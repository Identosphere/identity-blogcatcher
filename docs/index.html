<p>The Net Uptime Monitor</p>



<p><br>What it does…</p>



<p><br>Is your internet connection unreliable? You’ve probably called your internet provider’s support line and maybe they were able to help you, maybe they even sent out a tech to look at it. But all too often the response is “Well, it’s working fine now!”</p>



<p><br>The Net Uptime Monitor alerts you to failures in your internet connection and documents the exact time and length of those failures. This failure log will help your provider troubleshoot the problem – after it helps you convince them it’s not your imagination! Net Uptime Monitor is designed to be as simple as possible and accomplish this one purpose accurately and thoroughly with the least effort from you.</p>



<p><br>How it works…</p>



<p><br>Net Uptime Monitor (NUM) uses the “Ping” command to test the response from three public servers operated by Google, Level 3, and OpenDNS. (See “What’s a Ping?” below for an explanation.) Each server is pinged in turn at an interval that you can set – normally five seconds. By default, NUM waits 200 milliseconds (2/10 of a second) for the server to respond – at least 3 times as long as a typical broadband internet connection should take.</p>



<p><br>NUM pings one server at a time; if the server responds, NUM waits the test interval, then pings the next server. If the server doesn’t respond, NUM immediately tries the next server, then the next. If any of the servers respond, then your connection must be working. Only when all three servers fail to respond does NUM determine that your connection is down.</p>



<p><br>By using three servers, NUM ensures that the problem isn’t just with the server or with some connection on the way to that server, or that the server isn’t momentarily slow or congested.</p>



<p><br>NUM can detect failures as short as a couple of seconds in length, but you can decide how long a failure must be before it really counts. A very short failure of a second or so is not likely to affect your use of the net and isn’t of any real concern. You can set how long a failure must be before NUM alerts you to it and records the failure in its failure log.</p>



<p><br>Connection is up, no previous failures…</p>



<p>Connection is down, one previous failure…</p>



<p>The display shows the names and IP addresses of each server. The indicator “light” flashes yellow when the ping is sent and shows green for a successful response. The response time of the last ping is shown. When the response time exceeds the time set for “Wait for Ping Response”, the indicator turns red to show no response from that server.</p>



<p><br>If your connection fails, the current fail length is displayed in red. When the length of the failure exceeds your setting for “Log Failure If Longer Than”, NUM plays an alert sound and writes the failure information into its log.</p>



<p><br>The display also shows the monitored time (how long the monitor has been running), the time since the last logged failure (up time), the start time and length of the last logged failure, and the total count of logged failures since NUM was started. The current settings for the test interval and the minimum failure length to be logged are shown at the bottom of the display.</p>



<p><br>Click the minimize button on the NUM window to hide the display. NUM disappears into your system tray in the “notifications area”. The NUM icon is shown in the notification – you can hover over the icon to see the current time since the last failure (“Up Time”) or click the icon to restore the display. In the Settings, you can choose to have a “failure alert” sound play, and/or have the NUM window “pop up”, if a connection failure longer than your minimum setting occurs.</p>



<p><br>The Log</p>



<p><br>NUM keeps a log of results in a text file. You can view the current log at any time by clicking the “View Log” button. The log is displayed in a separate window. NUM will continue to update the log even while you are viewing it.<br>Because the log is a plain text file, you can open it outside of the NUM program. It will open in Notepad or your default text editor, so you can easily edit or print the log.</p>



<p><br>The log records the start and end time of the monitoring and each failure start time and length. A summary shows the total monitoring time, failure count, total down time, percentage of down time, and the minimum, maximum, and average failure lengths. Here’s an example:</p>

<p>Average Length 0:01:06</p>



<p>The example shows date and time in US English format; your log will use the format for your region.<br>The log files are saved in a folder of your choice; the default is your Documents folder. You can choose a different folder in the Settings.</p>



<p><br>Also in the Settings, there are two options for the log file:<br>1) New File Each Run<br>A new file is created each time NUM starts. Each log file is named with the date and time NUM was started so that they will appear in your directory in chronological order. The file name is in the form of “NetUptime 20110805 134243.txt”. In this example, the date is August 10, 2015 – 20150810 – and the time is 1:42:43 PM – 134243.<br>2) Add to Existing File<br>Each new log is added to the same single file. The file name is always NetUptime.txt. As long as that file exists in the folder where you have chosen to save the log file, NUM will keep adding to it. If the file doesn’t exist, i.e. it’s been deleted, moved, or renamed, NUM will start a new file.</p>



<p><br>The Settings</p>



<p>Click the “Change Settings” button on the NUM display to open the Settings window. There are several settings available:</p>



<p><br>Startup Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Start when Windows Starts? – Check the box and NUM will automatically start when your computer starts. Uncheck the box and you can start NUM when you want by clicking its desktop icon. The default on installation is checked – NUM starts automatically.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – Check the box and NUM will be minimized in the system tray automatically when it starts. The default on installation is unchecked – NUM starts with the main form displayed.<br>Test Settings…<br>· Test Interval – how many seconds between ping tests when the servers are responding. Five seconds is the default. It is possible that NUM will miss a failure that is shorter than the time between tests, so if your connection has very frequent failures of just a few seconds you might choose a shorter test interval. If you don’t have many failures, you may want to test less often. Most connection problems result in less frequent but longer failures, so five seconds is a good choice for most users.<br>· Wait for Ping Response – the length of time NUM waits for a response after sending a ping. The default setting of 200 milliseconds is recommended for normal situations. If you have a slower internet connection, such as a dialup or mobile connection, or are in a remote area where response is typically slow, you can set the wait time for up to 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds). To help you find the best setting for your situation, set the wait time to 1500 milliseconds and observe the ping response times NUM displays when your connection is working normally. Set the wait time to about 1.5 times the typical ping response times you see for efficient detection of outages.<br>· Change Target Servers – click to open the Target Servers window.</p>



<p>You can edit the IP Address and Name of any of the three servers. Click the Test button to try that server, verifying that it responds and checking the response time.</p>



<p><br>The default target servers (Google, Level 3, OpenDNS) were selected for their performance and very high reliability. You should only use a different server if you find that one of these servers does not respond reliably in your particular situation. Click “Restore Defaults” to reset the Target Servers to their original values. Changes to the Target Servers take effect the next time the program starts.</p>



<p><br>Alert and Log Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Pop Up on Failure? – Check the box and the NUM form will pop up from the system tray when there is a failure. Uncheck the box and NUM will continue to log and alert but it will stay minimized during a failure. The default on installation is checked – if NUM is minimized to the system tray, the main NUM form will be displayed when a failure is logged.<br>· Alert and Log Failure If Longer Than – the minimum failure length that will be counted, both for the log and the alert of a failure. Five seconds is the default setting.<br>· Log File Location – the folder where the logs will be stored. Click the “Select Folder” button to browse to the folder you want. The log for the current run of NUM is already started, so a change in this setting will not take effect until the next time you run NUM.<br>· Log File Option – New File Each Run (the default) or Add to Existing File. See previous section “The Log” for a more detailed explanation.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – choose the sound NUM makes when a failure is counted. The sound plays when you choose its button so you can preview each one. Choose “None” to silence the alert. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system. The default on installation is the “Short” sound.<br>· Play Reconnect Sound – NUM can play a sound when your internet reconnects after a failure. Choose “None” to silence the reconnect sound. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system.</p>



<p><br>Combine Settings for “Invisible” Operation</p>



<p><br>NUM can do its job without showing itself or alerting the user to its operation in any way. Choose these settings:<br>· Start when Windows Starts? – checked.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – checked.<br>· Pop Up On Failure – unchecked.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – None.<br>· Choose Reconnect Sound – None.<br>With this combination of settings, the user need never be aware of NUM. This is useful in a support situation where you are installing NUM on a computer you aren’t personally using.</p>



<p><br>What’s a Ping?</p>



<p><br>“Ping” is a command available on all kinds of computers that tests whether another computer on the network will respond to your computer. It’s named after the sound of submarine sonar systems – they send out a “ping” sound which bounces off their target and they listen for that echo, locating their target. The internet “ping” works in a similar way. You name your target, an internet server, and “ping” it. The ping command and response looks like this (in a DOS command window):</p>



<p><br>C:\ ping google.com</p>



<p>Pinging google.com [74.125.224.84] with 32 bytes of data:<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=30ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54</p>



<p>Ping statistics for 74.125.224.84:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br>Minimum = 30ms, Maximum = 31ms, Average = 30ms</p>



<p>A ping command actually generates four requests and the server replies four times. Each response is timed in thousandths of a second (ms = milliseconds). Here we see that the server at google.com responded in about 31/1000 or 3/100 of a second. The internet is fast! – when everything’s working.</p>



<p><br>Licensing</p>



<p><br>A license for Net Uptime Monitor removes the time limits from the trial version and lets you use the full program on one computer. To purchase a license or register your license, just click “Trial Version – Click to Register or Purchase License” at the bottom of the NUM main form. If you have your license, enter the License Key code you’ve received and click Register. If you need a license, click Purchase a License to visit our web site and make your purchase.<br>If you have already registered your copy of NUM, your name and email are shown on the main form. Click the License Info button to see your license key.</p>



<p><br>Moving to a New Computer or Installing a New Operating System</p>



<p><br>You must unregister your license before you replace your computer or install a new version of Windows. This will make your license key available again to use on your new system. Just click License Info, click Print This Form to make sure you’ll have the license key, then click Unregister License. The program will go back to Trial mode. You can then reuse your license key to register NUM on any computer.</p>

  <p>Summary:      How does a functioning credential ecosystem get started? This post goes deep on Manny Nijjarâs work to create a program for using digital staff passports in the sprawling UK NHS bureaucracy.</p>

<p>
    Dr Manny Nijjar is an infectious disease doctor with Whipps Cross Hospital in the UK. Heâs also an innovator who quickly saw how verifiable credentials could be applied to health care. I first met Manny at the launch of Sovrin Foundation in London in September 2016. Heâs been working to bring this vision to life with his company Truu, ever since.
</p>


    
	SSI For Healthcare: Lessons from the NHS Frontline


<p>
    In this video, Manny discusses why he became interested in digital credentials. He also speaks to the influence medical ethics has had on his journey. In 2015, he was training to become an infectious disease specialist. Manny was the most senior clinician on site in the evenings, in charge of about 500 beds.
</p>

<p>
    Manny kept getting called by, and about, a temporary agency doctor every night. Manny and other medical staff had questions about this doctorâs skills, qualifications, and the decisions he was making. But there were shortages and the hospital needed to fill the gap. Manny was so discouraged by seeing an unqualified physician slip through the cracks, that he was about to quit his career, but instead he determined to do something about it.
</p>

<p>
    Serendipitously, Manny came across self-sovereign identity (SSI) at the same time and, as I said, spoke at the launch of Sovrin Foundation. Over the next several years, Manny and his partners worked to create an SSI solution that the National Health Service in the UK could use to instantly verify the identity and skills of temporary and permanent clinical staff. There were three primary problems that this solves:
</p>
 
     Patient Safety - Verifying the identity and skills of temporary and permanent clinical staff. 
     Burden on Clinical Staff - Admin time for repeated identity and pre-employment checks. 
     Organizational Risk and Operational Inefficiencies - Failure of manual checks. Time and cost to onboard healthcare staff. 
 

<p>
    Mannyâs first thought had been to use a traditional, administrative scheme using usernames and passwords. But he saw the problems with that. He realized a digital credential was a better answer. And his journey into self-sovereign identity commenced.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Manny's paper credentials (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Over the past five years, Manny and his team at Truu have worked with clinicians, various parts of the NHS, employers, HR departments, and <a href="https://www.medecho.com/what-is-a-locum-agency/">locum agencies</a> to understand their needs and build a solution that fits.
</p>

<p>
    In 2019, Truu conducted a pilot with the NHS where the General Medical Council (GMC) issued âlicense to practiceâ credentials to SSI wallets controlled by medical staff. Medical staff could present that credential to Blackpool Teaching Hospitals. The hospital, in turn, issued a âsign inâ credential to the staff member who could then use it to log into clinical systems at the hospital.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Digital Credentials for People and Organizations (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic increased the pressure on the NHS, making the need to easily move staff between facilities acute. Truu worked with NHS to use this critical moment to shift to digital credentials and to do it in the right way. Truuâs early work, including the pilot, positioned the idea so that it could be quickly adopted when it was needed most. Digital credentialing in healthcare simplifies onboarding for providers, enables the secure expansion of telehealth services, and enhances information exchangeâ"providing a path to interoperability for healthcare data.
</p>

<p>
    The National Health Service in the UK has a <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">program to issue staff passports to medical personnel</a>, confirming their qualifications and ability to work. NHS staff passports are based on verifiable credentials. Eighty-four NHS organizations are participating to date.
</p>

<p>
    The work that Manny, his team at Truu, and <a href="https://www.truu.id/">partners</a> like <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> have done has already had a big impact. The UK Department of Health and Social Care recognized the importance of the program, promising to expand the use of staff passports in their Busting Bureaucracy report. They said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>NHSE/I, NHSX and HEE are working to provide multiple staff groups with access to digital staff passports in line with People Plan commitments to improve workforce agility and to support staff training and development.</p>
     
         Junior doctors, who frequently rotate to different healthcare providers, are being prioritized and the ambition is that they will have access to staff passports in 2021/22. The passports will hold digital credentials representing their skills, competencies and occupational health checks. 
         Other target groups include specialists such as maternity and stroke care staff who often need to be rapidly deployed to a neighboring hospital or care home. The use of digital staff passports will save agency fees and release time for care. 
     
</blockquote>

<p>
    Medical staff passports are catching on in the UK where they are solving real problems that ultimately impact patient care, staff fatigue, and patient access and privacy. The journey hasnât been short, but the NHS Staff Passport program is illustrative of a successful credential ecosystem.

  <p>Summary:      Iâve been a beekeeper for many years. I love the honey, but I love watching the bees even more. They are a fascinating example of a natural, decentralized system.</p>


<p>
    I installed a package of bees in a hive over the weekend. You buy bees in packages that contain 15-20 thousand bees and a queen. The queen is in a cage so she is easy to find. Queens give off a pheromone that attracts the other bees in the hive. The queen is the secret to creating legitimacy for the hive (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/legitimacy_and_decentralized_systems.shtml">Legitimacy and Decentralized Systems</a> for more on legitimacy). If the queen is in the new hive, chances are the other bees will see it as their legitimate home and stick around.
</p>


	<a></a>

<p>
    I placed queen cage in the hive using a rubber band to fix the cage on one of the frames that the bees make honeycomb on. I replaced the cork in the cage with a candy stopper. The bees eat through the candy over the course of a few days and free the queen. Hopefully, by that time, the hive is established and the bees stick around.
</p>

<p>
    After placing the queen cage in the hive, you just dump the bees out on top of the frames. I love this part because thousands of bees are flying everywhere trying to make sense of what just happened. But over the course of an hour or two, the hive coalesces on the queen and most of the bees are inside, getting adjusted to their new home.
</p>

	  <a></a>
	  About an hour after the bees get their new home, they're out on the porch, fanning and taking orientation flights. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Besides providing a basis for hive legitimacy, the queen is also the sole reproductive individual, responsible for laying every egg that will be raised in the hive. This is a big job. During the summer, she will lay about 2000 eggs per day and the hive will swell to multiple tens of thousands of bees. But beyond this, the queenâs role is limited. She doesnât direct the actions of the members of the hive. No one does.
</p>

<a></a>
 Thermoregulation 
<p>
    So, how does the hive function without central direction? Thermoregulation provides an example. Despite the fact that bees themselves are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeothermy">homeothermic</a>, the hive is. The bees manage to keep the hive at 93-94Â°F (34Â°C) regardless of the outside air temperature.
</p>

<p>
    How do the bees do that? The straightforward answer is that some bees go to the entrance of the hive and fan air to increase circulation when the internal temperature gets too high. When it gets too low, bees cluster in the center and generate heat by shivering.
</p>

<p>
    The more interesting question is âhow do the bees know to do that?â All the bees have similar genetic programming (algorithmic governance). But the tasks that theyâre inclined to do depend on their age. The youngest workers clean cells, then move onto nursing functions, mortuary activities, guarding the hive, and finally, in the last weeks of their lives, to foraging for water, nectar, and pollen.
</p>

<p>
    Bees have a genetic threshold for carrying out these tasks. The threshold changes as they age. A young bee has a very high threshold for foraging that decreases over her life. Further, these thresholds vary by <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patriline">patriline</a> (even though every bee in the hive has the same mother, there are many fathers), providing diversity.
</p>

<p>
    So as the temperature in the hive climbs, a few bees go down to the hive entrance and fan. As it gets hotter, even more bees will take up the task, depending on their internal threshold. Their genetic programming, combined with the diversity in their thresholds, promotes an even response to temperature swings that could damage the hive. You can read more about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/08/decentralized_systems_thermoregulation_in_bee_hives.shtml">hive thermoregulation in an earlier blog post</a> I wrote on the topic.
</p>

<a></a>
 Swarming and Protecting Against Byzantine Failure 

<p>
    An even more interesting phenomenon is how bees decide to swarm. Because the hive is a super organism, the queenâs efforts to reproduce donât result in a new hive unless thereâs a swarm. Swarming is how new hives are created.
</p>

<p>
    Bees swarm in response to stresses like insufficient food supply, too little space, and so on. But no one really knows how a hive decides itâs time to swarm. In preparation for a swarm, the hive starts to raise new queens. Whether an egg grows into a worker, drone, or queen is determined by how the larva is fed by nurse bees. At some point the bees collectively determine to swarm and the queen produces a pheromone that broadcasts that decision.
</p>

<p>
    The swarm consists of the current queen (and her powerful pheromones), some of the worker bees, and a portion of the honey stores. The swarm leaves the hive and the remaining bees raise the new queen and carry on. The swarm flies a short distance and settles down on some convenient structure to decide where to make their permanent home. Again the swarm centers on the queen. This is where the fun starts.
</p>

<p>
    Thomas Seeley of Cornell has been studying swarms for his entire career. In the following video he describes how bees use collective decision making to choose their new home.
</p>


	  <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/honeybee-decision-making"></a>
	  Cornell professor, biologist and beekeeper Thomas Seeley (click to view)


<p>
    There are several interesting features in this process. First, Seeley has determined that bees donât just make a good decision, but the best possible decision. I think thatâs amazing. Several hundred bees leave the swarm to search for a new home and participate in a debate to choose one of the available sites and settle on the best choice.
</p>

<p>
    This is a process that is potentially subject to byzantine failure. Not that the bees are malicious, in fact theyâre programmed to accurately represent their findings. But they can report faulty information based on their judgment of the suitability of a candidate site. The use of reputation signals for sites and voting by multiple inspectors allows the bees avoid bad decisions even in the face of false signals.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Swarm lodged in a fruit tree in my garden (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The process is further protected from error because bees are programmed to only advertise sites theyâve actually visited. Again, they donât have the ability to be malicious. Each bee advertising a potential site has done the work of flying to the site and inspecting it. As bees signal their excitement for that site in a waggle dance, even more bees will fly out to it, perform an inspection, and return to advertise their findings. I donât know if Iâd characterize this as proof of work, but it does ensure that votes are based on real information. Once a quorum of bees in the swarm reach consensus about a particular site, the swarm departs and takes up residence in their new home.
</p>

<blockquote>
     <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0046A9M68/windleyofente-20">Honeybee Democracy by Thomas D. Seeley</a> 
    <p>Honeybees make decisions collectively--and democratically. Every year, faced with the life-or-death problem of choosing and traveling to a new home, honeybees stake everything on a process that includes collective fact-finding, vigorous debate, and consensus building. In fact, as world-renowned animal behaviorist Thomas Seeley reveals, these incredible insects have much to teach us when it comes to collective wisdom and effective decision making. </p>
    <p>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
    You may not be thrilled if a swarm determines the best new home is in your attic, but you can be thrilled with the knowledge that ten thousand decentralized bees with sophisticated algorithmic programming achieved consensus and ranked it #1.
</p>

<p>
    The hive is a super organism with its intelligence spread out among its tens of thousands of members. Life and death decisions are made on a daily basis in a completely decentralized fashion. Besides thermoregulation of the hive and finding a new home, the bees in a hive autonomously make millions of other decentralized decisions every day that result in the hive not only surviving but thriving in hostile conditions. I find that remarkable.

<p></p><p>My favorite working environments have all been like liberal arts colleges: spaces where people were trying to do their best work, often quietly, with a great deal of introspection. Here, people asked questions about how they could do meaningful work that uplifted and empowered communities.</p><p>The worst - multiple startups - have been aggressively confrontational, where the emphasis was on hustling to get people in the door by any means necessary.</p><p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jroxann">Roxann Stafford</a> introduced me to this great quote from the labor organizer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Baker">General Baker</a>:</p><blockquote><p>You keep asking how do we get the people here? I say, what will we do when they get here?</p></blockquote><p>While it’s true that the Field of Dreams user acquisition strategy doesn’t work - even if you build it, they won’t necessarily come, so you’d better figure out how to reach out to the right people - it can only be a fragment of the product strategy. If you let hustle culture take over the entire business, you run the risk of spending all your time on how to get people there, and comparatively little on what you’ll do when they arrive. At best, you’ll end up with a superficial product; at worst, a disingenuous one. You might find yourself accidentally creating a culture where it’s okay to say just about anything to get people in the door.</p><p>The thing is, when you’re running out of money, or when you don’t have any to begin with, getting more is an imperative. As much as money is a pain in the ass, it’s necessary to keep the lights on, and to grow.</p><p>Newsrooms used to have a way to deal with this: a firewall between editorial and advertising departments. Because the value of a news publication is in the information it provides, regardless of financial influence, the need to make money has been kept siloed away. When, latterly, some newsrooms began to remove this firewall and allow financial considerations to affect the content of their coverage, the quality of their reporting (and public trust thereof) noticeably declined.</p><p>The same is true in software. When hustle culture becomes the product, the incentive to provide real, deep value to your community of users is undermined. You’ll deliver worse products. That isn’t to say that sales and marketing are not valuable: they’re absolutely vital. But a startup (or a project, or a traditional business) can’t let sales and marketing drive the ship. It’s the product team’s job to build something that deeply serves a need, including by identifying the first community of people to understand, co-design with, and serve.</p><p>Marketing, in the traditional sense, is the act of understanding that market and positioning a product to reach it (although it’s often reductively conflated with advertising). The sales folks - the hustlers - close the deals. These things are important parts of a complete, delicious breakfast, but they can’t be the whole breakfast.</p><p>Nothing absolves you from building a meaningful product, obsessing over every detail, and taking care in its craft and design. It’s hard to do that if your whole focus is on leads. Why do you exist? Who are you helping? How? These questions can’t just be a story you tell - they have to be your deeply-held reason for existing.</p><blockquote><p>You keep asking how do we get the people here? I say, what will we do when they get here?</p></blockquote><p>That’s the question that matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@garrhetsampson?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Garrhet Sampson</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hustle?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

The global pandemic has accelerated our adoption and transformation, and we are in a better place than March 2020. However, sticking with oil, we know that the extraction process has downsides, including carbon release, messy, and difficulty locating economic wells. &nbsp; Amongst data’s most significant downsides are legal liabilities, noise and the wrong data.&nbsp;</p><p>I can easily hide data’s downsides through dashboards.&nbsp; Our dashboards are based on trickle-down KPI and objectives from our strategic plan.&nbsp; We hand out <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-SMART-Goals">SMART</a> objectives, but such objectives fundamentally assume that we are and continue to do the right thing.&nbsp; We gather data and post-analysis present it as trending graphs or red, amber, green dashboards, aiming for everything to be going in the right direction or green.&nbsp; Green only means we have no negative variance between our plan and the actual. Organisationally we are incentivised to achieve green at any unknown cost or consequence.&nbsp; Trending analysis can always be generated through the selection of data to fit the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, we are using data to measure, analyse and inform. We have better control of variance across our entire operations and ecosystem than at any previous point in our history. We increasingly have to depend on dashboards to manage the complicated and complex, remain informed, and determine where our energies should be focussed.&nbsp; Without a doubt, this should remain and continue to be improved, but we are already on a diminishing return with the data we collect due to the increase in noise over signal and should aim to cull than add.&nbsp;</p><p>As an agenda item; should we introduce the colour BLUE into our reporting, trends, and dashboards to reduce reporting and data?&nbsp; The traditional traffic lights remain the same; blue is not replacing any of them; it can become the one that allows us to know we are doing the right thing and not just doing the wrong thing that is in the plan in the most efficient and effective way (can be green or red).</p><p>As a team, we have to feed our sense of enquiry, and our existing data gathering, analysis, and reporting do not value the complexity we are faced with. More data does not solve complexity. Data has allowed us to evolve from finance data as the most critical decision-making source to become more sensitive.&nbsp; Whilst we have far more data, it is still narrow, and we should consider how we prepare for the next evolution, which will not be more of the same data.&nbsp; Following on from customer data and the start in ESG, the next data set we are being mandated to report on is <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2020/11/05/the-sec-just-mandated-human-capital-disclosure-what-does-this-mean-for-you/">Human Capital.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Human capital reporting opens up our ability to sense what our employees and ecosystem are sensing, seeing and implying; helping us to determine, using technologies such as sentiment analysis, if we are doing the right thing. Where are issues that are not on the dashboard are occurring? What, as yet, unidentified tensions and conflicts are created by our current trickle-down objective/ incentive system? However, as you can imagine, big brother, privacy, and trust are foundational issues we need to discuss front up before this next evolutionary step hits us.&nbsp; This next phase of our data journey means we will find it harder to hide in the selection of data for trends and dashboards or just seek the right trend or green. This is more data, but different data and it will fill a gap in our knowledge,&nbsp; meaning we will be better informed about complex decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to present for 15 minutes on this topic and host a 45-minute debate with your approval.</p><p>Your CDO</p> <br>

  <p>I've released the first non-alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard">Django SQL Dashboard</a>, which provides an interface for running arbitrary read-only SQL queries directly against a PostgreSQL database, protected by the Django authentication scheme. It can also be used to create saved dashboards that can be published or shared internally.</p>
<p>I started building this tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/14/weeknotes/">back in March</a> as part of my work to port VaccinateCA away from Airtable <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Apr/12/porting-vaccinateca-to-django/">to a custom Django backend</a>. One of the  strengths of Airtable is that it allows ad-hoc data exploration and reporting, and I wanted to provide an alternative to that for the new Django backend.</p>
<p>I also wanted to try out some new ideas for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, which doesn't (yet) work with PostgreSQL.</p>
 First, a demo 
<p>I recorded this three minute video demo introducing the software, using my blog's database as an example.</p>



<p>In the video I run the following SQL queries to explore the many-to-many table that maps tags to my blog entries:</p>
  select * from blog_entry_tags;  
<p>The table starts out looking like this - not particularly interesting:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I run this query to join it against the <code>blog_tag</code> table and get the details of each tag:</p>
  select * from blog_entry_tags
join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id  
<p></p>
<p>This is a bit more useful. I then click on the "count" link at the top of that "tag" column. This constructs a SQL query for me that uses a <code>count(*)</code> and <code>group by</code> to return a count of each value in that column:</p>
  select "tag", count(*) as n from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results group by "tag" order by n desc  
<p></p>
<p>Then I demonstrate some of the default widget visualizations that come with Django SQL Dashboard. If I rewrite the query to return columns called <code>bar_label</code> and <code>bar_quantity</code> the tool will render the results as a bar chart:</p>
  select "tag" as bar_label, count(*) as bar_quantity from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results
group by "tag" order by bar_quantity desc  
<p></p>
<p>Next, I demonstrate a similar trick that instead produces a word cloud by aliasing the columns to <code>wordcloud_word</code> and <code>wordcloud_count</code>:</p>
  select "tag" as wordcloud_word, count(*) as wordcloud_count from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results
group by "tag" order by wordcloud_count desc  
<p></p>
<p>Finally, I show how that query can be turned into a saved dashboard and made available to the public. Here's the saved dashboard I created in the video:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/tag-cloud/">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/tag-cloud/</a></p>
<p>This illustrates a key idea underlying both Django SQL dashboard and Datasette: a complete application can be defined as a SQL query!</p>
<p>Much of the work we do as web application developers can be boiled down to constructing a SQL query and hooking it up to output to a web page. If you can safely execute SQL queries from page query strings this means you can build custom applications that exist entirely as bookmarkable URLs.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/24/drawing-shapes-spatialite/">draw-a-shape-on-a-map application</a> for searching mini parks in California from a few months ago is another example of this pattern in action.</p>
 Custom widgets 
<p>Building new custom widgets for this tool is extremely easy - hence the word cloud widget which I actually built specially for this demo. All you need to provide is a single Django template file.</p>
<p>If your widget is going to respond to returned columns <code>wordcloud_word</code> and <code>wordcloud_count</code> the name of that template is those columns, sorted alphabetically and joined with hyphens:</p>
<p><code>wordcloud_count-wordcloud_word.html</code></p>
<p>Place that in a <code>django_sql_dashboard/widgets</code> template directory and the new widget will be ready to use. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/blob/0.13/django_sql_dashboard/templates/django_sql_dashboard/widgets/wordcloud_count-wordcloud_word.html">full implementation</a> of the word cloud widget.</p>
 Named parameter support 
<p>This is a feature I lifted <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#named-parameters">directly from Datasette</a>. You can construct SQL queries that look like this:</p>
  select * from blog_entry where id = %(id)s  
<p>This uses psycopg2 syntax for named parameters. The value will be correctly quoted and escaped, so this is a useful tool for avoiding SQL injection attacks.</p>
<p>Djang SQL Dashboard spots these parameters and turns them into form fields. Here's what that looks like in the interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>These forms submit using GET, so the result can be bookmarked. Here's a saved dashboard you can use to retrieve the details of any of my blog entries by their numeric ID:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/blog-entry-by-id/?id=7991">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/blog-entry-by-id/?id=7991</a></p>
<p>You can include multiple SQL parameters on a single dashboard, and any form parameters will be made available to all of those queries.</p>
<p>This means you can build dashboards that run multiple queries against the same arguments. Imagine for example you want to build a report about a specific user's activity across multiple tables - you can accept their user ID as a parameter, then display the output of multiple queries (including custom visualizations) that each refer to that parameter.</p>
 Export through copy and paste 
<p>I love copy and paste as a mechanism for exporting data from a system. Django SQL Dashboard embraces this in a couple of ways:</p>
 
 Results from SQL queries can be copied out as TSV from an expandable textarea below the table - up to 1,000 rows. I like this format because you can paste it directly into Google Sheets or Excel to get the data correctly split into cells. 
 Any time JSON is returned as a value from PostgreSQL, a "copy to clipboard" icon is shown next to the JSON. I use this a lot: both for JSON stored in PostgreSQL as well as the output from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-aggregate.html">JSON aggregation functions</a>. 
 
 Export all query results as CSV/TSV 
<p>This comes up a lot at Vaccinate CA: we do a lot of data analysis where we need to work with other tools or send data to partners, and having a way to export the full set of results for a query (rather than truncating at the first thousand to avoid crashing the user's browser) was a frequent need. - Django SQL Dashboard provides this option using a combination of Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.StreamingHttpResponse">streaming HTTP response</a> mechanism and PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#server-side-cursors">server-side cursors</a> to efficiently stream large amounts of data without running out of resources.</p>
 A complex example: searching code examples across my blog 
<p>I decided to see how far I could push PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>I often include code in my blog entries - examples that are wrapped in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag. Within that tag I sometimes apply syntax highlighting (a bunch of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements).</p>
<p>It turns out I've included code snippets in 134 different blog entries:</p>
  select count(*) from blog_entry where body ~ '&lt;pre&gt;.*&lt;pre&gt;'  
<p>Can I use regular expressions in PostgreSQL to extract just the code examples, clean them up (removing those spans, reversing HTML entity encoding) and then provide simple search across the text of those examples, all in one query?</p>
<p>It turns out I can!</p>
<p>Here's a saved dashboard you can use to execute searches against just the contents of those <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags across every entry on my blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/code-examples/?search=select">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/code-examples/?search=select</a></p>
  with results_stripped as (
  select id, title,
    replace(replace(replace(replace(replace(regexp_replace(
      (regexp_matches(body, '&lt;pre&gt;(.*?)&lt;/pre&gt;', 'g'))[1],
        E'&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;', '', 'gi'
      ), '&amp;quot' || chr(59), '"'), '&amp;gt' || chr(59), '&gt;'), '&amp;lt' || chr(59), '&lt;'), '&amp;#039' || chr(59), chr(39)), '&amp;amp' || chr(59), '&amp;'
    ) as code
  from
    blog_entry
  where
    body ~ '&lt;pre&gt;.*&lt;pre&gt;'
)
select id, title, code, 'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link from results_stripped
where code like '%%' || %(search)s || '%%' limit 10  
<p>There's a lot going on here. The key component is this bit:</p>
 <code>regexp_matches(body, '&lt;pre&gt;(.*?)&lt;/pre&gt;', 'g'))[1]
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP">regexp_matches() function</a>, with the <code>'g'</code> flag, returns every match for the given regular expression. As part of a larger <code>select</code> query this means that if the expression matches three times you'll get back three rows in the output (in this case with duplicate <code>id</code> and <code>title</code> columns) - which is what I want here.</p>
<p>It's wrapped in a terrifying nest of extra functions. These serve two purposes: they strip out any nested HTML tags, and the un-escape the <code>&amp;quot;</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;amp;</code> and <code>&amp;#039;</code> HTML entities. I did this as a nested block of <code>replace()</code> functions - there's probably a neater solution here.</p>
<p>The <code>chr(59)</code> bits are a hack: Django SQL Dashboard disallows the <code>;</code> character to ensure people can't execute multiple SQL queries - which could be used to work around some of the per-transaction protective settings applied by the tool.</p>
<p>But I need to search-and-replace <code>&amp;quot;</code> - so I use this pattern to include the semicolon:</p>
 <code>replace(text, '&amp;quot' || chr(59), '"')
</code> 
<p>Where <code>||</code> is the PostgreSQL string concatenation operator.</p>
<p>The search itself is constructed like this:</p>
 <code>where code like '%%' || %(search)s || '%%'
</code> 
<p>This constructs a like query against <code>'%your-search-term%'</code> - the double percentage sign escaping is needed because <code>%</code> has a special meaning here (it's part of the <code>%(search)s</code> named parameter).</p>
<p>One last trick: the final output of the query is produced by this:</p>
  select id, title, code, 'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link from results_stripped  
<p><code>results_stripped</code> is a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/queries-with.html">CTE</a> defined earlier - I usually try to wrap up complex weird stuff like those nested <code>replace()</code> calls in a CTE so I can write a simple final query.</p>
<p>The <code>'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link</code> bit here concatenates together a URL that links to my entry based on its ID. My blog uses <code>/yyyy/Mon/slug/</code> URLs but generating these from a SQL query against the <code>created</code> column was a little fussy, so I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/771878920bbcf46eee3f34d22b2dc35340da07f9">added /e/ID redirecting URLs</a> to make generating links in dashboard queries easier.</p>
 Future plans 
<p>Django SQL Dashboard has already proved itself invaluable for my current project. I imagine I'll be using it for every Django project I build going forward - being able to query the database like this, create ad-hoc visualizations and then link to them is a huge productivity boost.</p>
<p>The bigger question is how it overlaps with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>.</p>
<p>Datasette has been SQLite-only since I started the project three and a half years ago - because I know that building a database abstraction layer is a huge additional commitment and, for Datasette's initial purpose of helping publish read-only data, it didn't feel necessary.</p>
<p>I have a growing suspicion that getting Datasette to work against PostgreSQL (and other database backends) in addition to SQLite is less work than I had originally thought.</p>
<p>Datasette is also built on top of ASGI. Django 3.0 <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/3.0/#asgi-support">introduced ASGI support</a>, so it's now possible to host ASGI applications like Datasette as part of a unified Django application.</p>
<p>So it's possible that the future of Django SQL Dashboard will be for Datasette to eventually make it obsolete.</p>
<p>That doesn't stop it from being extremely useful today. If you try it out I'd love to hear from you! I'm also keen to see people start to expand it for their own projects, especially via the <a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/en/latest/widgets.html#custom-widgets">custom widgets</a> mechanism.</p>
<p>Let me know if you try it out!</p>

For this to work, a trust needs to exist between the verifiable credential issuer and the application which requires the verifiable credentials to verify. A blockchain decentralized database is used and MATTR is used as a access layer to this ledger and blockchain. The applications are implemented in ASP.NET Core.</p>



<p>The verifier application Bo Insurance is used to implement the verification process and to create a presentation template. The application sends a HTTP post request to create a presentation request using the DID Id from the OIDC credential Issuer, created in the previous article. This DID is created from the National Driving license application which issues verifiable credentials and so a trust needs to exist between the two applications. Once the credentials have been issued to a holder of the verifiable credentials and stored for example in a digital wallet, the issuer is no longer involved in the process. Verifying the credentials only requires the holder and the verifier and the decentralized database which holds the digital identities and documents. The verifier application gets the DID from the ledger and signs the verify request. The request can then be presented as a QR Code. The holder can scan this using a MATTR digital wallet and grant consent to share the credentials with the application. The digital wallet calls the callback API defined in the request presentation body and sends the data to the API. The verifier application hosting the API would need to verify the data and can update the application UI using SignalR to continue the business process with the verified credentials.</p>

<p>Create the presentation template for the Verifiable Credential</p>



<p>A presentation template is required to verify the issued verifiable credentials stored on a digital wallet.</p>



<p>The digital identity (DID) Id of the OIDC credential issuer is all that is required to create a presentation request template.  In the application which issues credentials, ie the NationalDrivingLicense, a Razor page was created to view the DID of the OIDC credential issuer.</p>







<p>The DID can be used to create the presentation template. The MATTR documentation is really good here:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template</a></p>



<p>A Razor page was created to start this task from the UI. This would normally require authentication as this is an administrator task from the application requesting the verified credentials. The code behind the Razor page takes the DID request parameter and calls the MattrPresentationTemplateService to create the presentation template and present this id a database.</p>


  public class CreatePresentationTemplateModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrPresentationTemplateService _mattrVerifyService;
	public bool CreatingPresentationTemplate { get; set; } = true;
	public string TemplateId { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public PresentationTemplate PresentationTemplate { get; set; }
	public CreatePresentationTemplateModel(MattrPresentationTemplateService mattrVerifyService)
	{
		_mattrVerifyService = mattrVerifyService;
	}
	public void OnGet()
	{
		PresentationTemplate = new PresentationTemplate();
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		TemplateId = await _mattrVerifyService.CreatePresentationTemplateId(PresentationTemplate.DidId);
		CreatingPresentationTemplate = false;
		return Page();
	}
}

public class PresentationTemplate
{
	[Required]
	public string DidId { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The Razor page html template creates a form to post the request to the server rendered page and displays the templateId after, if the creation was successful.</p>


  @page
@model BoInsurance.Pages.CreatePresentationTemplateModel

&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;

                        }

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                        @if (!Model.CreatingPresentationTemplate)
                        {
                            &lt;div class="alert alert-success"&gt;
                                &lt;strong&gt;Mattr Presentation Template created&lt;/strong&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        }

                        
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the templateId is created, you can use the template ID to verify&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-sm"&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;img src="~/ndl_car_01.png" width="200" alt="Driver License"&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Driver Licence templateId from presentation template&lt;/b&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                    &lt;dl class="row"&gt;
                        &lt;dt class="col-sm-4"&gt;templateId&lt;/dt&gt;
                        &lt;dd class="col-sm-8"&gt;
                            @Model.TemplateId
                        &lt;/dd&gt;
                    &lt;/dl&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


  


<p>The MattrPresentationTemplateService is used to create the MATTR presentation template. This class uses the MATTR API and sends a HTTP post request with the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer and creates a presentation template. The service saves the returned payload to a database and returns the template ID as the result. The template ID is required to verify the verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to request an API token for the MATTR API using the credential of your MATTR account. This service has a simple token cache and only requests new access tokens when no token exists or the token has expired.</p>



<p>The BoInsuranceDbService service is used to access the SQL database using Entity Framework Core. This provides simple methods to persist or select the data as required. </p>


  private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrPresentationTemplateService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService,
	BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService)
{
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreatePresentationTemplateId(string didId)
{
	// create a new one
	var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = await CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(didId);

	// save to db
	var drivingLicensePresentationTemplate = new DrivingLicensePresentationTemplate
	{
		DidId = didId,
		TemplateId = v1PresentationTemplateResponse.Id,
		MattrPresentationTemplateReponse = JsonConvert
			.SerializeObject(v1PresentationTemplateResponse)
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService
		.CreateDriverLicensePresentationTemplate(drivingLicensePresentationTemplate);

	return v1PresentationTemplateResponse.Id;
}

private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(string didId)
{
	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");

	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = await CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(client, didId);
	return v1PresentationTemplateResponse;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method sends the HTTP Post request like in the MATTR API documentation. Creating the payload for the HTTP post request using the MATTR Open API definitions is a small bit complicated.  This could be improved with a better Open API definition. In our use case, we just want to create the default template for the OIDC credential issuer and so just require the DID Id.  Most of the other properties are fixed values, see the MATTR API docs for more information.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(
	HttpClient client, string didId)
{
	// create presentation, post to presentations templates api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template

	var createPresentationsTemplatesUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/templates";

	var additionalProperties = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
	additionalProperties.Add("type", "QueryByExample");
	additionalProperties.Add("credentialQuery", new List&lt;CredentialQuery&gt; {
		new CredentialQuery
		{
			Reason = "Please provide your driving license",
			Required = true,
			Example = new Example
			{
				Context = new List&lt;object&gt;{ "https://schema.org" },
				Type = "VerifiableCredential",
				TrustedIssuer = new List&lt;TrustedIssuer2&gt;
				{
					new TrustedIssuer2
					{
						Required = true,
						Issuer = didId // DID use to create the oidc
					}
				}
			}
		}
	});

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreatePresentationTemplate
	{
		Domain = _mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain,
		Name = "certificate-presentation",
		Query = new List&lt;Query&gt;
		{
			new Query
			{
				AdditionalProperties = additionalProperties
			}
		}
	};

	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

	var uri = new Uri(createPresentationsTemplatesUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var presentationTemplateResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (presentationTemplateResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{

			var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = JsonConvert
					.DeserializeObject&lt;MattrOpenApiClient.V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt;(
					await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1PresentationTemplateResponse;
		}

		var error = await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The application can be started and the presentation template can be created. The ID is returned back to the UI for the next step.</p>







<p>Verify the verifiable credentials</p>



<p>Now that a template exists to request the verifiable data from the holder of the data which is normally stored in a digital wallet, the verifier application can create and start a verification process. A post request is sent to the MATTR APIs which creates a presentation request using a DID ID and the required template. The application can request the DID from the OIDC credential issuer. The request is signed using the correct key from the DID and the request is published in the UI as a QR Code. A digital wallet is used to scan the code and the user of the wallet can grant consent to share the personal data. The wallet sends a HTTP post request to the callback API. This API handles the request, would validate the data and updates the UI using SignalR to move to the next step of the business process using the verified data.</p>







<p>Step 1 Invoke a presentation request</p>



<p>The InvokePresentationRequest method implements the presentation request. This method requires the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer which will by used to get the data from the holder of the data. The template ID is also required from the template created above. A challenge is also used to track the verification. The challenge is a random value and is used when the digital wallet calls the API with the verified data. The callback URL is where the data is returned to. This could be unique for every request or anything you want. The payload is created like the docs from the MATTR API defines.  The post request is sent to the MATTR API and a V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse is returned if all is configured correctly.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt; InvokePresentationRequest(
	HttpClient client,
	string didId,
	string templateId,
	string challenge,
	string callbackUrl)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/requests";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreatePresentationRequestRequest
	{
		Did = didId,
		TemplateId = templateId,
		Challenge = challenge,
		CallbackUrl = new Uri(callbackUrl),
		ExpiresTime = MATTR_EPOCH_EXPIRES_TIME_VERIFIY // Epoch time
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse = JsonConvert
				.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt;(
					await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 2 Get the OIDC Issuer DID</p>



<p>The RequestDID method uses the MATTR API to get the DID data from the blochchain for the OIDC credential issuer. Only the DID Id is required.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt; RequestDID(string didId, HttpClient client)
{
	var requestUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids/{didId}";
	var uri = new Uri(requestUrl);

	var didResponse = await client.GetAsync(uri);

	if (didResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
	{
		var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt;(
				await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

		return v1CreateDidResponse;
	}

	var error = await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 3 Sign the request using correct key and display QR Code</p>



<p>To verify data using a digital wallet, the payload must be signed using the correct key. The SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody uses the DID payload and the request from the presentation request to create the payload to sign. Creating the payload is a big messy due to the OpenAPI definitions created for the MATTR API. A HTTP post request with the payload returns the signed JWT in a payload in a strange data format so we parse this as a string and manually get the JWT payload.</p>


  private async Task&lt;string&gt; SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody(
	HttpClient client,
	V1_GetDidResponse did,
	V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/messaging/sign";

	object didUrlArray;
	did.DidDocument.AdditionalProperties.TryGetValue("authentication", out didUrlArray);
	var didUrl = didUrlArray.ToString().Split("\"")[1];
	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.SignMessageRequest
	{
		DidUrl = didUrl,
		Payload = v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse.Request
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
		{
			var result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
			return result;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The CreateVerifyCallback method uses the presentation request, the get DID and the sign HTTP post requests to create a URL which can be displayed in a UI. The challenge is created using the RNGCryptoServiceProvider class which creates a random string. The access token to access the API is returned from the client credentials OAuth requests or from the in memory cache. The DrivingLicensePresentationVerify class is persisted to a database and the verify URL is returned so that this could be displayed as a QR Code in the UI.</p>

public async Task&lt;(string QrCodeUrl, string ChallengeId)&gt; CreateVerifyCallback(string callbackBaseUrl)
{
	callbackBaseUrl = callbackBaseUrl.Trim();
	if (!callbackBaseUrl.EndsWith('/'))
	{
		callbackBaseUrl = $"{callbackBaseUrl}/";
	}

	var callbackUrlFull = $"{callbackBaseUrl}{MATTR_CALLBACK_VERIFY_PATH}";
	var challenge = GetEncodedRandomString();

	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");

	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var template = await _boInsuranceDbService.GetLastDriverLicensePrsentationTemplate();

	// Invoke the Presentation Request
	var invokePresentationResponse = await InvokePresentationRequest(
		client,
		template.DidId,
		template.TemplateId,
		challenge,
		callbackUrlFull);

	// Request DID 
	V1_GetDidResponse did = await RequestDID(template.DidId, client);

	// Sign and Encode the Presentation Request body
	var signAndEncodePresentationRequestBodyResponse = await SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody(
		client, did, invokePresentationResponse);

	// fix strange DTO
	var jws = signAndEncodePresentationRequestBodyResponse.Replace("\"", "");

	// save to db // TODO add this back once working
	var drivingLicensePresentationVerify = new DrivingLicensePresentationVerify
	{
		DidId = template.DidId,
		TemplateId = template.TemplateId,
		CallbackUrl = callbackUrlFull,
		Challenge = challenge,
		InvokePresentationResponse = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(invokePresentationResponse),
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody = jws
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService.CreateDrivingLicensePresentationVerify(drivingLicensePresentationVerify);

	var qrCodeUrl = $"didcomm://https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/?request={jws}";

	return (qrCodeUrl, challenge);
}

private string GetEncodedRandomString()
{
	var base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(GenerateRandomBytes(30));
	return HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode(base64);
}

private byte[] GenerateRandomBytes(int length)
{
	using var randonNumberGen = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
	var byteArray = new byte[length];
	randonNumberGen.GetBytes(byteArray);
	return byteArray;
}
  


<p>The CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel is the code behind for the Razor page to request a verification and also display the verify QR Code for the digital wallet to scan. The CallbackUrl can be set from the UI so that this is easier for testing. This callback can be any webhook you want or API. To test the application in local development, I used ngrok. The return URL has to match the proxy which tunnels to you PC, once you start. If the API has no public address when debugging, you will not be able to test locally.</p>


  public class CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService _mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService;
	public bool CreatingVerifier { get; set; } = true;
	public string QrCodeUrl { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public string ChallengeId { get; set; }

	}
	public void OnGet()
	{
		CallbackUrlDto = new CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeCallbackUrl();
		CallbackUrlDto.CallbackUrl = $"https://{HttpContext.Request.Host.Value}";
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		var result = await _mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService
			.CreateVerifyCallback(CallbackUrlDto.CallbackUrl);

		CreatingVerifier = false;

		QrCodeUrl = result.QrCodeUrl;
		ChallengeId = result.ChallengeId;
		return Page();
	}
}

public class CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeCallbackUrl
{
	[Required]
	public string CallbackUrl { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The html or template part of the Razor page displays the QR Code from a successful post request. You can set any URL for the callback in the form request. This is really just for testing.</p>

&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Step 4 Implement the Callback and update the UI using SignalR</p>



<p>After a successful verification in the digital wallet, the wallet sends the verified credentials to the API defined in the presentation request. The API handling this needs to update the correct client UI and continue the business process using the verified data. We use SignalR for this with a single client to client connection. The Signal connections for each connection is associated with a challenge ID, the same Id we used to create the presentation request. Using this, only the correct client will be notified and not all clients broadcasted. The DrivingLicenseCallback takes the body with is specific for the credentials you issued. This is always depending on what you request. The data is saved to a database and the client is informed to continue. We send a message directly to the correct client using the connectionId of the SignalR session created for this challenge.</p>


  [ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class VerificationController : Controller
{
	private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;

	private readonly IHubContext&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt; _hubContext;

	public VerificationController(BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService,
		IHubContext&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt; hubContext)
	{
		_hubContext = hubContext;
		_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	}

	[HttpPost]
	[Route("[action]")]
	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DrivingLicenseCallback([FromBody] VerifiedDriverLicense body)
	{
		string connectionId;
		var found = MattrVerifiedSuccessHub.Challenges
			.TryGetValue(body.ChallengeId, out connectionId);

		// test Signalr
		//await _hubContext.Clients.Client(connectionId).SendAsync("MattrCallbackSuccess", $"{body.ChallengeId}");
		//return Ok();

		var exists = await _boInsuranceDbService.ChallengeExists(body.ChallengeId);

		if (exists)
		{
			await _boInsuranceDbService.PersistVerification(body);

			if (found)
			{
				//$"/VerifiedUser?challengeid={body.ChallengeId}"
				await _hubContext.Clients
					.Client(connectionId)
					.SendAsync("MattrCallbackSuccess", $"{body.ChallengeId}");
			}

			return Ok();
		}

		return BadRequest("unknown verify request");
	}
}
  


<p>The SignalR server is configured in the Startup class of the ASP.NET Core application. The path for the hub is defined in the MapHub method.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...
	
	services.AddRazorPages();
	services.AddSignalR();
	services.AddControllers();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapHub&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt;("/mattrVerifiedSuccessHub");
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The Hub implementation requires only one fixed method. The AddChallenge method takes the challenge Id and adds this the an in-memory cache. The controller implemented for the callbacks uses this ConcurrentDictionary to find the correct connectionId which is mapped to the challenges form the verification.</p>


  public class MattrVerifiedSuccessHub : Hub
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// This should be replaced with a cache which expires or something
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public static readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; Challenges 
		= new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();

	public void AddChallenge(string challengeId, string connnectionId)
	{
		Challenges.TryAdd(challengeId, connnectionId);
	}

}
  


<p>The Javascript SignalR client in the browser connects to the SignalR server and registers the connectionId with the challenge ID used for the verification of the verifiable credentials from the holder of the digital wallet. If a client gets a message from that a verify has completed successfully and the callback has been called, it will redirect to the verified page. The client listens to the MattrCallbackSuccess for messages. These messages are sent from the callback controller directly.</p>


  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    
    var connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
		.withUrl("/mattrVerifiedSuccessHub").build();

    connection.on("MattrCallbackSuccess", function (challengeId) {
        console.log("received verification:" + challengeId);
        window.location.href = "/VerifiedUser?challengeid=" + challengeId;
    });

    connection.start().then(function () {
        //console.log(connection.connectionId);
        const challengeId = $("#ChallengeId").val();
        
        if (challengeId) {
            console.log(challengeId);
            // join message
            connection.invoke("AddChallenge", challengeId, 
				connection.connectionId).catch(function (err) {
                return console.error(err.toString());
            });
        }
    }).catch(function (err) {
        return console.error(err.toString());
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
  


<p>The VerifiedUserModel Razor page displays the data and the business process can continue using the verified data. </p>


  public class VerifiedUserModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;

	public VerifiedUserModel(BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService)
	{
		_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	}

	public string ChallengeId { get; set; }
	public DriverLicenseClaimsDto VerifiedDriverLicenseClaims { get; private set; }

	public async Task OnGetAsync(string challengeId)
	{
		// user query param to get challenge id and display data
		if (challengeId != null)
		{
			var verifiedDriverLicenseUser = await _boInsuranceDbService.GetVerifiedUser(challengeId);
			VerifiedDriverLicenseClaims = new DriverLicenseClaimsDto
			{
				DateOfBirth = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.DateOfBirth,
				Name = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.Name,
				LicenseType = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.LicenseType,
				FirstName = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.FirstName,
				LicenseIssuedAt = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.LicenseIssuedAt
			};
		}
	}
}

public class DriverLicenseClaimsDto
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string FirstName { get; set; }
	public string LicenseType { get; set; }
	public string DateOfBirth { get; set; }
	public string LicenseIssuedAt { get; set; }
}
  


<p>Running the  verifier</p>



<p>To test the BoInsurance application locally, which is the verifier application, ngrok is used so that we have a public address for the callback. I install ngrok using npm. Without a license, you can only run your application in http.</p>


  npm install -g ngrok
  


<p>Run the ngrok from the command line using the the URL of the application. I start the ASP.NET Core application at localhost port 5000. </p>


  ngrok http localhost:5000
  


<p>You should be able to copied the ngrok URL and use this in the browser to test the verification.</p>







<p>Once running, a verification can be created and you can scan the QR Code with your digital wallet. Once you grant access to your data, the data is sent to the callback API and the UI will be redirected to the success page.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR APIs work really well and support some of the flows for digital identities. I plan to try out the zero proof flow next. It is only possible to create verifiable credentials from data from your identity provider using the id_token. To issue credentials, you have to implement your own identity provider and cannot use business data from your application. If you have full control like with Openiddict, IdenityServer4 or Auth0, this is no problem, just more complicated to implement. If you do not control the data in your identity provider, you would need to create a second identity provider to issue credentials. This is part of your business logic then and not just an identity provider. This will always be a problem is using Azure AD or IDPs from large, medium size companies. The quality of the verifiable credentials also depend on how good the OIDC credential issuers are implemented as these are still central databases for these credentials and are still open to all the problems we have today. Decentralized identities have to potential to solve many problems but still have many unsolved problems.  </p>

<p>I wrote this fake story on January 24, 2005, in an email to <a href="https://hirshberg.com/">Peter Hirshberg</a> after we jokingly came up with it during a phone call. Far as I know, it was the first mention of the word “iPhone.”</p>
<p>Apple introduces one-button iPhone Shuffle</p>
<p>To nobody’s surprise, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the telephony market is no less radical and minimalistic than the one-button mouse and the gum-stick-sized music player. In fact, the company’s new cell phone — developed in deeply secret partnership with Motorola — extends the concept behind the company’s latest iPod, as well as its brand identity.</p>
<p>Like the iPod Shuffle, the new iPhone Shuffle has no display. It’s an all-white rectangle with a little green light to show that a call is in progress. While the iPhone Shuffle resembles the iPod Shuffle, its user interface is even more spare. In place of the round directional “wheel” of the iPods, the iPhone Shuffle sports a single square button. When pressed, the iPod Shuffle dials a random number from its phone book.</p>
<p>“Our research showed that people don’t care who they call as much as they care about being on the phone,” said Apple CEO Steve Jobs. “We also found that most cell phone users hate routine, and prefer to be surprised. That’s just as true for people answering calls as it is for people making them. It’s much more liberating, and far more social, to call people at random than it is to call them deliberately.”</p>
<p>Said (pick an analyst), “We expect the iPhone Shuffle will do as much to change the culture of telephony as the iPod has done to change the culture of music listening.”</p>
<p>Safety was also a concern behind the one-button design. “We all know that thousands of people die on highways every year when they take their eyes off the road to dial or answer a cell phone,” Jobs said. “With the iPhone Shuffle, all they have to do is press one button, simple as that.”</p>
<p>For people who would rather dial contacts in order than at random, the iPhone Shuffle (like the iPod Shuffle) has a switch that allows users to call their phone book in the same order as listings are loaded loaded from the Address Book application.<br>
To accommodate the new product, Apple also released Version 4.0.1 of &nbsp;Address Book, which now features “phonelists” modeled after the familiar “playlists” in iTunes. These allow the iPhone Shuffle’s phone book to be populated by the same ‘iFill’ system that loads playlists from iTunes into iPod Shuffles.</p>
<p>A number of online sites reported that Apple negotiating with one of the major cell carriers to allow free calls between members who maintain .Mac accounts and keep their data in Apple’s Address Book. A few of those sites also suggested that future products in the Shuffle line will combine random phone calling and music playing, allowing users to play random music for random phone contacts.</p>
<p>The iPhone Shuffle will be sold at Apple retail stores.</p>

  <p>Summary: The societal ramifications of Covid-19 passports are not easy to parse. Ultimately, I believe they are inevitable, so the questions for us are when, where, and how they should be used.</p>




<p>
    On December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi and his team at the University of Chicago initiated the first human-made, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1">self-sustaining nuclear chain reactions</a> in history beneath the viewing stands of Stagg Field. Once humans knew how nuclear chain reactions work and how to initiate them, an atomic bomb was inevitable. Someone would build one.
</p>

<p>
    What was not inevitable was when, where, and how nuclear weapons would be used. Global geopolitical events of the last half of the 20th century and many of the international questions of our day deal with the when, where, and how of that particular technology.
</p>

<p>
    A similar, and perhaps just as impactful, discussion is happening now around technologies like artificial intelligence, surveillance, and digital identity. Iâd like to focus on just one small facet of the digital identity debate: vaccination passports.

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/03/vaccination-passports.html">Vaccination Passports</a>, Devon Loffreto has strong words about the effort to create vaccination passports, writing:
</p>

<blockquote>The vaccination passport represents the introduction of the CCP social credit system to America, transmuting people into sub-human data points lasting lifetimes.
 From <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2021/03/vaccination-passports.html">Vaccination Passports</a><br>Referenced 2021-04-12T11:13:58-0600
 </blockquote>

<p>
    Devonâs larger point is that once we get used to having to present a vaccination passport to travel, for example, it could quickly spread. Presenting an ID could become the default with bars, restaurants, churches, stores, and every other public place saying âpapers, please!â before allowing entry.
</p>

<p>
    This is a stark contrast to how people have traditionally gone about their lives. Asking for ID is, by social convention and practicality, limited mostly to places where itâs required by law or regulation. We expect to get carded when we buy cigarettes, but not milk. A vaccination passport could change all that and thatâs Devonâs point.
</p>
<p>
    Devon specifically calls out the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass collaborative</a> as "supporting the administration of people as cattle, as fearful beings 'trusting' their leaders with their compliance."
</p>

<p>
For their part, participants of the Good Health Pass collaborative argue that they are working to create a âsafe path to restore international travel and restart the global economy.â Their principles declare that they are building health-pass systems that are privacy protecting, user-controlled, interoperable, and widely accepted.
</p>
<p>
Iâm sympathetic to Devonâs argument. Once such a passport is in place for travel, thereâs nothing stopping it from being used everywhere, moving society from free and open to more regulated and closed. Nothing that is, unless we put something in place.
</p>
<p>
    Like the direct line from Fermiâs atomic pile to an atomic bomb, the path from nearly ubiquitous smartphone use to some kind of digital vaccination passport is likely inevitable. The question for us isnât whether or not it will exist, but where, how, and when passports will be used.
</p>
<p>
    For example, Iâd prefer a vaccination passport that is built according to principles of the Good Health Pass collaborative than, say, one built by Facebook, Google, Apple, or Amazon. Social convention, and regulation where necessary, can limit where such a passport is used. Itâs an imperfect system, but social systems are. More important, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/legitimacy_and_decentralized_systems.shtml">decentralized governance processes are necessarily political</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As I said, Iâm sympathetic to Devonâs arguments. The sheer ease of presenting digital credentials removes some of the practicality barrier that paper IDs naturally have. Consequently, digital IDs are likely to be used more often than paper. I donât want to live in a society where Iâm carded at every turn—whether for proof of vaccination or anything else. But Iâm also persuaded that organizations like the Good Health Pass collaborative arenât the bad guys. Theyâre just folks who see the inevitability of a vaccination credential and are determined to at least see that itâs done right, in ways that respect individual choice and personal privacy as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
    The societal questions remain regardless.

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">new draft in the HTTP working group</a> that deals with signing HTTP messages of all types. Why is it here, and what does that give&nbsp;us?</p><p>HTTP is irrefutably a fundamental building block of most of today’s software systems. Yet security and identity need to be layered alongside HTTP. The most common of these is simply running the HTTP protocol over an encrypted socket using TLS, resulting in HTTPS. While this is a powerful and important security component, TLS works only my protecting the stream of bits in transit. It does not allow for message-level and application-level security operations. But what if we could sign the messages themselves?</p><p>While it is possible to wrap the body of a request in a cryptographic envelope like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/">JOSE</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/">XML DSig</a>, such approaches force developers to ignore most of the power and flexibility of HTTP, reducing it to a dumb transport layer. In order to sign a message but keep using HTTP as it stands, with all the verbs and headers and content types that it gives us, we will need a scheme that allows us to add a detached signature to the HTTP message. The cryptographic elements to the message can then be generated and validated separately from the request itself, providing a layered approach.</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at creating detached signature methods for HTTP over the years, one of the most famous being the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures">Cavage draft</a> which itself started as a community-facing version of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon’s SIGv4</a> method used within AWS. There were several other efforts, and all of them incompatible with each other in one way or another. To address this, the HTTP Working Group in the IETF stepped up and took on the effort of creating an RFC-track standard for HTTP message signatures that could be used across the variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As of the writing of this post, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">the specification is at version 04</a>. While it’s not finished yet, it’s recently become a bit more stable and so it’s worth looking at it in greater&nbsp;depth.</p> Normalizing HTTP <p>As it turns out, the hardest part of signing HTTP messages isn’t the signing, it’s the HTTP. HTTP is a messy set of specifications, with pieces that have been built up by many authors over many years in ways that aren’t always that consistent. A recent move towards consistency has been the adoption of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">Structured Field Values</a> for HTTP. In short, structured fields allow HTTP headers to house simple, non-recursive data structures with unambiguous parsing and deterministic serialization. These aspects made it perfect for use within the HTTP message signatures specification.</p><p>Previous efforts at HTTP message signing concentrated on creating a signature around HTTP headers, and the current draft is no exception in allowing that. On top of that, the current draft also allows for the definition of specialty fields that contain other pieces of constructed information not found in the headers themselves. These covered components are identified and combined with each other into a signature input string. To this string is added a field that includes all of the input parameters to this signature. For example, let’s say we want to sign parts of this HTTP&nbsp;request:</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br><br>{"hello": "world"} <p>We choose the components we want to sign, including the target of the request and a subset of the available headers, and create the following signature input&nbsp;string:</p> @request-target": post /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog<br>"host": example.com<br>"date": Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>"content-type": application/json<br>"digest": SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>"content-length": 18<br>"@signature-params": ("@request-target" "host" "date" "content-type"  "digest" "content-length");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss" <p>With a given HTTP message and a set of input parameters determining which parts of the message are covered with a signature, any party can re-generate this string with a reasonable level of success. Unsigned headers can be added to the message by intermediaries without invalidating the signature, and it’s even possible for an intermediary to add its own signature to the message on the way through — but we’ll get more into that advanced use case in a future post. The result of this is that the signer and verifier will re-create this signature input string independently of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Now that we have a normalized string to sign, how do we actually sign&nbsp;it?</p> Signing and Verifying Content <p>Once we have the string, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of applying a key and signature function to the string. Any signature method that takes in and bunch of bytes and spits out a different set of bytes is technically feasible&nbsp;here.</p><p>How do the signer and verifier know which algorithm to use on a given method? It turns out that different deployments have drastically different needs in this regard. As a consequence, this is an aspect that is application specific by the specification, with several common methods called&nbsp;out:</p>  The signer and verifier can both be configured to expect only a specific algorithm, or have that algorithm identified by some aspect external to the protocol.  The signer and verifier can identify the key used to do the signing and figure out the signature algorithm based on that. If an application’s using JSON Web Keys, the alg field of the key provides an easy way to identify a signing mechanism.  If the signer and verifier need to signal the algorithm dynamically at runtime, there is an alg field in the signature parameter set itself that points to a new registry.  And if two or more of these methods are applicable to a given message, the answers all have to match, otherwise something fishy is going on and the signature is invalidated.  <p>Given the above signature input string and an RSA-PSS signing method, we end up with the following Base64-encoded bytes as the signature output:</p> NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg== <p>This gives us a signed object, and now we need to put that into our HTTP&nbsp;message.</p> Sending Signatures in&nbsp;Messages <p>The HTTP message signature specification defines two new headers to carry the signature, Signature and Signature-Input. Both of these use the Dictionary construct from the HTTP Structured Field Values standard to carry a named signature.</p><p>But first, why two headers? This construct allows us to easily separate the metadata about the signature — how it was made — from the signature value itself. This separation makes parsing simpler and also allows the HTTP message signatures specification to support multiple independent signatures on a given&nbsp;message.</p><p>The Signature-Input header contains all the parameters that went into the creation of the signature, including the list of covered content, identifiers for the key and algorithm, and items like timestamps or other application-specific flags. In fact, this is the same value used as the last line of the signature input string, and so its values are always covered by the signature. The Signature header contains the value of the signature itself as a byte array, encoded in Base64. The signer chooses a name for the signature object and adds both items to the headers. The name has no semantic impact, it just needs to be unique within a given&nbsp;request.</p><p>Let’s say this signature is named sig1. The signer adds both headers to the request above, resulting in the following signed&nbsp;request.</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br>Signature-Input: sig1=("host" "date" "content-type");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss"<br>Signature: sig1=:NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg==:  {"hello": "world"} <p>Note that none of the other headers or aspects of the message are modified by the signature process.</p><p>The verifier parses both headers, re-creates the signature input string from the request, and verifies the signature value using the identified key and algorithm. But how does the verifier know that this signature is sufficient for this request, and how does the signer know what to sign in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Applying the Message Signature Specification <p>As discussed above, the signer and verifier need to have a way of figuring out which algorithm and keys are appropriate for a given signed message. In many deployments, this information can be gleaned through context and configuration. For example, a key derivation algorithm based on the tenant identifier in the URL can be used to dereference the key needed for a given call. Or an application identifier passed in the body could point to a record giving both the expected algorithm and allowable key material.</p><p>In addition to defining a predictable way to determine this, an application of the HTTP message signatures specification also needs to define which parts of the message need to be signed. For example, and API might have very different behaviors based on a Content-Type header but not really care about the Content-Encoding. A security protocol like OAuth or GNAP would require signing the Authorization header that contains the access token as well as the @request-target specialty field.</p><p>The HTTP protocol is also designed to allow interception and proxy of requests and responses, with intermediaries fully allowed to alter the message in certain ways. Applications that need to account for such intermediaries can be picky about which headers and components are signed, allowing the signature to survive expected message modifications but protecting against unanticipated changes in&nbsp;transit.</p><p>This fundamentally means that no signature method will ever be perfect for all messages — but that’s ok. The HTTP message signature draft instead leans on flexibility, allowing applications to define how best to apply the signature methods to achieve the security&nbsp;needed.</p> Building the&nbsp;Standard <p>The HTTP message signatures specification is still a long way from being done. It’s taken in a number of different inputs and many years of collective community experience, and that initially resulted in some major churn in the specification’s syntax and structure. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">As of version 04</a> though, the major surgery seems to be behind us. While there will inevitably be some changes to the parameters, names, and possibly even structures, the core of this is pretty solid. It’s time to start implementing it and testing it out with applications of all stripes, and I invite all of you to join me in doing just&nbsp;that.</p>

<p>NPR, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/npr-turns-50/">which turned 50</a> yesterday, used to mean National Public Radio. It still does, at least legally; but <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/inside/2010/07/12/128475395/npr-what-s-in-a-name">they quit calling it that</a> in 2010. The reason given was “…most of our audience — more than 27 million listeners to NPR member stations and millions more who experience our content on&nbsp;<a href="http://NPR.org" title="http://NPR. ">NPR.org</a> and through mobile or tablet devices — identify us as NPR.” Translation: We’re not just radio any more.</p>
<p>And they aren’t. Television, newspapers and magazines also aren’t what they were. All of those are now experienced mostly on glowing rectangles connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Put another way, the Internet is assimilating all of them. On the Internet, radio is also fracturing into new and largely (though not entirely) different spawn. The main two are streaming (for music, live news and events) and podcasting (for talk and news).</p>
<p>This sidelines the radio sources called&nbsp;stations. Think about it: how much these days do you ask yourself “What’s on?” And how much do you listen to an actual radio, or watch TV through an antenna? Do you even have a radio that’s not in a car or stored away in the garage?</p>
<p>If you value and manage your time, chances are you are using apps to store and forward your listening and viewing to later times, when you can easily speed up the program or skip over ads and other “content” you don’t want to “consume.” (I put those in quotes because only the supply side talks that way about what they produce and what you do with it.)</p>
<p>This does not match the legacy structure of radio stations. Especially technically.</p>
<p>See, the purpose of stations is to stand in one place radiating sound (called “programs”) on signals, in real time (called ‘live”), around the clock, for a limited geography: a city or a region. Key thing:&nbsp;they have to fill that time.</p>
<p>For this stations can get along without studios (like companies in our current plague have found ways to get along without offices). But they still need to maintain transmitters with antennas.</p>
<p>For AM, which was born in the 1920s, the waves are so long that whole towers, or collections of them, radiate the signals. In almost all cases these facilities take up acres of real estate—sometimes dozens of acres. For FM and TV, media born in the 1940s, the waves are short, but need to radiate from high places: atop towers, tall buildings or mountains.</p>
<p>Maintaining these facilities isn’t cheap. In the case of AM stations, it is now common for the land under towers to be worth far more than the stations themselves, which is why so many AM stations are now going off the air or moving off to share other stations’ facilities, usually at the cost of lost coverage.</p>
<p>This is why I am sure that&nbsp;most or all of these facilities will be as gone as horse-drawn carriages and steam engines, sometime in the next few years or decades. Also why I am documenting transmitters that still stand, photographically. You can see a collection of my transmitter and antenna photos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums">here</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=relevance&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=transmitter">here</a>. (The image above is what radiates KPCC/89.3 from Mt. Wilson, which overlooks Los Angeles.)</p>
<p>It’s a safe bet, for a few more years at least, that stations will still be around, transmitting to people mostly on the Net. But at some point (probably many points) the transmitters will be gone, simply because they cost too much, don’t do enough—and in one significant way, do too much. Namely, fill the clock, 24/7, with “content.”</p>
<p>To help get our heads around this, consider this: the word&nbsp;station <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station">derives</a> from the Latin&nbsp;station- and&nbsp;statio&nbsp;from stare, which means&nbsp;to stand. In a place.</p>
<p>In the terrestrial world, we needed stationary places for carriages, trains and busses to stop. On radio, we used to need what we called a “dial,” where radio stations could be found on stationary positions called channels or frequencies. Now those are numbers that appear in a read-out.</p>
<p>But even those were being obsolesced decades ago in Europe. There a car radio might say the name of a station, which might be received on any number of frequencies, transmitted by many facilities, spread across a region or a country. What makes this possible is a standard called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System">RDS</a>, which uses a function called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_frequency">alternative frequency</a>&nbsp;(AF) to make a radio play a given station on whatever channel sounds best to the radio. This would be ideal for the CBC in Canada and for regional public stations such as WAMC, KPCC, KUER and KCRW, which all have many transmitters scattered around.</p>
<p>Alas, when this standard was being worked out in the ’80s and early ’90s, the North American folks couldn’t imagine one station on many frequencies and in many locations, so they&nbsp;deployed a lesser derivative standard called RDBS, which lacked the AF function.</p>
<p>But this is now, and on its 50th anniversary public radio—and&nbsp;NPR stations especially—are doing well.</p>
<p>In radio ratings for <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001">New Yo</a><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001">rk</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb003">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">Washington</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb063">San Diego</a>, and dozens of other markets, the top news station is an NPR one. Here in <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001">Santa Barbara</a>, about a quarter of all listening goes to non-commercial stations, led by <a href="https://www.kclu.org/">KCLU</a>, the most local of the NPR affiliates with transmitters here. (Best I can tell, Santa Barbara, which I wrote about <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">here</a> in 2019, is still the top market for public radio in the country. Number two is still <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">Vermont</a>.)</p>
<p>But I gotta wonder how long the station-based status quo will remain stationary in our listening habits. To the degree that I’m a one-person bellwether, the prospects aren’t good. Nearly all my listening these days is to podcasts or to streams on the Net. Some of those are from stations, but most are straight from producers, only one of which is NPR. And I listen to few of them live.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a good bet that NPR will do well for decades to come. Its main challenge will be to survive the end of station-based live broadcasting. Because that eventuality is starting to become visible.</p>

<p>Yesterday was <a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/worldpressfreedomday">World Press Freedom Day</a>. I’d planned to publish this post then, but my mother was in the in ER. (She's out now; the rollercoaster continues.)</p><p>A functional, free press is a vital part of the foundation of democracy, right alongside free and open elections. It's impossible to have an educated voting populace without it - and you can't have a democracy without educated voters. It's incredibly important to have people out there dedicated to uncovering the truth and speaking truth to power.</p><p>According to Reporters Without Borders, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/united-states">the US ranks 44th in the world for press freedom</a>. During Trump's last year in office, nearly 400 journalists were assaulted on the job, and over 130 were detained. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321116/americans-remain-distrustful-mass-media.aspx">Only 40% of Americans trust the media</a>; among conservatives, the figure is considerably worse.</p><p>To control a populace, authoritarians first seek to undermine the press. <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/the-ominous-nazi-era-precedent-to-trump-s-fake-news-attacks-1.5438960">The Nazi-era term for this was Lügenpresse</a>, which literally translates to lying press. The Trump-era term was lifted almost verbatim: <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-fake-news-counter-history-b732873.html">fake news</a>. It continues to do harm.</p><p>As well as in the broader societal sphere, this discourse extends to industry: in tech, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists">we’ve had our own anti-press movements</a> that seek to undermine free and fair reporting. It’s always abhorrent.</p><p>Which isn’t to say that the press shouldn’t be criticized: oversight of journalism is also journalism, and conversations about the nature of reporting are important. No institution can be unassailable, and no journalist can be above reproach. I particularly welcome <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/11/the-moral-case-for-diversity-in-newsrooms-also-makes-good-business-sense/">conversations about diversity and equity in newsrooms</a> and how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2018/nov/05/newsroom-diversity-media-race-journalism">the demographics of reporting staff affect the stories they produce</a>. Journalists are imperfect, because everyone is imperfect; regardless, they should have unfettered access to information and receive protection under the law. The work they do makes freedom and democracy possible.</p><p>Similarly, whistleblowers. We depend on people who are willing to call out wrongdoing. <a href="https://www.ellsberg.net/">Daniel Ellsberg</a> revealing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers">Pentagon Papers</a> allowed Americans to understand the full scope of the Vietnam War for the first time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> allowed Americans to understand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files">that they were the subjects of illegal mass surveillance</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning">Chelsea Manning</a> allowed Americans to understand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/30/bradley-manning-wikileaks-revelations">war crimes that were committed in their names</a>. Each of them faced severe repercussions; each of them allowed American voters to better understand the actions of their government.</p><p>In the midst of the “fake news” culture war, there’s been a lot of talk about how to battle misinformation. One of those tactics has sometimes been to promote certain, trusted publications. The intention is noble: there’s no doubt in my mind that the New York Times is more trustworthy than InfoWars, for example. But the unintended effect is to shut out new publications that haven’t managed to build a reputation yet - and in particular, new publications that might be run by people of color, who are underrepresented in establishment media. It also has the effect of potentially discrediting whistleblower accounts that can’t find purchase in mainstream publications, creating an “approved news” that can unintentionally obscure important facts.</p><p>Instead, I’m more excited - albeit with some reservations - by software projects that add context on a story by showing how other outlets have reported it. I’m committed to an open web that allows anyone to publish, even if that means tolerating the InfoWars and Epoch Times dumpster fires alongside more legitimate sources. Context and critical reasoning are key.</p><p>The press isn’t glamorous; it’s not always convenient or comfortable. But it’s absolutely crucial for a functional democracy and a free society. Because power is at stake, there will always be people who want to undermine or control journalism - and our job as democratic citizens is to refuse to allow them.</p><p>I’m grateful for the press. I’m grateful for democracy. Let’s be vigilant.</p>

     <p>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendykimsmith/">Wendy Smith</a>&nbsp; https://www.learninginnovationslab.org/guest-faculty/</p><br><p>The importance of creating or seeing a paradox is that you can understand that the data and facts being presented to you can lead to the recommendation or conclusion being offered, but equally that the same data and facts can equally lead to a different conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is that we are not very good at finding flaws in our own arguments, if for no other reason than they support our incentives and beliefs. We tend to take it personally when someone attacks our logic, beliefs or method, even if they are searching for the paradox. Equally, the person you are about to question reacts just like you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for the paradox allows you to see the jumps, assumptions and framing in the logic being presented, which lays bare how our thinking and decisions are being manipulated.&nbsp; Often it turns out, others are blinded to see one conclusion, and as a leader and executive, your role is to explore and question the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Logical flow decisions often create paradoxes because of an invalid argument, but they are nevertheless valuable in creating a narrative. We see this as a statement or proposition which, despite sound (or apparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory.&nbsp; Finding a paradox in non-logical flow decisions reveals errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous. Equally,&nbsp; a paradox can be seen when a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition, which when investigated, proves to be well-founded or true. &nbsp; What is evident is the need for critical thinking, questions and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>Just because an idea pops into your head during a presentation doesn’t mean it’s true or reasonable. Idea bias is a new skinny belief you have just created, leading you to poor decision making as you have been framed. Often in a meeting, the framing is such that the presenter has set up a story or analogy which you believe in and fail to create new questions about (idea bias); as a way to make the logic jumps needed to justify a story.&nbsp; If you cannot see the paradox, you are in their model, which means you are unlikely to make an unbiased decision.&nbsp; If you can see the paradox you have mastered critical thinking and can use tools to ensure you make decisions that lead to outcomes that you want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If you cannot see the paradox, you are in a model.</p><br><p>Decision-making framing itself create paradox’s for us&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox">Prevention paradox</a>: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behaviour — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer, from the change.&nbsp; An assumption about the adoption of a product.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making_paradox">Decision-making paradox</a>: Picking “the best decision-making method” is a decision problem in itself.

   Work on VIAL for Vaccinate The States continues. 
 I talked about matching last week. I've been building more features to support figuring out if a newly detected location is already listed or not, with one of the most significant being the ability to search for locations within a radius of a specific point. 
 I've experimented with a PostgreSQL/Django version of the classic cos/sin/radians query

  <p>Work on VIAL for <a href="https://www.vaccinatethestates.com/">Vaccinate The States</a> continues.</p>
<p>I talked about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Apr/26/vaccinate-the-states/">matching</a> last week. I've been building more features to support figuring out if a newly detected location is already listed or not, with one of the most significant being the ability to search for locations within a radius of a specific point.</p>
<p>I've experimented with a PostgreSQL/Django version of <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/postgresql/closest-locations-to-a-point">the classic cos/sin/radians query for this</a> but if you're going to do this over a larger dataset it's worth using a proper spatial index for it - and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/gis/">GeoDjango</a> has provided tools for this since Django 1.0 in 2008!</p>
<p>I have to admit that outside of a few prototypes I've never used GeoDjango extensively myself - partly I've not had the right project for it, and in the past I've also been put off by the difficulty involved in installing all of the components.</p>
<p>That's a lot easier in 2021 than it was in 2008. But VIAL is a project in-flight, so here are some notes on what it took to get GeoDjango added to an existing Django project.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alexmv">Alex Vandiver</a> has been working with me on VIAL and helped figure out quite a few of these steps.</p>
 Activating PostgreSQL 
<p>The first step was to install the PostGIS PostgreSQL extension. This can be achieved using a Django migration:</p>
 from django.contrib.postgres.operations import CreateExtension
from django.db import migrations


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ("my_app", "0108_previous-migration"),
    ]

    operations = [
        CreateExtension("postgis"),
    ] 
<p>Most good PostgreSQL hosting already makes this extension available - in our case we are using Google Cloud SQL which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/extensions#postgresql-extensions-supported-by-cloud-sql">supports various extensions</a>, including PostGIS. I use <a href="https://postgresapp.com/">Postgres.app</a> for my personal development environment which bundles PostGIS too.</p>
<p>So far, so painless!</p>
 System packages needed by GeoDjango 
<p>GeoDjango <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs/">needs the GEOS, GDAL and PROJ</a> system libraries. Alex added these to our Dockerfile (used for our production deployments) like so:</p>
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y \
    binutils \
    gdal-bin \
    libproj-dev \
    &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  
 Adding a point field to a Django model 
<p>I already had a <code>Location</code> model, which looked something like this:</p>
 class Location(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    # ...
    latitude = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=9, decimal_places=5
    )
    longitude = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=9, decimal_places=5
    ) 
<p>I made three changes to this class: I changed the base class to this:</p>
 from django.contrib.gis.db import models as gis_models

class Location(gis_models.Model):
    # ... 
<p>I added a <code>point</code> column:</p>
     point = gis_models.PointField(
        blank=True,
        null=True,
        spatial_index=True
    ) 
<p>And I set up a custom <code>save()</code> method to populate that <code>point</code> field with a point representing the latitude and longitude every time the object was saved:</p>
 from django.contrib.gis.geos import Point

# ...

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Point is derived from latitude/longitude
        if self.longitude and self.latitude:
            self.point = Point(
                float(self.longitude),
                float(self.latitude),
                srid=4326
            )
        else:
            self.point = None
        super().save(*args, **kwargs) 
<p><code>srid=4326</code> ensures the point is stored using WGS84 - the most common coordinate system for latitude and longitude values across our planet.</p>
<p>Running <code>./manage.py makemigrations</code> identified the new <code>point</code> Point column and created the corresponding migration for me.</p>
 Backfilling the point column with a migration 
<p>The <code>.save()</code> method would populate <code>point</code> for changes going forward, but I had 40,000 records that already existed which I needed to backfill. I used this migration to do that:</p>
 from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ("core", "0110_location_point"),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunSQL(
            sql="""
            update location
            set point = ST_SetSRID(
                ST_MakePoint(
                    longitude, latitude
                ),
                4326
            );""",
            reverse_sql=migrations.RunSQL.noop,
        )
    ] 
 latitude/longitude/radius queries 
<p>With the new <code>point</code> column created and populated, here's the code I wrote to support simple latitude/longitude/radius queries:</p>
 from django.contrib.gis.geos import Point
from django.contrib.gis.measure import Distance

def search_locations(request):
    qs = Location.objects.filter(soft_deleted=False)
    latitude = request.GET.get("latitude")
    longitude = request.GET.get("longitude")
    radius = request.GET.get("radius")
    if latitude and longitude and radius:
        # Validate latitude/longitude/radius
        for value in (latitude, longitude, radius):
            try:
                float(value)
            except ValueError:
                return JsonResponse(
                    {"error": "latitude/longitude/radius should be numbers"}, status=400
                )
        qs = qs.filter(
            point__distance_lt=(
                Point(
                    float(longitude),
                    float(latitude)
                ),
                Distance(m=float(radius)),
            )
        )
    # ... return JSON for locations 
<p>In writing up these notes I realize that this isn't actually the best way to do this, because it fails to take advantage of the spatial index on that column! I've filed myself an issue to switch to the spatial-index-friendly <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/gis/geoquerysets/#dwithin">dwithin</a> instead.</p>
 Getting CI to work 
<p>The hardest part of all of this turned out to be getting our CI suites to pass.</p>
<p>We run CI in two places at the moment: GitHub Actions and Google Cloud Build (as part of our continuous deployment setup).</p>
<p>The first error I hit was this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>psycopg2.errors.UndefinedFile: could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/13/extension/postgis.control": No such file or directory</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that's what happens when your PostgreSQL server doesn't have the PostGIS extension available.</p>
<p>Our GitHub Actions configuration started like this:</p>
  name: Run tests

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:13
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: vaccinate
        options:
          --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5
        ports:
        - 5432:5432
    steps:  
<p>The <code>postgres:13</code> image doesn't have PostGIS. Swapping that out for <code>postgis/postgis:13-3.1</code> fixed that (using <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/">this image</a>).</p>
<p>Our Cloud Build configuration included this:</p>
    # Start up a postgres for tests
  - id: "start postgres"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      - "run"
      - "-d"
      - "--network=cloudbuild"
      - "-e"
      - "POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust"
      - "--name"
      - "vaccinate-db"
      - "postgres"

  - id: "test image"
    name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker"
    args:
      - "run"
      - "-t"
      - "--network=cloudbuild"
      - "-e"
      - "DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@vaccinate-db:5432/vaccinate"
      - "${_IMAGE_NAME}:latest"
      - "pytest"
      - "-v"  
<p>I tried swapping out that last <code>postgres</code> argument for <code>postgis/postgis:13-3.1</code>, like I had with the GitHub Actions one... and it failed with this error instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>django.db.utils.OperationalError: could not connect to server: Connection refused</code>
<code>Is the server running on host "vaccinate-db" (192.168.10.3) and accepting</code>
<code>TCP/IP connections on port 5432?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one stumped me. Eventually Alex figured out the problem: the extra extension meant the PostgreSQL was taking slightly longer to start - something that was covered in our GitHub Actions configuration by the <code>pg_isready</code> line. He added this step to our Cloud Build configuration:</p>
    - id: "wait for postgres"
    name: "jwilder/dockerize"
    args: ["dockerize", "-timeout=60s", "-wait=tcp://vaccinate-db:5432"]  
<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize">jwilder/dockerize</a> to wait until the database container starts accepting connections on port 5432.</p>
 Next steps 
<p>Now that we have GeoDjango I'm excited to start exploring new capabilities for our software. One thing in particular that interests me is teaching VIAL to backfill the county for a location based on its latitude and longitude - the US Census provide a shapefile of county polygons which I use with Datasette and SpatiaLite in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/us-counties-datasette">simonw/us-counties-datasette</a> project, so I'm confident it would work well using PostGIS instead.</p>

<p>This article shows how to create and issue verifiable credentials using <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> and an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a>. The ASP.NET Core application allows an admin user to create an OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR service. The credentials are displayed in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page web UI as a QR code for the users of the application. The user can use a digital <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">wallet</a> form MATTR to scan the QR code, authenticate against an <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> identity provider configured for this flow and use the claims from the id token to add the verified credential to the digital wallet. In a follow up post, a second application will then use the verified credentials to allow access to a second business process. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/MattrGlobalAspNetCore">https://github.com/swiss-ssi-group/MattrGlobalAspNetCore</a></p>



<p>Blogs in the series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/29/getting-started-with-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/">Getting started with Self Sovereign Identity SSI</a>  Create an OIDC credential Issuer with MATTR and ASP.NET Core  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/10/present-and-verify-verifiable-credentials-in-asp-net-core-using-decentralized-identities-and-mattr/">Present and Verify Verifiable Credentials in ASP.NET Core using Decentralized Identities and MATTR</a>  



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solutions involves an MATTR API which handles all the blockchain identity logic.  An ASP.NET Core application is used to create the digital identity and the OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR APIs and also present this as a QR code which can be scanned. An identity provider is required to add the credential properties to the id token. The properties in a verified credential are issued using the claims values from the id token so a specific identity provider is required with every credential issuer using this technic. Part of the business of this solution is adding business claims to the identity provider. A MATTR digital wallet is required to scan the QR code, authenticate against the OIDC provider which in our case is Auth0 and then store the verified credentials to the wallet for later use.</p>







<p>MATTR Setup</p>



<p>You need to register with MATTR and create a new account. MATTR will issue you access to your sandbox domain and you will get access data from them plus a link to support. </p>



<p>Once setup, use the OIDC Bridge tutorial to implement the flow used in this demo. The docs are really good but you need to follow the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">docs</a> exactly. </p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc</a></p>



<p>Auth0 Setup</p>



<p>A standard trusted web application which supports the code flow is required so that the MATTR digital wallet can authenticate using the identity provider and use the id token values from the claims which are required in the credential. It is important to create a new application which is only used for this because the client secret is required when creating the OIDC credential issuer and is shared with the MATTR platform. It would probably be better to use certificates instead of a shared secret which is persisted in different databases. We also use a second Auth0 application configuration to sign into the web application but this is not required to issue credentials. </p>



<p>In Auth0, rules are used to extend the id token claims. You need to add your claims as required by the MATTR API and your business logic for the credentials you wish to issue.</p>

    const namespace = 'https://--your-tenant--.vii.mattr.global/';
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_issued_at'] = user.user_metadata.license_issued_at;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_type'] = user.user_metadata.license_type;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'name'] = user.user_metadata.name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'first_name'] = user.user_metadata.first_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>For every user (holder) who should be able to create verifiable credentials, you must add the credential data to the user profile. This is part of the business process with this flow. If you were to implement this for a real application with lots of users, it would probably be better to integrate the identity provider into the solution issuing the credentials and add a UI for editing the user profile data which is used in the credentials. This would be really easy using ASP.NET Core Identity and for example OpenIddict or IdentityServer4. It is important that the user cannot edit this data. This logic is part of the credential issuer logic and not part of the user profile.</p>



<p>After creating a new MATTR OIDC credential issuer, the callback URL needs to be added to the Open ID connect code flow client used for the digital wallet sign in.</p>







<p>Add the URL to the Allowed Callback URLs in the settings of your Auth0 application configuration for the digital wallet.</p>



<p>Implementing the OpenID Connect credentials Issuer application</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is used to create new OIDC credential issuers and also display the QR code for these so that the verifiable credential can be loaded to the digital wallet. The application requires secrets. The data is stored to a database, so that any credential can be added to a wallet at a later date and also so that you can find the credentials you created. The MattrConfiguration is the data and the secrets you received from MATTR for you account access to the API. The Auth0 configuration is the data required to sign in to the application. The Auth0Wallet configuration is the data required to create the OIDC credential issuer so that the digital wallet can authenticate the identity using the Auth0 application. This data is stored in the user secrets during development.</p>

}
  


<p>Accessing the MATTR APIs</p>



<p>The MattrConfiguration DTO is used to fetch the MATTR account data for the API access and to use in the application.</p>


  public class MattrConfiguration
{
	public string Audience { get; set; }
	public string ClientId { get; set; }
	public string ClientSecret { get; set; }
	public string TenantId { get; set; }
	public string TenantSubdomain { get; set; }
	public string Url { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to acquire an access token and used for the MATTR API access. The token is stored to a cache and only fetched if the old one has expired or is not available.</p>


  public class MattrTokenApiService
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;MattrTokenApiService&gt; _logger;

	}

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string access_token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public int expires_in { get; set; }
		public string token_type { get; set; }
		public string scope { get; set; }
	}

	private class MattrCrendentials
	{

		public string grant_type { get; set; } = "client_credentials";
	}

	public MattrTokenApiService(
			IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
			IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory,
			ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
			IDistributedCache cache)
	{
		_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;

		var newAccessToken = await GetApiTokenClient(client);
		AddToCache(api_name, newAccessToken);

	}

	private async Task&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt; GetApiTokenClient(HttpClient client)
	{

			var tokenResponse = await client.PostAsJsonAsync(authUrl, payload);

			if (tokenResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
			{
				var result = await tokenResponse.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;AccessTokenItem&gt;();
				DateTime expirationTime = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(result.expires_in).DateTime;

	}

	private void AddToCache(string key, AccessTokenResult accessTokenItem)
	{

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>Generating the API DTOs using Nswag</p>



<p>The MattrOpenApiClientSevice file was generated using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag">Nswag</a> and the Open API file provided by MATTR <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref">here</a>. We only generated the DTOs using this and access the client then using a HttpClient instance. The Open API file used in this solution is deployed in the git repo.</p>



<p>Creating the OIDC credential issuer</p>



<p>The MattrCredentialsService is used to create an OIDC credentials issuer using the MATTR APIs. This is implemented using the CreateCredentialsAndCallback method. The created callback is returned so that it can be displayed in the UI and copied to the specific Auth0 application configuration. </p>


  private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
private readonly DriverLicenseCredentialsService _driverLicenseService;
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrCredentialsService(IConfiguration configuration,
	DriverLicenseCredentialsService driverLicenseService,
	IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService)
{
	_configuration = configuration;
	_driverLicenseService = driverLicenseService;
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreateCredentialsAndCallback(string name)
{
	// create a new one
	var driverLicenseCredentials = await CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer();
	driverLicenseCredentials.Name = name;
	await _driverLicenseService.CreateDriverLicense(driverLicenseCredentials);

	var callback = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers/{driverLicenseCredentials.OidcIssuerId}/federated/callback";
	return callback;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer method implements the different steps described in the MATTR API documentation for this. An access token for the MATTR API is created or retrieved from the cache and DID is created and the id from the DID post response is used to create the OIDC credential issuer.  The DriverLicenseCredentials is returned which is persisted to a database and the callback is created using this object.</p>


  private async Task&lt;DriverLicenseCredentials&gt; CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer()
{
	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService
		.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders
		.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var did = await CreateMattrDid(client);
	var oidcIssuer = await CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(client, did);

	return new DriverLicenseCredentials
	{
		Name = "not_named",
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		OidcIssuer = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(oidcIssuer),
		OidcIssuerId = oidcIssuer.Id
	};
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDid method creates a new DID as specified by the API. The MattrOptions class is used to create the request object. This is serialized using the StringContentWithoutCharset class due to a bug in the MATTR API validation. I created this class using the blog from <a href="https://gunnarpeipman.com/httpclient-remove-charset/">Gunnar Peipman</a>.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt; CreateMattrDid(HttpClient client)
{
	// create did , post to dids 
	// https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref/#operation/createDid
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/use-did/

	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocument
	{
		Method = MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocumentMethod.Key,
		Options = new MattrOptions()
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var createDidResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (createDidResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt;(
					await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreateDidResponse;
		}

		var error = await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The MattrOptions DTO is used to create a default DID using the key type “ed25519”. See the MATTR API docs for further details.</p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
  /// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
  /// 
  /// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
  /// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public string keyType { get; set; } = "ed25519";
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer implements the OIDC credential issuer to create the post request. The request properties need to be setup for your credential properties and must match claims from the id token of the Auth0 user profile. This is where the OIDC client for the digital wallet is setup and also where the credential claims are specified. If this is setup up incorrectly, loading the data into your wallet will fail. The HTTP request and the response DTOs are implemented using the Nswag generated classes. </p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt; CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(HttpClient client, V1_CreateDidResponse did)
        {
            // create vc, post to credentials api
            // https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/setup-issuer

            var createCredentialsUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers";

            var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateOidcIssuerRequest
            {
                Credential = new Credential
                {
                    IssuerDid = did.Did,
                    Name = "NationalDrivingLicense",
                    Context = new List&lt;Uri&gt; {
                         new Uri( "https://schema.org") // Only this is supported
                    },
                    Type = new List&lt;string&gt; { "nationaldrivinglicense" }
                },
                ClaimMappings = new List&lt;ClaimMappings&gt;
                {
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="name", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="firstName", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/first_name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseType", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_type"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="dateOfBirth", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/date_of_birth"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseIssuedAt", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_issued_at"}
                },
                FederatedProvider = new FederatedProvider
                {
                    ClientId = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientId"],
                    ClientSecret = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientSecret"],
                    Url = new Uri($"https://{_configuration["Auth0Wallet:Domain"]}"),
                    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" }
                }
            };

            var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

            var uri = new Uri(createCredentialsUrl);

            using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
            {
                var createOidcIssuerResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

                if (createOidcIssuerResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
                {
                    var v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt;(
                            await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

                    return v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse;
                }

                var error = await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            }

            throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
        }
  


<p>Now the service is completely ready to generate credentials. This can be used in any Blazor UI, Razor page or MVC view in ASP.NET Core. The services are added to the DI in the startup class. The callback method is displayed in the UI if the application successfully creates a new OIDC credential issuer.</p>


  private readonly MattrCredentialsService _mattrCredentialsService;
public bool CreatingDriverLicense { get; set; } = true;
public string Callback { get; set; }

[BindProperty]
public IssuerCredential IssuerCredential { get; set; }
public AdminModel(MattrCredentialsService mattrCredentialsService)
{
	_mattrCredentialsService = mattrCredentialsService;
}
public void OnGet()
{
	IssuerCredential = new IssuerCredential();
}

public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
{
	if (!ModelState.IsValid)
	{
		return Page();
	}

	Callback = await _mattrCredentialsService
		.CreateCredentialsAndCallback(IssuerCredential.CredentialName);
	CreatingDriverLicense = false;
	return Page();
}
}

public class IssuerCredential
{
	[Required]
	public string CredentialName { get; set; }
}
  


<p>Adding credentials you wallet</p>



<p>After the callback method has been added to the Auth0 callback URLs, the credentials can be used to add verifiable credentials to your wallet. This is fairly simple. The Razor Page uses the data from the database and generates an URL using the MATTR specification and the id from the created OIDC credential issuer. The claims from the id token or the profile data is just used to display the data for the user signed into the web application. This is not the same data which is used be the digital wallet. If the same person logs into the digital wallet, then the data is the same. The wallet authenticates the identity separately. </p>

		}
	}
}
  


<p>The data is displayed using Bootstrap. If you use a MATTR wallet to scan the QR Code shown underneath, you will be redirected to authenticate against the specified Auth0 application. If you have the claims, you can add verifiable claims to you digital wallet.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR API has a some problems with its API and a stricter validation would help a lot. But MATTR support is awesome and the team are really helpful and you will end up with a working solution. It would be also awesome if the Open API file could be used without changes to generate a client and the DTOs. It would makes sense, if you could issue credentials data from the data in the credential issuer application and not from the id token of the user profile. I understand that in some use cases, you would like to protect against any wallet taking credentials for other identities, but I as a credential issuer cannot always add my business data to user profiles from the IDP. The security of this solution all depends on the user profile data. If a non authorized person can change this data (in this case, this could be the same user), then incorrect verifiable credentials can be created. </p>



<p>Next step is to create an application to verify and use the verifiable credentials created here.</p>

   Hosting SQLite databases on Github Pages 
 I've seen the trick of running SQLite compiled to WASM in the browser before, but this comes with an incredibly clever bonus trick: it uses SQLite's page structure to fetch subsets of the database file via HTTP range requests, which means you can run indexed SQL queries against a 600MB database file while only fetching a few MBs of data over the wire.

<p>I've seen the trick of running SQLite compiled to WASM in the browser before, but this comes with an incredibly clever bonus trick: it uses SQLite's page structure to fetch subsets of the database file via HTTP range requests, which means you can run indexed SQL queries against a 600MB database file while only fetching a few MBs of data over the wire. Absolutely brilliant. Tucked away at the end of the post is another neat trick: making the browser DOM available to SQLite as a virtual table, so you can query and update the DOM of the current page using SQL!</p>

   Just over a year ago I started tracking TILs, inspired by Josh Branchaud's collection. I've since published 148 TILs across 43 different topics. It's a great format! 
 TIL stands for Today I Learned. The thing I like most about TILs is that they drop the barrier to publishing something online to almost nothing.

  <p>Just over <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/">a year ago</a> I started tracking TILs, inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">Josh Branchaud's collection</a>. I've since published <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">148 TILs</a> across 43 different topics. It's a great format!</p>
<p>TIL stands for Today I Learned. The thing I like most about TILs is that they drop the barrier to publishing something online to almost nothing.</p>
<p>If I'm writing a blog entry, I feel like it needs to say something new. This pressure for originality leads to vast numbers of incomplete, draft posts and a sporadic publishing schedule that trends towards not publishing anything at all.</p>
<p>(Establishing a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">weeknotes habit</a> has helped enormously here too.)</p>
<p>The bar for a TIL is literally "did I just learn something?" - they effectively act as a public notebook.</p>
<p>They also reflect my values as a software engineer. The thing I love most about this career is that the opportunities to learn new things never reduce - there will always be new sub-disciplines to explore, and I aspire to learn something new every single working day.</p>
<p>My hope is that by publishing a constant stream of TILs I can reinforce the idea that even if you've been working in this industry for twenty years there will always be new things to learn, and learning any new trick - even the most basic thing - should be celebrated.</p>

<p>Ratings have always been good, putting it in the top few. See <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb283">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has also <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb556">done okay</a> in San Luis Obispo, for similar reasons.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, those are markets #91 and #171. Similar in a coastal California kind of way.</p>
<p>The station is also a throwback, with its commitment to being the institution it is, with real personalities who actually live there, aren’t leaving, and having a sense of humor about all of it. Also love. And listener participation. None of that is a formula.</p>

<p>With respect to DJ personalities, there are at least two that, in my fantasy of owning that station, would be gone before the ink was dry. (You might even have an idea of whom). Paradoxically, that’s probably part of what makes KPIG work.</p>
<p>It’s really the cross-country market appeal of the ‘Americana’ music format that is my question.</p></blockquote>
<p>My <a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-the-KPIG-radio-format-of-Americana-Folk-Blugrass-Delta-to-modern-Blues-Blues-rock-trad-modern-C-W-country-Southern-Rock-jam-bands-singer-songwriters-some-jazz-big-band-jazz-singers-sell-across-markets-in/answer/Doc-Searls?comment_id=197415134&amp;comment_type=2">response</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a local thing. KPIG (and KFAT and KHIP before it) is a deeply rooted local institution. It’s not a formula, and without standing one up in some other region like it, and funding it long enough to see if it catches on, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p>All of radio is in decline now, as talk listening moves to podcasts and music listening moves to streaming. The idea that a city or a region needs things called “stations,” all with limited geographical coverage, and with live talent performing, and an obligation to stay on the “air” 24/7, designed to work through things called “radios,” which are no longer sold in stores and persist as secondary functions on car dashboards, is an anachronism at a time when damn near everything (including chat, telephony, video, photography, gaming, fitness tracking and you-name-it) is moving onto phones—which are the most persistently personal things people carry everywhere.</p>
<p>There are truly great alternative stations, however, that thrive in their markets: KESP in Seattle and WWOZ in New Orleans are two great examples. That KPIG manages to persist as a commercial station is especially remarkable in a time when people would rather hit a 30-second skip-forward button on their phone app than listen to an ad.</p>
<p>So I guess my answer is no. But if you want Americana, there are lots of stations that play or approximate it on the Internet. And all of them can be received on your phone or your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was a bit tough to write, because yesterday I was poised to enjoy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ron.phillips.376">Ron Phillips</a>‘ long-standing Saturday morning show on WWOZ when I <a href="https://www.wwoz.org/blog/646591">learned he had died</a> suddenly of a heart attack. Ron has been a great friend since the 1970s, when he was a mainstay at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WQDR19721984">WQDR</a> in Raleigh, and I was a partner in its ad agency (while still <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2017/04/26/where-the-nickname-came-from/">being a funny guy</a> at cross-market non-rival <a href="https://jeff560.tripod.com/wdbs.html">WDBS</a>), and I had planned to give him a call after his show, to see how he was doing. (He’d had carpal tunnel surgery recently.)</p>
<p>Though WWOZ is alive and thriving, and there persist many radio stations that are vital institutions in their towns and regions, radio on the whole has been in decline. See <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-media-consumption-has-changed-in-2021/">here</a>:</p>
 <p>Via&nbsp;<a href="http://VisualCapitalist.com" title="http://VisualCapitalist. ">VisualCapitalist.com</a></p> 
<p>The slopes there are long, and a case can be made, on that low angle alone, that radio will persist forever, along with magazines and TV. But it’s clear that our media usage is moving, overall, to the Internet, where mobile devices are especially good at doing what radio, TV and magazines also do—and in some ways doing it better.</p>
<p>But back to William Moser’s question.</p>
<p>There are already many ways to stream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)">Americana (aka American roots music)</a> on the Internet, whether from stations, streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, or a channel or two on SiriusXM. But those are largely personality-free.</p>
<p>What KPIG has (once described to me as “mutant cowboy rock &amp; roll”) isn’t a format. It’s an institution, like a favorite old tavern, music club, outdoor festival, or coffee shop—or all of those rolled into one. Can one replicate that with an Internet station, or a channel on some global service?</p>
<p>I think not, because those services are all global. You need to start with local roots. WWOZ has that, because it started as a&nbsp;radio station in New Orleans, a place that is itself deeply rooted. After years of living all over the place, Ron moved to New Orleans to be with those roots, and near its greatest radio voice.</p>
<p>Radio is geographical. All the stations I mentioned above, living and dead, are not the biggest ones in their towns. KPIG’s signal is almost notoriously minimal. So is KEXP’s in Seattle. They are local in the most basic sense.</p>
<p>I suppose that condition will persist for another decade or two. But it’s hard to say. Mobile devices are also evolving quickly, getting old within just a few years.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’ll miss it much, the succession of generations being what it is. But we are losing something. And you can still hear it on KPIG.</p>

<p>This is my monthly roundup of the media I consumed and found interesting. Here's my list for April, 2021.</p> Books <p><a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/collection/67918/captain_america_vol_1_winter_in_america_trade_paperback">Captain America Vol. 1: Winter In America, by Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>. To be honest, I was expecting more. Ta-Nehisi Coates is such a brilliant writer, but this volume felt minimalist to the point of being abstracted away from the drama. It does set up the story for a little more, but not enough more. Still, it felt good to read a comic book again - it’s been quite a while.</p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/suite-for-barbara-loden/9780997366600">Suite for Barbara Loden, by Nathalie Léger, translated by Natasha Lehrer and Cécile Menon</a>. I read it in one sitting, mesmerized by the writing and the articulation of a recognizable kind of sadness. This is the kind of book I would write if I was brave enough: almost certainly not as skillfully, but with an intention to gather the dark corners of solitude and weaving it into poetry. The translation is superb; I wish I could read it in its original French.</p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/shuggie-bain-a-novel-booker-prize-winner-9780802148506/9780802148506">Shuggie Bain, by Douglas Stuart</a>. Immersive and real. I could smell Glasgow in every page. The desperation of these well-rounded characters trying to survive through post-industrial poverty, and the moments of human beauty despite it all, ring true. The writing is excellent; the heart at the center of it all beats strong.</p> Streaming <p><a href="https://www.searchlightpictures.com/nomadland/">Nomadland</a>. Naturalistic to the point that fiction and reality are blurred. Frances McDormand gives an impressive performance as always, but what really stands out are the real-life characters drawn into the story. Their lives are written across their faces; tragic but defiant.</p><p><a href="https://www.sonyclassics.com/film/thefather">The Father</a>. Anchored by kaleidoscopic writing and nuanced performances, we see one man’s dementia play out from all sides. The set is a character in itself, reflecting slips of memory and a rapidly unraveling relationship with time. Watching it from the context of my own parents’ - albeit very different - failing health was tough. One of those films where quiet recognition leaves you cathartically weeping alone in the dark.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81399614">The Mitchells vs. The Machines</a>. I guffawed. A lot. Packed full of in-jokes, this has everything you’d expect from the people who made Into the Spider-Verse and The LEGO Movie.

And why did delivery marketplaces across the U.S., and countries around the world, suddenly seem to be flooded with them?”</p><p><a href="https://om.co/2021/04/01/the-wrong-kind-of-splash/">The Wrong Kind of Splash</a>. Om on Unsplash: “I was a fan up until last evening when I got an email announcing that the company was being acquired by none other than Getty Images. Hearing this was like a red hot spike through the eyes. A startup whose raison d’être was to upend draconian and amoral companies like Getty Images was going to now be part of Getty. Even after I have had time to process it, the news isn’t sitting well with me.”</p><p><a href="https://obviousstartupadvice.com/2021/04/06/let-your-employees-ask-questions/">Let Your Employees Ask Questions</a>. “But you also have to recognize that as a founder, you’re empowered to fuck things up. If you spend three months chasing a market that turns outs to be a dead end, nobody is going to fire you. You own the place. If someone does that at a large company, they’re maybe getting fired. And your employees will bring that reticence to your startup. So, early on, plan on providing feedback and answering a lot of questions about how you want things to get done.”</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2021/04/07/investing-in-firefly-health/">Investing in Firefly Health</a>. This announcement caught my attention for this: “Health insurance is undergoing a rapid cycle of unbundling and repackaging. Vertically-integrated “payviders” (groups that both pay for services, like an insurer would, and administer those services, like a provider would) are emerging as a new standard, and provider networks are being recontoured as virtual-first care models take root.” I have some thoughts on what the ultimate “payvider” would be - but I wonder if these sorts of services will help get America more comfortable with the idea of a real healthcare system.</p><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/">How Index Funds May Hurt the Economy</a>. "In recent decades, the whole economy has gone on autopilot. Index-fund investment is hyperconcentrated. So is online retail. So are pharmaceuticals. So is broadband.

That has led to all sorts of deleterious downstream effects: suppressing workers’ wages, raising consumer prices, stifling innovation, stoking inequality, and suffocating business creation. The problem is not just the indexers. It is the public markets they reflect, where more chaos, more speculation, more risk, more innovation, and more competition are desperately needed."</p><p><a href="https://www.revolt.tv/news/2021/4/8/22373418/sean-diddy-combs-general-motors-corporate-america-letter">If You Love Us, Pay Us: A letter from Sean Combs to Corporate America</a>. "Corporations like General Motors have exploited our culture, undermined our power, and excluded Black entrepreneurs from participating in the value created by Black consumers. In 2019, brands spent $239 billion on advertising. Less than 1% of that was invested in Black-owned media companies. Out of the roughly $3 billion General Motors spent on advertising, we estimate only $10 million was invested in Black-owned media. Only $10 million out of $3 billion! Like the rest of Corporate America, General Motors is telling us to sit down, shut up and be happy with what we get."</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/09/technology/amazon-defeats-union.html">Amazon Workers Defeat Union Effort in Alabama</a>.

In the last few months, several governments, including Canada, the E.U., Ireland, and even Japan—which invented the word karoshi, for death by overwork—announced they’re considering “right to disconnect” laws.

"The best empathetic leaders are frequently grounded in authentic emotional connectivity with those on their team and beyond.

     <br><p>I know the journey is more important than the destination, but destinations provide an essential point as they mark somewhere to head towards.&nbsp; All journeys start with a single step, and for me, this journey started a little over three years ago. I have spent this past period considering the question, “How do we make Better Decisions.” This question was refined to become “How do we make Better Decisions with data.” This expanded into “How do we make Better Decisions with data and be better ancestors?”&nbsp; My journey can finally see a destination.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I am now facing a more significant challenge.</p><p>Having reached the destination zone, I want to leave a mark, and it's straightforward to imagine planting a flag. The hope is that when the flag is planted some of the team back at home can see that you've reached the final place.&nbsp; In most circumstances, the destination is not in the Line-of-Sight. Therefore you pick up the flag and wave it, hoping that somebody with binoculars can see you waving your destination flag. If someone sees you, they relay it to the others that the advance party or pioneers (risk-takers and general nutters) have reached the destination. In innovation and invention land, you're tempted to stay at the destination, hoping that the others will follow you to the same place. Waiting there means you eventually run out of resources, this being cash or budget. Having run out of resources, you're faced with the reality you have to head back to where everyone else is as nobody is going to follow you to the destination; it is too risky.&nbsp; On arriving back at home, there's a bit of a party and a celebration. You relay your stories about the journey and how wonderful the destination is. &nbsp; After a few hours of partying, everybody heads back to their homes, leaving you wondering how to persuade others to go to the destination as well.</p><p>There are a series of videos on YouTube of a single dancer who starts to dance to music, and over periods of 5-minutes to several hours, the dancing crowd grows until everybody is dancing. Early adopters and supporters join the pioneer, and eventually, they are joined by the followers who make the crowd. (2021 #covid19 note, what is a crowd and what is a party?)</p><p>The next day after your return, everybody gets up and goes around their jobs and business as usual.&nbsp; What is now needed is to convert the excitement of the destination into a language and story that the first supporters and early adopters can relate to and join in. What is tremendously difficult is constructing a straightforward linear narrative and step actions, meaning the crowd can also join in and desire to get to a new destination. (crossing the chasm)&nbsp; For businesses right now, this is the digital transformation, data, circular economy, ESG, climate change, AI, ethics and sustainability.&nbsp; The pioneers have been to the destination, planted the flags, imagined the better fruits, but we have to drop the complexity of the issues and find a better story for us all to get there.</p><p>The journey I have been on for the last few years is understanding how we make better decisions.&nbsp; This means I have had to unpack numerous topics and dependencies deep in the messiness of models and complexity. Unsurprisingly there are only a few who are also motivated about understanding the complexity and philiosphy of better decisions, it is my burden. We are converting what we have found at the destination (how to make better decisions with data and be better ancestors) into a language that fellow supporters and early adopters can engage with and discuss.&nbsp;</p><p>BUT</p><p>I am now desperate for expert support to convert the ideas into straightforward narrative and actions that the crowd in the town can take on board and start their journey, but knowing where they are going has been discovered. My struggle is that I find it hard to dumb down the complex into a tweet as it cannot possibly embrace the complexity. I continually flight myself as I can see the simple is not truly representative. The PhD virologist of 30 years is given 1 minute to explain virus mutation on the news.&nbsp; The simple becomes fodder to the vocal and easily upset in social media land as it is easily misunderstood and taken out of context. I spend more time trying to justify (to myself) why I am using simple concepts to explain complex ideas.</p><p></p><p>Tribe, I need some help.&nbsp; Is there anybody out there (a nod to Pink Floyd) who is willing to spend the time in a small community helping to refine the words, language, stories, ideas and concepts into a straightforward linear narrative that portrays actions and activities, which means we can all take steps on a journey to making Better Decisions? This is not a job it is a vocation. Journeys are so much more fun when we do them together, and the next part of the journey is to do it all together. I'm looking for early adopter and supporters who can share their destinations so that together we can create a better narrative about decision making, governance and oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you willing and able to help form and write a narrative to enable others to come on our journey?</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>In commercial land, the axis of power has tended to rest with the CEO/ CFO relationship. &nbsp; There is always a myriad of other political triangles that lobby and wrestle for power and sway decisions.&nbsp; Given that decisions are increasingly reliant on evidence which is data, the CDO gets dragged into everyone's battles, which are not always in the best interest of the business, customer, ecosystem or society - such are incentive scheme.</p><p>Everyone else in the senior team does not want to recognise is that the data they use as evidence and proof is equally supportive or detrimental to everyone else's cause.&nbsp; Whilst everyone else on the leadership team gets to pick and bias what they foreground and promote, the CDO has to keep their mind open and judge all data with the same level of critical thinking.&nbsp; This tends to mean the CDO becomes the punch bag when data either supports or otherwise a decision, which in reality is a political lobby for power which the data may not fully support. However, we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that even the most highly skilled data scientists, who were incentivised to come to the most accurate results, can create a broad range of conclusions, even when given the same data and hypothesis.&nbsp; This means that senior leadership teams don’t know if the data they have and the conclusion they have reached is correct.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent and significant published <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/cd5j9/">paper</a> gave 73 teams the same data and research question. The answers varied widely, and very little variation was easily explained. What the paper goes on to say is that competencies and potential confirmation biases do not explain the broad variation in outcomes.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>The paper concludes that if any given study had been conducted by a different (set of) researcher(s), perhaps even the same researchers at a different time, its results may well have varied for reasons that cannot be reduced to easily observable analytical choices or biases.&nbsp; They conclude that steps in the research process remain undisclosed in the standard presentation and consumption of scientific results and have exposed a “hidden universe” of idiosyncratic research and researcher variability. An important takeaway here is that the reality of researcher decisions cannot easily be simulated.</p><p>Therefore, there are at least two forces at play in data leading to a recommendation or decision.&nbsp; One, the bias and foregrounding of data outcomes by a member of the leadership team is for a reason. Two. the same data, same tools, the same team can generate more than one recommendation.&nbsp; How to determine what is at play is a modern-day skill the CDO must-have.&nbsp;</p><p>As the CDO, you have to gain the trust of all your senior team and work with them to determine what is incentive biased, desired outcome-driven, seeking support or driven from the data set where there is naturally more than one possible conclusion.&nbsp; In doing this, you have to be capable of assessing the alignment or divergence from others in the team who have come to different conclusions. &nbsp; This becomes more complex if the data set is public, purchased, or gathered from the ecosystem with partners, as others outside of the organisation can create different conclusions. You have to be prepared to justify your reason, rationale and processes. &nbsp; The skill you need to demonstrate is one of consistency in finding a route to align any data conclusions to the company's purpose and agreed strategic goals and not to the forces of lobby. Leave those calls to the CEO knowing the CEO has your back or get out, as being the new corporate punch bag is not fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>Each leadership team member is playing their own game and is looking to the CDO to find and support data for their cause, lobby, decision or budget.&nbsp; This means that the CDO becomes the corporate punch bag and police, taking over from HR. The CDO has to navigate the path of varying conclusions and desired outcomes from the same data set, which are in conflict as they meet individuals agendas. &nbsp; As the CEO, you have to be aware of this and the game your CFO will play.&nbsp; The power axis itself of the CEO/ CFO relationship comes under stress as the CDO can give you more insights into decisions “presented because of incentives and self-interest” than anyone else, but HR will still want to own it.&nbsp; If you alienate the CDO, you will lose that linkage, which is exactly what others want.&nbsp; However, first, check that the CDO has this trust of the team and that your CDO has the capability and capacity to manage this modern-day leadership challenge.&nbsp; If not, it might be time to upgrade your CDO with new skills or find a new version.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p>Today marks an important milestone in the life of the OpenID Foundation and the worldwide digital identity community.  Following <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/19/resolution-thanking-don-thibeau-for-his-service/">Don Thibeau’s decade of exemplary service to the OpenID Foundation as its Executive Director</a>, today we <a href="https://openid.net/2021/04/28/welcoming-gail-hodges-as-our-new-executive-director/">welcomed Gail Hodges as our new Executive Director</a>.</p>
<p>Don was instrumental in the creation of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a> program, the <a href="https://fapi.openid.net/">Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>, and its ongoing worldwide adoption.  He’s created and nurtured numerous liaison relationships with organizations and initiatives advancing digital identity and user empowerment worldwide.  And thankfully, Don intends to stay active in digital identity and the OpenID Foundation, including supporting Gail in her new role.</p>
<p>Gail’s <a href="https://twitter.com/gailhodges">Twitter</a> motto is “Reinventing identity as a public good”, which I believe will be indicative of the directions in which she’ll help lead the OpenID Foundation.  She has extensive leadership experience in both digital identity and international finance, as described in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-hodges-26b1b9/">LinkedIn profile</a>.  The board is thrilled to have her on board and looks forward to what we’ll accomplish together in this next exciting chapter of the OpenID Foundation!</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to come meet Gail at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openid-foundation-virtual-workshop-tickets-143831524963">OpenID Foundation Workshop tomorrow</a>, where she’ll introduce herself to the OpenID community.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Why are some decentralized systems accepted and widely used while others wither? Why do some âhard forksâ succeed while others fail? It all comes down to legitimacy.</p>





<p>
    As an undergraduate engineering major, I recall being surprised by the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem">three body problem</a>. In Newtonian mechanics, there are nice closed-form solutions to problems involving the motion of two interacting bodies, given their initial position and velocity. This isnât true of systems with three or more points. How can adding just one more point to the system make it unsolvable?
</p>
<p>
    N-body systems are chaotic for most initial conditions and their solution involves numerical methods—simulation—rather than nice, undergraduate-level math. In other words, itâs messy. Humans like simple solutions.
</p>

<p>
    Like the n-body problem, decentralized systems are chaotic and messy. Humans arenât good at reasoning about emergent behavior from the coordinated, yet autonomous, behavior of interacting agents. We build bureaucracies and enact laws to try to make chaotic systems legible. The internet was our first, large-scale technical system where decentralization and governance clashed. I remember people in the 90âs asking âWhoâs in charge of the internet?â
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a>, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, discusses why legitimacy is crucial for the success of any decentralized endeavor. He says:
</p>
<blockquote>[T]he Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems are capable of summoning up billions of dollars of capital, but have strange and hard-to-understand restrictions on where that capital can go.
     From <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a><br>Referenced 2021-04-26T14:46:43-0600
     </blockquote>
<p>
    These âstrange and hard to understand restrictionsâ are rooted in legitimacy. Decentralized systems must be considered legitimate in order to thrive. That legitimacy is tied to how well the systems and people enabling them, like programmers and miners, are seen to be following âthe rulesâ both written and unwritten. Legitimacy isnât a technical issue, but a social one.
</p>

<p>
    Wikipedia defines legitimacy as
</p>
<blockquote>
    the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.
</blockquote>
<p>
    While this is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that have large impacts on people and society.
</p>

<p>
    With respect to legitimacy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009W6VK70/windleyofente-20">Philip Bobbit</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The defining characteristic â¦ of a constitutional order is its basis for legitimacy. The constitutional order of the industrial nation state, within which we currently live, promised: give us power and we will improve the material well-being of the nation.
</blockquote>

<p>
    In other words, legitimacy comes from the constitutional order: the structure of the governance and its explicit and implicit promises. People grant legitimacy to constitutional orders that meet their expectations by surrendering part of their sovereignty to them. In the quote from Vilaik above, the "strange and hard to understand restrictions" are promises that members of the Bitcoin or Ethreum ecosystems believe those constitutional orders have made. And if they're broken, the legitimacy of those system is threatened. 
</p>
<p>
    Talking about âlegitimacyâ and âconstitutional ordersâ for decentralized systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or your favorite NFT might feel strange, but I believe these are critical tools for understanding why some thrive and others wither. Or why some hard forks succeed and others don't. 
</p>

<p>
    In Bobbittâs theory of constitutional orders, transitions from one constitutional order to a new one always requires war. While people seeking legitimacy for one decentralized system or another might not use tanks or missiles, a hard fork is essentially just that—a war fought to cause the transition from one constitutional order to another because of a question of legitimacy. For example, Vitalik describes how the Steem community did a hard fork to create Hive, leaving Steemâs founder (and his tokens) behind because the constitutional order he represented lost its legitimacy because people believed it could no longer keep its promises. 
</p>
<p>
    So when you hear someone talking about a decentralized system and starting sentences with phrases like âSomebody shouldâ¦â or âWhy do we let themâ¦â or âWhoâs in charge ofâ¦â, beware. Unlike most of the easy to understand systems weâre familiar with, decentralized systems are heterarchical, not hierarchical. Thus the means of their control is political, not authoritarian. These systems are not allowed to exist—they're called "permissionless" for a reason. They simply are, by virtue of their legitimacy in the eyes of people who use and support them.
</p>

<p>
    This doesnât mean decentralized systems are unassailable, but changing them is slower and less sure than most people would like. When you âknowâ the right way to do something, you want a boss who can dictate the change. Changing decentralized systems is a political process that sometimes requires war. As Clausewitz said âWar is the continuation of politics by other means.â
</p>

<p>
    There are no closed-form solutions to the n-body problems represented by decentralized systems. They are messy and chaotic. Iâm not sure people will ever get more comfortable with decentralization or understand it well enough to reason about it carefully. But one thing is for sure: decentralized systems donât care. They simply are.

 Yesterday, Jason Fried, Basecamp’s CEO, shared an internal memo he’d written about changes at the company.

<p>Yesterday, Jason Fried, Basecamp’s CEO, shared <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">an internal memo he’d written about changes at the company</a>. In it, he details how political discussions are no longer acceptable at work, and how benefits he considers to be “paternalistic” - like gym memberships and farmer’s market shares - are being removed.</p><p>It’s weird to me that this is coming from a company that literally wrote the book on culture. I’ve always thought of Basecamp (and its predecessor, 37 Signals) as being the yardstick for how to run a great company. This blog post completely blew that out of the water.</p><p>Conor Muirhead, a designer at Basecamp, later noted that <a href="https://twitter.com/conormuirhead/status/1386890596749512714">political discussion was limited to two opt-in spaces</a>: a space called “Civil Solace”, and a recently-formed DEI council. He notes that it was rare for these discussions to spill out of those spaces, although they did when, for example, “folks shared thoughts on how mocking people’s non-anglo names is a stepping stone towards racism”.</p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/LeeFlower/status/1386750697312509957">Annalee Flower Horne rightly pointed out</a>, “here's a thing about banning political discussions from a space because they're divisive: that does not resolve the division. It just says if you feel marginalized or unsafe here, keep it to yourself, we don't want to hear it.” Indeed, the predominantly white, male discourse - the one that is still dominant - is not usually considered to be “political”, while equity for marginalized people usually is. The effect is to further marginalize people of color in particular.</p><p>Regarding “paternalistic benefits”, <a href="https://avc.com/2021/04/paternalism-in-the-office/">Fred Wilson points out that</a> “If you care about the mental and physical well-being of your team, I believe it makes sense to support them by investing in that. Companies can do that tax efficiently and employees cannot. Paying employees more so that they can then make these investments personally sounds rational but I don’t believe it will be as effective as company-funded programs that employees can opt into or not.” Because these benefits enjoy a special tax status, removing them disproportionately affects lower paid workers.</p><p>Something must have happened behind the scenes at Basecamp to force this change. The smart money’s on management becoming uncomfortable with changes requested, and power gathered, by the DEI council. But if you don’t want to make those changes, why have the council to begin with, except as a superficial gesture?</p><p>Basecamp was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-26/basecamp-follows-coinbase-in-banning-politics-talk-at-work">emboldened by Coinbase</a>, which <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">previously enacted a similar policy</a>. It’s a regressive trend that more tech companies, led by men who are already predisposed to this narrower worldview, are likely to follow. This is particularly true in the post-Trump era, when the stakes (from a privileged perspective) seem lower.</p><p>For many of them, it’s an intentional roll back of the clock. Code2040 CEO Emeritus <a href="https://twitter.com/karlitaliliana/status/1386906668630380553">Karla Monterroso shared that</a> “I will never forget a Latinx VP at a big tech company telling me that one of their VC’s (big name) told him at a board meeting that they had become an inhospitable place for white men and they needed to fix that.”</p><p>The solution, for now, is to call it out, and for those of us with privilege to pledge never to work for (or start) an organization with these policies. Diversity and inclusion is more important than ever. And leaders who care about the culture of their companies should once again take note of the Basecamp team: this time as a lesson in what not to do.</p>

<p>NOTE: This article supersedes an older version of this article: </p>



  <a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/04/21/the-verifiable-economy-architecture-reference-model-ve-arm/">The Verifiable Economy: Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) 0.1: Original Concepts&nbsp;[OLD]</a>  



 1. Introduction 



 1.1 Goals 



<p>The goals of this article are three-fold:</p>



  Introduce the concept of a Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCA) and how they can be use to implement controls over which specific methods a particular party is allowed execute against a particular instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO).  Illustrate how <a>#graphitization techniques</a> can be used for visualizing:  Trusted Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  DID Documents  Trusted Digital Agents (and their Service Endpoints (SEPs))  Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) and,   Most importantly, their myriad of interrelationships.    Use the above 2 goals to further detail and describe how to use the VE-ARM model for implementing trusted, reliable, efficient, frictionless, standards-based, global-scale software systems based on Fully Decentralized Objects (FDOs).  



 1.2 Purpose 



<p>This article takes the following “All-in” graph view of The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) and partitions it into a series of subgraphs that depict the key elements of the overall architecture reference model for FDOs. Each subgraph is documented with a narrative that is mapped to the numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/ve2-f0.png"></a>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve1-0.3-legend.png"></a>Figure 1. The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM)



<p>The above visualization is the result of a several iterations validating The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) against the following live scenario:</p>



<blockquote><p>Erin acquiring a personal DID and DID Document to enable Erin to acquire a Province of Sovronia Driver’s License (SDL) (represented as an FDO) and hold the SDL in Erin’s digital wallet.</p><a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/29/tdw-glossary-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-user-scenarios-erin-buys-a-car-in-sovronia-3-user-scenarios/">T</a><a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/29/tdw-glossary-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-user-scenarios-erin-buys-a-car-in-sovronia-3-user-scenarios/">DW Glossary: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) User Scenarios: Erin Buys a Car in Sovronia (3 User&nbsp;Scenarios)</a></blockquote>



<p>An Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) is comprised of the following minimal elements:</p>



  DID (and correspond DID Document)  Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) for the object’s DID and DID Document  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above MVCA for the object (recursively)  A Property Set for the object  Property Set DID (and corresponding DID Document)  Property Set MVCA for the property set’s DID and DID Document  Property Set Verifiable Credential (VC) to hold the object’s properties and their values  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above property set MVCA (recursively)    A Trusted Digital Agent registered with a Service Endpoint (SEP) in the object’s DID Document that implements the VCA controlled methods for accessing and interacting with the object and/or it’s property set. Control over which methods are invokable by a party is controlled by the respective MVCAs and a Delegated Directed Graphs of VCAs (if there are any).  



<p>The goal and purpose of the VE-ARM is to describe a Fully-Decentralized Object (FDO) model that unites the following concepts into a single integrated, operational model:</p>



  Verifiable Identifiers, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and DID Documents;  Verifiable Claims, Relationships, and Verifiable Credentials (VCs);   Verifiable Capability Proclamations, Verifiable Capability Invocations, and Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs); and  Trusted Digital Agents (TDAs)  



 1.3 Background 



<p>The scenario used to model the VE-ARM is an example of a citizen (Erin) of a fictional Canadian province called Sovronia holding a valid physical Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL) as well as a digital, verifiable Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin SDL).</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/drivers-license-erin-amanda-lee-anderson-larged.png"></a> Figure 2. Erin’s Real-World Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL) 



 1.4 Creation of the Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM)  



<p>The underlying model was built automatically using a series of <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Cypher queries running against a collection of actual DID Document, Verifiable Credential, and Verifiable Capability Authorization JSON files. The visualization was laid out using the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Browser. The resulting layout was manually optimized to produce the final version of the visualization that appears below. The numbered targets were added using Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>



 2. Organization of this Article 



<p>Following a list of Key Definitions, the remainder of this article is organized as a series of increasingly more detailed explanations of the VE-ARM model. </p>



<p>Each subgraph is described by a narrative that explains the purpose of each element in the particular subgraph. Each narrative is organized as a list of numbered bullets that further describe to the corresponding  numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph .</p>



<blockquote><p>A narrative is a story. It recounts a series of events that have taken place. … These essays are telling a story in order to drive a point home. Narration, however, is the act of telling a story. </p><a href="https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-narration.html">Examples of Narration: 3 Main Types in Literature</a></blockquote>

 3. Key Definitions 



<p>Several of the following definitions (those related to verifiable capability authorizations) are inspired by the following RWoT5 article:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/draft-documents/lds-ocap/lds-ocap.md">Linked Data Capabilities</a> by Christopher Lemmer Webber and Mark S. Miller  



<p>Additional context can be found in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data v0.3</a>.</p>



  3.1 VE-ARM Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) Model 



<p>The VE-ARM Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) model used to grant the authority to specific parties to invoke specific methods against a instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). The VE-ARM VCA model is based, in part, on the Object-Capability Model. The VE-ARM VCA model supports Delegation and Attenuation.</p>



 3.2 Object Capability Model 



<blockquote><p>The object-capability model is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination:</p><p>An unforgeable reference (in the sense of object references or protected pointers) that can be sent in messages.<br>A message that specifies the operation to be performed.</p>Object-Capability Model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model</a>)</blockquote>



 3.3 VCA Model Principles Delegation and Attenuation 



<blockquote><p>With delegation, a capability holder can transfer his capability to another entity, whereas with attenuation he can confine a capability before delegating it.</p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11515.pdf">Capability-based access control for multi-tenant systems using OAuth 2.0 and Verifiable Credentials</a></blockquote>



 3.4 Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) 



<p>In The Verifiable Economy, a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) is comprised of the following minimal elements:</p>



  DID (and correspond DID Document)  Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) for the object’s DID and DID Document  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above MVCA for the object (recursively)  A Property Set  Property Set DID (and corresponding DID Document)  Property Set MVCA for the property set’s DID and DID Document  Property Set Verifiable Credential (VC) to hold the object’s properties and their values  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above property set MVCA (recursively)    An Trusted Digital Agent registered with a Service Endpoint (SEP) in the object’s DID Document that implements the VCA controlled methods for accessing and interacting with the object and/or it’s property set. Control over which methods are invokable by a party is controlled by the respective MVCAs and a Delegated Directed Graphs of VCAs (if there are any).  



 3.5 Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) Model 



<p>A complete decentralized object system based on the concept of FDOs.</p>



 3.6 Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) 



<p>A Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) is a JSON-LD structure that grants (or restricts) a specific parts (the controller of a key (grantedKey)) the ability to invoke specific methods against a specific instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). A VCA typically has a type of Proclamation (unless it is a Method Invocation VCA).</p>



<p>Each VCA has:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA  type – “Proclamation”  parent – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for a parent VCA whose control supersedes this current VCA.  The current VCA’s capabilities must be equal to or an attenuation of the parent VCA’s capabilities. The part of the VCA model is recursive.  subject – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier of the specific instance of the FDO.  An FDO can be an object or a service represented as an object.  grantedKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to whom the specified capabilities are being granted specifically with respect to the specific instance of the FDO.  caveat – the collection of specific capabilities the party represented by grantedKey is granted (or restricted) from invoking against a specific instance of the FDO identified by the subject identifier.  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>The following is an example of a VCA associated with Erin and Erin’s Sovronia Driver’s License Property Set.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetvca.png"></a>Snippet 1. Verifiable Credential Authorization (VCA) Example



 3.7 Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) 



<p>A Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) is a Proclamation-type VCA that is created for every FDO at the time that the DID and DID Document for the FDO is issued by a Trusted Decentralized Identity Provider (TDIDP) (e.g. SOVRONIA).</p>



<p>That is, a new MVCA is created whenever a new DID and DID Document are issued by a TDIDP. The MVCA typically grants authorization for any and all methods to the controller of the DID. (This is the essence of the definition of self-sovereign identity principle.)  </p>



<p>Each MVCA has:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA  type – “Proclamation” (or “Invocation”)  subject – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier of the specific instance of the FDO.  An FDO can be an object or a service represented as an object.  grantedKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to whom the specified capabilities are being granted specifically with respect to the specific instance of the FDO.  caveat – the collection of specific capabilities the party represented by grantedKey is granted (or restricted) from invoking against a specific instance of the FDO identified by the subject identifier. Typically, this is set to RestrictToMethod( * ) granting the controller of the grantedKey to execute any and all methods against the subject. (This is where and how the essence of the definition of the self-sovereign identity principle is realized.)  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>NOTE: A MVCA has no parent property because an MVCA always represents the top-level root VCA in a Delegated Directed Graphs of Verifiable Capability Authorizations (see below). </p>



<p>The following is an example of a MVCA for Erin’s Sovronia Drivers License Property Set. This MVCA is the parent of the above VCA.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetmvca.png"></a>Snippet 2. Master Verifiable Credential Authorization (MVCA) Example



 3.8 VCA Method Invocation (MI) 



<p>A VCA Method Invocation (MI) is a JSON-LD structure that attempts to invoke a specific method against a specific instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) on behalf of a specific invoking party. An MI is of type Invocation (not Proclamation).</p>



<p>Each VCA has:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the MI  type – “Invocation”  proclamation – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA to be used for this MI against the specific instance of an FDO by a specific party.  method – specific name of the method to be invoked against the specific instance of an FDO by a specific party.  usingKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to be used to attempt the invocation of the above method against a specific instance of the FDO.  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>NOTE: An MI doesn’t have a subject property. The target object is specified by the subject property of the proclamation VCA.</p>



<p>The following is an example of a MI that attempts to invoke the Present method on behalf of Erin against Erin’s Sovronia Drivers License Property Set. The referenced VCA is the VCA example from above.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetmi.png"></a>Snippet 3. Verifiable Credential Authorization Method Invocation (MI) Example 



 3.9 Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations 



<p>A Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations is a directed list of VCAs that starts with an MVCA as it’s top-level, root VCA. Each VCA in the graph points to the previous VCA in the graph via its parent property. An MI, in turn, refers to a single VCA in the graph via the MI’s proclamation property. The capabilities in effect are those that are specifically listed in the target VCA’s caveat property. While there is no inheritance of capabilities in this model, the capabilities specified by each VCA must be equal or less than (a subset of) the capabilities of the parent VCA (Principles of Delegation and Attenuation).</p>



<p>The above examples of a MVCA, VCA and MI, taken together, form an example of a Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-delegated-chain-of-vcas-2.png"></a>Figure 3. Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations Example



<p>3.8.1 Narrative</p>



<p>17. Erin SDL Prop Set MVCA. Erin SDL Prop Set MVCA is the Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) created for Erin’s SDL Prop Set (DD) at the time that the DID and DID Document were first issued by SOVRONA on behalf of the Province of Sovronia for Erin’s SDL. (A new MVCA is created whenever a new DID and DID Document are issued by a TDIDP. The MVCA grants authorization for any and all methods defined for the subject to the effective issuer. In this case, the effective issuer is the Province of Sovronia.)</p>



<p>18. Erin SDL VCA. Erin SDL VCA is the Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) created for Erin’s SDL Prop Set DD. The VCA was issued by the Province of Sovronia authorizing Erin to be able to present the properties (and their values) of Erin’s SDL to a third party using the Present method associated with Erin’s SDL Prop Set and supported (implemented) by Erin’s AGENT. The parent of Erin’s SDL VCA is the Erin SDL MVCA.</p>



<p>19. Erin SDL VCA MI. Erin SDL VCA MI is an example of a MVCA Method Invocation (VCA MI) that uses the Erin SCL VCA which authorizes the potential execution of the Present method by Erin against Erin’s SDL Prop Set.</p>



 3.10 Resource Servers and Authentication Servers 



<blockquote><p>A resource server that hosts a protected resource owned by a resource owner, a client wishing to access that resource, and an authorization server responsible for generating access tokens. Access tokens are granted to clients authorized by the resource owner: client authorization is proven using an authorization grant. In our system we are using the ‘client credentials’ grant. As it can be seen from Fig. 1, when this type of grant is used, a resource owner configures the authentication server with the credentials of the authorized clients; a client authenticates to the authorization server and receives an access token, then it uses the access token to access the protected resource.</p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11515.pdf">Capability-based access control for multi-tenant systems using OAuth 2.0 and Verifiable Credentials</a></blockquote>



<p>Although these terms are not currently used in the VE-ARM, the resource server role is assigned to the FDO AGENT specified in the subject’s DID document. The authorization server role is assigned to the actor who is responsible for creating Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs). In the current example, SOVORONIA hosts the authorization server on behalf of either the Province of Sovronia or Erin.</p>



 4. VE-ARM Principles 



<p>The following principles are used to guide The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM):</p>



  DD MVCA Principle. Every DID (and DID Document) has a corresponding Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MCVA). Whenever a DID and corresponding DID Document is issued, a corresponding Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MCVA) is automatically created. See F2 in Figure 1. Snippet 4 is an example of a DID Document Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (DD MVCA).  Property Set VC Principle. All of the properties (and their values), a Property Set, for a particular decentralized object are stored in a Verifiable Credential (VC) that has an id value that is equal to the DID id of the decentralized object. See F6 in Figure 6. Snippet 5 is a partial example of a Property Set Verifiable Credential (PS VC).

 12. Conclusions 



<p>The goals of this article are three-fold:</p>



  Introduce the concept of a Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCA) and how they can be use to implement controls over which specific methods a particular party is allowed execute against a particular instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO).  Illustrate how <a>#graphitization techniques</a> can be used for visualizing:  Trusted Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  DID Documents  Trusted Digital Agents (and their Service Endpoints (SEPs))  Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) and,   Most importantly, their myriad of interrelationships.    Use the above 2 goals to further detail and describe how to use the VE-ARM model for implementing trusted, reliable, efficient, frictionless, standards-based, global-scale software systems based on Fully Decentralized Objects (FDOs).  



<p>This article described The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) using a #graphiziation approach for visualization.  The resulting overall graph was partitioned into a series of subgraphs that depict the key elements of the architecture reference model. Each subgraph was documented with a narrative that is mapped to the numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph . </p>

<p>I’ve been lucky to get some productive, actionable criticism on my short stories, both from writing classes I’ve been a part of and journals I’ve submitted to.</p><p>The most common criticism goes something like this: “your line to line writing is solid, but you let the idea become the story”. In other words, rather than letting the story stand on its own feet, I fall into the trap of treating it like a kind of argument with a point I want to drive home.</p><p>I’m pretty sure I’ve developed this habit from 23 years of opinionated blogging: I write regular posts that try and argue for a particular worldview, or a way of doing things. Even if you’re a newcomer, you’ve probably noticed that I talk quite a bit about decentralization, data ownership, and the dangers of centralized data silos as a means to build concentrated wealth. I care about those things, and I’d love for more people to join me.</p><p>It’s served me pretty well as a way to write on my website, but it doesn’t really work for stories. The underlying idea can certainly inform how the story is written - and it should - but the narrative needs to be driven by its characters. Stories are about telling “true lies” that shine a light on some aspect of being human. In genre fiction that will often be accompanied by an exploration of an overt idea, but if, for example, a science fiction story is just about the science and not about how real human characters live and breathe in a world where that science is true, the story will suck.</p><p>It’s a trap and I’m learning to get over it.</p><p>Here’s the thing: I’ve realized that I fall into the exact same trap in my technology work, too. I’m often so wrapped up in an idea I care about - scroll up for a list of some of them - that I let it subsume the most important thing about any technology project. Just as a story needs to be driven by human characters (or proxies for human characters; I’m not arguing against Redwall here), technology products need to be driven by the people who use them. It’s not about your story as a creator; it’s about their story as a user.</p><p>It’s an ego thing, in a way. In both cases, I become so excited by the idea that I let myself become the character: the person expressing the idea, either in prose or code. The trick, the real art of it, is to inform the story with your ideas, but to center the character. Their journey is the all-important thing, and if an idea doesn’t fit with that journey, it doesn’t belong there.</p><p>Like I said: it’s a trap and I’m learning to get over it. And I strongly suspect I’m not alone.</p><p>You serve the reader by telling a human story; you serve the user by serving their story. It’s not about educating them, or forcing them around to your point of view. Whether you’re shining a light on the human condition or making a tool to make a part of it easier, it’s about service. Our goal should be to disappear and let the work speak for itself.</p>

<p>This post shows how an ASP.NET Core Web API and an ASP.NET Core Razor page application can be implemented to use windows authentication. The Razor page application uses Javascript to display an autocomplete control which gets the data indirectly from the service API which is protected using windows authentication. The Razor Page application uses the API to get the auto-complete suggestions data. Both applications are protected using windows authentication.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/PoCWindowsAuth">https://github.com/damienbod/PoCWindowsAuth</a></p>



<p>Setup the API</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core demo API is setup to use windows authentication. The launch settings windowsAuthentication property is set to true and the anonymousAuthentication property to false. The application host file settings on your development PC would also need to be configured to allow windows authentication, which is disabled by default. See the stack overflow link at the bottom for more information.</p>


  {
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": true,
    "anonymousAuthentication": false,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:44364",
      "sslPort": 44364
    }
  },
  


<p>The Startup ConfigureServices method is configured to require authentication using the IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme scheme. This would need to be changed if you were using a different hosting model.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

	services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(option =&gt;
		option.JsonSerializerOptions
              .PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase);
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The API is protected using the authorize attribute. This example returns the user name from the windows authentication.</p>


  [Authorize]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class MyDataController : ControllerBase
{

	private readonly ILogger&lt;MyDataController&gt; _logger;

	public MyDataController(ILogger&lt;MyDataController&gt; logger)
	{
		_logger = logger;
	}

	[HttpGet]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; { User.Identity.Name };
	}
}
  


<p>Implement the ASP.NET Core Razor pages</p>



<p>The application calling the API also requires windows authentication and requests the data from the API project. The HttpClient instance requesting the data from the API project must send the default credentials with each API call. A HttpClientHandler is used to implement this. The HttpClientHandler is added to a named AddHttpClient service  which can be used anywhere in the application.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

	services.AddHttpClient();

	HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler()
	{
		UseDefaultCredentials = true
	};

	services.AddHttpClient("windowsAuthClient", c =&gt;{ })
		.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =&gt; handler);

	services.AddScoped&lt;MyDataClientService&gt;();
	services.AddRazorPages().AddJsonOptions(option =&gt;
		option.JsonSerializerOptions
			.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase);
}
  


<p>A client service is implemented to call the API from the second project. This client uses the IHttpClientFactory to create instances of the HttpClient. The CreateClient method is used to create an instance using the named client which was configured in the Startup class. This instance will send credentials to the API.</p>


  public MyDataClientService(
	IConfiguration configurations,
	IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
{
	_configurations = configurations;
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_jsonSerializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions
	{
		PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
	};
}

public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetMyData()
{
	try
	{
		var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("windowsAuthClient");
		client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configurations["MyApiUrl"]);

		var response = await client.GetAsync("api/MyData");
		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			var data = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
			await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

			return data;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
		throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}, Message: {error}");

	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
		throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
	}
}
  


<p>Javascript UI</p>



<p>If using Javascript to call the API protected with window authentication, this can become a bit tricky due to CORS when using windows authentication. I prefer to avoid this and use a backend to proxy the calls from my trusted backend to the API. The OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest method is used to call the API. The would also make it easy to map DTOs from my API to my view DTOs as required.</p>


   public class IndexModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;IndexModel&gt; _logger;
        private readonly MyDataClientService _myDataClientService;
        public List&lt;string&gt; DataFromApi;
        public string SearchText { get; set; }
        public List&lt;PersonCity&gt; PersonCities;

        public IndexModel(MyDataClientService myDataClientService,
            ILogger&lt;IndexModel&gt; logger)
        {
            _myDataClientService = myDataClientService;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public async Task OnGetAsync()
        {
            DataFromApi = await _myDataClientService.GetMyData();
        }

        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest(string term)
        {
            PersonCities = await _myDataClientService.Suggest(term);
            SearchText = term;

            return new JsonResult(PersonCities);
        }
    }
  


<p>The Razor Page underneath uses an autocomplete implemented in Javascript to suggest data requested from the API. Any Javascript framework can be used in this way.</p>


  @page "{handler?}"
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data from API:&lt;/p&gt;

    @foreach (string item in Model.DataFromApi)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;@item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;fieldset class="form"&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Search for a person in the search engine&lt;/legend&gt;
    &lt;table width="500"&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;
                &lt;input class="form-control" id="autocomplete" type="text" style="width:500px" /&gt;
            &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;div class="card" id="results"&gt;
    &lt;h5 class="card-header"&gt;
        &lt;span id="docName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span id="docFamilyName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docInfo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docCityCountry"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docWeb"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                            console.log(type);
                        }
                    });
                },
                select: function (event, ui) {
                    $("#results").show();

                    $("#docName").text(ui.item.data.name);
                    $("#docFamilyName").text(ui.item.data.familyName);

                    $("#docCityCountry").text(ui.item.data.cityCountry);
                    $("#docWeb").text(ui.item.data.web);
                    console.log(ui.item);
                }
            });
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
}

  


<p>If all is setup correctly, the ASP.NET Core application displays the API data which is protected using the windows authentication.</p>







<p>CRSF</p>



<p>If using windows authentication, you need to protect against CSRF forgery like any application using cookies. It is also recommended NOT to use windows authentication in the public domain. Modern security architectures should be used like Open ID Connect whenever possible. This works well on intranets or for making changes to existing applications which use windows authentication in secure networks.</p>

  <p>On Friday <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> grew in scope, a lot: we launched a new website called <a href="https://www.vaccinatethestates.com/">Vaccinate The States</a>. Patrick McKenzie wrote <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2021/04/23/vaccinate-the-states/">more about the project here</a> - the short version is that we're building the most comprehensive possible dataset of vaccine availability in the USA, using a combination of data collation, online research and continuing to make a huge number of phone calls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VIAL, the Django application I've been working on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/vaccinateca/">since late February</a>, had to go through some extensive upgrades to help support this effort!</p>
<p>VIAL has a number of responsibilities. It acts as our central point of truth for the vaccination locations that we are tracking, powers the app used by our callers to serve up locations to call and record the results, and as-of this week it's also a central point for our efforts to combine data from multiple other providers and scrapers.</p>
<p>The data ingestion work is happening in a public repository, <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vaccine-feed-ingest">CAVaccineInventory/vaccine-feed-ingest</a>. I have yet to write a single line of code there (and I thoroughly enjoy working on that kind of code) because I've been heads down working on VIAL itself to ensure it can support the ingestion efforts.</p>
 Matching and concordances 
<p>If you're combining data about vaccination locations from a range of different sources, one of the biggest challenges is de-duplicating the data: it's important the same location doesn't show up multiple times (potentially with slightly differing details) due to appearing in multiple sources.</p>
<p>Our first step towards handling this involved the addition of "concordance identifiers" to VIAL.</p>
<p>I first encountered the term "concordance" being used for this <a href="https://whosonfirst.org/docs/concordances/">in the Who's On First project</a>, which is building a gazetteer of every city/state/country/county/etc on earth.</p>
<p>A concordance is an identifier in another system. Our location ID for RITE AID PHARMACY 05976 in Santa Clara is <code>receu5biMhfN8wH7P</code> - which is <code>e3dfcda1-093f-479a-8bbb-14b80000184c</code> in <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/">VaccineFinder</a> and <code>7537904</code> in <a href="https://www.vaccinespotter.org/">Vaccine Spotter</a> and <code>ChIJZaiURRPKj4ARz5nAXcWosUs</code> in Google Places.</p>
<p>We're storing them in a Django table called <code>ConcordanceIdentifier</code>: each record has an <code>authority</code> (e.g. <code>vaccinespotter_org</code>) and an identifier (<code>7537904</code>) and a many-to-many relationship to our <code>Location</code> model.</p>
<p>Why many-to-many? Surely we only want a single location for any one of these identifiers?</p>
<p>Exactly! That's why it's many-to-many: because if we import the same location twice, then assign concordance identifiers to it, we can instantly spot that it's a duplicate and needs to be merged.</p>
 Raw data from scrapers 
<p><code>ConcordanceIdentifier</code> also has a many-to-many relationship with a new table, called <code>SourceLocation</code>. This table is essentially a PostgreSQL JSON column with a few other columns (including <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code>) into which our scrapers and ingesters can dump raw data. This means we can use PostgreSQL queries to perform all kinds of analysis on the unprocessed data before it gets cleaned up, de-duplicated and loaded into our point-of-truth <code>Location</code> table.</p>
 How to dedupe and match locations? 
<p>Initially I thought we would do the deduping and matching inside of VIAL itself, using the raw data that had been ingested into the <code>SourceLocation</code> table.</p>
<p>Since we were on a tight internal deadline it proved more practical for people to start experimenting with matching code outside of VIAL. But that meant they needed the raw data - 40,000+ location records (and growing rapidly).</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I built a CSV export feature for the VIAL admin screens, using Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.StreamingHttpResponse">StreamingHttpResponse</a> class combined with keyset pagination for bulk export without sucking the entire table into web server memory - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/django/export-csv-from-django-admin">details in this TIL</a>.</p>
<p>Our data ingestion team wanted a GeoJSON export - specifically newline-delimited GeoJSON - which they could then load into <a href="https://geopandas.org/">GeoPandas</a> to help run matching operations.</p>
<p>So I built a simple "search API" which defaults to returning 20 results at a time, but also has an option to "give me everything" - using the same technique I used for the CSV export: keyset pagination combined with a <code>StreamingHttpResponse</code>.</p>
<p>And it worked! It turns out that if you're running on modern infrastructure (Cloud Run and Cloud SQL in our case) in 2021 getting Django to return 50+MB of JSON in a streaming response works just fine.</p>
<p>Some of these exports are taking 20+ seconds, but for a small audience of trusted clients that's completely fine.</p>
<p>While working on this I realized that my idea of what size of data is appropriate for a dynamic web application to return more or less formed back in 2005. I still think it's rude to serve multiple MBs of JavaScript up to an inexpensive mobile phone on an expensive connection, but for server-to-server or server-to-automation-script situations serving up 50+ MB of JSON in one go turns out to be a perfectly cromulent way of doing things.</p>
 Export full results from django-sql-dashboard 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard">django-sql-dashboard</a> is my Datasette-inspired library for adding read-only arbitrary SQL queries to any Django+PostgreSQL application.</p>
<p>I built the first version <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/14/weeknotes/">last month</a> to help compensate for switching VaccinateCA away from Airtable - one of the many benefits of Airtable is that it allows all kinds of arbitrary reporting, and Datasette has shown me that bookmarkable SQL queries can provide a huge amount of that value with very little written code, especially within organizations where SQL is already widely understood.</p>
<p>While it allows people to run any SQL they like (against a read-only PostgreSQL connection with a time limit) it restricts viewing to the first 1,000 records to be returned - because building robust, performante pagination against arbitrary SQL queries is a hard problem to solve.</p>
<p>Today I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/releases/tag/0.10a0">django-sql-dashboard 0.10a0</a> with the ability to export all results for a query as a downloadable CSV or TSV file, using the same <code>StreamingHttpResponse</code> technique as my Django admin CSV export and all-results-at-once search endpoint.</p>
<p>I expect it to be pretty useful! It means I can run any SQL query I like against a Django project and get back the full results - often dozens of MBs - in a form I can import into other tools (including Datasette).</p>

   If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet …

<p>If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet and making the rich richer
and the poor poorer and generally all the other kinds of fights that
people like to have about capitalism (also a quasi-vague word
occupying some hotly contested mental real estate).</p>
<p>There are good reasons to hold opinions about various aspects of what
are called "blockchains", and I too have some pretty strong opinions
I'll be getting into in a followup article.
The followup article will be about "cryptocurrencies", which many people
also seem to think of as synonymous with "blockchains", but this isn't
particularly true either, but we'll deal with that one then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some of the fighting on the internet is kind of
confusing, but even more importantly, kind of confused.
Some of it might be what I call "sportsballing": for whatever reason,
for or against blockchains has become part of your local sportsball
team, and we've all got to be team players or we're gonna let the local
team down already, right?
And the thing about sportsballing is that it's kind of arbitrary and
it kind of isn't, because you might pick a sportsball team because you
did all your research or you might have picked it because that just
happens to be the team in your area or the team your friends like, but
god almighty once you've picked your sportsball team let's actually not
talk against it because that might be giving in to the other side.
But sportsballing kind of isn't arbitrary either because it tends to
be initially connected to real communities of real human beings and
there's usually a deeper cultural web than appears at surface level,
so when you're poking at it, it appears surface-level shallow but
there are some real intricacies beneath the surface.  (But anyway, go
sportsball team.)</p>
<p>But I digress.
There are important issues to discuss, yet people aren't really
discussing them, partly because people mean different things.
"Blockchain" is a strange term that encompasses a wide idea space,
and what people consider or assume essential to it vary just as
widely, and thus when two people are arguing they might not even be
arguing about the same thing.
So let's get to unpacking.</p>
 "Blockchain" as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general 
<p>Years ago I was at a conference about decentralized networked
technology, and I was having a conversation with someone I had just met.
This person was telling me how excited they were about
blockchains... finally we have decentralized network designs, and so
this seems really useful for society!</p>
<p>I paused for a moment and said yes, blockchains can be useful for some
things, though they tend to have significant costs or at least
tradeoffs.  It's good that we also have other decentralized network
technology; for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standard I was involved in had no blockchains but did rely on the
much older "classic actor model."</p>
<p>"Oh," the other person said, "I didn't know there were other kinds of
decentralized network designs.  I thought that 'blockchain' just meant
'decentralized network technology'."</p>
<p>It was as if a light had turned on and illuminated the room for me.  Oh!
This explained so many conversations I had been having over the years.
Of course... for many people, blockchains like Bitcoin were the first
ever exposure they had (aside from email, which maybe they never gave
much thought to as being decentralized) of something that involved
a decentralized protocol.  So for many people, "blockchain" and
"decentralized technology" are synonyms, if not in technical design,
but in terms of understanding of a space.</p>
<p>Mark S. Miller, who was standing next to me, smiled and gave a very
interesting followup: "There is only one case in which you need a
blockchain, and that is in a decentralized system which needs to
converge on a single order of events, such as a public ledger
dealing with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending#Decentralized_currencies">double spending problem</a>."</p>
<p>Two revelations at once.  It was a good conversation... it was a good
start.
But I think there's more.</p>
 Blockchains are the "cloud" of merkle trees 
<p>As time has gone on, the discourse over blockchains has gotten more
dramatic.  This is partly because what a "blockchain" is hasn't been
well defined.</p>
<p>All terminology exists on an ever-present battle between
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/23-nerdout-fuzzy-and-crisp.html">fuzziness and crispness</a>,
with some terms being much clearer than others.
The term "boolean" has a fairly crisp definition in computer science,
but if I ask you to show me your "stove", the device you show me today
may be incomprehensible to someone's definition a few centuries ago,
particularly in that today it might not involve fire.
Trying to define as in terms of its functionality can also cause
confusion: if I asked you to show me a stove, and you showed me a
computer processor or a car engine, I might be fairly confused, even
though technically people enjoy showing off that they can cook eggs on
both of these devices when they get hot enough.
(See also: <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/identity-is-a-katamari/">Identity is a Katamari, language is a Katamari explosion</a>.)</p>
<p>Still, some terms are fuzzier than others, and as far as terms go,
"blockchain" is quite fuzzy.
Hence my joke: "Blockchains are the 'cloud' of merkle trees."</p>
<p>This ~joke tends to get a lot of laughs out of a particular kind of
audience, and confused looks from others, so let me explain.
The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that it's a "chain of
blocks", but all that really seems to mean is that it's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle tree</a>... really,
just an immutable datastructure where one node points at the parent node
which points at the parent node all the way up.
The joke then is not that this merkle tree runs on a cloud, but that
"cloud computing" means approximately nothing: it's marketing speak for
some vague handwavey set of "other peoples' computers are doing
computation somewhere, possibly on your behalf sometimes."
Therefore, "cloud of merkle trees" refers to the vagueness of the
situation.
(As everyone knows, jokes are funnier when fully explained, so I'll
turn on my "STUDIO LAUGHTER" sign here.)</p>
<p>So, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, ie a merkle tree, and I mean,
technically speaking, that means that <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a
blockchain (especially if the commits are signed), but when you see
someone arguing on the internet about whether or not blockchains are
"good" or "bad", they probably weren't thinking about git, which aside
from having a high barrier of entry in its interface and some concerns
about the hashing algorithm used, isn't really something likely to
drag you into an internet flamewar.</p>
 "Blockchain" is to "Bitcoin" what "Roguelike" is to "Rogue" 
<p>These days it's common to see people either heaping praises on
blockchains or criticizing them, and those people tend to be shouting
past one another.
I'll save unpacking that for another post.
In the meanwhile though, it's worth noting that people might not be
talking about the same things.</p>
<p>What isn't in doubt is whether or not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
is a blockchain... trying to understand and then explore the problem
space around Bitcoin is what created the term "blockchain".
It's a bit like the video game genre of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>,
which started with the game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>,
particularly explored and expanded upon in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a>,
and then suddenly exploding into the indie game scene as a "genre"
of its own.
Except the genre has become fuzzier and fuzzier as people have explored
the surrounding space.
What is essential?
Is a grid based layout essential?
Is a <a href="http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/">non-euclidean grid</a> acceptable?
Do you have to provide an ascii or ansi art interface so people can play
in their terminals?
Dare we allow unicode characters?
What if we throw out terminals altogether and just play on a grid
of 2d pixelart?
What about 3d art?
What about permadeath?
What about the fantasy theme?
What about random level generation?
What are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Key_features">key features</a>
of a roguelike?</p>
<p>Well now we're at the point where I pick up a game like
<a href="https://blazingbeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Beaks_Wiki">Blazing Beaks</a>
and it calls itself a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Rogue-lites_and_procedural_death_labyrinths">"roguelite"</a>,
which I guess is embracing the point that terminology has gotten extremely
fuzzy... this game feels more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron">Robotron</a>
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>.</p>
<p>So... if "blockchain" is to Bitcoin what "roguelike" is to Rogue, then
what's essential to a blockchain?
Does the blockchain have to be applied to a financial instrument, or
can it be used to store updateable information about eg identity?
Is global consensus required?
Or what about a "trusted quorum" of nodes, such as in Hyperledger?
Is "mining" some kind of asset a key part of the system?
Is proof of work acceptable, or is proof of stake okay?
What about proof of space, proof of space-time, proof of pudding?</p>
<p>On top of all this, some of the terms around blockchains have been
absorbed as if into them.
For instance, I think to many people, "smart contract" means something
like "code which runs on a blockchain" thanks to Ethereum's major
adoption of the term, but the
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>
described "smart contracts" as the "likely killer app of distributed
capabilities" all the way
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990125095122/http://www.erights.org/">back in 1999</a>,
and was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990209105758/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/smart_contracts_idea.html">borrowing the term</a>
from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990128165611/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/">Nick Szabo</a>,
but really the same folks working on E had described many of those same
ideas in the <a href="https://agoric.com/papers/">Agoric Papers</a> back in 1988.
Bitcoin wasn't even a thing at all until at least 2008, so depending on
how you look at it, "smart contracts" precede "blockchains" by one or
two decades.
So "blockchain" has somehow even rolled up terms outside of its space
as if within it.
(By the way, I don't think anyone has given a good and crisp definition
for "smart contract" either despite some of these people trying to give
me one, so let me give you one that I think is better and embraces its
fuzziness: "Smart contracts allow you to do the kinds of things you
might do with legal contracts, but relying on networked computation
instead of a traditional state-based legal system."
It's too bad more people also don't know about the huge role that Mark
Miller's "split contracts" idea plays into this space because that's
what makes the idea finally makes sense... but that's a conversation
for another time.)
(EDIT: Well, after I wrote this, Kate Sills lent me her
definition, which I think is the best one: "Smart contracts are
credible commitments using technology, and outside a state-provided
legal system."  I like it!)</p>
<p>So anyway, the point of this whole section is to say that kind of like
roguelike, people are thinking of different things as essential to
blockchains.
Everyone roughly agrees on the jumping-off point of ideas but since
not everyone agrees from there, it's good to check in when we're having
the conversation.
Wait, you do/don't like this game because it's a roguelike?
Maybe we should check in on what features you mean.
Likewise for blockchains.
Because if you're blaming blockchains for burning down the planet, more
than likely you're not condemning signed git repositories (or at least,
if you're condemning them, you're probably doing so about it from an
aspect that isn't the fundamental datastructure... probably).</p>
<p>This is an "easier said than done" kind of thing though, because of
course, I'm kind of getting into some "in the weeds" level of details
here... but it's the "in the weeds" where all the substance of the
disagreements really are.
The person you are talking with might not actually even know or consider
the same aspects to be essential that you consider essential though,
so taking some time to ask which things we mean can help us lead to a
more productive conversation sooner.</p>
 "Blockchain" as an identity signal 
<p>First, a digression.
One thing that's kind of curious about the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signaling">"virtue signal"</a>
is that in general it tends to be used as a kind of virtue signal.
It's kind of like the word
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%28contemporary_subculture%29">hipster</a>
in the previous decade, which weirdly seemed to be obsessively and
pejoratively used by people who resembled hipsters than anyone else.
Hence I used to make a joke called "hipster recursion", which is that
since hipsters seem more obsessesed with pejorative labeling of
hipsterism than anyone else, there's no way to call someone a "hipster"
without yourself taking on hipster-like traits, and so inevitably
even this conversation is N-levels deep into hipster recursion
for some numerical value of N.</p>
<p>"Virtue signaling" appears similar, but even more ironically so
(which is a pretty amazing feat given how much of hipsterdom seems to
surround a kind of inauthentic irony).
When I hear someone say "virtue signaling" with a kind of sneer, part
of that seems to be acknowledging that other people are sending signals
merely to impress others that they are some kind of the same group but
it seems as if it's being raised as in a
you-know-and-I-know-that-by-me-acknowledging-this-I'm-above-virtue-signaling
kind of way.
Except that by any possible definition of virtue signaling, the above
appears to be a kind of virtue signaling, so now we're into virtue
signaling recursion.</p>
<p>Well, one way to claw our way out of the rabbithole of all this is to
drop the pejorative aspect of it and just acknowledge that signaling
is something that everyone does.
Hence me saying "identity signaling" here.
You can't really escape identity signaling, or even sportsballing, but
you can acknowledge that it's a thing that we all do, and there's a
reason for it: people only have so much time to find out information
about each other, so they're searching for clues that they might align
and that, if they introduce you to their peer group, that you might
align with them as well, without access to a god-like view of the
universe where they know exactly what you think and exactly what
kinds of things you've done and exactly what way you'll behave in
the future or whether or not you share the same values.
(After all, what else is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>
but an ethical framework that takes this in its most condensed form as
its foundation?)
But it's true that at its worst, this seems to result in shallow, quick,
judgmental behavior, usually based on stereotypes of the other side...
which can be unfortunate or unfair to whomever is being talked about.
But also on the flip side, people also do identity signal to each other
because they want to create a sense of community and bonding.
That's what a lot of culture is.
It's worth acknowledging then that this occurs, recognizing its use and
limitations, without pretending that we are above it.</p>
<p>So wow, that's quite a major digression, so now let's get back to
"identity signaling".
There is definitely a lot of identity signaling that tends to happen
around the word "blockchain", for or against.
Around the critiques of the worst of this, I tend to agree: I find much
of the machismo hyper-white-male-privilege that surrounds some of the
"blockchain" space uncomfortable or cringey.</p>
<p>But I also have some close friends who are not male and/or are people
of color and those ones tend to actually suffer the worst of it from
these communities internally, but also seem to find things of value in
them, but particularly seem to feel squeezed externally when the field
is reduced to these kinds of (anti?-)patterns.
There's something sad about that, where I see on the one hand friends
complaining about blockchain from the outside on behalf of people who
on the inside seem to be both struggling internally but then kind of
crushed by being lumped into the same identified problems externally.
This is hardly a unique problem but it's worth highlighting for a moment
I think.</p>
<p>But anyway, I've taken a bunch of time on this, more than I care to,
maybe because (irony again?) I feel that too much of public conversation
is also hyperfocusing on this aspect... whether there's a subculture
around blockchain, whether or not that subculture is good or bad, etc.
There's a lot worthwhile in unpacking this discourse-wise, but some of
the criticisms of blockchains as a technology (to the extent it even
is coherently one) seem to get lumped up into all of this.
It's good to provide thoughtful cultural critique, particularly one
which encourages healthy social change.
And we can't escape identity signaling.
But as someone who's trying to figure out what properties of networked
systems we do and don't want, I feel like I'm trying to navigate the
machine and for whatever reason, my foot keeps getting caught in the
gears here.
Well, maybe that itself is pointing to some architectural mistakes,
but socially architectural ones.
But it's useful to also be able to draw boundaries around it so that
we know where this part of the conversation begins and ends.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "decentralized centralization" (or "decentralized convergence") 
<p>One of the weird things about people having the idea of "blockchains" as
being synonymous with "decentralization" is that it's kind of both very
true and very untrue, depending on what abstraction layer you're
looking at.</p>
<p>For a moment, I'm going to frame this in harsh terms: blockchains are
decentralized centralization.</p>
<p>What?
How dare I!
You'll notice that this section is in harsh contrast to the
"blockchain as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general"
section... well, I am acknowledging the decentralized aspect of it,
but the weird thing about a blockchain is that it's a decentralized
set of nodes converging on (creating a centrality of!) a single
abstract machine.</p>
<p>Contrast with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts">classic actor model</a>
systems like
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>
in <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>,
or as less good examples
(because they aren't quite as behavior-oriented as they are
correspondence-oriented, usually)
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>
(ie, email).
All of these systems involve decentralized computation and collaboration
stemming from sending messages to actors (aka "distributed objects").
Of CapTP this is especially clear and extreme: computations happen in
parallel across many collaborating machines (and even better, many
collaborating objects on many collaborating machines), and the behavior
of other machines and their objects is often even opaque to you.
(CapTP survives this in a beautiful way, being able to do well on
anonymous, peer to peer, "mutually suspicious" networks.
But maybe read my
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">rambling thoughts about CapTP</a>
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>While to some degree there are some very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">clever</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">tricks</a>
in the world of cryptography where you may be able to get back some of
the opacity, this tends to be very expensive, adding an expensive
component to the already inescapable additional expenses of a
blockchain.
A multi-party blockchain with some kind of consensus
will always, by definition be slower than a single machine operating
alone.</p>
<p>If you are irritated by this framing: good.
It's probably good to be irritated by it at least once, if you can
recognize the portion of truth in it.
But maybe that needs some unpacking to get there.
It might be better to say "blockchains are decentralized convergence",
but I have some other phrasing that might be helpful.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "a single machine that many people run" 
<p>There's value in having a single abstract machine that many people run.
The most famous source of value is in the "double spending problem".
How do we make sure that when someone has money, they don't spend that
money twice?</p>
<p>Traditional accounting solves this with a linear, sequential ledger,
and it turns out that the right solution boils down to the same thing
in computers.
Emphasis on sequential: in order to make sure money balances out
right, we really do have to be able to order things.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though: the double spending problem was in a sense
solved in terms of single-computers a long time ago in the object
capability security community.
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html">Capability-based Financial Instruments</a>
was written about a decade before blockchains even existed and
showed off how to make a "mint" (kind of like a fiat-currency bank)
that can be implemented in about 25 lines of code in the right
architecture (I've <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/blob/4f664218c87fa96432a04d0a107618ec36ab9310/goblins/actor-lib/simple-mint.rkt#L13">ported it to Goblins</a>,
for instance) and yet has both distributed accounts and is robust
against corruption on errors.</p>
<p>However, this seems to be running on a "single-computer based
machine", and again operates like a fiat currency.
Anyone can create their own fiat currency like this, and they are
cheap, cheap, cheap (and fast!) to make.
But it does rely on sequentiality to some degree to operate correctly
(avoiding a class of attacks called "re-entrancy attacks").</p>
<p>But this "single-computer based machine" might bother you for a couple
reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>We might be afraid the server might crash and service will be
  interrupted, or worse yet, we will no longer be able to access our
  accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>Or, even if we could trade these on an open market, and maybe
  diversify our portfolio, maybe we don't want to have to trust a
  single operator or even some appointed team of operators... maybe we
  have a lot of money in one of these systems and we want to be sure
  that it won't suddenly vanish due to corruption.</p>
 
 
<p>Well, if our code operates deterministically, then what if from the
same initial conditions (or saved snapshot of the system) we replay
all input messages to the machine?
Functional programmers know: we'll end up with the same result.</p>
<p>So okay, we might want to be sure this doesn't accidentally get
corrupted, maybe for backup reasons.
So maybe we submit the input messages to two computers, and then
if one crashes, we just continue on with the second one until the
other comes up, and then we can restore the first one from the
progress the second machine made while the first one was down.</p>
<p>Oh hey, this is already technically a blockchain.
Except our trust model is that we implicitly trust both machines.</p>
<p>Hm.
Maybe we're now worried that we might have top-down government
pressure to coerce some behavior on one of our nodes, or maybe we're
worried that someone at a local datacenter is going to flip some bits
to make themselves rich.
So we actually want to spread this abstract machine out over three
countries.
So okay, we do that, and now we set a rule agreeing on what all the
series of input messages are... if two of three nodes agree, that's
good enough.
Oh hey look, we've just invented the "small-quorum-style"
blockchain/ledger!</p>
<p>(And yes, you can wire up <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>
to do just this; a hint as to how is seen in the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
Actually, let's come back to that later.)</p>
<p>Well, okay.
This is probably good enough for a private financial asset, but what
about if we want to make something more... global?
Where nobody is in charge!</p>
<p>Well, we could do that too.
Here's what we do.</p>
 
 
<p>First, we need to prevent a "swarming attack" (okay, this is
  generally called a "sybil attack" in the literature, but for a
  multitude of reasons I won't get into, I don't like that term).
  If a global set of peers are running this single abstract machine,
  we need to make sure there aren't invocations filling up the system
  with garbage, since we all basically have to keep that information
  around.
  Well... this is exactly where those proof-of-foo systems come in
  the first time; in fact Proof of Work's origin is in something
  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a> which
  was designed to add "friction" to disincentivize spam for email-like
  systems.
  If we don't do something friction-oriented in this category, our
  ledger is going to be too easily filled with garbage too fast.
  We also need to agree on what the order of messages is, so we
  can use this mechanism in conjuction with a consensus algorithm.</p>
 
 
<p>When are new units of currency issued?
  Well, in our original mint example, the person who set up the mint
  was the one given the authority to make new money out of thin air
  (and they can hand out attenuated versions of that authority to
  others as they see fit).
  But what if instead of handing this capability out to individuals
  we handed it out to anyone who can meet an abstract requirement?
  For instance, in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zcap-ld</a>
  an invoker can be any kind of entity which is specified with
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">linked data proofs</a>,
  meaning those entities can be something other than a single key...
  for instance, what if we delegated to an abstract invoker that was
  specified as being "whoever can solve the state of the machine's current
  proof-of-work puzzle"?
  Oh my gosh!
  We just took our 25-line mint and extended it for mining-style
  blockchains.
  And the fundamental design still applies!</p>
 
 
<p>With these two adjustments, we've created a "public blockchain" akin
to bitcoin.
And we don't need to use proof-of-work for either technically...
we could swap in different mechanisms of friction / qualification.</p>
<p>If the set of inputs are stored as a merkle tree, then all of the
system types we just looked at are technically blockchains:</p>
 
 
<p>A second machine as failover in a trusted environment</p>
 
 
<p>Three semi-trusted machines with small-scale private consensus</p>
 
 
<p>A public blockchain without global trust, with swarming-attack
   resistance and an interesting abstract capability accessible
   to anyone who can meet the abstract requirement (in this case,
   to issue some new currency).</p>
 
 
<p>The difference for choosing any of the above is really a question of:
"what is your trust/failover requirements?"</p>
 Blockchains as time travel plus convergent inputs 
<p>If this doesn't sound believable to you, that you could create
something like a "public blockchain" on top of something like Goblins
so easily, consider how we might extend
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time travel in Terminal Phase</a>
to add multiplayer.
As a reminder, here's an image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, a secret thing about Terminal Phase is that the gameplay is
deterministic (the random starfield in the background is not, but the
gameplay is) and runs on a fixed frame-rate.
This means that given the same set of keyboard inputs, the game will
always play the same, every time.</p>
<p>Okay, well let's say we wanted to hand some way for someone to replay
our last game.
Chess games can be fully replayed with a very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">condensed syntax</a>,
meaning that merely handing someone a short list of codes they can
precisely replay the same game, every time, deterministically.</p>
<p>Well okay, as a first attempt at thinking this through, what if for
some game of Terminal Phase I played we wrote down each keystroke I
entered on my keyboard, on every tick of the game?
Terminal Phase runs at 30 ticks per second.
So okay, if you replay these, each one at 30 ticks per second, then
yeah, you'd end up with the same gameplay every time.</p>
<p>It would be simple enough for me to encode these as a linked list
(cons, cons, cons!) and hand them to you.
You could descend all the way to the root of the list and start
playing them back up (ie, play the list in reverse order) and you'd
get the same result as I did.
I could even stream new events to you by giving you new items to
tack onto the front of the list, and you could "watch" a game I
was playing live.</p>
<p>So now imagine that you and I want to play Terminal Phase together
now, over the network.
Let's imagine there are two ships, and for simplicity, we're playing
cooperatively.
(The same ideas
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_protocol">can be extended to competitive</a>,
but for narrating how real-time games work it's easier to to start
with a cooperative assumption.)</p>
<p>We could start out by wiring things up on the network so that I am
allowed to press certain keys for player 1 and you are allowed to
press certain keys for player 2.
(Now it's worth noting that a better way to do this doesn't involve
keys on the keyboard but capability references, and really that's
how we'd do things if we were to bring this multiplayer idea live, but
I'm trying to provide a metaphor that's easy to think about without
introducing the complicated sounding kinds of terms like "c-lists" and
"vat turns" that we ocap people seem to like.)
So, as a first attempt, maybe if we were playing on a local area
network or something, we could synchronize at every game tick: I share
my input with you and you share yours, and then and only then do both
of our systems actually input them into that game-tick's inputs.
We'll have achieved a kind of "convergence" as to the current game state
on every tick.
(EDIT: I wrote "a kind of consensus" instead of "a kind of
convergence" originally, and that was an error, because it misleads
on what consensus algorithms tend to do.)</p>
<p>Except this wouldn't work very well if you and I were living far away
from each other and playing over the internet... the lag time for
doing this for every game tick might slow the system to a crawl...
our computers wouldn't get each others' inputs as fast as the game was
moving along, and would have to pause until we received each others'
moves.</p>
<p>So okay, here's what we'll do.
Remember the time-travel GUI above?
As you can see, we're effectively restoring from an old snapshot.
Oh!  So okay.
We could save a snapshot of the game every second, and then both get
each other our inputs to each other as fast as we can, but knowing
it'll lag.
So, without having seen your inputs yet, I could move my ship up and
to the right and fire (and send that I did that to you).
My game would be in a "dirty state"... I haven't actually seen what
you've done yet.
Now suddenly I get the last set of moves you did over the network...
in the last five frames, you move down and to the left and fire.
Now we've got each others' inputs... what our systems can do is
secretly time travel behind the scenes to the last snapshot, then
fast forward, replaying both of our inputs on each tick up until the
latest state where we've both seen each others' moves (but we wouldn't
show the fast forward process, we'd just show the result with the
fast forward having been applied).
This can happen fast enough that I might see your ship jump forward
a little, and maybe your bullet will kill the enemy instead of mine
and the scores shift so that you actually got some points that
for a moment I thought I had, but this can all happen in realtime
and we don't need to slow down the game at all to do it.</p>
<p>Again, all the above can be done, but with actual wiring of
capabilities instead of the keystroke metaphor... and actually, the
same set of ideas can be done with any kind of system, not just
a game.</p>
<p>And oh hey, technically, technically, technically if we both hashed
each of our previous messages in the linked list and signed each one,
then this would qualify as a merkle tree and then this would also
qualify as a blockchain... but wait, this doesn't have anything to do
with cryptocurrencies!
So is it really a blockchain?</p>
 "Blockchain" as synonym for "cryptocurrency" but this is wrong and don't do this one 
<p>By now you've probably gotten the sense that I really was annoyed with
the first section of "blockchain" as a synonym for "decentralization"
(especially because blockchains are decentralized centralization/convergence)
and that is completely true.
But even more annoying to me is the synonym of "blockchain" with
"cryptocurrency".</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency" means "cryptographically based currency" and it is
NOT synonymous with blockchains.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash">Digicash</a> precedes blockchains
by a dramatic amount, but it is a cryptocurrency.
The "simple mint" type system also precedes blockchains and while it
can be run on a blockchain, it can also run on a solo
computer/machine.</p>
<p>But as we saw, we could perceive multiplayer Terminal Phase as
technically, technically a blockchain, even though it has nothing to do with
currencies whatsoever.</p>
<p>So again a blockchain is just a single, abstract, sequential machine,
run by multiple parties.
That's it.
It's more general than cryptocurrencies, and it's not exclusive to
implementing them either.
One is a kind of programming-plus-cryptography-use-case
(cryptocurrencies), the other one is a kind of abstracted machine
(blockchains).</p>
<p>So please.
They are frequently combined, but don't treat them as the same thing.</p>
 Blockchains as single abstract machines on a wider network 
<p>One of my favorite talks is Mark Miller's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXUqfgdDbr8">Programming Secure Smart Contracts</a>
talk.
Admittedly, I like it partly because it well illustrates some of the
low-level problems I've been working on, and that might not be as
useful to everyone else.
But it has this lovely diagram in it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is better understood by watching the video, but the abstraction
layers described here are basically as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>"Machines" are the lowest layer of abstraction on the network, but
   there a variety of kinds of machines.
   Public blockchains are one, quorum blockchains are another, solo
   computer machines yet another (and the simplest case, too).
   What's interesting then is that we can see public chains and quorums
   abstractly demonstrated as machines in and of themselves... even though
   they are run by many parties.</p>
 
 
<p>Vats are the next layer of abstraction, these are basically the
   "communicating event loops"... actors/objects live inside them,
   and more or less these things run sequentially.</p>
 
 
<p>Replace "JS ocaps" with "language ocaps" and you can see actors/objects
   in both Javascript and Spritely living here.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, at the top are "erights" and "smart contracts", which feed
   into each other... "erights" are "exclusive electronic rights", and
   "smart contracts" are generally patterns of cooperation involving
   achieving mutual goals despite suspicion, generally involving the
   trading of these erights things (but not necessarily).</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, well cool!
This finally explains the worldview I see blockchains on.
And we can see a few curious things:</p>
 
 
<p>The "public chain" and "quorum" kinds of machines still boil down
   to a single, sequential abstract machine.</p>
 
 
<p>Object connections exist between the machines... ocap security.
   No matter whether it's run by a single computer or multiple.</p>
 
 
<p>Public blockchains, quorum blockchains, solo-computer machines
   all talk to each other, and communicate between object references
   on each other.</p>
 
 
<p>Blockchains are not magical things.
They are abstracted machines on the network.
Some of them have special rules that let whoever can prove they qualify
for them access some well-known capabilities, but really they're just
abstracted machines.</p>
<p>And here's an observation: you aren't ever going to move all
computation to a single blockchain.
Agoric's CEO, Dean Tribble,
<a href="https://youtu.be/WeRbY6tiAio?t=712">explained beautifully why on a recent podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems with Ethereum is it is as tightly coupled as
possible.
The entire world is a single sequence of actions that runs on a
computer with about the power of a cell phone.
Now, that's obviously hugely valuable to be able to do commerce in a
high-integrity fashion, even if you can only share a cell phone's
worth of compute power with the entire rest of the world.
But that's clearly gonna hit a brick wall.
And we've done lots of large-scale distributed systems whether
payments or cyberspace or coordination, and the fundamental model
that covers all of those is
islands of sequential programming in a sea of asynchronous communication.
That is what the internet is about, that's what the interchain is about,
that's what physics requires you to do if you want a system to scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put this way, it should be obvious: are we going to replace the entire
internet with something that has the power of a cell phone?
To ask the question is to know the answer: of course not.
Even when we do admit blockchain'y systems into our system, we're going
to have to have many of them communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Blockchains are just machines that many people/agents run.
That's it.</p>
<p>Some of these are encoded with some nice default programming to do
some useful things, but all of them can be done in non-blockchain
systems because
communicating islands of sequential processes is the generalization.
You might still want a blockchain, ie you might want multiple parties
running one of those machines as a shared abstract machine, but
how you configure that blockchain from there might depend on your
trust and integrity requirements.</p>
 What do I think of blockchains? 
<p>I've covered a wide variety of perspectives of "what is a blockchain"
in this article.</p>
<p>On the worse end of things are the parts involving hand-wavey
confusion about decentralization, mistaken ideas of them being tied to
cryptocurrencies, marketing hype, cultural assumptions, and some real,
but not intrinsic, cultural problems.</p>
<p>In the middle, I am particularly keen on highlighting the similarity
between the term "blockchain" and the term "roguelike", how both of
them might boil down to some key ideas or not, but more importantly
they're both a rough family of ideas that diverge from one highly
influential source (Bitcoin and Rogue respectively).
This is also the source of much of the "shouting past each other",
because many people are referring to different components that they
view as essential or inessential.
Many of these pieces may be useful or harmful in isolation, in small
amounts, in large amounts, but much of the arguing (and posturing)
involves highlighting different things.</p>
<p>On the better end of things is a revelation, that blockchains are just
another way of abstracting a computer so that multiple parties can run
it.
The particular decisions and use cases layered on top of this
fundamental design are highly variant.</p>
<p>Having made the waters clear again, we could muddy them.
A friend once tried to convince me that all computers are
technically blockchains, that blockchains are the generalization of
computing, and the case of a solo computer is merely one where a
blockchain is run only by one party and no transaction history or old
state is kept around.
Maybe, but I don't think this is very useful.
You can go in either direction, and I think the time travel and
Terminal Phase section maybe makes that clear to me, but I'm not so
sure how it lands with others I suppose.
But a term tends to be useful in terms of what it introduces, and
calling everything a blockchain seems to make the term even less
useful than it already is.
While a blockchain could be one or more parties running a sequential
machine as the generalization, I suggest we stick to two or more.</p>
<p>Blockchains are not magic pixie dust, putting something on a
blockchain does not make it work better or more
decentralized... indeed, what a blockchain really does is converging
(or re-centralizing) a machine from a decentralized set of computers.
And it always does so with some cost, some set of overhead...
but what those costs and overhead are varies depending on what the
configuration decisions are.
Those decisions should always stem from some careful thinking about
what those trust and integrity needs are... one of the more
frustrating things about blockchains being a technology of great
hype and low understanding is that such care is much less common than
it should be.</p>
<p>Having a blockchain, as a convergent machine, can be useful.
But how that abstracted convergent machine is arranged can diverge
dramatically; if we aren't talking about the same choices, we might
shout past each other.
Still, it may be an unfair ask to request that those without a deep
technical background go into technical specifics, and I recognize
that, and in a sense there can be some amount gained from speaking
towards broad-sweeping, fuzzy sets and the patterns they seem to be
carrying.
A gut-sense assertion from a set of loosely observed behaviors can be
a useful starting point.
But to get at the root of what those gut senses actually map to, we
will have to be specific, and we should encourage that specificity
where we can (without being rude about it) and help others see those
components as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, as convergent machines, blockchains will not operate
alone.
I think the system that will hook them all together
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">should be CapTP</a>.
But no matter the underlying protocol abstraction, blockchains
are just abstract machines on the network.</p>
<p>Having finally disentangled what blockchains are, I think soon I
would like to move onto what cryptocurrencies are.
Knowing that they are not necessarily tied to blockchains opens us
up to considering an ecosystem, even an interoperable and exchangeable
one, of varying cryptographically based financial instruments, and
the different roles and uses they might play.
But that is another post of its own, for whenever I can get to it,
I suppose.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: After writing this post, I had several conversations
with several blockchain-oriented people.
Each of them roughly seemed to agree that Bitcoin was roughly the
prototypical "blockchain", but each of them also seemed to highlight
different things they thought were "essential" to what a "blockchain"
is: some kinds of consensus algorithms being better than others, that
kinds of social arrangements are enabled, whether transferrable
assets are encoded on the chain, etc.
To start with, I feel like this does confirm some
of the premise of this post, that Bitcoin is the starting point, but
like Rogue and "roguelikes", "blockchains" are an exploration space
stemming from a particular influential technical piece.</p>
<p>However my friend Kate Sills (who also gave me a much better
definition for "smart contracts", added above) highlighted something
that I hadn't talked about much in my article so far, which I do agree
deserves expansion.
Kate said: "I do think there is something huge missing from your
piece.  Bitcoin is amazing because it aligns incentives among actors
who otherwise have no goals in common."</p>
<p>I agree that there's something important here, and this definition of
"blockchain" maybe does explain why while from a computer science
perspective, perhaps signed git trees do resemble blockchains, they
don't seem to fit within the realm of what most people are thinking
about... while git might be a tool used by several people with aligned
incentives, it is not generally itself the layer of
incentive-alignment.</p>

<p>I’ve been having a lot of really inspiring conversations about decentralization lately. Decentralization doesn’t require the blockchain - and pre-dates it - but the rise of blockchain technologies have allowed more people to become comfortable with the idea and why it’s valuable.</p><p>Decentralized platforms have been part of virtually my entire career. I left my first job out of university to start <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/mar/07/elearning.technology13">Elgg</a>, a platform that allowed anyone to make an online space for their communities on their own terms. It started in education and developed an ecosystem there, before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgg_(software)">expanding to far wider use cases</a>. Across it all, the guiding principle was that one size didn’t fit all: every community should be able to dictate not just its own features, but its own community dynamics. We were heavily involved in interoperability and federation conversations, and my biggest regret is that we didn’t push our nascent Open Data Definition forward into an <a href="https://activitystrea.ms/">ActivityStreams</a>-like data format. To this day, though, people are using Elgg to support disparate communities across the web. Although they use Elgg’s software, the Elgg Foundation doesn’t strip-mine those communities: all value (financial and otherwise) stays with them.</p><p><a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a> was built on a similar principle, albeit for a world of ubiquitous connectivity where web-capable devices sit in everyone’s pocket. I use it every day (for example, to power this article), as many others do.</p><p>Much later, I was the first employee at <a href="https://www.ouvre-boite.com/">Julien Genestoux’s</a> <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com">Unlock</a>, which is a decentralized protocol for access control built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Here, a piece of content is “locked” with an NFT, and you can sell or share access via keys. If a user connects to content (which could be anything from a written piece to a real-life physical event) with a key for the lock, they gain access. Because it’s an open protocol, one size once again doesn’t fit all: anyone can use the underlying lock/key mechanism to build something new. Because it’s decentralized, the owner of the content keeps all the value.</p><p>Contrast that principle with Facebook, which has been the flag-bearer for the strip-mining of communities across the web for well over a decade now. Its business model means that it’s super-easy to create a community space, which it then monetizes for all it’s worth: you even have to pay to effectively reach the people you connected with to begin with. We’ve all become familiar with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/opinion/facebook-democracy.html">the societal harms of its targeted model</a>, but even beyond that, centralization has inherent harms. When every online interaction and discussion is templated to the same team’s design decisions (and both the incentives and assumptions behind those decisions), those interactions are inevitably shaped by those templates. It leads to what Amber Case calls <a href="http://cyborganthropology.com/Templated_Self">the templated self</a>. Each of those conversations consequently occurs in a form that serves Facebook (or Twitter, etc) rather than the community itself.</p><p>It’s easy to discount blockchain; I did, for many years. (It was actually <a href="https://dada.art/home">DADA</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/the-drunken-walk-matter-seven-demo-day-special-dada-7781f663b0e4">one of our investments at Matter</a>, who <a href="https://powerdada.medium.com/the-complacency-of-crypto-art-b7d026546e8a">showed me the way</a>.) And there’s certainly a lot that can be said about the environmental impact and more. We should talk about them now: it’s important to apply pressure to change to proof of stake and other models beyond. The climate crisis can’t be brushed aside. But we shouldn’t throw out the baby with the bathwater: blockchain platforms have created value in decentralization, and provided a meaningful alternative to invasive, centralized silos for the first time in a generation. Those things are impermanent; we won’t be talking about <a href="https://coil.com/p/Doctor_Change/The-Environmental-Impact-of-Proof-of-Work/xKp5E1Ju0">harmful, slow proof of work algorithms</a> in a few years, in the same way we don’t talk about HTML 1 today.</p><p>What does it look like to build an ethical, decentralized platform for community and discourse that is also self-sustaining, using these ideas? How can we distribute equity among participants of the community rather than sucking it up into a centralized megacorporation or institutional investors? That question has been giving me energy. And there are more and more people thinking along similar lines.</p><p>Animated GIF NFTs and crypto speculation aren’t very interesting at best (at least to me), and at worst are a reflection of a kind of reductive greed that has seriously negative societal effects. But looking beyond the gold rush, the conversations I’m having remind me of the conversations I used to have about the original web. The idea of decentralization is empowering. The idea of a community supporting itself organically is empowering. The idea of communities led by peer-to-peer self-governance is empowering. The idea of movement leaders being organically supported in their work is empowering. And we’re now in a position where if we pull those threads a little more, it’s not obvious that these ideas will fail. That’s an exciting place to be.</p>

Found this today, buried in my Google Docs, and thought of sharing publicly (unedited), in case if someone finds it&nbsp;helpful!</p><p>Good Morning folks, thanks for joining in — it’s my great pleasure to do this session on ‘My Personal Brand is My Professional Success&nbsp;Story’.</p><p>First of all I must thank Asanka, Zai, Charitha, Usama and the entire marketing team for giving me the opportunity to present on this topic. In first sight, I thought, it’s tough to present on a topic — that I have not consciously focused on — or purposely wanted to achieve myself. Then again, thinking further on the title, I realized whether we like it or not each one of us has a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The personal brand is the image of you, that you cultivate in others’ minds. In other words — that is how — others think about you. This raises a question in all ‘radical’ minds — why we have to care about what others think about us — we do our bit in the way we want, and should we care about personal branding? It is extremely important to find answers to this question, because if we are not convinced of something, we will never do&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my view there are no individuals — there is a bigger, greater team behind each individual. This bigger, greater team includes your parents, siblings, spouse, kids, relations, friends. colleagues and many more. You like it or not, more or less you are a reflection of this team behind you. As we grow up as human beings the team behind us — or the team which influences us, widens up. It would not just include well-wishers, but also haters, competitors and many more. But, still you as an individual is a reflection of this team. Sometimes — or even in most of the cases, the haters could motivate you more than well-wishers. This team also includes people you have never talked to — people you have never seen — people who never exist, like some characters in books. This is the team behind you — at the same time — you like it or not you become a member of a team behind another individual or set of individuals. In other words, you get influenced by a team and then again you influence another set of individuals.</p><p>Let me take a quick example. Everyone knows Mahatma Gandhi. In his own words, Ghandi once said — “Three moderns have left a deep impress on my life and captivated me. Raychandbhai by his living contact; Tolstoy by his book, “The Kingdom of God is within you”; and Ruskin by his “Unto This Last”. That was what influenced him — today there are countless number of individuals who are influenced by&nbsp;Gandhi.</p><p>Arguably, CNBC, in 2014, named Steve Jobs as the most influential person in last 25 years. Thousands of people are influenced by Steve Jobs, at the same time there are many other people who influenced Jobs — Edwin H. Land, who co-founded Polaroid and made a number of significant advancements in the field of photography, is one of them, Jobs used to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>In short, whether you like it or not, more or less, you get influenced by others and then again you influence others. Now it is a question on how much an impact you want to make on the rest of the world before you die, to make this world a better place than it looks like today.&nbsp;I</p><p>f you want to make a good/positive impact on others, you care about how they think about you. If you cannot build a positive image of you, in their minds, you will find it extremely hard to make a positive impact in their lives. The positive image of you is the reflection of your character. If you have a bad character, it is extremely hard to build a good image out of it, not quite impossible though. But, if your character is good, the positive image is the bonus what you get for it. Personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself — but to express yourself. Everyone from the history, who has made a positive impact to the world, have expressed themselves. The way Gandhi took to express himself, is not the same which Steve Jobs&nbsp;picked.</p><p>The rest of the talk from here onwards, is about, how to build a good image and then how to express your character to the rest, to build a positive personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, everyone of us, should have a vision for the life. Vision for the life is the one that drives you to the future. The vision for the life is the one that motivates us to wake up every morning. If you don’t have one — start thinking about it from today. Think about, what motivates you to do what you do everyday. Having a good vision is the core in building a great&nbsp;image.</p><p>The vision has to be inspirational — a great vision statement inspires and moves us. It is a motivational force that compels action. You recognize a great vision statement when you find it difficult not to be inspired.</p><p>The vision has to be challenging — the best vision statements challenge us to become better. In this way, a vision statement requires us to stretch ourselves in pursuit of the vision we seek to achieve. The vision is not an ‘easy target’; it is something that if achieved- would represent a sense of pride and fulfillment.</p><p>The vision has to be achievable — vision must not be so far-fetched that is outside of our reach. It must be conceivably possible, though not probable without additional effort.</p><p>When we start working for a company, we get used to spend most of our time working there. If your vision for life does not match with the vision of the company you work for — there could be many conflicts and you won’t be productive. If your vision for life, is to make this world a better place, you cannot work for a company which produces cigarettes or&nbsp;weapons.</p><p>The second most important thing in building a good image, is your integrity. Oprah Winfrey, who is a well-respected TV talk show host, actress, producer and philanthropist, says “Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not.”. I don’t think there is a better way of explaining, ‘integrity’ than this. It captures all what it needs to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I have visited and talked with many WSO2 customers over last eight years. We never talk to a customer with an intention of selling a product. First thing we do is listening to them and learn from them, then we all work towards the best solution to the problem they have. Finally we see how WSO2 could fit into the solution. If it is not a perfect fit — we never lie — we identify the gaps — and find a way to move forward by filling those gaps. Most of the time we win the customer at the second stage, when we build the solution for them and in many cases they agree to go ahead with us, even we are not the perfect match for their problem. That is mainly because, the level of integrity we demonstrate as a&nbsp;company.</p><p>No one is perfect — that also implies everyone makes mistakes. A guy with a high level of integrity would never hide mistakes, but rather would accept it, apologize for it and fix it. Never he would lie — never he would say something to one person and something else to another. Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”</p><p>In short, vision for life will drive you to the future, while the integrity is the cornerstone of your personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The third most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, to raise yourself against negativity. Do not let negativity kill your productivity, enthusiasm, passion and spirit. People who spread negativity are the people who feel extremely insecure in their current state. They only have complaints — no suggestions. Their feedbacks are negative, not constructive. They see only bad — not a single bit of good. Identifying these type of people are not that hard — first you need to shield yourself from negativity — then you need to protect your team. Even just by keeping silent when hear something negative, you indirectly contributes to spread it over — fix it at that very point. If you are closely following the US presidential election campaign, you might have noticed, Donald Trump, who is the republican front runner at the moment, is being heavily criticized for being silent and not correcting a question raised by someone in his political campaign, where he said — ‘Muslims is a problem and Barack Obama is a Muslim’. Even though Trump is still the frontrunner, his popularity has gone down considerably after these dialogues.</p><p>The fourth most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, when you do something do it to a level where it can make an impact. If you believe something is right, go for it and make it happen. At the end of the day you may fail — but look back and see whether you have contributed to your best — if so, you will never frustrate — no&nbsp;regrets.</p><p>Expressing an idea is important — but representing an idea is much more important. When you represent something you own it. If you want to do something to make an impact, you must own it. You should not be a someone who talks the talk but does not walk the&nbsp;walk.</p><p>Tolerating criticism and accepting constructive feedback, is another key aspect in building a positive image. There are no better sources than criticisms to validate the direction we are heading and to learn. Bill Gates, once said ‘Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning’.</p><p>We discussed so far, the need to build a positive image and how to do it. Next we will focus on how to build a personal brand by expressing yourself. As we discussed before, personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself. If you already have a positive image, being little expressive will build you a positive personal brand. If you already have a negative image, being little expressive will build you a negative personal brand. The image you build is a reflection of your character. That includes your role, as a father, son, brother, husband, colleague, friend, mentor, developer, architect and many more. You can build an image as a good father and a bad son — or as a good son and a bad brother — or as a good friend and a bad developer — likewise any combinations. But, more or less, ultimately your true image is how you do overall. You can be the best developer in the company, but then again if you do not understand the value of respecting each other’s religions and cultural values or — in a single word, if you are a racist — your top skills as a developer is worthless.</p><p>You need to pick how you want to impact the world — or how you want the world to see you. Thats your personal brand — and you build it on top of your character or the image. Your overall character is the shelter for your personal brand. If you do not build it right — if you find holes in it — you cannot protect your brand, even from a light shower. That’s why building the right character comes well before building a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, the area you can make the most impact to the world, in its positive direction, is the area that you are most passionate about. If you are extremely worried and angry about child labour — you can be a thought leader in protesting against child labour. If you are extremely worried and angry about human rights violations — you can be a thought leader in protecting human rights. If you are extremely passionate about integration technologies, you can be a thought leader in integration space. If you are extremely passionate about machine learning, you can be a thought leader in machine learning space. If you are passionate about APIs — you can be a thought leader in API space. If you are passionate about Big Data, you can be a thought leader in Big Data space. If you are passionate about Identity and Access Management, you can be a thought leader in Identity and Access Management space. Opportunities are limitless — but remember our ground rules — if you do something — do it to a level where it can make a positive impact. You do not need to worry about being a thought leader, but when you make a good positive impact, you will become a thought leader automatically.</p><p>Once you decide the area where you want to make an impact — the rest depends on how good you as a communicator. Communication is critically important, because, that’s the only way you can reach to your audience. Content marketing is the best way to build a brand and reputation online; when people look for information, they tend to go back to sources that were helpful to them. If you can become a trusted source of information through your content, over time you’ll become collectively known as the expert of your specific field. It’s best to start your own blog and update it on a regular basis — at least weekly. If you do not update regularly you lose your audience. At the start it would be tough — but once you make it a practice, it will start to happen effortlessly. Another key principle I would like to highlight here is the difference between good and great. Most of the time the difference between good and great lies heavily on how you do tiny/little things better. You may spend hours in writing a blog — finding the content — validating the content and getting all in order. But — we are bit lazy to put another more five to ten minutes of effort, to format our blog post, publish it in DZone and other blog aggregators, share it in social media sites — and do little more. This additional ten minutes of effort could easily make your blog post from being a good one to a great one — and also would attract a larger audience.</p><p>Regularly participate in mailing lists related to the subject of your interest is another way of passing your message to the rest of the world. These mailing lists may be within WSO2 or even outside. Look for standard bodies like W3C, IETF, OASIS — and any other communities that share the same interest of yours, and eagerly participate in related discussions. Not just the mailing lists, look for interesting groups in Facebook, LinkedIn, StackOverFlow and wherever possible and make your&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Webinars at WSO2 is another key medium to pass your message to the audience of your interest. If you want to be a thought leader in your product space, then your responsibility does not end at the moment you release the product. You need to come up with a plan for evangelization — and webinars could be extremely helpful.</p><p>At WSO2 you get a massive number of opportunities to build your brand. Your personal brand is important to you as well as, to the company you serve. Few years back, we had a VP of Marketing called Katie Poplin — and I personally got motivated by some of the concepts she put forward. One thing she believed was, in the open source community, brand value of individuals are much higher and trustworthier than that of companies. People used to think, everything a company shares, is part of their marketing propaganda — which may not reflect the real value. But, what individuals share are their first hand experience. Also we had monthly awards for best blogger, best evangelist and the best article. If I remember correctly I won both the best blogger and best evangelist awards in couple of months and it was fun&nbsp;:-).</p><p>Then again don’t just get constrained by the the opportunities you get from WSO2. Always look for what is happening outside. Try to get your articles published in external portals. Also — look for writing books. Writing a book is not hard as it looks to be. First you need to come up with a proposal, with an attractive topic, in your domain of expertise, and then submit it to few publishers. Most of the publishers accept book proposals and if you go to their web sites, you will find everything you need to know, on writing books — go for&nbsp;it!.</p><p>Conferences and meetups are another way to establish yourself as a prominent speaker in the corresponding domain. Then again, getting a speaking opportunity will depend on how better you have done your homework.</p><p>These are only few techniques to build your brand, in the domain you are interested in, on top of your personal image or the character. Building your personal brand is a focused exercise, not just a piece of cake. It’s a journey, not a destination. Once you built it — maintaining it and protecting it is much harder. As we discussed before, your image or the character is the shelter or the shield of your personal brand. If you build your character consciously, that’ll help you in protecting your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Finally to wrap up, in this session we discussed the importance of brand building, how to build your character and the image, how to build a personal brand under the shelter of your character. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/my-personal-brand-is-my-professional-success-story-8460fe351113">My Personal Brand is My Professional Success Story!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/04/26/the-verifiable-economy-architecture-reference-model-ve-arm-step-by-step/">The Verifiable Economy: Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) 0.2:&nbsp;Step-by-Step</a>.  



 Introduction 



<p>This visualization represents the first complete iteration of The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM). It is the first complete example of a Fully-Decentralized Object Model (FDOM) that unites the following into a single integrated model:</p>



  Verifiable Identifiers, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and DID Documents;  Verifiable Claims, Relationships, and Verifiable Credentials (VCs); and  Verifiable Capability Proclamations, Verifiable Capability Invocations, and Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs).  



 Background 



<p>The scenario used to model the VE-ARM is an example of a citizen (Erin) of a fictional Canadian province called Sovronia holding a valid physical Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL) as well as a digital, verifiable Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin SDL).</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/drivers-license-erin-amanda-lee-anderson-larged.png"></a>Figure 1. Erin’s Real-World Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL)



 Creation of the Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM)  



<p>The underlying model was built automatically using a series of <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Cypher queries running against a collection of actual DID Document, Verifiable Credential, and Verifiable Capability Authorization JSON files. The visualization was laid out using the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Browser. The resulting layout was manually optimized to produce the final version of the visualization that appears below. The numbered markers were added using Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>



<p>The Legends and Narration sections that follow further describe the VE-ARM in more detail. A whitepaper will be available shortly. The whitepaper will contain copies of the underlying DID Document, Verifiable Credential, and Verifiable Capability Authorization JSON files.</p>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

   note: content goes first; than try summary

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This article shows a strategy for security multiple APIs which have different authorization requirements but the tokens are issued by the same authority. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used as the identity provider. A user API and a service API are implemented in the ASP.NET Core API project. The access token for the user API data is created using an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">Open ID Connect</a> Code flow with PKCE authentication and the service API access token is created using the client credentials flow in the trusted backend of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> application. It is important that both access tokens will only work for the intended API.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel">https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The projects are setup to use a Blazor WASM application hosted in ASP.NET Core secured using the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and the BFF pattern. Cookies are used to persist the session. This application uses two separate APIs, a user data API and a service API. The access token from the OIDC authentication is used to access the user data API and a client credentials flow is used to get an access token for the service API. Auth0 is setup using a regular web application and an API configuration. A scope was added to the API which is requested in the client application and validated in the API project.</p>







<p>Implementing the APIs in ASP.NET Core</p>



<p>OAuth2 JwtBearer auth is used to secure the APIs. As we use the same Authority and the same Audience, a single scheme can be used for both applications. We use the default JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme. </p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
	options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme 
		= JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme 
		= JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
{
	options.Authority 
		= "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
	options.Audience 
		= "https://auth0-api1";
});
  


<p>The AddAuthorization method is used to setup the policies so that each API can authorize that the correct token was used to request the data. Two policies are added, one for the user access token and one for the service access token. The access token created using the client credentials flow with Auth0 can be authorized using the azp claim and the Auth0 gty claim. The API client-id is validated using the token claims. The user access token is validated using an IAuthorizationHandler implementation. A default policy is added to the AddControllers method to require an authenticated user meaning a valid access token.</p>


  services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
{
	policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
	{
		p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
		// Validate id of application for which the token was created
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "AScjLo16UadTQRIt2Zm1xLHVaEaE1feA");
	});

	policies.AddPolicy("p-service-api-auth0", p =&gt;
	{
		// Validate id of application for which the token was created
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "naWWz6gdxtbQ68Hd2oAehABmmGM9m1zJ");
		p.RequireClaim("gty", "client-credentials");
	});
});

services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
	var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
		.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
		.Build();
	options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});
  


<p>Swagger is added with an OAuth UI so that we can add access tokens manually to test the APIs.</p>


  services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
{
	// add JWT Authentication
	var securityScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
	{
		Name = "JWT Authentication",
		Description = "Enter JWT Bearer token **_only_**",
		In = ParameterLocation.Header,
		Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
		Scheme = "bearer", // must be lower case
		BearerFormat = "JWT",
		Reference = new OpenApiReference
		{
			Id = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
			Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme
		}
	};
	c.AddSecurityDefinition(securityScheme.Reference.Id, securityScheme);
	c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
	{
		{securityScheme, new string[] { }}
	});

	c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
	{
		Title = "My API",
		Version = "v1",
		Description = "My API",
		Contact = new OpenApiContact
		{
			Name = "damienbod",
			Email = string.Empty,
			Url = new Uri("https://damienbod.com/"),
		},
	});
});
  


<p>The Configure method is used to add the middleware to implement the API application. It is important to use the UseAuthentication middleware and you should have no reason to implement this yourself. If you find yourself implementing some special authentication middleware for whatever reason, maybe your security architecture might be incorrect.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
	app.UseSwagger();
	app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
	{
		c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "User API");
		c.RoutePrefix = string.Empty;
	});

	// only needed for browser clients
	// app.UseCors("AllowAllOrigins");

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The UserApiScopeHandler class implements the abstract AuthorizationHandler class. Logic can be implemented here to fulfil the UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement. This requirement is what we use to authorize a request for the user data API. This handler just validates if the required scope exists in the scope claim. </p>


  public class UserApiScopeHandler : 
	AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement&gt;
{

	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
		AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var scopeClaim = context
			.User
			.Claims
			.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scope");

		if (scopeClaim != null)
		{
			var scopes = scopeClaim
				.Value
				.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
				
			if (scopes.Any(t =&gt; t == "auth0-user-api-one"))
			{
				context.Succeed(requirement);
			}
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}

public class UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement : 
	IAuthorizationRequirement{ }
  


<p>The policies can be applied anywhere within the application and the authorization logic is not tightly coupled anywhere to the business of the application. By separating the authorization implementation with the business implementation of the application, it is easier to maintain and understand the authorization and business of the application. This has worked well for me and I find it easy to test and maintain applications setup like this over long periods of time.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
  


<p>The p-service-api-auth policy is applied to the Service API.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "p-service-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ServiceTwoController : ControllerBase
  


<p>When the application is started, the swagger UI is displayed and any access token can be pasted into the swagger UI. Both APIs are displayed in the swagger and both APIs require a different access token.</p>







<p>Calling the clients from ASP.NET Core</p>



<p>A Blazor WASM application hosted in ASP.NET Core is used to access the APIs. The application is secured using a trusted server rendered application and the OIDC data is persisted to a secure cookie.  The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider method is used to set the audience of the API to request the access token with the required scope. The scopes are added to the OIDC options.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
	options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-BlazorServer";
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
	options.Authority = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}";
	options.ClientId = Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"];
	options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Auth0:ClientSecret"];
	options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
	options.Scope.Clear();
	options.Scope.Add("openid");
	options.Scope.Add("profile");
	options.Scope.Add("email");
	options.Scope.Add("auth0-user-api-one");
	options.CallbackPath = new PathString("/signin-oidc");
	options.ClaimsIssuer = "Auth0";
	options.SaveTokens = true;
	options.UsePkce = true;
	options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
	options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";

	options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
	{
		// handle the logout redirection 
		OnRedirectToIdentityProviderForSignOut = (context) =&gt;
		{
			var logoutUri = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}/v2/logout?client_id={Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"]}";

			var postLogoutUri = context.Properties.RedirectUri;
			if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(postLogoutUri))
			{
				if (postLogoutUri.StartsWith("/"))
				{
					// transform to absolute
					var request = context.Request;
					postLogoutUri = request.Scheme + "://" + request.Host + request.PathBase + postLogoutUri;
				}
				logoutUri += $"&amp;returnTo={ Uri.EscapeDataString(postLogoutUri)}";
			}

			context.Response.Redirect(logoutUri);
			context.HandleResponse();

			return Task.CompletedTask;
		},
		OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
		{
			// The context's ProtocolMessage can be used to pass along additional query parameters
			// to Auth0's /authorize endpoint.
			// 
			// Set the audience query parameter to the API identifier to ensure the returned Access Tokens can be used
			// to call protected endpoints on the corresponding API.
			context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter("audience", "https://auth0-api1");

			return Task.FromResult(0);
		}
	};
});

  


<p>Calling the User API</p>



<p>A user API client service is used to request the data from the ASP.NET Core API. The access token is passed as a parameter and the IHttpClientFactory is used to create the HttpClient.</p>


  /// &lt;summary&gt;
/// setup to oidc client in the startup correctly
/// https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core#enterprise-saml-and-others-
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class MyApiUserOneClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configurations;
	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

	public MyApiUserOneClient(
		IConfiguration configurations,
		IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
	{
		_configurations = configurations;
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	}

	public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetUserOneApiData(string accessToken)
	{
		try
		{
			var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

			client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configurations["MyApiUrl"]);

			client.SetBearerToken(accessToken);

			var response = await client.GetAsync("api/UserOne");
			if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
			{
				var data = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
				await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

				return data;
			}

			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}
}

  


<p>The user access token is saved to the HttpContext after a successful sign-in and the GetTokenAsync method with the “access_token” parameter is used to retrieve the user access token. </p>


  private readonly MyApiUserOneClient _myApiUserOneClient;

public CallUserApiController(
	MyApiUserOneClient myApiUserOneClient)
{
	_myApiUserOneClient = myApiUserOneClient;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetAsync()
{
	// call user API
	string accessToken = 
		await HttpContext.GetTokenAsync("access_token");
	var userData = 
		await _myApiUserOneClient
			.GetUserOneApiData(accessToken);

	return Ok(userData);
}
  


<p>Calling the Service API </p>



<p>Using a service API requires requesting an access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. This flow can only be used in a trusted backend and a secret is required to request an access token. No user is involved. This is a machine to machine request. The access token is persisted to a distributed cache.</p>


  public class Auth0CCTokenApiService
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;Auth0CCTokenApiService&gt; _logger;
	private readonly Auth0ApiConfiguration _auth0ApiConfiguration;

	private static readonly Object _lock = new Object();
	private IDistributedCache _cache;

	private const int cacheExpirationInDays = 1;

	private class AccessTokenResult
	{
		public string AcessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string access_token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public int expires_in { get; set; }
		public string token_type { get; set; }

<p>The services are added to the default IoC in ASP.NET Core so that construction injection can be used.</p>


  services.AddHttpClient();
services.AddOptions();

services.Configure&lt;Auth0ApiConfiguration(Configuration.GetSection("Auth0ApiConfiguration");
services.AddScoped&lt;Auth0CCTokenApiService&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;MyApiServiceTwoClient&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;MyApiUserOneClient&gt;();
  


<p>The service can be used anywhere in the code as required.</p>


  private readonly MyApiServiceTwoClient _myApiClientService;

public CallServiceApiController(
	MyApiServiceTwoClient myApiClientService)
{
	_myApiClientService = myApiClientService;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetAsync()
{
	// call service API
	var serviceData = await 
		_myApiClientService.GetServiceTwoApiData();

	return Ok(serviceData);
}
  


<p>You can test the APIs in the swagger UI. I added a breakpoint to my application and copied the access token. I added the token to the swagger UI.</p>







<p>If you send a HTTP request using the wrong token for the intended API, the request will be rejected and a 401or 403 is returned. Without the extra authorization logic implemented with the policies, this request would not have failed.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>It is really important to validate that only access tokens created for the specific APIs will work. There are different ways of implementing this. If using service APIs which are probably solution internal,  you could possibly use network security as well to separate these into different security zones. It is really important to validate the no access non-functional use case where using the same identity provider to create the access token for different APIs or if the identity provider produces access tokens for different applications which will probably have different security requirements. For high security requirements, you could use sender constrained tokens.</p>

<p>Given a latitude and longitude, how can you tell what country that point sits within? One way is to do a point-in-polygon lookup against a set of country polygons, but this can be tricky: some countries such as New Zealand have extremely complex outlines, even though for this use-case you don't need the exact shape of the coastline. country-coder solves this with a custom designed 595KB GeoJSON file with detailed land borders but loosely defined ocean borders. It also comes with a wrapper JavaScript library that provides an API for resolving points, plus useful properties on each country with details like telepohen calling codes and emoji flags.</p>

<p>Daniel found the door to another world the day his father died.</p><p>It sat behind the ugly painting of a hillside in France that his dad bought at a second hand shop a few years ago; he hung it proudly in his bedroom, despite Daniel’s mother’s protests. It was hanging at an angle when Daniel came to check on the house. When he straightened it, he caught a glimpse of shiny, red wood: a small square door sealed with a brass latch.</p><p>He pulled the latch and found it opened easily. Golden sunlight illuminated the dusty room; through the frame, he saw a cloudless, shimmering blue sky. Spirals of brightly-colored birds he had never seen before flew between trees. A warm breeze ran through his hair.</p><p>He shut the door with a start.</p><p>Surely he was imagining things?</p><p>Gently, he opened it again; just a crack. Again, he felt the breeze against his skin and heard the call of unfamiliar birds. It was the dead of winter, but the room was again lit in summery gold.</p><p>His heart pounded in his ears. He backed away slowly, and he kept backing away until he was locking the door, then mounting his bicycle, and finally racing home as fast as he could.</p><p>He had no idea how to process what he’d seen.</p><p>He wished there was someone he could ask about it. But his father was gone.</p><p>*</p><p>“Did you go over?” Daisy asked, wrapping her husband in a hug as soon as he walked in through the kitchen door. She had a spaghetti bolognese going on the stovetop; half-grated cheese sat on a wooden chopping board on the countertop. Simple comfort food for the end of a terrible day.</p><p>Daniel nodded wordlessly.</p><p>“How are you holding up?”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s hit me yet, to be honest,” Daniel said, after a moment. “I feel numb. He was a miserable man in some ways, and we never had a very warm relationship, but he was my Dad. Now he’s gone, there are so many things I want to ask him, and I can’t.”</p><p>Daisy kissed his forehead. Her blonde hair brushed against his face. “I know. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I should tell Mum,” he said.</p><p>Daisy looked at him with concern. “Do you think she needs to know tonight? Will it make a difference to her?”</p><p>“No,” Daniel said, “but it’ll make a difference to me. I don’t want it hanging over everything. I need to tell her.”</p><p>Daisy pulled him in tighter. “She won’t know what you’re saying,” she said, quietly, as kindly as she could. “She’ll forget it as soon as you walk out through the door.” It felt blunt; cruel, even. But Daniel had been through enough for one day. He needed to rest.</p><p>“I’ll go tomorrow,” he told her, finally.</p><p>“I love you,” she said.</p><p>He loved her too, and told her so. He didn’t mention the door.</p><p>*</p><p>Daniel’s mother lived in a a memory care facility next to the John Radcliffe hospital, just off the ring road in east Oxford. In contrast to the hospital’s modern steel and glass, the facility’s pebble-dash walls were painted over with thick beige paint that came off in chunks at the corners. The morning sky cast the street in a dim grey, and as he walked up to the building, he shivered underneath his coat.</p><p>“I’m so sorry to hear about your Da,” Amy said after he’d signed in at the front desk. She had been the head nurse since his mother was first checked in. In some ways she was like family now: not Nurse Walsh, but Amy, the woman who had been by Daniel’s side when he first signed the forms, and when his mother’s memory had gone so far that she barely remembered who he was. His Dad hated it there, and had barely ever set foot in the building.</p><p>“Thank you,” Daniel said.</p><p>His mother sat in a big, institutional armchair upholstered in brown, wipe-clean vinyl. She was watching some daytime TV show about house-hunting in Europe on the communal flat-screen. Over the institutional smell of cleaning fluid, he could smell roses. Her perfume. Even now, with her memory mostly gone and the fabric of who she used to be torn apart by disease, she insisted on wearing it.</p><p>“Hi Mum,” he said, gently, taking care not to startle her.</p><p>She looked at him blankly.</p><p>“It’s your son,” he said. “Daniel.”</p><p>His mother smiled, but it was hard to tell if it was out of recognition.</p><p>“It’s nice to see you,” he said, smiling. She didn’t respond, and turned back to the television.</p><p>“How have you been, Mum?” He asked, sitting on a vinyl ottoman in front of her.</p><p>“I’ve been buying a house in Spain,” she said, turning back to him. Her voice carried a touch of a Russian accent; a fragment of the community of Jewish immigrants she’d grown up with in London. “It’s beautiful.”</p><p>“That’s lovely,” Daniel said.</p><p>“Yes, it makes a very nice change. I will go there with Peter in the summer.”</p><p>“That sounds nice,” Daniel said. He swallowed hard. “Mum, that’s why I’m here. I need to talk to you about Dad. About Peter.”</p><p>“My husband,” she said, smiling.</p><p>“Yes,” Daniel said, reaching out to touch her hand. “He died, Mum.”</p><p>“That cannot be. I spoke to him this morning.”</p><p>Daniel wondered if she’d really seen him in years. “I’m so sorry,” he said, “but Dad’s gone.”</p><p>She looked at him, but said nothing. He thought he could see her eyes grow wider, just slightly, but he couldn’t say for sure.</p><p>“He had a heart attack,” he said. “They couldn’t save him. They tried everything.”</p><p>She remained motionless, and the two of them sat there in complete silence. After a minute or two had passed, she said, abruptly: “I think you should go.”</p><p>“Okay, Mum,” Daniel said. There was no sense in arguing. “I love you.”</p><p>She turned back to the television, soaking herself in the sunny images of southern Spain. As she watched and the conversation with her son faded into the background, a smile began to curl back onto her face.</p><p>Daniel picked himself up off the ottoman. He took a long look at his mother, took in the smell of her perfume, and noticed the way her happiness didn’t quite seem to reach her eyes.</p><p>He turned towards the exit and waved a half-hearted thank you to Amy. She nodded and gave him a sympathetic smile.</p><p>He was just about to push the door open out into the reception when his mother turned back to him and asked: “Have you found the door yet?”</p><p>*</p><p>Daniel’s father had been an academic at the university, although he had given up most of his teaching duties long ago. He sat in a small office lined with Russian literature, peering into his computer screen and slowly hunting and pecking articles for research journals. The university let him stay partially out of kindness, and partially because he had become a relatively well-known name in the field. His translation of The Brothers Karamazov had long since fallen out of fashion, but in the seventies you could buy it in any bookstore.</p><p>Now that he was dead, the university made it clear that his office needed to be cleared out within the week.</p><p>Daniel and Daisy piled his books into open boxes. When one was full, they sealed it with brown packing tape and wrote a short description across the top. Dad’s books: a completely inadequate label for a life’s work. But there was nothing else they could write; neither one of them knew much about Russian literature. The stories and traditions that he had spent his life immersed in were an unknown.</p><p>The room smelled of dusty pages, and of him.</p><p>“So what did she say?” Daisy asked, packing a heavy-looking book bound in a burgundy dust jacket.</p><p>“She told me to leave,” Daniel said.</p><p>“So she knows what happened. She understands.”</p><p>Daniel sealed up a box and piled it on top of the others. There were seven of them now, towering in one corner. “I think so,” he said, “but these days it’s hard to tell for sure.”</p><p>“Did she say anything else?”</p><p>Daniel folded together a new, empty box, and sealed up the bottom with tape. “She turned back to the television. She literally wouldn’t talk to me anymore. And that was that.”</p><p>They turned their attention back to their work, boxing up the books and the hopelessly out-of-date computer that sat on his desk. In his desk drawers, they found a handful of Rubles - bright green notes with the remains of columns illustrated across them - and a cheap, plastic compass with a loop for tying to your wrist. Beside them was a quote, scrawled in his father’s handwriting on a white notecard: “For some a prologue, for some an epilogue”.</p><p>Before long, the room was empty. Daniel knew it would be scrubbed down soon, ready for the next academic to fill it with their work, wiped clear of the memory and the smell and the spirit of his father.</p><p>It was only when they had driven away that Daniel told her what he’d seen.</p><p>*</p><p>The two of them held hands in his father’s bedroom, facing the door in the wall. A moment ago, he had opened it for her, and she had seen a beautiful blue sky. It seemed impossible - like a magic trick - but then he did it again, and again. Once he had opened and closed the door for a fourth time, both of them acknowledged that it was real.</p><p>“But what is it?” Daisy asked.</p><p>“It’s a door,” Daniel said. “To somewhere.”</p><p>“But what is it?”</p><p>“I have no idea.”</p><p>*</p><p>They sat around the small dinner table his father had kept in the kitchen, eating slices of frozen pizza and sipping at glasses of the cheap red wine they had found in the</p><p>“Well, we can’t sell the house,” Daisy said. “Not with ... that.”</p><p>“No, I suppose not,” Daniel said. “But we can’t just keep the house here, sitting empty. It’s not right.”</p><p>“I agree. I just don’t know what to do about it. What if someone breaks in and finds it?”</p><p>“We don’t know where it goes; where that place is. What if it’s dangerous? What if, when you climb through, you can’t come back? We don’t know anything.”</p><p>“Do you think we can move it?” Daisy asked.</p><p>“It’s a doorway. How can you move a doorway?”</p><p>They finished their wine in silence as the sunlight left them and the room dimmed.</p><p>After they had sat in darkness for a while, Daisy said: “we should go through it.”</p><p>*</p><p>Daniel insisted that he would be the first to climb through. The plan was that he would climb back all the way, and then go through again, to make sure it was possible and that Daisy wouldn’t be trapped there. Then, and only then, she would climb through to follow him. They would leave the door open, with a broom propped against it so that it couldn’t swing shut.</p><p>It was small and square and two thirds the way up the wall, so he found that he needed to stand on a chair to have any hope of pulling himself through. Even then, it took more arm strength than he was comfortable exerting. But he found he could grip the sides of the doorframe, and Daisy gave him a small push, which helped. Before long, he felt the sun on his back and found that his feet were planted in the greenest grass he’d ever seen.</p><p>On this side, the doorframe floated in mid-air: just a square hanging in space with Daisy inside, and behind her, the gloom of the bedroom.</p><p>“Are you okay?” she asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Daniel said. “It’s actually lovely in here. Out here. Wherever here is.”</p><p>“Come back out,” Daisy beckoned.</p><p>He pulled himself back through the doorway, awkwardly landing backwards on the chair. “That was pretty good, actually.”</p><p>“Okay,” Daisy said, “now back you go, and then I’ll follow you.”</p><p>Daniel once again pulled himself through the doorframe, and then gave Daisy a hand and helped her through behind him. Her sneakers landed in the grass.</p><p>“Oh,” Daisy said, turning her head towards the sky, “this is magnificent.”</p><p>They could see now that they were on a grassy hillside on the edge of a forest. On one side, they could see the birds and the trees. On the other, if they looked back beyond the doorframe, they could see a valley stretch out below them, and beyond it, more rolling hills dotted with trees and shrubs. Flowers sprung up among the grass. There were no signs of civilization anywhere; not so much as a hedgerow. It was wild and beautiful.</p><p>“How could your father keep this a secret?” Daisy asked, smiling. She turned to Daniel, but found that he was suddenly still, his face turned ashen.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>From through the doorframe, somewhere back in the house, she could hear the sound of floorboards creaking under footsteps. As she listened, she realized that each step was getting louder; the person in the house was getting closer.</p><p>“Who is it?” Daisy whispered.</p><p>“Someone must have broken in,” Daniel whispered back.</p><p>“What if they see the door?”</p><p>“I don’t think we can avoid it now.”</p><p>They crouched below the frame and looked up, hoping to see who had broken into the house without being seen themselves.</p><p>“Is he here?” an unfamiliar woman’s voice said, somewhere in the house.</p><p>“I don’t see him,” a man’s voice said.</p><p>“Fine,” the first voice said. “Find the doorway and let’s sit in wait before he comes to look at the house.”</p><p>“Right you are,” the second voice said, noticeably louder. They were getting closer still; coming up the stairs now.</p><p>“If you see him, we must use force,” the first voice said. “We know the evil that lurks in his heart. It must be stamped out.”</p><p>Daisy clasped her hand to her mouth, her eyes wide in horror. Daniel was so still that she wasn’t sure if he was still breathing.</p><p>“Who is that?” Daisy whispered.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Daniel whispered.</p><p>“I found it! Ya ponyal!” shouted a voice from somewhere behind the doorway, and they heard the sounds of running footsteps.</p><p>Suddenly, Daniel stood up, reached through the square frame back into the bedroom, and closed the door behind them. The square of red wood hung in mid-air, impossibly. Behind it, he could hear the knocking and scratching of men, desperate to break through, but for reasons he couldn’t understand, they were barred.</p><p>*</p><p>The ground was soft but dry underfoot. As they walked down into the valley, they encountered the odd mouse amidst the grass or a bird pecking at something in the ground. The sun was warm, but the air wasn’t too hot or dry. It was the perfect summer’s day, and they were trapped in it.</p><p>Daniel had tried to move the doorframe so they could take it with them, but it stayed firm, as if it was cemented in something other than thin air. In the end they decided to leave it and see if they could find civilization. In the best case, there might be another door that could take them somewhere else, back into the real world.</p><p>It wasn’t that this place wasn’t the real world - it was just, they didn’t know what it was, or where. Or even when, if they stopped to think about it.</p><p>They had been walking for hours when they came across three strange, small cottages. Each of them was built with a wooden frame, with sticks and leaves packed in with clay and covered in a mixture of lime and sand. The roofs leaned up at sheer angles and were covered in bundles of straw. At one end, a small clay chimney jutted out, with a triangular, slate chimney cap.</p><p>“Do you think they’ll have water?” Daisy asked. It had been a long, hot walk.</p><p>“I think we have to try,” Daniel said. “I hope they’re friendly.”</p><p>Nervously, Daniel walked up to the door of the closest cottage and gave it a small, polite knock. There was no answer. After a few moments, he knocked again; when nobody came to the door, he turned back to Daisy and shrugged.</p><p>“Let’s try the next one,” she said. She walked to the next-closest cottage and knocked on the door. Again, there was no answer; she waited and tried again, but once more nobody came to the door.</p><p>They were about to walk up to the door of the third cottage when it opened with a bang. A small, old woman wearing a red handkerchief around her head walked out and looked at them with fierce eyes.</p><p>“Chy mozhu ya vam dopomohty?” the woman asked, sternly, in what sounded like a Russian accent.</p><p>Daniel raised his hand in a friendly wave. “Hello,” he said.</p><p>*</p><p>The three of them sat in the old woman’s one-room cottage, drinking cups of strong, black tea. They didn’t share a common language, but Daisy seemed to have a knack for getting her intentions across through gestures and intonation. The woman’s name was Olena, and she had plenty of tea to share.</p><p>The sun outside had begun to dim, and Olena lit a small fire, which crackled in the fireplace and cast shadows that danced across the walls. She told her story as best she could, given the lack of words between them. Her husband, Ananiy, had gone to find a better home, taking her son, Andriy, with him. There was an army, or a mob of some kind - it was hard to tell through the language barrier - that was rampaging over the land and stealing peoples’ homes. Villages were burned to the ground. Entire families were obliterated.</p><p>As she spoke, Daniel recognized one word: “pogrom”.</p><p>Olena stood up to go outside; she gestured towards the fireplace and made a chopping motion. Firewood. Daniel and Daisy raised their hands and pointed to themselves instead; we’ll gather it for you. She smiled in acceptance, and the two of them left the cottage to find wood to burn.</p><p>“Did you hear her?” Daniel asked in a hushed whisper. As they walked around the cottage, they found a small pile of dry wood in a clay hut. “Pogroms. She was talking about pogroms.”</p><p>“I think she’s speaking Russian,” Daisy said.</p><p>“Is this —?”</p><p>Daisy nodded. “It seems insane, but I think we’re in the past. Like, over a hundred years ago in the past. It’s crazy, but at the same time, it must be. The pogroms in Russia were during the revolution. The White Army murdered Jews and spread propaganda that they were communists.”</p><p>“I think you’re right, but it’s more than that,” Daniel said.</p><p>“More than that?”</p><p>“It’s a lot, but yeah,” Daniel said, “more than that. I think Ananiy was my great grandfather. Ananiy and Olena were my great grandparents.”</p><p>Daisy gave him a quick hug; then, they gathered as much firewood as each of them could carry under each arm, and went back inside.</p><p>Olena laid out some woolen blankets on the floor for them to sleep under (“spaty,” she said, while gesturing emphatically towards them). She slept on a small, wooden bed in the corner under another set of blankets. The fire slowed and turned to embers, and before long they could hear the old woman’s gentle snoring.</p><p>*</p><p>In the darkness, Daisy turned to face Daniel. “How do we get back?” she whispered.</p><p>“I think we have to find our way back to the door,” Daniel said. “It seems like there’s only one way back.”</p><p>“What about Olena? What if the White Army comes to find her?”</p><p>“If she really is my great grandmother, they won’t. My great grandmother survived the pogroms and fled to join Ananiy and Andriy in London. She’ll be okay.”</p><p>“And if she isn’t?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Daniel admitted. “I don’t think we can risk bringing her home. Into the future, I mean.”</p><p>Daisy nodded and thought for a minute. “This is all so surreal. I don’t know how we got here or how this even exists. But there’s one more thing I’ve been thinking. It’s going to sound strange, but I don’t think it can be stranger than anything else that’s happened today.”</p><p>“I think I know who the people in the house were,” Daisy whispered. “I think, somehow, it was the White Army. Or, perhaps, the ghosts of the White Army, or their descendants. The way they were talking - we know the evil that lurks in his heart. It’s such a strange thing to say. And they were speaking in Russian when they found the door. It seems so strange, but I’m scared that what I’m saying might actually be true, and they might be waiting for us whenever we go back.”</p><p>“How much time do you think has passed?” Daniel asked.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It’s night-time now, right? Here? And it was evening when we climbed through the door back home. If time moves at the same speed here as there - which it must do, because we heard people through the doorway - then it’s got to be early morning there by now.”</p><p>“What are you saying?”</p><p>“I’m saying it’s time to go.”</p><p>*</p><p>“The door?” Daniel sat himself back down on the vinyl ottoman in front of his mother. “What do you know about that?”</p><p>She smiled at him like she used to, back before her illness dragged her away from the world; a smile of recognition and love. “I know all about it,” she said. “It followed him. It followed us. From where we came from, where our parents came from, and their parents, too, all the way up to us sitting here now. And it will follow you, and your children, and their children.”</p><p>“It seems so impossible,” Daniel said.</p><p>“When something bad happens, it ripples outwards. When someone is hurt, their children are hurt too, and so, too, their children. We all carry the past with us. That is what the door is. The things that hurt us follow us forever.”</p><p>“That sounds like a curse.”</p><p>“It is,” his mother said. “And it is a curse that is ten times worse if you pretend it’s not there. You will feel tired and not know why you are tired. It will pull at you and make you crazy with a thousand tiny hooks, and you will blame yourself. Trauma you inherit has no cause other than what comes through your family; you are confronted by ghosts that aren’t yours. The only way to stop the cycle - the waves of hurt that flow from generation to generation - is to face it. And that’s what the door is.”</p><p>“So I have to go through it?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “That won’t stop the hurt its tracks. But it will give you the power to fight it, as knowledge always does. It will give it a name, and a form.”</p><p>“I don’t understand what this means.”</p><p>“You will. I can tell you no more.”</p><p>Daniel got up and hugged his mother. “I love you, Mum,” he said.</p><p>“I love you too,” she said, turning back to the television. “Now leave me with my home in Spain.”</p><p>*</p><p>They stood, once again, in front of the door, which hung against nothingness in the dead of the night. They had folded the blankets as neatly as they could, left Olena sleeping in her bed, and made the long journey up out of the valley.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s behind this door,” Daniel said. “They might still be there. It might be dangerous. You didn’t ask for this; this isn’t a part of your family history. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It isn’t, and it is,” Daisy said. “It’s part of my family history now because you’re my family. It doesn’t matter that it doesn’t come to me from my parents; it comes to me from love. I accept it because I accept you. It’s not my family history; it’s my family future. And knowing it helps me know you a little better.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>They embraced each other, then, in the night.</p><p>“Let’s do this,” Daisy said.</p><p>Daniel pushed the door open and it swung out into his father’s bedroom. His face glowed as the morning light shone through the frame. He turned to face Daisy and smiled; then, with one swift movement, he swung himself through the square and out into the room.</p><p>A moment later, she followed him. Her feet dropped back onto the beige carpet with a thud.</p><p>They were back in the present day. Dust floated in rays of sunlight. The ugly painting sat on the floor, balanced against the wall.</p><p>The house was silent and empty, but it sang with the life of Daniel’s parents: their history; the history they brought with them; the stories they left behind.</p><p>“What now?” Daisy asked.</p><p>Wordlessly, Daniel moved forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://werd.io/tag/fiction">#fiction</a></p>

The biggest problem is that they often get captured by error handling scripts, which may not have the right code in place to redact them.

And the costs continue to climb as the drama unfolds with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/13/ever-given-seized-egypt/">port authorities and insurers battling over what’s owed to&nbsp;who.</a></p><p>Transmute is a software company — a verifiable credentials as a service company to be exact — and we’ve been focused specifically on the credentials involved in moving steel assets around the globe alongside our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">customers at DHS SVIP and CBP</a> for the last couple years now. Now, there’s no “silver bullet” for mitigating the fiscal impact of the Ever Given on global trade, and ships who arrived the day it got stuck or shortly after certainly faced a tough decision — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/suez-canal-blocked-ship.html">sail around the Cape of Africa for up to ~$800K [fuel costs alone] + ~26 days to trip or wait it out at an up to $30K per day demurrage expense</a> [without knowing it’d only be stuck for 6 days or ~$180,000].</p><p>So what if you’re a shipping manager and you can make this decision faster? Or, make the call before your ship arrives at the canal? [Some did make this decision, by the way]. What if your goods are stuck on the Ever Given — do you wait it out? Switching suppliers is costly, and you’ve likely got existing contracts in place for much of the cargo. Even if you could fulfill existing contracts and demand on time with a new supplier, what do you do with the delayed cargo expense? What if you’re unsure whether you can sell the duplicate and delayed goods when they reach their originally intended destination?</p><p>Well, verifiable credentials — a special kind of digital document that’s cryptographically provable, timestamped and anchored to an immutable ledger at the very moment in time it’s created — can give companies the kind of data needed to make these sorts of decisions. With use over time for trade data, verifiable credentials build a natural reputation for all the things the trade documents are about: suppliers, products, contracts, ports, regulations, tariffs, time between supply chain handoff points,&nbsp;etc.</p><blockquote>This type of structured data is of such high integrity that supply chain operators can rely on it and feel empowered to make decisions based on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>What I’m hoping comes from this global trade disaster is a change in the way supply chain operators make critical decisions. Supply chains of the future will be powered by verifiable credentials, which seamlessly bridge all the data silos that exist today — whether software-created silos or even the paper-based manual, offline&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Today, it’s possible to move from a static, critical chain style of management where we often find ourselves in a reactive position to supply chains that look more like an octopus. High integrity data about suppliers and products enables proactive, dynamic decision making in anticipation of and in real time response to shifts in the market — ultimately capturing more revenue opportunities and mitigating risk at the same&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/takeaways-from-the-suez-canal-crisis-971f7404b058">Takeaways from the Suez Canal Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.</p>

<p>What is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

 What You'll Need 

<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>

 
 An HTTP client. 
 A URL parsing library. 
 A hashing library that supports SHA256. 
 A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML. 
 The ability to show an HTML form to the user. 
 

 IndieAuth Flow Summary 

<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>

 
 Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address. 
 Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server. 
 Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string. 
 Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string. 
 Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server. 
 

 Step by Step 

<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>

 Show the Sign-In Form 

<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type="url"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>

<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>

<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/indieauth/start" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="url" name="url" placeholder="example.com"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign In"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>

 Discover the IndieAuth Server 

<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>

<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#url-canonicalization">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href="https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>

 Start the Flow by Redirecting the User 

<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>

 
 <code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value. 
 <code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app. 
 <code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below. 
 <code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short. 
 <code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server. 
 <code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.) 
 

<p>Calculating the Code Challenge</p>

<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>

 
 Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long 
 Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string 
 Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge 
 

<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>

<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>

 <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code
  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com
  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc
  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256
  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks
  &amp;scope=profile
</code> 

<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>

<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>

 Handle the Redirect Back 

<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>

 <code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
</code> 

<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>

 Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info 

<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
 <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> 
 <code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge. 
 

<p>This is described in additional detail <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>

 <code>{
  "me": "https://indieauth.rocks/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "IndieAuth Rocks",
    "url": https://indieauth.rocks/"
    "photo": "https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>

 
 The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field. 
 If the <code>me</code> URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step. 
 

<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>

<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Now you're done!</p>

<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their <code>me</code> URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the <code>profile</code> object to keep their profile up to date.</p>

 Testing Your IndieAuth Client 

<p>To test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:</p>

 
 <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing. 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress</a> - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well. 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal</a> - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server. 
 <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfauth">Selfauth</a> - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server. 
 

<p>Eventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at <a href="https://indieauth.rocks">indieauth.rocks</a> so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.</p>

 Getting Help 

<p>If you get stuck or need help, feel free to drop by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">IndieWeb chat</a> to ask questions! Myself and many others are there all the time and happy to help troubleshoot new IndieAuth implementations!</p>

However, complex decisions based on experience, gut instinct, leadership and opinions still play a role, but most decisions can now be underpinned with a firmer foundation.  BE curious&nbsp;about how the business operates and makes money and its drivers of cost, revenue, and customer satisfaction through the lens of data and analytical models.  BE an ambassador&nbsp;of change. Data uncovers assumptions that unpack previous political decisions and moves power. Data does not create change but will create conflict — how this is managed is a critical CDO skill.  BE a great storyteller.  KNOW who&nbsp;is the smartest data scientist in the company, where the most sophisticated models are, and understand and appreciate what those data teams do and how they do it. Managing and getting the best from these teams is a skill everyone needs.  FIGURE out&nbsp;and articulate the value your team can deliver to the business in the next week, month, and quarter. As the CDO, what is the value you bring to your peers and shareholder in the next 5 years?  IMPROVE decision making&nbsp;using data for day to day, how to reduce risk and how to inform the company on achieving and adapting the company’s strategy.  BUILD relationships&nbsp;to source data both within your business and the wider ecosystem. This is both to determine the quality of the data and be able to better use data and or roll out solutions that improve quality and decision-making.  KNOW what technical questions&nbsp;to ask and being able to live with the complexity involved in the delivery.  <p>Decision making is a complex affair, and as CDO’s we are there to support. Decisions are perceived to be easier when there is lots of data, and the signal is big, loud and really clear. Big data has a place, but we must not forget small signals from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnographic data</a>&nbsp;sources. Leadership often does not know what to do with critical and challenging small data, especially when it challenges easy assumptions that big data justifies.</p><blockquote><p>A CDO superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias</p></blockquote><p>Our superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias, and help strategic thinkers, who often put a higher value on quantitative data. They didn’t know how to handle data that wasn’t easily measurable does not show up in existing paid-for reports. Ethnographic work has a serious perception problem in a data-driven decision world. A key role of the CDO is to uncover all data and its value, not bias to a bigger data set — that is just lazy. I love this image from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/triciawang/">@triciawang</a>, where the idea of critical small data set is represented as “thick data.” Do follow her work&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triciawang.com/">https://www.triciawang.com/</a>&nbsp;or that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievebell/">Genevieve Bell</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://katecrawford.net/about.html">Kate Crawford</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danah.org/">danah boyd&nbsp;</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria">@zephoria</a>).</p>          <p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">Nokia’s experience of ignoring small data</a></p> Note to the CEO <p>Digital transformation has built a dependence on data, and the bigger the data set, the more weight it is assumed to have. Often, there is a dangerous assumption made that the risk in a decision is reduced because of the data set's size. It may be true for operational issues and automated decision making but not necessarily for strategy.</p><p>As the CEO, you need to determine the half-life of the data used to justify or solidify a decision. Half-life in science is when more than 50 per cent of a substance has undergone a radical change; in business terms, this is when half the value of the data is lost or a doubling of the error. The bigger the data set, the quicker (shorter) the half-life will be. Indeed some data’s half-life is less than the time it took to collect and store it. It is big but it really has no value. For small data sets, such as ethnographic data, the half-life can be longer than a 3 to 5 years strategic planning cycle. Since some data might be small and could be a signal to your future, supporting a CDO who puts equal weight on all data is critical to success.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/28/vaccinateca/">back in February</a>, I've been working with the <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> project to try to bring the pandemic to an end a little earlier by helping gather as accurate a model as possible of where the Covid vaccine is available in California and how people can get it.</p>
<p>The key activity at VaccinateCA is calling places to check on their availability and eligibility criteria. Up until last night this was powered by a heavily customized Airtable instance, accompanied by a custom JavaScript app for the callers that communicated with the Airtable API via some Netlify functions.</p>
<p>Today, the flow is powered by a new custom Django backend, running on top of PostgreSQL.</p>
 The thing you should never do 
<blockquote><p>Here's one that took me fifteen years to learn: "let's build a new thing and replace this" is hideously dangerous: 90% of the time you won't fully replace the old thing, and now you have two problems!</p>- Simon Willison (@simonw) <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1145114228170190848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2019</a></blockquote>
<p>Replacing an existing system with a from-scratch rewrite is risky. Replacing a system that is built on something as flexible as Airtable that is evolving on a daily basis is positively terrifying!</p>
<p>Airtable served us extremely well, but unfortunately there are hard limits to the number of rows Airtable can handle and we've already bounced up against them and had to archive some of our data. To keep scaling the organization we needed to migrate away.</p>
<p>We needed to build a matching relational database with a comprehensive, permission-controlled interface for editing it, plus APIs to drive our website and application. And we needed to do it using the most <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a> possible, so we could focus on solving problems directly rather than researching anything new.</p>
<p>It will never cease to surprise me that Django has attained boring technology status! VaccineCA sits firmly in Django's sweet-spot. So we used that to build our replacement.</p>
<p>The new Django-based system is called VIAL, for "Vaccine Information Archive and Library" - a neat <a href="https://twitter.com/obra">Jesse Vincent</a> bacronym.</p>
<p>We switched things over to VIAL last night, but we still have activity in Airtable as well. I expect we'll keep using Airtable for the lifetime of the organization - there are plenty of ad-hoc data projects for which it's a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The most important thing here is to have a trusted single point of truth for any piece of information. I'm not quite ready to declare victory on that point just yet, but hopefully once things settle down over the next few days.</p>

<p></p>

 Data synchronization patterns 
<p>The first challenge, before even writing any code, was how to get stuff out of Airtable. I built a tool for this a while ago called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/airtable-export">airtable-export</a>, and it turned out the VaccinateCA team were using it already before I joined!</p>
<p><code>airtable-export</code> was already running several times an hour, backing up the data in JSON format to a GitHub repository (a form of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a>). This gave us a detailed history of changes to the Airtable data, which occasionally proved extremely useful for answering questions about when a specific record was changed or deleted.</p>
<p>Having the data in a GitHub repository was also useful because it gave us somewhere to pull data from that wasn't governed by Airtable's rate limits.</p>
<p>I iterated through a number of different approaches for writing importers for the data.</p>
<p>Each Airtable table ended up as a single JSON file in our GitHub repository, containing an array of objects - those files got pretty big, topping out at about 80MB.</p>
<p>I started out with Django management commands, which could be passed a file or a URL. A neat thing about using GitHub for this is that you can use the "raw data" link to obtain a URL with a short-lived token, which grants access to that file. So I could create a short-term URL and paste it directly to my import tool.</p>
<p>I don't have a good pattern for running Django management commands on Google Cloud Run, so I started moving to API-based import scripts instead.</p>
<p>The pattern that ended up working best was to provide a <code>/api/importRecords</code> API endpoint which accepts a JSON array of items.</p>
<p>The API expects the input to have a unique primary key in each record - <code>airtable_id</code> in our case. It then uses Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/querysets/#update-or-create">update_or_create()</a> ORM method to create new records if they were missing, and update existing records otherwise.</p>
<p>One remaining challenge: posting 80MB of JSON to an API in one go would likely run into resource limits. I needed a way to break that input up into smaller batches.</p>
<p>I ended up building a new tool for this called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/json-post">json-post</a>. It has an extremely specific use-case: it's for when you want to POST a big JSON array to an API endpoint but you want to first break it up into batches!</p>
<p>Here's how to break up the JSON in <code>Reports.json</code> into 50 item arrays and send them to that API as separate POSTs:</p>
 <code>json-post Reports.json \                              
   "https://example.com/api/importReports" \
   --batch-size 50
</code> 
<p>Here are some more complex options. Here we need to pass an <code>Authorization: Beraer XXXtokenXXX</code> API key header, run the array in reverse, record our progress (the JSON responses from the API as newline-delimited JSON) to a log file, set a longer HTTP read timeout and filter for just specific items:</p>
 <code>% json-post Reports.json \                              
   "https://example.com/api/importReports" \
  -h Authorization 'Bearer XXXtokenXXX' \
  --batch-size 50 \
  --reverse \
  --log /tmp/progress.txt \
  --http-read-timeout 20 \
  --filter 'item.get("is_soft_deleted")'
</code> 
<p>The <code>--filter</code> option proved particularly useful. As we kicked the tires on VIAL we would spot new bugs - things like the import script failing to correctly record the <code>is_soft_deleted</code> field we were using in Airtable. Being able to filter that input file with a command-line flag meant we could easily re-run the import just for a subset of reports that were affected by a particular bug.</p>
<p><code>--filter</code> takes a Python expression that gets compiled into a function and passed <code>item</code> as the current item in the list. I borrowed the pattern from <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-transform#user-content-lambda-for-executing-your-own-code">my sqlite-transform tool</a>.</p>
 The value of API logs 
<p>VaccineCA's JavaScript caller application used to send data to Airtable via a Netlify function, which allowed additional authentication to be added built using  Auth0.</p>
<p>Back in February, the team had the bright idea to log the API traffic to that function to a separate base in Airtable - including full request and response bodies.</p>
<p>This proved invaluable for debugging. It also meant that when I started building VIAL's alternative implementation of the "submit a call report" API I could replay historic API traffic that had been recorded in that table, giving me a powerful way to exercise the new API with real-world traffic.</p>
<p>This meant that when we turned on VIAL we could switch our existing JavaScript SPA over to talking to it using a fully tested clone of the existing Airtable-backed API.</p>
<p>VIAL implements this logging pattern again, this time using Django and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Given that the writable APIs will recieve in the low thousands of requests a day, keeping them in a database table works great. The table has grown to 90MB so far. I'm hoping that the pandemic will be over before we have to worry about logging capacity!</p>
<p>We're using PostgreSQL <code>jsonb</code> columns to store the incoming and returned JSON, via Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/models/fields/#jsonfield">JSONField</a>. This means we can do in-depth API analysis using PostgreSQL's JSON SQL functions! Being able to examine returned JSON error messages or aggregate across incoming request bodies helped enormously when debugging problems with the API import scripts.</p>
 Storing the original JSON 
<p>Today, almost all of the data stored in VIAL originated in Airtable. One trick that has really helped build the system is that each of the tables that might contain imported data has both an <code>airtable_id</code> nullable column and an <code>import_json</code> JSON field.</p>
<p>Any time we import a record from airtable, we record both the ID and the full, original Airtable JSON that we used for the import.</p>
<p>This is another powerful tool for debugging: we can view the original Airtable JSON directly in the Django admin interface for a record, and confirm that it matches the ORM fields that we set from that.</p>
<p>I came up with a simple pattern for <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/django/pretty-print-json-admin">Pretty-printing all read-only JSON in the Django admin</a> that helps with this too.</p>
 Staying as flexible as possible 
<p>The thing that worried me most about replacing Airtable with Django was Airtable's incredible flexibility. In the organization's short life it has already solved so many problems by adding new columns in Airtable, or building new views.</p>
<p>Is it possible to switch to custom software without losing that huge cultural advantage?</p>
<p>This is the same reason it's so hard for custom software to compete with spreadsheets.</p>
<p>We've only just made the switch, so we won't know for a while how well we've done at handling this. I have a few mechanisms in place that I'm hoping will help.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard">django-sql-dashboard</a>. I wrote about this project in previous weeknotes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/14/weeknotes/">here</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/21/django-sql-dashboard-widgets/">here</a> - the goal is to bring some of the ideas from <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> into the Django/PostgreSQL world, by providing a read-only mechanism for constructing SQL queries, bookmarking and saving the results and outputting simple SQL-driven visualizations.</p>
<p>We have a lot of SQL knowledge at VaccinateCA, so my hope is that people with SQL will be able to solve their own problems, and people who don't know SQL yet will have no trouble finding someone who can help them.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/#17">boring technology</a> model of things, <code>django-sql-dashboard</code> counts as the main innovation token I'm spending for this project. I'm optimistic that it will pay off.</p>
<p>I'm also leaning heavily on Django's migration system, with the aim of making database migrations common and boring, rather than their usual default of being rare and exciting. We're up to 77 migrations already, in a codebase that is just over two months old!</p>
<p>I think a culture that evolves the database schema quickly and with as little drama as possible is crucial to maintaining the agility that this kind of organization needs.</p>
<p>Aside from the Django Admin providing the editing interface, everything that comes into and goes out of VIAL happens through APIs. These are fully documented: I want people to be able to build against the APIs independently, especially for things like data import.</p>
<p>After seeing significant success with PostgreSQL JSON already, I'm considering using it to add even more API-driven flexbility to VIAL in the future. Allowing our client developers to start collecting a new piece of data from our volunteers in an existing JSON field, then migrating that into a separate column once it has proven its value, is very tempting indeed.</p>
 Open source tools we are using 
<p>An incomplete list of open source packages we are using for VIAL so far:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a> - as a validation layer for some of the API endpoints

<a href="https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose">python-jose</a> - for JWTs, which were already in use by our Airtable caller app 
 
<a href="https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion">django-reversion</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jedie/django-reversion-compare/">django-reversion-compare</a> to provide a diffable, revertable history of some of our core models 
 
<a href="https://github.com/django-admin-tools/django-admin-tools">django-admin-tools</a> - which adds a handy customizable menu to the admin, good for linking to additional custom tools 
 
<a href="https://github.com/3YOURMIND/django-migration-linter">django-migration-linter</a> - to help avoid accidentally shipping migrations that could cause downtime during a deploy 
 
<a href="https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pytest-django</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine">time-machine</a> and <a href="https://colin-b.github.io/pytest_httpx/">pytest-httpx</a> for our unit tests

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core Blazor web assembly UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application can be secured using cookies. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used as the identity provider. The trusted application is protected using the Open ID Connect code flow with a secret and using PKCE. The API calls are protected using the secure cookie and anti-forgery tokens to protect against CSRF. This architecture is also known as the Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel">https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/08/securing-blazor-web-assembly-using-cookies/">Securing Blazor Web assembly using Cookies and Azure AD</a>  Securing Blazor Web assembly using Cookies and Auth0  







<p>The application was built as described in the previous blog in this series. Please refer to that blog for implementation details about the WASM application, user session and anti-forgery tokens. Setting up the Auth0 authentication and the differences are described in this blog.</p>



<p>An Auth0 account is required and a Regular Web Application was setup for this. This is not an SPA application and must always be deployed with a backend which can keep a secret. The WASM client can only use the APIs on the same domain and uses cookies. All application authentication is implemented in the trusted backend and the secure data is encrypted in the cookie.</p>







<p>The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect Nuget package is used to add the authentication to the ASP.NET Core application. User secrets are used for configuration which uses the Auth0 sensitive data</p>


  &lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;WebProject_DirectoryAccessLevelKey&gt;1&lt;/WebProject_DirectoryAccessLevelKey&gt;
    &lt;UserSecretsId&gt;de0b7f31-65d4-46d6-8382-30c94073cf4a&lt;/UserSecretsId&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\Client\BlazorAuth0Bff.Client.csproj" /&gt;
    &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\Shared\BlazorAuth0Bff.Shared.csproj" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server" Version="5.0.5" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer" Version="5.0.5" NoWarn="NU1605" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect" Version="5.0.5" NoWarn="NU1605" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="IdentityModel" Version="5.1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="IdentityModel.AspNetCore" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;

  


<p>The ConfigureServices method in the Startup class of the ASP.NET Core Blazor server application is used to add the authentication. The Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and a client secret is used for the default challenge and a cookie is used to persist the tokens if authenticated. The Blazor client WASM uses the cookie to access the API.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Open ID Connect is configured to match the Auth0 settings for the client. A client secret is required and used to authenticate the application. The PKCE option is set explicitly to use PKCE with the client configuration. The required scopes are set so that the profile is returned and an email. These are OIDC standard scopes. The user profile API is used to return the profile data and so keep the id_token small. The tokens are persisted. If successful, the data is persisted to an identity cookie. The logout client is configured as documented by Auth0 in its example.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; {
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
	options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-BlazorServer";
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt; {
	options.Authority = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}";
	options.ClientId = Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"];
	options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Auth0:ClientSecret"];
	options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
	options.Scope.Clear();
	options.Scope.Add("openid");
	options.Scope.Add("profile");
	options.Scope.Add("email");
	options.CallbackPath = new PathString("/signin-oidc");
	options.ClaimsIssuer = "Auth0";
	options.SaveTokens = true;
	options.UsePkce = true;
	options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
	options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";

	options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
	{
		// handle the logout redirection 
		OnRedirectToIdentityProviderForSignOut = (context) =&gt;
		{
			var logoutUri = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}/v2/logout?client_id={Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"]}";

			var postLogoutUri = context.Properties.RedirectUri;
			if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(postLogoutUri))
			{
				if (postLogoutUri.StartsWith("/"))
				{
					// transform to absolute
					var request = context.Request;
					postLogoutUri = request.Scheme + "://" + request.Host + request.PathBase + postLogoutUri;
				}
				logoutUri += $"&amp;returnTo={ Uri.EscapeDataString(postLogoutUri)}";
			}

			context.Response.Redirect(logoutUri);
			context.HandleResponse();

			return Task.CompletedTask;
		}
	};
});
  


<p>The Configure method is implement to require authentication. The UseAuthentication extension method is required. Our endpoints are added like in the previous blog.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;
	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();
	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
		endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
	});
}
  


<p>The Auth0 configuration can be downloaded in the sample application, or you can configure this direct in the Auth0 UI and copy this. Three properties are required. I added these to the user secrets in my application development. If I deployed this to Azure, I would add these to an Azure Key Vault and can then use managed identities to access the secrets.</p>


  "Auth0": {
   "Domain": "your-domain-in-auth0",
   "ClientId": "--in-secrets--",
   "ClientSecret": "--in-secrets--"
}
  


<p>Now everything will run and you can now use ASP.NET Core Blazor BFF with Auth0. We don’t need any access tokens in the browser.  This was really simple to configure and only ASP.NET Core standard Nuget packages are used. Security best practices are supported by Auth0 and it is really easy to setup. In production I would force MFA and FIDO2 if possible. </p>

<p>I have a persistent, infuriating problem with typing.</p><p>The only laptop I own with a functional keyboard is my iPad Pro - the one device in this form factor that doesn’t actually ship with a keyboard. Even my work laptop suffers from the notorious <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/">broken butterfly keyboard problem</a>.</p><p>Keys stick. They misfire. They double-type. Hitting the space bar once results in two spaces, which my computer turns into a period. Other keys have lost sensitivity. It's inconsistent.</p><p>The thing is, it creeps up on you. When your keyboard is iffy, you’re less likely to open your laptop to hack on something, or to use it to write. When you’re writing anything - blog posts, fiction, source code, documentation, even emails and Slack messages - keys that double-press or don’t fire at all can be catastrophic. It’s led to me writing less, coding less, and getting far less use out of my computers. Which, given what I do for a living, is not great. And considering what I paid for my Macs, it’s outrageous.</p><p>My laptop needs to feel like an extension of me. My outboard brain; my reliable toolkit. It can’t fail.</p><p>My personal laptop is five years old, which is beyond my usual threshold for upgrading, so I don’t feel horrible about replacing it with a newer model. But as much as I’d love to acquire <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">a new M1 device</a>, I’m not certain I want to give that money to Apple. I like Macs, but I feel burned.</p><p>So what might it look like to jump ship and find something else?</p><p>I want: a keyboard that works; excellent battery life; speed; a relatively lightweight form factor; privacy.</p><p>I’d also like: a low environmental footprint; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair">repairable hardware</a>; <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/">openness</a>; a chassis that will last me at least 4-5 years; a default operating system that isn’t Windows.</p><p>Is that even a product that’s on the market?</p><p>My living depends on computers, so I’m willing to pay a premium for something that checks all the boxes. But in a world / industry where the default is Mac, I don’t even know where to begin.</p><p>What’s worked for you? Does this exist? Or should I just sit tight and wait for the new M1 Macs and be done with it?</p>

<p>Setup</p>



<p>We want implement the flow shown in the following figure. The National Driving license application is responsible for issuing driver licenses and administrating licenses for users which have authenticated correctly. The user can see his or her driver license and a verifiable credential displayed as a QR code which can be used to add the credential to a digital wallet. When the application generates the credential, it adds the credential DID to the blockchain ledger with the cryptographic proof of the issuer and the document. When you scan the QR Code, the DID will get validated and will be added to the wallet along with the request claims. The digital wallet must be able to find the DID on the correct network and the schema and needs to search for the ledger in the correct blockchain. A good wallet should take care of this for you. The schema is required so that the data in the DID document can be understood.</p>







<p>Trinsic Setup</p>



<p>Trinsic is used to connect to the blockchain and create the DIDs, credentials in this example. Trinsic provides good getting started <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">docs</a>.</p>



<p>In Trinsic, you need to create an organisation for the Issuer application.</p>







<p>Click on the details of the organisation to get the API key. This is required for the application. This API Key cannot be replaced or updated, so if you make a mistake and lose this, commit it in code, you would have to create a new organisation. It is almost important to note the network. This is where you can find the DID to get the credentials produced by this issuer. </p>







<p>To issuer credentials, you need to create a template or schema with the claims which are issued in the credential using the template. The issuer application provides values for the claims.</p>







<p>Implementing the ASP.NET Core Issuer </p>



<p>The verifiable credentials issuer is implemented in an ASP.NET Core application using Razor pages and Identity. This application needs to authenticate the users before issuing a verifiable credential for the user. FIDO2 with the correct authenticate flow would be a good choice as this would protect against phishing. You could use credentials as well, if the users of the applications had a trusted ID. You would still have to protect against phishing. The quality of the credentials issued depends on the security of the issuing application. If the application has weak user authentication, then the credentials cannot be trusted. For a bank, gov IDs, drivings license, a high level of security is required. Open ID Connect FAPI with FIDO2 would make a good solution to authenticate the user. Or a user with a trusted gov issued credential together with FIDO2 would also be good. </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application initializes the services and adds the Trinsic client using the API Key from the organisation which issues the credentials. The Trinsic.ServiceClients Nuget package is used for the Trinsic integration. ASP.NET Core Identity is used to add, remove users and add driving licenses for the users in the administration part of the application. MFA should be setup but as this is a demo, I have not forced this.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddScoped&lt;TrinsicCredentialsService&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;DriverLicenseService&gt;();

	services.AddTrinsicClient(options =&gt;
	{
		// For CredentialsClient and WalletClient
		// API key of National Driving License (Organisation which does the verification)
		options.AccessToken = Configuration["Trinsic:ApiKey"];
		// For ProviderClient
		// options.ProviderKey = providerKey;
	});

	services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
		options.UseSqlServer(
			Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
	services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();

	services.AddIdentity&lt;IdentityUser, IdentityRole&gt;(
		options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
	 .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
	 .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IEmailSender, EmailSender&gt;();
	services.AddScoped&lt;IUserClaimsPrincipalFactory&lt;IdentityUser&gt;,
		AdditionalUserClaimsPrincipalFactory&gt;();

	{
		options.AddPolicy("TwoFactorEnabled",
			x =&gt; x.RequireClaim("amr", "mfa")
		);
	});

	services.AddRazorPages();
}
  


<p>User secrets are used to add the secrets required for the application in development. The secrets can be added to the  Json secrets file and not to the code source. If deploying this to Azure, the secrets would be read from Azure Key vault. The application requires the Trinsic API Key and the credential template definition ID created in Trinsic studio.</p>

<p>The driving license service is responsible for creating driver license for each user. This is just an example of logic and is not related to SSI.</p>


  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using NationalDrivingLicense.Data;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace NationalDrivingLicense
{
    public class DriverLicenseService
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _applicationDbContext;

        public DriverLicenseService(ApplicationDbContext applicationDbContext)
        {
            _applicationDbContext = applicationDbContext;
        }

        public async Taskbool&gt; HasIdentityDriverLicense(string username)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(username))
            {
                var driverLicense = await _applicationDbContext.DriverLicenses.FirstOrDefaultAsync(
                    dl =&gt; dl.UserName == username &amp;&amp; dl.Valid == true
                );

                if (driverLicense != null)
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }

            return false;
        }

        public async Task&lt;DriverLicense&gt; GetDriverLicense(string username)
        {
            var driverLicense = await _applicationDbContext.DriverLicenses.FirstOrDefaultAsync(
                    dl =&gt; dl.UserName == username &amp;&amp; dl.Valid == true
                );

            return driverLicense;
        }

        public async Task UpdateDriverLicense(DriverLicense driverLicense)
        {
            _applicationDbContext.DriverLicenses.Update(driverLicense);
            await _applicationDbContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        }
    }
}
  


<p>The Trinsic credentials service is responsible for creating the verifiable credentials. It uses the users drivers license and creates a new credential using the Trinsic client API using the CreateCredentialAsync method. The claims must match the template created in the studio. A Trinsic specific URL is returned. This can be used to create a QR Code which can be scanned from a Trinsic digital wallet.</p>


  public class TrinsicCredentialsService
{
        private readonly ICredentialsServiceClient _credentialServiceClient;
        private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
        private readonly DriverLicenseService _driverLicenseService;

        public TrinsicCredentialsService(ICredentialsServiceClient credentialServiceClient,
            IConfiguration configuration,
            DriverLicenseService driverLicenseService)
        {
            _credentialServiceClient = credentialServiceClient;
            _configuration = configuration;
            _driverLicenseService = driverLicenseService;
        }

        public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetDriverLicenseCredential(string username)
        {
            if (!await _driverLicenseService.HasIdentityDriverLicense(username))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException("user has no valid driver license");
            }

            var driverLicense = await _driverLicenseService.GetDriverLicense(username);

                {"Issued At", driverLicense.IssuedAt.ToString()},
                {"Name", driverLicense.Name},
                {"First Name", driverLicense.FirstName},
                {"Date of Birth", driverLicense.DateOfBirth.Date.ToString()},
                {"License Type", driverLicense.LicenseType}
            };

            CredentialContract credential = await _credentialServiceClient
                .CreateCredentialAsync(new CredentialOfferParameters
                {

                    ConnectionId = connectionId,

                    CredentialValues = credentialValues
                });

            driverLicense.DriverLicenseCredentials = credential.OfferUrl;
            await _driverLicenseService.UpdateDriverLicense(driverLicense);

            return credential.OfferUrl;
        }
}
  


<p>The DriverLicenseCredentials Razor page uses the Trinsic service and returns the credentials URL if the user has a valid drivers license. </p>


  using System.Threading.Tasks;

        public string CredentialOfferUrl { get; set; }
        public DriverLicenseCredentialsModel(TrinsicCredentialsService trinsicCredentialsService,

            _trinsicCredentialsService = trinsicCredentialsService;
            _driverLicenseService = driverLicenseService;

        public async Task OnGetAsync()
        {
            DriverLicense = await _driverLicenseService.GetDriverLicense(HttpContext.User.Identity.Name);

            if (DriverLicense != null)
            {

                DriverLicenseMessage = "You have no valid driver license";
            }
        }

<p>When the application is started, you can register and create a new license in the license administration. </p>







<p>Add licences as required. The credentials will not be created here, only when you try to get a driver license as a user.</p>







<p>The QR code of the license is displayed which can be scanned and added to your Trinsic digital wallet.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works fairly good but has a number of problems. The digital wallets are vendor specific and the QR Code, credential links are dependent on the product used to create this. The wallet implementations and the URL created for the credentials are all specific and rely on good will of the different implementations of the different vendors. This requires an RFC specification or something like this, if SSI should become easy to use and mainstream. Without this, users would require n-wallets for all the different applications and would also have problems using credentials between different systems.</p>



<p>Another problem is the organisations API keys use the represent the issuer or the verifier applications. If this API keys get leaked which they will, the keys are hard to replace.</p>



<p>Using the wallet, the user also needs to know which network to use to load the credentials, or to login to your product.  A default user will not know where to find the required DID. </p>



<p>If signing in using the wallet credentials, the application does not protect against phishing. This is not good enough for high security authentication. FIDO2 and WebAuthn should be used if handling such sensitive data as this is designed for.</p>



<p>Self sovereign identities is in the very early stages but holds lots of potential. A lot will depend on how easy it is to use and how easy it is to implement and share credentials between systems. The quality of the credential will depend on the quality of the application issuing it.</p>



<p>In a follow up blog to this one, <a href="https://github.com/Franklin89">Matteo </a>will use the verifiable credentials added to the digital wallet and verify them in  a second application.</p>

 From scraper to Datasette 
<p>My scraper for this data is <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/f89e0c8166b25645f8e92ebc148f9cb9db119554/.github/workflows/scrape.yml#L20">a single line</a> in a GitHub Actions workflow:</p>
 <code>curl https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_county_condensed_data \
  | jq . &gt; counties.json
</code> 
<p>I pipe the data through <code>jq</code> to pretty-print it, just to get nicer diffs.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/f89e0c8166b25645f8e92ebc148f9cb9db119554/build_database.py">build_database.py</a> script then iterates over the accumulated git history of that <code>counties.json</code> file and uses <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> to build a SQLite table:</p>
 for i, (when, hash, content) in enumerate(
    iterate_file_versions(".", ("counties.json",))
):
    try:
        counties = json.loads(
            content
        )["vaccination_county_condensed_data"]
    except ValueError:
        # Bad JSON
        continue
    for county in counties:
        id = county["FIPS"] + "-" + county["Date"]
        db[
            "daily_reports_counties"
        ].insert(
            dict(county, id=id), pk="id",
            alter=True, replace=True
        ) 
<p>The resulting table can be seen at <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc/daily_reports_counties">cdc/daily_reports_counties</a>.</p>
 From Datasette to Observable 
<p>Observable notebooks are my absolute favourite tool for prototyping new visualizations. There are examples of pretty much anything you could possibly want to create, and the Observable ecosystem actively encourages forking and sharing new patterns.</p>
<p>Loading data from Datasette into Observable is easy, using Datasette's various HTTP APIs. For this visualization I needed to pull two separate things from Datasette.</p>
<p>Firstly, for any given date I need the full per-county vaccination data. Here's the full table <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc/daily_reports_counties?Date=2021-04-02">filtered for April 2nd</a> for example.</p>
<p>Since that's 3,221 rows Datasette's JSON export would need to be paginated... but Datasette's CSV export can stream all 3,000+ rows in a single request. So I'm using that, fetched using the <code>d3.csv()</code> function:</p>
  county_data = await d3.csv(
    `https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc/daily_reports_counties.csv?_stream=on&amp;Date=${county_date}&amp;_size=max`
);  
<p>In order to animate the different dates, I need a list of available dates. I can get those with a SQL query:</p>
  select distinct Date
from daily_reports_counties
order by Date  
<p>Datasette's JSON API has a <code>?_shape=arrayfirst</code> option which will return a single JSON array of the first values in each row, which means I can do this:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc.json?sql=select%20distinct%20Date%20from%20daily_reports_counties%20order%20by%20Date&amp;_shape=arrayfirst">https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc.json?sql=select%20distinct%20Date%20from%20daily_reports_counties%20order%20by%20Date&amp;_shape=arrayfirst</a></p>
<p>And get back just the dates as an array:</p>
  [
  "2021-03-26",
  "2021-03-27",
  "2021-03-28",
  "2021-03-29",
  "2021-03-30",
  "2021-03-31",
  "2021-04-01",
  "2021-04-02",
  "2021-04-03"
]  
<p>Mike Bostock has a handy <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/scrubber">Scrubber</a> implementation which can provide a slider with the ability to play and stop iterating through values. In the notebook that can be used like so:</p>
  viewof county_date = Scrubber(county_dates, {
  delay: 500,
  autoplay: false
})

county_dates = (await fetch(
  "https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc.json?sql=select%20distinct%20Date%20from%20daily_reports_counties%20order%20by%20Date&amp;_shape=arrayfirst"
)).json()

import { Scrubber } from "@mbostock/scrubber"  
 Drawing the map 
<p>The map itself is rendered using <a href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson">TopoJSON</a>, an extension to GeoJSON that efficiently encodes topology.</p>
<p>Consider the map of 3,200 counties in the USA: since counties border each other, most of those border polygons end up duplicating each other to a certain extent.</p>
<p>TopoJSON only stores each shared boundary once, but still knows how they relate to each other which means the data can be used to draw shapes filled with colours.</p>
<p>I'm using the <code>https://d3js.org/us-10m.v1.json</code> TopoJSON file built and published with d3. Here's my JavaScript for rendering that into an SVG map:</p>
  {
  const svg = d3
    .create("svg")
    .attr("viewBox", [0, 0, width, 700])
    .style("width", "100%")
    .style("height", "auto");

  svg
    .append("g")
    .selectAll("path")
    .data(
      topojson.feature(topojson_data, topojson_data.objects.counties).features
    )
    .enter()
    .append("path")
    .attr("fill", function(d) {
      if (!county_data[d.id]) {
        return 'white';
      }
      let v = county_data[d.id].Series_Complete_65PlusPop_Pct;
      return d3.interpolate("white", "green")(v / 100);
    })
    .attr("d", path)
    .append("title") // Tooltip
    .text(function(d) {
      if (!county_data[d.id]) {
        return '';
      }
      return `${
        county_data[d.id].Series_Complete_65PlusPop_Pct
      }% of the 65+ population in ${county_data[d.id].County}, ${county_data[d.id].StateAbbr.trim()} have had the complete vaccination`;
    });
  return svg.node();
}  
 Next step: a plugin 
<p>Now that I have a working map, my next goal is to package this up as a Datasette plugin. I'm hoping to create a generic choropleth plugin which bundles TopoJSON for some common maps - probably world countries, US states and US counties to start off with - but also allows custom maps to be supported as easily as possible.</p>
 Datasette 0.56 
<p>Also this week, I shipped <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-56">Datasette 0.56</a>. It's a relatively small release - mostly documentation improvements and bug fixes, but I've alse bundled SpatiaLite 5 with the official Datasette Docker image.</p>

  <p>Earlier this week I spoke to Molly who wrote this article about so called “vaccine passports” we don’t call them that though (Only government’s issue passports). Digital Vaccination Certificates would be more accurate. Early on when the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative was founded I joined to help. In December the initiative joined LFPH and I become […]</p>

<p>Of the deeper thoughts I might give to this moment, I have <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/25-governance-leadership-founders-syndrome.html">given them elsewhere</a>.  For this blogpost, I just want to speak of feelings... feelings of hurt and hope.</p>
<p>I am reaching out, collecting the feelings of those I see around me, writing them in my mind's journal.  Though I hold clear positions in this moment, there are few roots of feeling and emotion about the moment I feel I haven't steeped in myself at some time.  Sometimes I tell this to friends, and they think maybe I am drifting from a mutual position, and this is painful for them.  Perhaps they fear this could constitute or signal some kind of betrayal.  I don't know what to say: I've been here too long to feel just one thing, even if I can commit to one position.</p>
<p>So I open my journal of feelings, and here I share some of the pages collecting the pain I see around me:</p>
<p>The irony of a movement wanting to be so logical and above feelings being drowned in them.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who found a comfortable and welcoming home in a world of loneliness, and the split between despondence and outrage for that unraveling.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who wanted to join that home too, but did not feel welcome.</p>
<p>The pent up feelings of those unheard for so long, uncorked and flowing.</p>
<p>The weight and shadow of a central person who seems to feel things so strongly but cannot, and does not care to learn to, understand the feelings of those around them.</p>
<p>I flip a few pages ahead.  The pages are blank, and I interpret this as new chapters for us to write, together.</p>
<p>I hope we might re-discover the heart of our movement.</p>
<p>I hope we can find a place past the pain of the present, healing to build the future.</p>
<p>I hope we can build a new home, strong enough to serve us and keep us safe, but without the walls, moat, and throne of a fortress.</p>
<p>I hope we can be a movement that lives up to our claims: of justice, of freedom, of human rights, to bring these to everyone, especially those we haven't reached.</p>

<p>Why is it good to think of a Glossary as a Network of Balls connected by Elastics?</p>



<p>From: Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) &lt;mwherman@parallelspace.net&gt;<br>Sent: March 24, 2021 8:47 AM<br>To: Leonard Rosenthol &lt;lrosenth@adobe.com&gt;; David Waite &lt;dwaite@pingidentity.com&gt;; Jim St.Clair &lt;jim.stclair@lumedic.io&gt;<br>Cc: Drummond Reed &lt;drummond.reed@evernym.com&gt;; sankarshan &lt;sankarshan@dhiway.com&gt;; W3C Credentials CG (Public List) &lt;public-credentials@w3.org&gt;; Hardman, Daniel &lt;Daniel.Hardman@sicpa.com&gt;<br>Subject: TDW Glossary [was: The “self-sovereign” problem (was: The SSI protocols challenge)]</p>



<p>RE: First and foremost, without a definition/clarification of “Verifiable”, both of your statements are ambiguous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leonard, I don’t disagree with your feedback. What I have been rolling out to the community is selected neighborhoods of closely related terms from the TDW Glossary project.</p>



<blockquote><p>[A Glossary is] like a bunch of balls explicitly connected by elastics: add a new ball to the model and all of the existing balls in the neighborhood need to adjust themselves.&nbsp;The more balls you have in the network, the more stable the network becomes.&nbsp;So it is with visual glossaries of terms, definitions, and relationships.</p>Michael Herman, March 2021</blockquote>



<p>Verifiable and Verifiable Data Registry are in the model but currently, they don’t have specific verified definitions.</p>



<p>The TDW Glossary is a huge, visual, highly interrelated, multi-disciplinary, multi-standard, 6-domain, semantic network model (<a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/10/tdw-glossary-management-platform-gmp-initial-results/">https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/10/tdw-glossary-management-platform-gmp-initial-results/</a>) that includes:</p>

<p>Here’s a snapshot of what the TDW Glossary “all-in” view looks like today (aka the “network of balls connected by elastics”). The TDW Glossary has (or will very soon have) more than 500 terms and definitions plus associated metadata and relationships.</p>



<p>Thank you for the feedback, Leonard.&nbsp;Keep it coming.</p>



<p>Cheers,<br>Michael</p>

How do we order and with what authority data, finance,&nbsp; team, processes/methods, justifications, regulation, culture/brand/reputation, compliance/oversight/ governance,&nbsp; reporting and stewardship? What is more important to us as a team; the trustworthiness or truthfulness of a decision?&nbsp; The quality of a decision? The explainability of a decision? The ability to communicate a decision or diversity in a decision?&nbsp; If data is controlled by finance and seen as an asset or liability, how does it affect your decision making capability?</p><p>As the CDO, if you determine that the axis of control remains with the CEO/ CFO it may be time to align your skill to a CEO gets data.&nbsp;</p><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>It is your choice, but your new CDO is your new CFO in terms of power for decision making, which means there will be a swing in the power game. Your existing CEO/ CFO axis is under threat, and we know that underhanded and political games will emerge in all changes of power.&nbsp; You will lead the choice about how you want this to play out given that all CEO’s need to find their next role every 5 to 7 years, which will only ever require more interactions with the CDO and data, defending the CFO power plays will not bring favour to your next role.&nbsp; The CFO remains critically essential, but the existing two-way axis (CEO/CFO) has to become a three-way game that enables the CDO to shine until a new power balance is reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>What is Self Sovereign Identity SSI?</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity is an emerging solution built on blockchain technology for solving digital identities which gives the management of identities to the users and not organisations. It makes it possible the solve consent and data privacy of your data and makes it possible to authenticate your identity data across organisations or revoke it. It does not solve the process of authenticating users in applications. You can authenticate into your application using credentials from any trusted issuer, but this is vulnerable to phishing attacks. FIDO2 would be a better solution for this together with an OIDC flow for the application type. Or if you could use your credentials together with a registered FIDO2 key for the application, this would work. The user data is stored in a digital wallet, which is usually stored on your mobile phone. Recovery of this wallet does not seem so clear but a lot of work is going on here which should result in good solutions for this. The credentials DIDs are stored to a blockchain and to verify the credentials you need to search in the same blockchain network.</p>
<p>What are the players?</p>
<p>Digital Identity, Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</p>
<p>A digital identity can be expressed as a universal identifier which can be owned and can be publicly shared. A digital identity provides a way of showing a subject (user, organisation, thing), a way of exchanging credentials to other identities and a way to verify the identity without storing data on a shared server. This can be all done across organisational boundaries. A digital identity can be found using decentralized identifiers (DID) and this has working group standards in the process of specifying this. The DIDs are saved to a blockchain network which can be resolved.</p>
<p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">https://w3c.github.io/did-core/</a></p>
<p>The DIDs representing identities are published to a blockchain network.</p>
<p>Digital wallet</p>
<p>A digital wallet is a database which stores all your verified credentials which you added to your data. This wallet is usually stored on your mobile phone and needs encryption. You want to prevent all third party access to this wallet. Some type of recovery process is required, if you use a digital wallet. A user can add or revoke credentials in the wallet. When you own a wallet, you would publish a public key to a blockchain network. A DID is returned representing the digital identity for this wallet and a public DID was saved to the network which can be used to authenticate anything interacting with the wallet. Digital wallets seem to be vendor locked at the moment which will be problematic for mainstream adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials, Verifiable credentials</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p>
<p>A verifiable credential is an immutable set of claims created by an issuer which can be verified. A verifiable credential has claims, metadata and proof to validate the credential. A credential can be saved to a digital wallet, so no data is persisted anywhere apart from the issuer and the digital wallet.</p>
<p>This credential can then be used anywhere.</p>
<p>The credential is created by the issuer for the holder of the credential. This credential is presented to the verifier by the holder from a digital wallet and the verifier can validate the credential using the issuer DID which can be resolved from the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Networks</p>
<p>The networks are different distributed blockchains with verifiable data registries using DIDs. You need to know how to resolve each DID, issuer DID to verify or use a credential and so you need to know where to find the network on which the DID is persisted. The networks are really just persisted distributed databases. <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin </a>or other blockchains can be used as a network. The blockchain holds public key DIDs, DID documents, ie credentials and schemas.</p>
<p>Energy consumption</p>
<p>This is something I would like to evaluate, and if this technology was to become widespread, how much energy would this cost. I have no answers to this at the moment.</p>

<p>In 2018 I built a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">tool</a> to help researchers evaluate a proposed set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">credibility signals</a> intended to enable <a href="https://misinfocon.com/how-annotation-enables-machine-learning-fc4b0ceab10a">automated systems</a> to rate the credibility of news stories.</p>
<p>Here are examples of such signals:</p>
<p>– Authors cite expert sources (positive)</p>
<p>– Title is clickbaity (negative)</p>
<p>And my favorite:</p>
<p>– Authors acknowledge uncertainty (positive)</p>
<p>Will the news ecosystem ever be able to label stories automatically based on automatic detection of such signals, and if so, should it? These are open questions. The best way to improve news literacy may be the <a href="https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/">SIFT</a> method advocated by Mike Caulfield, which shifts attention away from intrinsic properties of individual news stories and advises readers to:</p>
<p>– Stop</p>
<p>– Investigate the source</p>
<p>– Find better coverage</p>
<p>– Trace claims, quotes, and media to original context</p>
<p>“The goal of SIFT,” writes Charlie Warzel in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/fake-news-media-attention.html">Don’t Go Down the Rabbit Hole</a>, “isn’t to be the arbiter of truth but to instill a reflex that asks if something is worth one’s time and attention and to turn away if not.”</p>
<p>SIFT favors extrinsic signals over the intrinsic ones that were the focus of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/">W3C Credible Web Community Group</a>. But intrinsic signals may yet play an important role, if not as part of a large-scale automated labeling effort then at least as another kind of news literacy reflex.</p>
<p>This morning, in <a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/ap_news/commentary-how-public-health-officials-can-convince-those-reluctant-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/article_0d3d0540-8c55-5f55-9078-f6ca2052cf4e.html">How public health officials can convince those reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine</a>, I read the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What made these Trump supporters shift their views on vaccines? Science — offered straight-up and with a dash of humility.</p>
<p>The unlikely change agent was Dr. Tom Frieden, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration. Frieden appealed to facts, not his credentials. He noted that the theory behind the vaccine was backed by 20 years of research, that tens of thousands of people had participated in well-controlled clinical trials, and that the overwhelming share of doctors have opted for the shots.</p>
<p>He leavened those facts with an acknowledgment of uncertainty. He conceded that the vaccine’s potential long-term risks were unknown. He pointed out that the virus’s long-term effects were also uncertain.</p>
<p>“He’s just honest with us and telling us nothing is 100% here, people,” one participant noted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s evidence that acknowledgement of uncertainty really is a powerful signal of credibility. Maybe machines will be able to detect it and label it; maybe those labels will matter to people. Meanwhile, it’s something people can detect and do care about. Teaching students to value sources that acknowledge uncertainty, and discount ones that don’t, ought to be part of any strategy to improve news literacy.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL: Confidential Storage Specification Refactoring 0.2 – March 24, 2021</p>



<p>Based on the March 11 Zoom discussion where we worked hard to discern the differences between Agents, Hubs, and EDVs (and I believe were largely successful IMO), I’ve like to propose to the SDS/CS WG that we refactor the current Confidential Storage specification into 3 separable parts/specifications.&nbsp; I also present a high-level roadmap (simple ordering) for how the WG might proceed if this refactoring is accepted (or at least, if the first part/first new specification is accepted).</p>



<p>Version 0.2 adds some comments about inter-specification and specification version dependencies.</p>



<p>Separable Part 1: Factor the current EDV-related components of the current Confidential Specification into its own specification document. This document would be a ZCAP/HTTP-specific specification document for EDVs. I also propose that the title of this specification document clearly reflect that orientation.&nbsp; For example, the proposed title for this specification document is: EDV Specification 1.0: ZCAP/HTTP Data Vault Storage.</p>



<p>Separable Part 2: Factor the Hub-related components of the current Confidential Specification into its own specification document. This document would define the Hub components that an Agent or App can talk to as well as describe how a Hub “sits on top of an EDV service instance”. I also propose that the title of this specification document clearly reflect that orientation.&nbsp; For example, the proposed title for this specification document is: Data Hub Specification 1.0: Federated (or Aggregated) Personal Data Access (or something like that).</p>



<p>Separable Part 3: Develop a specification for the Layer A Trusted Content Storage Kernel as its own specification document (see the diagram below). This document would document a public lower-level interface for directly interacting with local-device hosted/attached EDVs without needing or requiring a higher-level remote access protocol (e.g. HTTP). I also propose that the title of this specification document clearly reflect that orientation.&nbsp; For example, the proposed title for this specification document is: EDV Kernel Specification 1.0: Layer A Trusted Content Storage Kernel. This is in support of apps like the Fully Decentralized Dewitter scenario.</p>



<p>Roadmap: The scope of the above specifications and a high-level roadmap (simple ordering) for these specifications is illustrated below.</p>

<p>Dependencies</p>



  EDV Specification 1.0: ZCAP/HTTP Data Vault Storage. The intent is for this specification to be fast-tracked based on the 3 existing prototype/PoC implementations. This specification would neither have nor take any dependencies on either of the 2 specifications below.&nbsp; In particular, this specification would neither have nor take any dependencies on the EDV Kernel Specification.&nbsp; A future version or variation of the EDV Specification may take a dependency against whatever is the current version of the EDV Kernel Specification – if the WG chooses to.  Data Hub Specification 1.0: Federated (or Aggregated) Personal Data Access. This specification would likely take a dependency against whatever is the current version of the EDV Specification (likely EDV Specification 1.0) – if the WG chooses to.  EDV Kernel Specification 1.0: Layer A Trusted Content Storage Kernel. This specification would not have nor take any hard dependencies against either of the above specifications. The EDV Kernel Specification would be guided by the needs/requirements of the prevailing EDV Specification 1.0: ZCAP/HTTP Data Vault Storage implementations in addition to the Fully Decentralized Twitter (Dewitter) user scenario. Ideally, Layer A of one of the prevailing implementations may act as the reference implementation for the EDV Kernel Specification (assuming its source code and documentation are freely licensed and open-sourced).

<p>After relistening to the March 11 recording with more intent and building the partial transcription (see my previous email), I’ve come up with an updated architecture reference model (ARM) for this Agent-Hub-EDV stack that is emerging.&nbsp; Here’s a snapshot as of a few minutes ago…</p>

<p>Transcription of Selected Parts of the DIF SDS/CS March 11, 2021 Zoom Call:<br>Hub and EDV Discussion featuring Daniel Buchner’s Description of a Hub</p>



<p>I’ve posted this partial transcription here: <a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/24/transcription-of-selected-parts-of-the-dif-sds-cs-march-11-2021-zoom-call-hub-and-edv-discussion-featuring-daniel-buchners-description-of-a-hub/">https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/24/transcription-of-selected-parts-of-the-dif-sds-cs-march-11-2021-zoom-call-hub-and-edv-discussion-featuring-daniel-buchners-description-of-a-hub/</a></p>



<p>Context</p>



<p>This is a transcription of selected parts of the EDV-Hub conversation during the DIF SDS/CS Thursday weekly Zoom call on March 11, 2021. This is the call where Daniel Buchner described (verbally) several aspects about what is and what is not a Hub.</p>



<p>This partial transcription focuses primarily on Daniel’s comments as they relate to the question “what is a Hub?”.</p>



<p>Have a great day, afternoon, or evening,</p>

 4. OSI Stack Proposal for Confidential Storage Specification 



<p>From: Michael Herman (Trusted Digital Web) &lt;<a href="mailto:mwherman@parallelspace.net">mwherman@parallelspace.net</a>&gt;<br>Sent: March 24, 2021 7:10 AM<br>To: <a href="mailto:sds-wg@lists.identity.foundation">sds-wg@lists.identity.foundation</a>; <a href="mailto:sds-wg@dif.groups.io">sds-wg@dif.groups.io</a>; Credentials Community Group &lt;<a href="mailto:public-credentials@w3.org">public-credentials@w3.org</a>&gt;; Daniel Buchner &lt;<a href="mailto:daniel.buchner@microsoft.com">daniel.buchner@microsoft.com</a>&gt;<br>Subject: RE: Is there an equivalent to the “OSI Network Stack” but for storage and storage access?</p>



<p>I tweaked (twerked?) up a version of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osi-model-jb.svg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Osi-model-jb.svg</a> to produce this …just an idea. It follows from a transcription of DanielB’s March 11 description of a Hub and where it sits between an Agent and an EDV.</p>



<p>Your thoughts? …maybe this becomes a key aspect/contribution in our CS specifications?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=5.0.0-doc">SpatiaLite 5</a> came out earlier this year with a bunch of exciting improvements, most notably an implementation of <a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=KNN">KNN</a> (K-nearest neighbours) - a way to efficiently answer the question "what are the 10 closest rows to this latitude/longitude point".</p>
<p>I love building <a href="https://www.owlsnearme.com/">X near me</a> websites so I expect I'll be using this a lot in the future.</p>
<p>I spent a bunch of time this week figuring out how best to install it into a Docker container for use with Datasette. I finally cracked it in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1249">issue 1249</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/3fcfc8513465339ac5f055296cbb67f5262af02b/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> in the Datasette repository now builds with the SpatiaLite 5.0 extension, using a pattern <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/docker/debian-unstable-packages">I figured out</a> for installing Debian unstable packages into a Debian stable base container.</p>
<p>When Datasette 0.56 is released the official Datasette Docker image will bundle SpatiaLite 5.0.</p>
 CDC vaccination history in Datasette 
<p>I'm tracking the CDC's per-state vaccination numbers in my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history">cdc-vaccination-history</a> repository, as described in my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">Git scraping lightning talk</a>.</p>
<p>Scraping data into a git repository to track changes to it over time is easy. What's harder is extracting that data back out of the commit history in order to analyze and visualize it later.</p>
<p>To demonstrate how this can work I added a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/1fd1003f34ec512cf0b89c68fe609e130c7fe3f1/build_database.py">build_database.py</a> script to that repository which iterates through the git history and uses it to build a SQLite database containing daily state reports. I also added <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/blob/1fd1003f34ec512cf0b89c68fe609e130c7fe3f1/.github/workflows/scrape.yml#L29-L57">steps to the GitHub Actions workflow</a> to publish that SQLite database using Datasette and Vercel.</p>
<p>I installed the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> visualization plugin there too. Here's <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc/daily_reports?_sort=id&amp;Location__exact=CA#g.mark=bar&amp;g.x_column=Date&amp;g.x_type=temporal&amp;g.y_column=Doses_Administered&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">a chart</a> showing the number of doses administered over time in California.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This morning I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history/commit/1b274d3aab5cc58ae6c79411dbc15d28d8bd0c8b#diff-87ee5504a3e25ac558b343724c905f2f7949e8cec3d92b9c4300bb922afa164f">started capturing</a> the CDC's per-county data too, but I've not yet written code to load that into Datasette. [UPDATE: that table is now available: <a href="https://cdc-vaccination-history.datasette.io/cdc/daily_reports_counties">cdc/daily_reports_counties</a>]</p>
 Datasette on Azure 
<p>I'm keen to make Datasette easy to deploy in as many places as possible. I already have mechanisms for publishing to Heroku, Cloud Run, Vercel and Fly.io - today I worked out the recipe needed for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/">Azure Functions</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't bundled it into a <code>datasette-publish-azure</code> plugin yet but that's the next step. In the meantime the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/azure-functions-datasette">azure-functions-datasette</a> repo has a working example with instructions on how to deploy it.</p>
<p>Thanks go to Anthony Shaw for <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-library/issues/75#issuecomment-808553496">building out the ASGI wrapper</a> needed to run ASGI applications like Datasette on Azure Functions.</p>
 iam-to-sqlite 
<p>I spend way too much time <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Asimonw%20iam&amp;src=typed_query">whinging about IAM</a> on Twitter. I'm certain that properly learning IAM will unlock the entire world of AWS, but I have so far been unable to overcome my discomfort with it long enough to actually figure it out.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1374494730088706058">yet another unproductive whinge</a> this week I guilted myself into putting in some effort, and it's already started to pay off: I figured out how to dump out all existing IAM data (users, groups, roles and policies) as JSON using the <code>aws  iam get-account-authorization-details</code> command, and got so excited about it that I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/iam-to-sqlite">iam-to-sqlite</a> as a wrapper around that command that writes the results into SQLite so I can browse them using Datasette!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm increasingly realizing that the key to me understanding how pretty much any service works is to pull their JSON into a SQLite database so I can explore it as relational tables.</p>
 A useful trick for writing weeknotes 
<p>When writing weeknotes like these, it's really useful to be able to see all of the commits from the past week across many different projects.</p>
<p>Today I realized you can use GitHub search for this. Run a search for <code>author:simonw created:&gt;2021-03-20</code> and filter to commits, ordered by "Recently committed".</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/search?l=&amp;o=desc&amp;q=author%3Asimonw+created%3A%3E2021-03-20&amp;s=committer-date&amp;type=Commits">Here's that search for me</a>.</p>
 Django pull request accepted! 
<p>I had <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/14171">a pull request</a> accepted to Django this week! It was a documentation fix for the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/expressions/#django.db.models.expressions.RawSQL">RawSQL query expression</a> - I found a pattern for using it as part of an <code>.filter(id__in=RawSQL(...))</code> query that wasn't covered by the documentation.</p>
 And we found a new home 
<p>One other project this week: Natalie and I closed on a new home! We're moving to El Granada, a tiny town just north of Half Moon Bay, on the coast 40 minutes south of San Francisco. We'll be ten minutes from the ocean, with plenty of <a href="https://pinnipeds-near-me.now.sh/">pinnipeds</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/">pelicans</a>.

There was a 1.75-diopter set for books, magazines, newspapers, and my laptop (when it’s in my lap), plus a 1.25-diopter set for the screens I look at when working in my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">Captain Kirk chair</a>. They were cheap, and the idea was that they’d be an abundant resource. I could leave spectacles lying around in various places, there would always be a pair handy, no worries about losing them.</p>
<p>So of course I did lose them like crazy. At one point I bought another 5-pack but still, somehow, I’m down to a single 1.75 and a single 1.25. And I just realized it’s been that way for quite a while. Now that the resource is scarce, I value it more highly and take care to preserve it.</p>
<p>I’m sorely tempted to restock. It’s so easy! A couple of clicks and two more 5-packs will be here tomorrow. And they’re cheap, so what’s not to like?</p>
<p>For now, I’m resisting the temptation because I don’t like the effect such radical abundance has had on me. It’s ridiculous to lose 13 pairs of glasses in a couple of years. I can’t imagine how I’d explain that to my pre-Amazon self.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to try to assign greater value to the glasses I do have, and treat them accordingly. And when I finally do lose them, I hope I’ll resist the one-click solution. I thought it was brilliant at the time, and part of me still does. But it just doesn’t feel good.</p>

<p>Note: This post is the sole opinion and perspective of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Over the past several months I have been diligently attempting to map the dynamically evolving world of trust frameworks and verifiable credentials into a straightforward and hopefully timeless terminology that can be used for policymaking. The storyboard diagram above is what I’ve come up with so&nbsp;far.</p>  Counterparty — for every consequential relationship or transaction there are at a minimum of two parties involved. Regardless of whether the interaction is collaborative, competitive, zero positive sum, they can be considered as counterparties to one&nbsp;another.  Claim — is the something that is the matter of concern between the counterparties — it can be financial, tangible, intangible; something in the present, or a promise of something in the&nbsp;future.  Offer — a counterparty offers something that usually relates to a&nbsp;Claim.  Commit — a counterparty can commit to its&nbsp;Offer.  Present — a counterparty can present an Offer (or a&nbsp;Claim).  Accept — on the other side, the other counterparty accepts an&nbsp;Offer.  Issue — An Offer, once formed, can be issued in whatever form — usually a document or credential that is signed by the counterparty.  Hold — An offer can be held. How it is held depends on its embodiment (e.g.., digital, paper, verbal,&nbsp;etc.)  Verify — An offer, or more specifically its embodiment can be verified for its origin and integrity.  <p>All of the above is made possible&nbsp;by:</p>  Business Trust — how the counterparties decide to trust one another. This is the non-technical aspect of agreements, rules, treaties, legislation, etc.  <p>And underpinned by:</p>  Technical Trust: how the counterparties prove to another that their trust has not been compromised. This the technical aspect that includes, cryptographic protocols, data formats,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.</p><p>As always, I am open for comment and constructive feedback. You know where to find&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Starting today, we’re opening our platform for general availability. Specifically, that means if you’re ready to build a solution to solve a real-world problem for your users, we’re ready to support you. Simply <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">contact us</a> to get the ball rolling and to have your production environment set up. Of course, if you’re not quite ready for that, you can still test drive the platform by signing up for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial</a> of MATTR VII to get started right away. It’s an exciting time in the MATTR universe, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We’re continuing to build-out features to operationalize and support production use cases. To this end, in the near future we will be enhancing the sign-up and onboarding experience as well as providing tools to monitor your usage of the platform. Please <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">reach out</a> to give us feedback on how we can improve our products to support the solutions you’re building.</p><p>We’re excited to be in this new phase of our journey with MATTR VII. It will no doubt be another big year for decentralized identity, bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of bringing cryptography and digital trust to every person on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">Medium</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">Twitter</a> for further&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/launching-mattr-vii-4e11bcb9aaef">Why we’re launching MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Why all my servers have an 8GB empty file 
 This is such a good idea: keep a 8GB empty spacer.img file on any servers you operate, purely so that if the server runs out of space you can delete the file and get some breathing room for getting everything else working again. I've had servers run out of space in the past and it's an absolute pain to sort out - this trick would have really helped.

<p>This post describes Transmute’s approach to interoperable software and includes video and technical results from a recent interoperability demonstration with <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">US DHS SVIP</a> cohort companies.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">ian dooley</a> on&nbsp;<a>Unsplash</a><p>The future of software is all about&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Customers want to chose technology that best solves their business problems, knowing that they will not be locked in with a vendor if that solution is no longer the best&nbsp;fit.</p><p>Businesses are also demanding choice about when and how they consume important data — a reaction to the data silos and expensive systems integrations of the&nbsp;past.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">Interoperability</a> moves from theory to reality when companies have meaningful ability to choose. It is predicated on open standards foundations that enable easy movement of data and&nbsp;vendors.</p> Interoperability with DHS SVIP Companies <p>Our team was proud to participate in the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">US Department of Homeland Security Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> Interoperability Plug-fest this month. DHS SVIP has been leading the charge on interoperability for years now, putting their funding and networks on the table to lead the&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This was Transmute’s second time participating as an awarded company of the SVIP program, and we were joined by 7 other companies from around the globe, addressing topics from supply chain traceability to digital assets for&nbsp;humans.</p><p>While each company is focused on slightly different industries — and therefore nuanced solutions for those customers — we are all committed (and contractually obligated by the US Government) to implement open standards infrastructure in a way that ensures verifiable information can be issued, consumed, and verified across systems using different technical “stacks”.</p><p>Technical foundations for interoperability include the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-imp-guide/">W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/on-json-ld-and-the-semantics-of-identity-42d051d3ce14">JSON Linked Data</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api">Verifiable Credentials HTTP API</a>, and the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a>. Companies also worked from shared vocabularies based on use case, such as the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-vocab">Traceability Vocabulary</a> that aggregates global supply chain ontologies for use in linked data credentials.</p><p>The following two videos show examples of interoperability in action using both Transmute and other cohort company systems. Note that the use cases have been simplified to allow for ease of demonstration to diverse audiences.</p><p>Transmute and other companies also publicly shared the results of our interoperability testing — Transmute’s results are&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/test-suite/transmute/">here</a>.</p> Interoperability in steel supply&nbsp;chain <p>Transmute is working directly with US Customs and Border Protection to trace the origins of steel materials using verifiable credentials. This video shows an example of multiple steel supply chain actors exchanging verifiable trade information culminating in a seamless review process from&nbsp;CBP.</p> Interoperability across industries <p>We also worked with other cohort companies to demonstrate how important credentials like a vaccination certificate can be used to help supply chain professionals get back to work safely. This demo includes the use of selective disclosure technology as well as off-line verification of a paper credential.</p> Charting the&nbsp;Course <p>Interoperability across systems moves the internet towards a more open-network approach for trustworthy exchange of information. Choice is increasingly becoming the network feature that governments and enterprises will not do without. <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">It is pre-competitive table stakes for doing business.</a> The path is clear for those of us developing technology in this space: interoperate, or get out. Fortunately, the competitive “pie” is big enough for all of&nbsp;us.</p><blockquote>By creating interoperable systems that can seamlessly exchange trusted information we are creating a global network of information that grows in value as more players enter&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Transmute is proud to build with talented teams from around the globe, including our cohort friends: Mattr, Mavennet, Mesur, Digital Bazaar, Secure Key, Danube Tech, and Spherity.</p><p>Thank you also to the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS SVIP</a> team for funding this interoperability work, and to our partners at <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/">US CBP</a> for your support moving from technology to tactical solutions.</p><p>To learn more about Transmute’s platform and solutions <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">contact us&nbsp;today</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">Interoperability is Not a Choice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post shows how HTML header meta data can be dynamically updated or changed for a Blazor Web assembly application routes hosted in ASP.NET Core. This can be usually for changing how URL link previews are displayed when sharing links.</p>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorMetaData">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorMetaData</a></p>
<p>Updating the HTTP Header data to match the URL route used in the Blazor WASM can be supported using a Razor Page host file instead of using a static html file. The Razor Page _Host file can use code behind and a model from this class. The Model can the be used to display the different values as required. This is a Hosted WASM application using ASP.NET Core as the server.</p>

  How “Assume positive intent” downplays impact, gaslights employees, and absolves leaders of responsibility.

<p>Lets talk about that well-worn bit of wisdom: “assume positive intent.” On the
surface it’s excellent advice: practice empathy by mindfully assuming that
people may create issues despite their best intentions. You’ve heard the
parables, from Steven Covey’s <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/658/Steven_Covey.html" title="Steven Covey: Paradigms and the 7 Habits">paradigm shift on the subway</a> to
David Foster Wallace’s <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf" title="Transcription of the 2005 Kenyon Commencement Address - May 21, 2005 — Written and Delivered by David Foster Wallace">latent condemnation</a> of gas-guzzling traffic
and soul-sucking supermarkets. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi has <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html" title="The best advice I ever got — Indra Nooyi">popularized the
notion</a> to ubiquity in corporate America.</p>
<p>In practice, the assumption of positive intent enables some pretty serious
anti-patterns.</p>
<p>First, focusing on intent downplays impact. Good intentions don’t change the
outcomes of one’s actions: we still must deal with whatever broke. At best, good
intentions enable openness to feedback and growth, but do not erase those
mistakes.</p>
<p>Which leads us to a more fundamental dilemma. In a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/the-problem-with-assuming-positive-intent-ea8385ce961d" title="The Problem With Assuming Positive Intent">piece for Medium</a> last year,
<a href="https://medium.com/@ruth_terry/about">Ruth Terry</a>, quoting the <a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/" title="Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity">Kirwan Institute</a>’s Lena Tenney, summarizes it aptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By downplaying actual impact, assuming positive intent can deprioritize the
experience of already marginalized people.</p>
<p>“All of this focus on intention essentially remarginalizes a person of color
who’s speaking up about racism by telling them that their experience doesn’t
matter because the person didn’t mean it that way,” says Tenney, who helped
create interactive implicit bias learning tools for the Kirwan Institute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarginalization of the vulnerable seriously undermines the convictions
behind “assume positive intent,” not to mention the culture at large. But the
impact transcends racial contexts: it appears wherever people present
uncomfortable issues to people in a dominant position.</p>
<p>Take the workplace. A brave employee publicly calls out a problematic behavior
or practice, often highlighting implicit bias or, at the very least, patterns
that contradict the professed values of the organization. Management nods and
says, “I’m glad you brought that up, but it’s important for us all to assume
positive intent in our interactions with our co-workers.” Then they explain the
context for the actions, or, more likely, list potential mitigating details —
without the diligence of investigation or even consequences. Assume positive
intent, guess at or manufacture explanations, but little more.</p>
<p>This response minimizes the report’s impact to management while simultaneously
de-emphasizing the experience of the worker who voiced it. Such brave folks,
speaking just a little truth to power, may start to doubt themselves or what
they’ve seen. The manager has successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting" title="Wikpedia: “Gaslighting”">gaslighted</a> the worker.</p>
<p>Leaders: please don’t do this. The phrase is not “Assume positive intent for me,
but not for thee.” Extend the assumption only to the people reporting
uncomfortable issues. There’s a damn good chance they came to you only by the
assumption of positive intent: if your coworkers thought you had ill-intent,
they would not speak at all.</p>
<p>If you feel inclined to defend behavior or patterns based on presumption of
good intent, avoid that reflex, too. Good intent may be key to transgressors
accepting difficult feedback, but hold them accountable and don’t let
assumptions stand on their own. Impact matters, and so must consequences.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Never use the assumption of good intent to downplay or
dismiss the crucial but uncomfortable or inconvenient feedback brave souls bring
to you.</p>
<p>Assume positive intent in yourself, never assert it in others, and know that,
regardless of intent, problems still must be addressed without making excuses or
devaluing or dismissing the people who have suffered them.</p>

<p>Were it not for the Wayback Machine, a lot of my post-1995 writing would now be gone. Since the advent of online-only publications, getting published has been a lousy way to stay published. When pubs change hands, or die, the works of their writers tend to evaporate.</p>
<p>I’m not a great self-archivist, despite having better-than-average skills for the job. Many but not all of my professional archives are preserved — for now! — on my website. Occasionally, when I reach for a long-forgotten and newly-relevant item, only to find it 404, I’ll dig around and try to resurrect it. The forensic effort can be a big challenge; an even bigger one is avoiding self-blame.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with personal archives. When our family lived in New Delhi in the early 1960s, my dad captured thousands of images. Those <a href="http://jonudell.info/IndiaSlides/">color slides</a>, curated in carousels and projected onto our living room wall in the years following, solidified the memories of what my five-year-old self had directly experienced. When we moved my parents to the facility where they spent their last years, one big box of those slides went missing. I try, not always successfully, to avoid blaming myself for that loss.</p>
<p>When our kids were little we didn’t own a videocassette recorder, which was how you captured home movies in that era. Instead we’d rent a VCR from Blockbuster every 6 months or so and spend the weekend filming. It turned out to be a great strategy. We’d set it on a table or on the floor, turn it on, and just let it run. The kids would forget it was there, and we recorded hours of precious daily life in episodic installments.</p>
<p>Five years ago our son-in-law volunteered the services of a friend of his to digitize those tapes, and brought us the MP4s on a thumb drive. I put copies in various “safe” places. Then we moved a couple of times, and when I reached for the digitized videos, they were gone. As were the original cassettes. This time around, there was no avoiding the self-blame. I beat myself up about it, and was so mortified that I hesitated to ask our daughter and son-in-law if they have safe copies. (Spoiler alert: they do.) Instead I’d periodically dig around in various hard drives, clouds, and boxes, looking for files or thumb drives that had to be there somewhere.</p>
<p>During this period of self-flagellation, I thought constantly about something I heard Roger Angell say about Carlton Fisk. Roger Angell was one of the greatest baseball writers, and Carlton Fisk one of the greatest players. One day I happened to walk into a bookstore in Harvard Square when Angell was giving a talk. In the Q and A, somebody asked: “What’s the most surprising thing you’ve ever heard a player say?”</p>
<p>The player was Carlton Fisk, and the surprise was his answer to the question: “How many time have you seen the video clip of your most famous moment?”</p>
<p>That moment is one of the most-watched sports clips ever: Fisk’s walk-off home run in game 6 of the 1975 World Series. He belts the ball deep to left field, it veers toward foul territory, he dances and waves it fair.</p>
<p>So, how often did Fisk watch that clip? Never.</p>
<p>Why not? He didn’t want to overwrite the original memory.</p>
<p>Of course we are always revising our memories. Photographic evidence arguably prevents us from doing so. Is that good or bad? I honestly don’t know. Maybe both.</p>
<p>For a while, when I thought those home videos were gone for good, I tried to convince myself that it was OK. The original memories live in my mind, I hold them in my heart, nothing can take them away, no recording can improve them.</p>
<p>Although that sort of worked, I was massively relieved when I finally fessed up to my negligence and learned that there are safe copies. For now, I haven’t requested them and don’t need to see them. It’s enough to know that they exist.</p>

<p>After the OAuth 2.0 JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2121">was sent to the RFC Editor</a>, the IESG requested an additional round of IETF feedback.  We’ve published an updated draft addressing the remaining review comments, specifically, SecDir comments from Watson Ladd.  The only normative change made since the 28 was to change the MIME Type from “<code>oauth.authz.req+jwt</code>” to “<code>oauth-authz-req+jwt</code>”, per advice from the designated experts.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this specification takes the JWT Request Object from <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core (Passing Request Parameters as JWTs)</a> and makes this functionality available for pure OAuth 2.0 applications – and does so without introducing breaking changes.  This is one of a series of specifications bringing functionality originally developed for OpenID Connect to the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem.  Other such specifications included OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>] and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>].</p>

    This article is about how to ensure Directors gain assurance about “data” that is supporting the recommendations in a Board paper.  <p></p><br><p>I have read, written and presented my fair share of Board and Investment Committee papers over the past 25 years. As Directors, we are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions we take. I can now observe a skills gap regarding “data”, with many board members assuming and trusting the data that forms the basis on which they are asked to approve. There are good processes, methods and procedures for ensuring that any Board papers presented are factual. However, decisions using big-data and their associated analysis tools, including ML and AI, which drives automation, is new and requires different expertise at a higher level of detail.&nbsp; Challenging data is different from finding it hard to question in detail any C-suite on their specific expertise and, more generally, the general counsel, CFO and CTO.&nbsp; The CDO/ CIO axis bridges the value line being both a cost and revenue.&nbsp; With “data” as the business driver, it remains superficially easier to question costs without understanding the consequences on our future decision ability and even harder to unpack unethical revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic “board paper” will likely have the following headings: Introduction, Background, Rationale, Structure/ Operations, Illustrative Financials &amp; Scenarios, Competition, Risks and Legal. Case by case, there are always minor adjustments. Finally, some form of recommendation will invite the board to note key facts and approve the action.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO), to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; A section on Data Attestation will be a declaration that there are traceable evidence and proof of the data and the action of the presenter being a witness to certifying it.&nbsp; Some teams will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix and some will claim it is already inherent in the process. How and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>Such a section could provide a solution until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data correctly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper (already inherent). However, the data expertise and skills at most senior levels are also well below what we need because all the politics, bias and complexity is in the weeds, which is both easy not to know and hide.&nbsp; Board members have to continue to question performance metrics (KPI and BSC) to determine the motivation for any decision, but having to trust “data sets” a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.&nbsp; If nothing else, a “data attestation statement” will set a hurdle for those presenting to prioritise bias, ethics and consequences of data used in their proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Having to trust data sets a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.</p>  Arguments for and against  <p>Key assumptions</p>  <p>Data is critically important to our future and is foundational for decision making going forward.</p>  <p>Data is more complex today and continues to increase in complexity.</p>  <p>The C-suite and leadership team are experts in their disciplines and has deep expertise in their critical areas, but there is a data skills gap.</p>  <p>There is a recognition at the board that data bias, a lack of audibility, provenance, and data lineage can lead to flawed/bad decision making.</p>  <p>Based on these working assumptions, I do not believe that adding a “Data Attestation” section is a long term fix.&nbsp; Whilst to comply with Section 172 of the Companies Act, it is an absolute requirement to meet the fiduciary duties that we upskill.&nbsp; But data is not like marking, technology, operations, finance or HR - data is new, and the vast majority of boards and senior leadership team have little experience in big data,&nbsp; data analytics or coding.&nbsp; It is a recognition that education and skills development is a better solution, but in the gap between today and skills arriving, we should do something? &nbsp; Critically, I would support introducing a data attestation section with a set date where it falls away.&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential to consider as insurance companies who offer D&amp;O policies are looking at new clauses related to the capability of Directors who make decisions based on data and their ability to know the data was “fit for purpose” for the decision. Insurance companies need to protect their claims business and might feel that the upskilling might take to long.</p><p>Why might this work? Do you get on a plane and ask to pilot it?&nbsp; Do you go to the hospital with the correct google answer or ask a qualified Doctor?&nbsp; We need to form our own view that someone has checked whether the pilot and doctor are qualified.&nbsp; Today, we outsource Audit to a committee because of this same issue; it is complex. But Data is not finance, and data is not an Audit committee issue. Data is a different skill set.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Each Board has to make its own choice. The easiest is to justify to oneself that our existing processes are good enough and we are following “best practices”, compliance thinking. &nbsp; Given the 76 recommendations in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Sir Donald Brydon Review of Audit</a>, assuming that our existing processes are good enough is difficult to justify. If we want to make better decisions with data, we need to make sure we can.&nbsp;</p>  Recommendation  <p>A strong recommendation would be to put in place an “Attestation Clause”, a drop-dead date, a 2-year mandatory data training program aimed at the senior leadership team and Directors/ Board members and a succession plan that priorities data skills for new senior and board (inc NXD) roles.</p>  Proposal  <p>A “data attestation” section intends that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specified any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant, created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <p>The independent auditor should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider; this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body; this is about 3rd party verification and validation. As a company, you build a list of experts and cycle through them regularly. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and an insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important; this does not negate or novate data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Example of a Data Attestation section</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany (PLC) Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in this paper’s presentation. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights, and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest, and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><br>

<p>This article looks at the authentication pyramid for signing into different applications. I only compare flows which have user interaction and only compare the 2FA, MFA differences. A lot of incorrect and aggressive marketing from large companies are blurring out the differences so that they can sell their products and so on.</p>
<p>When you as a user need to use an application, you need to login. The process of logging in or signing in requires authentication of the user and the application. The sign in or login is an authentication process. </p>
<p>To explain the different user and application (identity) authentication possibilities, I created an authentication pyramid diagram from worse to best. FIDO2 is the best way of authenticating as this is only one which protects against phishing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Passwords which rotate</p>
<p>Passwords which rotate without a second factor is the worst way of authenticating your users. By forcing password rotation, people are forced to update passwords regularly and this discourages the use of password managers and encourages users to use something simple which they can remember. In companies which use this policy, a lot of users have a simple password with a two-digit number at the end of the password. You can guess the number by calculating the length of time the user was at the company and the amount of time a password is active. </p>
<p>Passwords</p>
<p>Passwords without a second factor which don’t rotate are better than password which rotate as people tend to use better passwords. It is easier to educate the organisation users to use a password manager and then any complicated password can be easily used without constant rotation, annoyance. If it’s a pain to use in your daily routine, then people will try to avoid using it. I encourage users to use <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">bitwarden </a>but most password managers work good. Ease of use in the browser is important.</p>
<p>SMS MFA</p>
<p>SMS as a second factor is way better than passwords alone. But SMS as a second factor has too many security problems and is too easy to bypass. NIST no longer recommends using SMS as a second factor. </p>
<p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html">https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html</a></p>
<p>Authenticators</p>
<p>Authenticators are a good solution for second factor authentication and does improve the quality and the security of the authentication process compared to passwords and SMS second factor. Authenticators do have many problems, but the major fault of authenticators is that it does NOT protect against phishing. When using authenticators, your users are still vulnerable to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>If a user accesses a phishing website, the push notification will still get sent to the mobile device or the OTP can still be validated. A lot of companies are now moving to 2FA using authenticators. One problem with this is that the push notifications seems to get sent randomly from Authenticators. Authenticators are NOT enough if you have high security requirements.</p>
<p>Most people will recognise the popup underneath. This popup opens on one of my domains on almost a daily basis. I see users conditioned now to just click the checkbox, give in the code and continue working without even checking which application requested this. It has become routine now to just fill this in and click it away so that you can continue working. Sometimes the popup just opens because the last code has timed out. If someone had acquired your password and was logging in, a few users would just enter the code for the attacker due to this conditioning. Also, if you were accessing your application through a phishing website, you would not notice any difference here and continue to validate with the code.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another problem with authenticators is that it requires a mobile phone to install the application. To complete the login, you require a phone. Most of us only have one mobile phone, so if you lose your phone, then you are locked out of your accounts. The account recovery comes into play which is usually a password, or SMS. Your security is reduced to SMS or password if you use this type of recovery. If recovery requires your IT admin to reset the account, you must wait for the IT from your organisation to reset your account, but this way, the security stays at the authenticator security level.</p>
<p>It is important that the account recovery does not use a reduced authentication process.</p>
<p>FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online)</p>
<p>FIDO2 is the best way to authenticate identities where user interaction is required. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 </a>protects against phishing. This is the standout feature which none of the other authentication processes protect against. If you lose your FIDO2 key, then you can use a second FIDO2 key. You as an organisation no longer need to worry about phishing. This could change in the future, but at present FIDO2 protects against phishing. </p>
<p>If you are an organisation with 100 employees, you could only allow FIDO2 and block all other authentication methods. Each employee would require 2 FIDO2 keys which would cost roughly 100$. This would cost about 10k for 100 users and so fully protect an organisation and rid yourself from phishing. You could save all the costs of the phishing exercises which so my companies force us to do now.  </p>
<p>Here’s how you could configure this in Azure AD using the security, Authentication methods:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Passwordless is great when using FIDO2. FIDO2 has best practice and recommendations for which FIDO2 flow, when and where to use. There are different type of FIDO2 flows for different use cases.</p>
<p>Passwordless is not only FIDO2, so be careful implementing a Passwordless flow. Make sure it’s a FIDO2 solution. </p>
<p>If you are using FIDO2, you will require NFC on the mobile phones to use applications from the organisation, unless you allow FIDO2 hardware from the device.  </p>
<p>Identity authentication is only one part of the authentication. If you use a weak OAuth2/OIDC (OpenID Connect) flow, or something created by yourself, you also can have a weak authentication even if using FIDO2. It is important to follow standards. For example using FIDO2 authentication with OIDC <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">FAPI </a>would give you a really good authentication solution. </p>
<p>Try to avoid non-transparent solutions. Big companies will always push their own solutions and if these are not built using standards, there is no way of knowing how good the solution is. Security for your users is not the focus for the companies selling security solutions, selling their SOLUTION is the focus. It is up to you to know what you are buying. Security requires a good solution for application security and network security. A good solution will give you the chance to use best practice in both. </p>
<p>I would consider OIDC FAPI state of the art for high security in applications. This is what I would now consider when evaluating solutions for banks, insurance or government E-Ids. Using this together with FIDO2 and you have an easy to use best practice security solution.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, somebody asked, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-your-choice-radio-television-or-the-Internet">Which is your choice, radio, television, or the Internet?</a>. I <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-your-choice-radio-television-or-the-Internet/answer/Doc-Searls">replied</a> with the following.</p>
<p>If you say to your smart speaker “Play <a href="https://www.kskopublicradio.com/">KSKO</a>,” it will play that small-town Alaska station, which has the wattage of a light bulb, anywhere in the world. In this sense the Internet has eaten the station. But many people in rural Alaska served by KSKO and its tiny repeaters don’t have Internet access, so the station is either their only choice, or one of a few. So we use the gear we have to get the content we can.</p>
<p>TV viewing is also drifting from cable to à la carte subscription services (Netflix, et. al.) delivered over the Internet, in much the same way that it drifted earlier from over-the-air to cable. And yet over-the-air is still with us. It’s also significant that most of us get our Internet over connections originally meant only for cable TV, or over cellular connections originally meant only for telephony.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan">Marshall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_McLuhan">Eric</a> McLuhan, in&nbsp;<a title="www.amazon.com" href="https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Media-Science-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0802077153">Laws of Media</a>, say every new medium or technology does four things:&nbsp;enhance,&nbsp;retrieve,&nbsp;obsolesce&nbsp;and&nbsp;reverse. (These are also caled the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrad_of_media_effects">Tetrad of Media Effects</a>.) And there are many answers in each category. For example, the Internet—</p>
 
 enhances content delivery; 
 retrieves radio, TV and telephone technologies; 
 obsolesces over-the-air listening and viewing; 
 reverses into tribalism; 
 
<p>—among many other effects within each of those.</p>
<p>The McLuhans also note that few things get completely obsolesced. For example, there are still steam engines in the world. Some people still make stone tools.</p>
<p>It should also help to note that the Internet is not a technology. At its base it’s a protocol—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">TCP/IP</a>—that can be used by a boundless variety of technologies. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">protocol</a> is a set of manners among things that compute and communicate. What made the Internet ubiquitous and all-consuming was the adoption of TCP/IP by things that compute and communicate everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This development—the worldwide adoption of TCP/IP—is beyond profound. It’s a change as radical as we might have if all the world suddenly spoke one common language. Even more radically, it creates a second digital world that coexists with our physical one.</p>
<p>In this digital world, we are at a functional distance apart of zero. We also have no gravity. We are simply&nbsp;present&nbsp;with each other. This means the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preposition_and_postposition">preposition</a> that accurately applies to our experience of the Internet is&nbsp;with. Because we are not really&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;through&nbsp;or&nbsp;over&nbsp;anything. Those prepositions refer to the physical world. The digital world is some(non)thing else.</p>
<p>This is why referring to the Internet as a medium isn’t quite right. It is a one-of-one, an example only of itself. Like the Universe. That you can broadcast through the Internet is just one of the countless activities it supports. (Even though the&nbsp;it&nbsp;is not an&nbsp;it&nbsp;in the material sense.)</p>
<p>I think we are only at the beginning of coming to grips with what it all means, besides&nbsp;a lot.</p>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy-backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time are a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user often has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fuelled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseparation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of trade-offs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Reading a collection of John McPhee stories, I found several that were new to me. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/06/28/duty-of-care">The Duty of Care</a>, published in the New Yorker in 1993, is about tires, and how we do or don’t properly recycle them. One form of reuse we’ve mostly abandoned is retreads. McPhee writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>A retread is in no way inferior to a new tire, but new tires are affordable, and the retreaded passenger tire has descended to the status of a clip-on tie.</p></blockquote>
<p>My dad wore clip-on ties. He also used retreaded tires, and I can remember visiting a shop on several occasions to have the procedure done.</p>
<p>Recently I asked a friend: “Whatever happened to retreaded tires?” We weren’t sure, but figured they’d gone away for good reasons: safety, reliability. But maybe not. <a href="https://www.tirerecappers.com/how-does-retread-work/">TireRecappers</a> and <a href="https://www.treadwright.com/pages/retread-moldcure-manufacturing">TreadWright</a> don’t buy those arguments. Maybe retreads were always a viable option for our passenger fleet, as they still are for our truck fleet. And maybe, with better tech, they’re better than they used to be.</p>
<p>In Duty of Care, McPhee tells the story of the Modesto pile. It was, at the time, the world’s largest pile of scrap tires containing, by his estimate, 34 million tires.</p>
<blockquote><p>You don’t have to stare long at that pile before the thought occurs to you that those tires were once driven upon by the Friends of the Earth. They are Environmental Defense Fund tires, Rainforest Action Network tires, Wilderness Society tires. They are California Natural Resources Federation tires, Save San Francisco Bay Association tires, Citizens for a Better Environment tires. They are Greenpeace tires, Sierra Club tires, Earth Island Institute tires. They are Earth First! tires!</p></blockquote>
<p>(I love a good John McPhee list.)</p>
<p>The world’s largest pile of tires left a surprisingly small online footprint, but you can find the LA Times’ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-11-30-mn-16908-story.html">Massive Pile of Tires Fuels Controversial Energy Plan</a> which describes the power plant — 41 million dollars, 14 megawatts, “the first of its kind in the United States and the largest in the world” — that McPhee visited when researching his story. I found it on Google Maps by following McPhee’s directions.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were abandon your car three miles from the San Joaquin County line and make your way on foot southwest one mile…</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the power plant. There’s no evidence of tires, or trucks moving them, so maybe the plant, having consumed the pile, is retired. Fortunately it never caught fire, that would’ve made a hell of a mess.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_recycling">Wikipedia</a>, we’ve reduced our inventory of stockpiled tires by an order of magnitude from a peak of a billion around the time McPhee wrote that article. We burn most of them for energy, and turn some into ground rubber for such uses as paving and flooring. So that’s progress. But I can’t help but wonder about the tire equivalent of Amory Lovins’ <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-efficiency/whats-a-negawatt">negawatt</a>: “A watt of energy that you have not used through energy conservation or the use of energy-efficient products.”</p>
<p>Could retreaded passenger tires be an important source of negawatts? Do we reject the idea just because they’re as unfashionable as clip-on ties? I’m no expert on the subject, obviously, but I suspect these things might be true.</p>

<p>みなさん、フランスの２０世紀の作曲家、ダマーズの「フルート、オーボエ、クラリネットとピアノのための四重奏」をご存知でしょうか？いかにもフランスという洒脱な曲です。リンクを貼ったのは二楽章ですが、ダマーズはこれに限らず第二楽章に楽しいものがおおいです。</p>



<p>ダマーズはコルトーの弟子で、フォーレのノクチュルヌとバルカローレの全曲録音を最初にした人でもあります。</p>



<p>新古典主義の作曲だったので20世紀にはあまり評価されていませんでしたが、最近評価が上がってきて録音も手に入るようになってきています。いかにもフランス的。プーランクが好きだったらダマーズも好きだと思います。</p>

<p>I remember well exactly when I decided not to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>. It was on July 26, 2009, after I finished driving back home to Arlington, Mass, after dropping off my kid at summer camp in Vermont. I had heard a story about it on the radio that convinced me that now was the time to put $100 into something new that would surely become Something Big.</p>
<p>But trying to figure out how to do it took too much trouble, and my office in the attic was too hot, so I didn’t. Also, at the time, the price was $0. Easy to rationalize not buying a non-something that’s worth nothing.</p>
<p>So let’s say I made the move when it hit $1, which I think was in 2011. That would have been $100 for 100 bitcoin, which at this minute&nbsp;are worth $56101.85 apiece. A hundred of those are now $5,610,185. And what if I had paid the 1¢ or less a bitcoin would have been in July, 2009? You move the decimal point while I shake my head.</p>
<p>So now we have NFTs. What do you think I should do? Or anybody? Serious question.</p>

<p>On March 9, The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* hosted presentations from Xavier Vila, Product Manager for Validated ID and Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Director of Astrea on eIDAS and Self Sovereign Identity.  The presentations covered the technical, legal and business dimensions of bridging between eIDAS and SSI concepts and increasing the value and usability of digital identity in the European model.</p><p>A key component of the Digital Europe architecture is the existence of a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure.  This journey was started in 2014 with the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.  As has been discussed in previous Vienna Digital Identity Meetups, a high assurance digital identity is the key piece connecting the physical and digital worlds, and this piece was not included in the initial creation of our digital world.</p><p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success?  There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU.  Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready.  Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.  All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p><p>Validated ID has been developing a eIDAS - ESSIF bridge bringing the eIDAS trust seals to Verifiable Credentials.  As a  Qualified Trust Service Provider under the eIDAS, Validated ID has been offering trust services to customers across Europe since 2012.  Xavier presented this current work and provides a detailed explanation on how the eIDAS-SSI bridge applies the qualified electronic seals to Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Dr. Alamillo further clarified the importance of the eIDAS-SSI Bridge in his presentation on SSI in the eIDAS Regulation.  When a Qualified Electronic Seal is applied to a Verifiable Credential the combined document becomes a legal document with cross border legal value within the EU.  Currently in an identity context, eIDAS is the European wide identity meta system, providing the framework for the 27 nation states of the EU to operate as a very large federated identity network.  However, the point was raised the in the current ongoing revision of the eIDAS regulation, it is possible that handling of electronic identification may be changed from a ‘connecting of services’ to a new trust service.</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/522501200">https://vimeo.com/522501200</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:04:00 - Xavier Vila, Validated ID </p>  <p>0:34:00 - Questions </p>  <p>0:42:00 - Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Astrea </p>  <p>1:18:00 - Questions </p>  <p>1:28:00 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events  </p>  <p>Resources</p><p>SSI - eIDAS Bridge GitHub Repo - <a href="https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/">https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/</a></p><p>Xavier Vila’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/210308-Vienna-Identity-Meetup-SSI-eIDAS-Bridge.pdf">Vale-SSI-EIDAS Bridge.pdf<br>Nach</a>o Alamillo’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/Vienna-digital-identity-event-eIDAS-Alamillo.pdf">Alamillo-SSI-EIDAS.pdf</a></p><p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>For 20 bucks or less, nowadays, you can buy an extra-wide convex mirror that clips onto your car’s existing rear-view mirror. We just tried one for the first time, and I’m pretty sure it’s a keeper. These gadgets claim to eliminate blind spots, and this one absolutely does. Driving down 101, I counted three seconds as a car passed through my driver’s-side blind spot. That’s a long time when you’re going 70 miles per hour; during that whole time I could see that passing car in the extended mirror.</p>
<p>Precious few gadgets spark joy for me. This one had me at hello. Not having to turn your head, avoiding the risk of not turning your head — these are huge benefits, quite possibly life-savers. For 20 bucks!</p>
<p>It got even better. As darkness fell, we wondered how it would handle approaching headlights. It’s not adjustable like the stock mirror, but that turns out not to be a problem. The mirror dims those headlights so they’re easy to look at. The same lights in the side mirrors are blinding by comparison.</p>
<p>I’ve been driving more than 40 years. This expanded view could have been made available at any point along the way. There’s nothing electronic or digital. It’s just a better idea that combines existing ingredients in a new way. That pretty much sums up my own approach to product development.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the metaphor. Seeing around corners is a superpower I’ve always wanted. I used to love taking photos with the fisheye lens on my dad’s 35mm Exacta, now I love making panoramic views with my phone. I hate being blindsided, on the road and in life, by things I can’t see coming. I hate narrow-mindedness, and always reach for a wider view.</p>
<p>I’ll never overcome all my blind spots but it’s nice to chip away at them. After today, there will be several fewer to contend with.</p>

  For a few years now, T-Mobile has been branding itself the “un-carrier,” saying&nbsp;it’s “synonymous with 100% customer commitment.” Credit where due: we switched from AT&amp;T a few years ago because T-Mobile, alone among U.S. carriers at the time, gave customers a nice cheap unlimited data plan for traveling outside the country.

<p>For a few years now, T-Mobile has been branding itself the “un-carrier,” <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/our-story/un-carrier-history">saying</a>&nbsp;it’s “synonymous with 100% customer commitment.” Credit where due: we switched from AT&amp;T a few years ago because T-Mobile, alone among U.S. carriers at the time, gave customers a nice cheap unlimited data plan for traveling outside the country.</p>
<p>But now comes <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803">this story</a> in the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p>T-Mobile to Step Up Ad Targeting of Cellphone Customers<br>
Wireless carrier tells subscribers it could share their masked browsing, app data and online activity with advertisers unless they opt out</p>
<p>Talk about jumping on a bandwagon sinking in quicksand. Lawmakers in Europe (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>), California (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) and elsewhere have been doing their best to make this kind of thing illegal, or at least difficult. Worse, it should now be clear that it not only sucks at its purpose, but customers hate it. A lot.</p>
<p>I just counted, and all 94 responses in the “conversation” under that piece are disapproving of this move by T-Mobile. I just copied them over and compressed out some extraneous stuff. Here ya go:</p>
<p>“Terrible decision by T-Mobile. Nobody ever says “I want more targeted advertising,” unless they are in the ad business. &nbsp;Time to shop for a new carrier – it’s not like their service was stellar.”</p>
<p>“A disappointing development for a carrier which made its name by shaking up the big carriers with their overpriced plans.”</p>
<p>“Just an unbelievable break in trust!”</p>
<p>“Here’s an idea for you, Verizon. Automatically opt people into accepting a break on their phone bill in exchange for the money you make selling their data.”</p>
<p>“You want to make money on selling customer’s private information? Fine – but in turn, don’t charge your customers for generating that profitable information.”</p>
<p>“Data revenue sharing is coming. If you use my data, you will have to share the revenue with me.”</p>
<p>“Another reason to never switch to T-Mobile.”</p>
<p>“Kudos to WSJ for providing links on how to opt-out!”</p>
<p>“Just another disappointment from T-Mobile.&nbsp; I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>
<p>“We were supposed to be controlled by the government.”</p>
<p>“How crazy is it that we are having data shared for service we&nbsp; PAY for? You might expect it on services that we don’t, as a kind of ‘exchange.'”</p>
<p>“WSJ just earned their subscription fee. Wouldn’t have known about this, or taken action without this story. Toggled it off on my phone, and then sent everyone I know on T Mobile the details on how to protect themselves.”</p>
<p>“Just finished an Online Chat with their customer service dept….’Rest assured, your data is safe with T-Mobile’…no, no it isn’t.&nbsp; They may drop me as a customer since I sent links to the CCPA, the recent VA privacy law and a link to this article.&nbsp; And just&nbsp; to make sure the agent could read it – I sent the highlights too.&nbsp; the response – ‘Your data is safe….’&nbsp; Clueless, absolutely clueless.”</p>
<p>“As soon as I heard this, I went in and turned off tracking.&nbsp; Also, when I get advertising that is clearly targeted (sometimes pretty easy to tell) I make a mental note to never buy or use the product or service advertised if I can avoid it.&nbsp; Do others think the same?”</p>
<p>“Come on Congress, pass a law requiring any business or non-profit that wants to share your data with others to require it’s customers to ‘opt-in’. We should(n’t) have to ‘opt-out’ to prevent them from doing so, it should be the other way around. Only exception is them sharing data with the government and that there should be laws that limit what can be shared with the government and under what circumstances.”</p>
<p>“There must be massive amounts of money to be made in tracking what people do for targeted ads.&nbsp; I had someone working for a national company tell me I would be shocked at what is known about me and what I do online.&nbsp; My 85 year old dad refuses a smartphone and pays cash for everything he does short of things like utilities.&nbsp; He still sends in a check each month to them, refuses any online transactions.&nbsp; He is their least favorite kind of person but, he at least has some degree of privacy left.”</p>
<p>“Would you find interest-based ads on your phone helpful or intrusive?<br>
Neither–they’re destructive. They limit the breadth of ideas concerning things I might be interested in seeing or buying. I generally proactively look when I want or need something, and so advertising has little impact on me. However, an occasional random ad shows up that broadens my interest–that goes away with the noise of targeted ads overlain and drowning it out. If T-Mobile were truly interested, it would make its program an opt-in program and tout it so those who might be interested could make the choice.”</p>
<p>“Humans evolved from stone age to modern civilization. These tech companies will strip all our clothes.”</p>
<p>“They just can’t help themselves. They know it’s wrong, they know people will hate and distrust them for it, but the lure of doing evil is too strong for such weak-minded business executives to resist the siren call of screwing over their customers for a buck. Which circle of hell will they be joining Zuckerberg in?”</p>
<p>“Big brother lurks behind every corner.”</p>
<p>“What privacy policy update was this?&nbsp; Don’t they always preface their privacy updates with the statement: YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US(?) When did T-Mobile tell its customers our privacy is no longer important to them?&nbsp; And that in fact we are now going to sell all we know about you to the highest bidder. Seems they need at least to get informed consent to reverse this policy and to demonstrate that they gave notice that was actually received and reviewed and&nbsp;&nbsp;understood&nbsp;by customers….otherwise, isn’t this wiretapping by a third party…a&nbsp;crime?&nbsp; Also isn’t using electronic means to monitor someone in an environment where they have the reasonable expectation of privacy a&nbsp;tort.&nbsp;Why don’t they just have a dual rate structure?&nbsp;&nbsp; The more expensive traditional privacy plan and a cheaper exploitation plan? Then at least they can demonstrate they have given you consideration for the surrender of your right to privacy.”</p>
<p>“A very useful article! I was able to log in and remove my default to receive such advertisements “relevant” to me.&nbsp; That said all the regulatory bodies in the US are often headed by industry personnel who are their to protect companies, not consumers. US is the best place for any company to operate freely with regulatory burden. T-mobile follows the European standards in EU, but in the US there are no such restraints.”</p>
<p>“It’s far beyond time for the Congress to pass a sweeping privacy bill that outlaws collection and sale of personal information on citizens without their consent.”</p>
<p>“Appreciate the heads-up&nbsp; and the guidance on how to opt out. Took 30 seconds!”</p>
<p>“Friends, you may not be aware that almost all of the apps on your iPhone track your location, which the apps sell to other companies, and someday the government. If you want to stop the apps from tracking your locations, this is what to do. In Settings, choose Privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then choose Location Services.&nbsp; There you will see a list of your apps that track your location.&nbsp; All of the time. I have switched nearly all of my apps to ‘Never’ track.&nbsp; A few apps, mostly relating to travel, I have set to “While using.”&nbsp; For instance, I have set Google Maps to ‘While using.’ That is how to take control of your information.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for this important info! I use T-Mobile and like them, but hadn’t heard of this latest privacy outrage. I’ve opted out.”</p>
<p>“T-Mobile is following Facebook’s playbook.&nbsp;Apple profits by selling devices and Operating Sysyems. Facebook &amp; T-Mobile profit by selling, …………………&nbsp;YOU!”</p>
<p>“With this move, at first by one then all carriers, I will really start to limit my small screen time.”</p>
<p>“As a 18 year customer of T-Mobile, I would have preferred an email from T-Mobile&nbsp; about this, rather than having read this by chance today.”</p>
<p>“It should be Opt-In, not Opt-out. Forcing an opt out is a bit slimy in my books. Also, you know they’ll just end up dropping that option eventually and you’ll be stuck as opted in. Even if you opted in, your phone plan should be free or heavily subsidized since they are making dough off your usage.”</p>
<p>“No one automatically agrees to tracking of one’s life, via the GPS on their cell phone. Time to switch carriers.”</p>
<p>“It’s outrageous that customers who pay exorbitant fees for the devices are also exploited with advertising campaigns. I use ad blockers and a VPN and set cookies to clear when the browser is closed. When Apple releases the software to block the ad identification number of my device from being shared with the scum, I’ll be the first to use that, too.”</p>
<p>“It was a pain to opt out of this on T-Mobile. NOT COOL.”</p>
<p>“I just made the decision to “opt out” of choosing TMobile as my new phone service provider. &nbsp;So very much appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Well, T-Mobile, you just lost a potential subscriber.&nbsp; And why not reverse this and make it opt-in instead of opt-out? &nbsp;I know, because too many people are lazy and will never opt-out, selling their souls to advertisers. And for those of you who decide to opt-out, congratulations. &nbsp;You’re part of the vast minority who actually pay attention to these issues.”</p>
<p>“I have been seriously considering making the switch from Verizon to T-Mobile. The cavalier attitude that T-Mobile has for customers data privacy has caused me to put this on hold. You have to be tone deaf as a company to think that this is a good idea in the market place today.”</p>
<p>“Been with T-Mo for over 20 years because they’re so much better for international travel than the others. I don’t plan on changing to another carrier but I’ll opt out of this, thanks.”</p>
<p>“So now we know why T-Mobile is so much cheaper.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard anyone say that they want more ads. How about I pay too much for your services already and I don’t want ANY ads. We need a European style GDP(R) with real teeth in the USA and we need it now!”</p>
<p>“So these dummies are going to waste their money on ads when their service Suckky Ducky!&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, but it’s a wasteland of T-Mobile, “No Service” Bars on your phone with these guys.&nbsp; It’s the worst service, period.&nbsp;Spend your money on your service, the customers will follow.&nbsp; Why is that so hard for these dummies to understand?”</p>
<p>“If they do this I will go elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“When will these companies learn that their ads are an annoyance.&nbsp; I do not want or appreciate their ads.&nbsp; I hate the words ‘We use our data to customize the ads you receive.'”</p>
<p>“Imagine if those companies had put that much effort and money into actually improving their service. Nah, that’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Thank you info on how to opt out. I just did so. It’s up to me to decide what advertising is relevant for me, not some giant corporation that thinks they own me.”</p>
<p>“who is the customer out there like, Yeah I&nbsp;want&nbsp;them to advertise to me! I love it!’? Hard to believe anyone would ask for this.”</p>
<p>“I believe using a VPN would pretty much halt all of this nonsense, especially if the carrier doesn’t want to cooperate.”</p>
<p>“I’m a TMobile customer, and to be honest, I really don’t care about advertising–as long as they don’t give marketers my phone number.&nbsp; Now that would be a deal breaker.”</p>
<p>“What about iPhone users on T-Mobile?&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple’s move to remove third party cookies is creating this incentive for carriers to fill the void. It’s time for a national privacy bill.”</p>
<p>“We need digital privacy laws !!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Sad that Europe and other countries are far ahead of us here.”</p>
<p>“Pure arrogance on the part of the carrier. What are they thinking at a time when people are increasingly concerned about privacy? I’m glad that I’m not currently a T-Mobile customer and this seals the deal for me for the future.”</p>
<p>“AT&amp;T won’t actually let you opt out fully. Requests to block third party analytics trigger pop up messages that state ‘Our system doesn’t seem to be cooperating. Sorry for any inconvenience. Please try again later’.”</p>
<p>“One of the more salient articles I’ve read anywhere recently. Google I understand, we get free email and other stuff, and it’s a business.&nbsp;But I already pay a couple hundred a month to my phone provider. And now they think it’s a good idea to barrage me and my family? What about underage kids getting ads – that must be legal only because the right politicians got paid off.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I bet customers have been begging for more “targeted advertising”. &nbsp;It would be nice if a change in privacy policy also allowed you to void your 12 month agreement with these guys.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for showing us how to opt out. If these companies want to sell my data, then they should pay me part of the proceeds. Otherwise, I opt out.”</p>
<p>Think T-Mobile is listening?</p>
<p>If not, they’re just a typical carrier with 0% customer commitment.</p>

  One year ago exactly (at this minute), my wife and I were somewhere over Nebraska, headed from Newark to Santa Barbara by way of Denver, on the last flight we’ve ever taken.

<p>One year ago exactly (at this minute), my wife and I were somewhere over Nebraska, headed from Newark to Santa Barbara by way of Denver, on the last flight we’ve ever taken. Prior to that we had put about four million miles on United alone, flying almost constantly somewhere, mostly on business. The map above traces what my pocket GPS recorded on various trips (and far from all of them) by land, sea and air since 2007. This life began for me in 1990 and for my wife long before that. Post-Covid, none of this will ever be the same. For anybody.</p>
<p>We also haven’t seen most of our kids or grandkids in more than a year. Same goes for countless friends, business associates and fellow (no longer) travelers on other routes of life.</p>
<p>The old normal is over. We don’t know what the new normal will be, exactly; but it’s clear that business travel as we knew it is gone for years to come, if not forever.</p>
<p>I also sense a generational hand-off. Young people always take over from their elders at some point, but this handoff is from the physical to the digital. Young people are digital natives. Older folk are at best familiar with the digital world: adept in many cases, but not born into it. Being born into the digital world is very different. And still very new.</p>
<p>Though my wife and I have been stuck in Southern California for a year now, we have been living mostly in the digital world, working hard on that handoff, trying to deposit all we can of our long experience and hard-won wisdom on the conveyor belt of work we share across generations.</p>
<p>There will be a new normal, eventually. It will be a normal like the one we had in the 20th Century, which started with WWI and ended with Covid. This was a normal where the cultural center was held by newspapers and broadcasting, and every adult knew how to drive.</p>
<p>Now we’re&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/02/23/welcome-to-the-21st-century/">in the 21st Century</a>, and it’s something of a whiteboard. We still have the old media and speak the same languages, but Covid pushed a reset button, and a lot of the old norms are open to question, if not out the window completely.</p>
<p>Why should the digital young accept the analog-born&nbsp;status quos of&nbsp;business, politics, religion, education, transportation or anything? The easy answer is because the flywheels of those things are still spinning. The hard answers start with questions about how we can do all that stuff better. For sure all&nbsp;the answers will be, to a huge degree, digital.</p>
<p>Perspective: the world has been digital for a only few years now, and will likely remain so for many decades or centuries. Far more has been not been done than has, and lots of stuff will have to be improvised until we (increasingly the young folk) figure out the best approaches. It won’t be easy. None of the technical areas my wife and I are involved with personally (and I’ve been writing about) —<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20privacy">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20identity">identity</a>, <a href="https://www.big-fintech.com/Media/BIGcast/ArticleID/416/Masters-Of-Identity-Part-2">fintech</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/10/31/about-face/">facial recognition</a>, <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">advertising</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20journalism">journalism</a>—have easy answers to their problems, much less final ones.</p>
<p>But we like working on them, and sensing some progress, which doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I wanted to find something I’d written about privacy. So I started with a simple search on Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy"></a></p>
<p>The result was this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk027GpO224bVqHtszlifSgH2QElhxg%3A1615428050746&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=0nlJYLDjKvq40PEP7KCrwAY&amp;iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYEmH4oABvwZXU7SSlElAGSIoNzDGF_su&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy&amp;oq=doc+searls+privacy&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECc6BAguECc6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOgQILhBDOggILhCxAxCDAToFCAAQsQM6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOggIABCxAxCDAToKCAAQhwIQsQMQFDoICAAQsQMQkQI6AggAOgUILhCxAzoHCC4QsQMQQzoKCC4QhwIQsQMQFDoHCAAQsQMQCjoICC4QxwEQrwE6BQghEKABOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeUKgIWORAYIFEaANwAHgAgAGCAYgBwRCSAQQxMi45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwlP24kqfvAhV6HDQIHWzQCmgQ4dUDCAo&amp;uact=5"></a></p>
<p>Which is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very way long way of saying this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy" title="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy">https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+…</a></p>
<p>That’s 609 characters vs. 47, or about 13 times longer. (Hence the word “very” repeated 13 times, above.)</p>
<p>Why are search URLs so long these days? The didn’t used to be.</p>
<p>I assume that the 562 extra characters in that long url tell Google more about me and what I’m doing than they used to want to know. In old long-URL search results, there was human-readable stuff there about the computer and the browser being used. This mess surely contains the same, plus lots of personal data about me and what I’m doing online in addition to searching for this one thing. But I don’t know. And that’s surely part of the idea here.</p>
<p>This much, however, is easy for a human to read:</p>
 
 Giant URLs like this are cyphers, on purpose. 
 You’re not supposed to know what they actually say. Only Google should know. 
 There is a lot about your searches that are&nbsp;Google’s business and not yours. 
 Google has lost interest (if it ever had any) in making search result URLs easy to copy and use somewhere else, such as in a post like this. 
 
<p>Bing is better in this regard. Here’s the same search result there:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy&amp;form=QBLH&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=doc+searls+privacy&amp;sc=0-18&amp;qs=n&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=E72524E96FE449DA86253E8D8574CC5C"></a></p>
<p>That’s 101 characters, or less than 1/6th of Google’s.</p>
<p>The de-crufted URL is also shorter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy" title="https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy">https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+pri…</a></p>
<p>Just 44 characters.</p>
<p>So here is a suggestion for both companies: make search results available with one click in their basic forms. That will make sharing those URLs a lot easier to do, and create good will as well. And, Google, if a cruft-less URL is harder&nbsp;for you to track, so what? Maybe you shouldn’t be doing some of this tracking in the first place.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s better to make things easy for people than harder. This is one of those times. Or billions of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The column republished below, originally at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html</a>, was the vector that connected me to my dear friend Gardner Campbell. I’m resurrecting it here partly just to bring it back online, but mainly to celebrate the ways in which Gardner — a film scholar among many other things — is, right now, bringing his film expertise to the practice of online teaching. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3106">this post</a> he reflects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the learning spaces I’ve been in provide very poorly, if at all, for the supposed magic of being co-located. A state-mandated prison-spec windowless classroom has less character than a well-lighted Zoom conference. A lectern with a touch-pad control for a projector-and-screen combo is much less flexible and, I’d argue, conveys much less human connection and warmth than I can when I share a screen on Zoom during a synchronous class, or see my students there, not in front of a white sheet of reflective material, but in the medium with me, lighting up the chat, sharing links, sharing the simple camaraderie of a hearty “good morning” as class begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3096">this one</a> he shares the <a href="https://youtu.be/82Gu4BKagpI">course trailer</a> (!) for Fiction into film: a study of adaptations of “Little Women”.</p>
<p>My 2005 column was a riff on a New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/movies/is-a-cinema-studies-degree-the-new-mba.html">Is Cinema Studies the new MBA</a>? It was perhaps a stretch, in 2005, to argue for cinema studies as an integral part of the new freshman comp. The argument makes a lot more sense now.</p>
 
 The New Freshman Comp 
<p>For many years I have alternately worn two professional hats: writer and programmer. Lately I find myself wearing a third hat: filmmaker. When I began making the films that I now call screencasts, my readers and I both sensed that this medium was different enough to justify the new name that we collaboratively gave it. Here’s how I define the difference. Film is a genre of storytelling that addresses the whole spectrum of human experience. Screencasting is a subgenre of film that can tell stories about the limited — but rapidly growing — slice of our lives that is mediated by software.</p>
<p>Telling stories about software in this audiovisual way is something I believe technical people will increasingly want to do. To explain why, let’s first discuss a more ancient storytelling mode: writing.</p>
<p>The typical reader of this column is probably, like me, a writer of both prose and code. Odds are you identify yourself as a coder more than as a writer. But you may also recently have begun blogging, in which case you’ve seen your writing muscles grow stronger with exercise.</p>
<p>Effective writing and effective coding are more closely related than you might think. Once upon a time I spent a year as a graduate student and teaching assistant at an Ivy League university. My program of study was science writing, but that was a tiny subspecialty within a larger MFA (master of fine arts) program dedicated to creative writing. That’s what they asked me to teach, and the notion terrified me. I had no idea what I’d say to a roomful of aspiring poets and novelists. As it turned out, though, many of these kids were in fact aspiring doctors, scientists, and engineers who needed humanities credits. So I decided to teach basic expository writing. The university’s view was that these kids had done enough of that in high school. Mine was that they hadn’t, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>I began by challenging their reverence for published work. Passages from books and newspapers became object lessons in editing, a task few of my students had ever been asked to perform in a serious way. They were surprised by the notion that you could improve material that had been professionally written and edited, then sold in bookstores or on newsstands. Who were they to mess with the work of the pros?</p>
<p>I, in turn, was surprised to find this reverent attitude even among the budding software engineers. They took it for granted that programs were imperfect texts, always subject to improvement. But they didn’t see prose in the same way. They didn’t equate refactoring a program with editing a piece of writing, as I did then and still do.</p>
<p>When I taught this class more than twenty years ago the term “refactoring” wasn’t commonly applied to software. Yet that’s precisely how I think about the iterative refinement of prose and of code. In both realms, we adjust vocabulary to achieve consistency of tone, and we transform structure to achieve economy of expression.</p>
<p>I encouraged my students to regard writing and editing as activities governed by engineering principles not unlike the ones that govern coding and refactoring. Yes, writing is a creative act. So is coding. But in both cases the creative impulse is expressed in orderly, calculated, even mechanical ways. This seemed to be a useful analogy. For technically-inclined students earning required humanities credits, it made the subject seem more relevant and at the same time more approachable.</p>
<p>In the pre-Internet era, none of us foresaw the explosive growth of the Internet as a textual medium. If you’d asked me then why a programmer ought to be able to write effectively, I’d have pointed mainly to specs and manuals. I didn’t see that software development was already becoming a global collaboration, that email and newsgroups were its lifeblood, and that the ability to articulate and persuade in the medium of text could be as crucial as the ability to design and build in the medium of code.</p>
<p>Nowadays, of course, software developers have embraced new tools of articulation and persuasion: blogs, wikis. I’m often amazed not only by the amount of writing that goes on in these forms, but also by its quality. Writing muscles do strengthen with exercise, and the game of collaborative software development gives them a great workout.</p>
<p>Not everyone drinks equally from this fountain of prose, though. Developers tend to write a great deal for other developers, but much less for those who use their software. Laziness is a factor; hubris even more so. We like to imagine that our software speaks for itself. And in some ways that’s true. Documentation is often only a crutch. If you have to explain how to use your software, you’ve failed.</p>
<p>It may, however, be obvious how to use a piece of software, and yet not at all obvious why to use it. I’ll give you two examples: Wikipedia and del.icio.us. Anyone who approaches either of these applications will immediately grasp their basic modes of use. That’s the easy part. The hard part is understanding what they’re about, and why they matter.</p>
<p>A social application works within an environment that it simultaneously helps to create. If you understand that environment, the application makes sense. Otherwise it can seem weird and pointless.</p>
<p>Paul Kedrosky, an investor, academic, and columnist, alluded to this problem on his blog last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Funny conversation I had with someone yesterday: We agreed that the thing that generally made us both persevere and keep trying any new service online, even if we didn’t get it the first umpteen times, was having Jon Udell post that said service was useful. After all, if Jon liked it then it had to be that we just hadn’t tried hard enough. [<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001115.html">Infectious Greed</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I immodestly quote Paul’s remarks in order to revise and extend them. I agree that the rate-limiting factor for software adoption is increasingly not purchase, or installation, or training, but simply “getting it.” And while I may have a good track record for “getting it,” plenty of other people do too — the creators of new applications, obviously, as well as the early adopters. What’s unusual about me is the degree to which I am trained, inclined, and paid to communicate in ways that help others to “get it.”</p>
<p>We haven’t always seen the role of the writer and the role of the developer as deeply connected but, as the context for understanding software shifts from computers and networks to people and groups, I think we’ll find that they are. When an important application’s purpose is unclear on the first umpteen approaches, and when “getting it” requires hard work, you can’t fix the problem with a user-interface overhaul or a better manual. There needs to be an ongoing conversation about what the code does and, just as importantly, why. Professional communicators (like me) can help move things along, but everyone needs to participate, and everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer struggling to evangelize an idea, I’d start by reiterating that your coding instincts can also help you become a better writer. Until recently, that’s where I’d have ended this essay too. But recent events have shown me that writing alone, powerful though it can be, won’t necessarily suffice.</p>
<p>I’ve written often — and, I like to think, cogently — about wikis and tagging. But my screencasts about Wikipedia and del.icio.us have had a profoundly greater impact than anything I’ve written on these topics. People “get it” when they watch these movies in ways that they otherwise don’t.</p>
<p>It’s undoubtedly true that an audiovisual narrative enters many 21st-century minds more easily, and makes a more lasting impression on those minds, than does a written narrative. But it’s also true that the interactive experience of software is fundamentally cinematic in nature. Because an application plays out as a sequence of frames on a timeline, a narrated screencast may be the best possible way to represent it and analyze it.</p>
<p>If you buy either or both of these explanations, what then? Would I really suggest that techies will become fluid storytellers not only in the medium of the written essay, but also in the medium of the narrated screencast? Actually, yes, I would, and I’m starting to find people who want to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>A few months ago I heard from Michael Tiller, who describes himself as a “mechanical engineer trapped in a computer scientist’s body.” Michael has had a long and passionate interest in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modelica.com/">Modelica</a>, an open, object-oriented language for modeling mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, and control systems. He wanted to work with me to develop a screencast on this topic. But it’s far from my domains of expertise and, in the end, all he really needed was my encouragement. This week, Michael launched a website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/">Dynopsis.com</a>&nbsp;that’s chartered to explore the intersection of engineering and information technologies. Featured prominently on the site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=modelica_screencast">this 20-minute screencast</a>&nbsp;in which he illustrates the use of Modelica in the context of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynasim.se/">Dymola</a>&nbsp;IDE.</p>
<p>This screencast was made with Windows Media Encoder 9, and without the help of any editing. After a couple of takes, Michael came up with a great overview of the Modelica language, the Dymola tool, and the modeling and simulation techniques that they embody. Since he is also author of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0792373677">book</a>&nbsp;on this subject, I asked Michael to reflect on these different narrative modes, and here’s how he responded on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were interested in teaching someone just the textual aspects of the Modelica language,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-0719698-6919906">this is exactly the approach I would take</a>.<br>
…<br>
But when trying to teach or explain a medium that is visual, other tools can be much more effective. Screencasts are one technology that could really make an impact on the way some subjects are taught and I can see how these ideas could be extended much further. [<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=node/19">Dynopsis: Learning by example: screencasts</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re just scratching the surface of this medium. Its educational power is immediately obvious, and over time its persuasive power will come into focus too. The New York Times recently asked: “Is cinema studies the new MBA?” I’ll go further and suggest that these methods ought to be part of the new freshman comp. Writing and editing will remain the foundation skills they always were, but we’ll increasingly combine them with speech and video. The tools and techniques are new to many of us. But the underlying principles — consistency of tone, clarity of structure, economy of expression, iterative refinement — will be familiar to programmers and writers alike.</p>

<p>The article shows how a Blazor web assembly UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application can be secured using cookies. Azure AD is used as the identity provider and the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package is used to secure the trusted server rendered application. The API calls are protected using the secure cookie and anti-forgery tokens to protected against CSRF. This architecture is also known as the Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern.</p>
<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzureADAuthRazorUiServiceApiCertificate/tree/main/BlazorBff">Blazor Cookie security</a></p>
<p>Why Cookies</p>
<p>By using cookies, it gives us the possiblity to increase the security of the whole application, UI + API. Blazor web assembly is treated as a UI in the server rendered application. By using cookies, no access tokens, refresh tokens or id tokens are saved or managed in the browser. All security is implemented in the trusted backend. By implementing the security in the trusted backend, the application can be authenticated by the identity provider and all access tokens are removed from the browser, web storage. With the correct security definitions on the cookies, the security risks can be reduced, and the client application can be authenticated. It would be possible to use sender constrained tokens, or Mutual TLS for increased security, if this was required. Anti-forgery tokens are required to secure the API requests because we use cookies. </p>
<p>The UI and the backend are one application which are coupled together. This is different to the standard Blazor template which uses access tokens. The WASM and the API are secured as two separate applications. Here only a single server rendered application is secured. The WASM client can only use APIs hosted on the same domain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>History</p>
<p>2021-03-09 Updated Anti-forgery policy, feedback Philippe De Ryck</p>
<p>Credits</p>
<p>Some of the code in this repo was built using original source code from Bernd Hirschmann. </p>
<p>Thank you for the <a href="https://github.com/berhir/BlazorWebAssemblyCookieAuth">git repository</a>.</p>
<p>Creating the Blazor application</p>
<p>The Blazor application was created using a web assembly template hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. You need to check the checkbox in Visual Studio for this. No authentication was added. This creates three projects. We will add the security first, then the services to use the Identity of the authenticated user in the WASM client, and then add the bits required for CSRF protection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Securing the application using Azure AD</p>
<p>The application is secured using the Azure AD identity provider. This is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web web application client, not API client. This is just a wrapper for the Open ID connect code flow authentication and if successful authenticated, the auth data is stored in a cookie. Two Azure App Registrations are used to implement this, one for the API and one for the Web authentication. A client secret is required to access the API. A certificate could also be used instead. See the Microsoft.Identity.Web docs for more info.</p>
<p>The app.settings contains the configuration for both the API and the web client.  The ScopeForAccessToken contains all the scopes required by the application so that after the user authenticates, the user can give consent up front for all required APIs. The rest is standard.</p>
 "AzureAd": {
	"Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
	"Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
	"TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
	"ClientId": "46d2f651-813a-4b5c-8a43-63abcb4f692c",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "add secret to the user secrets"
},
	"UserApiOne": {
	"ScopeForAccessToken": "api://b2a09168-54e2-4bc4-af92-a710a64ef1fa/access_as_user User.ReadBasic.All user.read",
	"ApiBaseAddress": "https://localhost:44395"
},
 
<p>The following nuget packages were added to the server blazor host application.</p>
 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web.MicrosoftGraphBeta 
 IdentityModel 
 IdentityModel.AspNetCore 
 
<p>The startup ConfigureServices method is used to add the Azure AD authentication clients. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to add the web client which uses the services added in the AddMicrosoftIdentityUI method. Graph API is added as a downstream API demo.</p>
 public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // + ...
	
	services.AddHttpClient();
	services.AddOptions();

	string[] initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(
		"UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
		 .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/beta",
			"User.ReadBasic.All user.read")
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

	services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
}
 
<p>The Configure method is used to add the middleware in the correct order. The Blazor application is setup like the template except for the fallback which maps to the razor page _Host instead of the index. This was added to support anti forgery tokens which I’ll explain later in this blog.</p>
 public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
		app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging();
	}
	else
	{
		app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
		app.UseHsts();
	}

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();
	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
		endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
	});

<p>Using the claims, identity in the web assembly client application</p>
<p>The next part of the code was implemented using the source code created by Bernd Hirschmann. Now that the server authentication is implemented and the identity exists for the user and the application, the claims from this identity and the state of the actual user needs to be accessed and used in the client web assembly part of the application. APIs need to be created for this purpose. The account controller is used to initialize the sign in flow and a HTTP Post can be used to sign out.</p>

<p>Cross-site request forgery CSRF protection</p>
<p>Cross-site request forgery (also known as XSRF or CSRF) is a possible security problem when using cookies. We can protect against this using anti-forgery tokens and will add this to the Blazor application. To support this, we can use a Razor page _Host.cshtml file instead of a static html file. This host page is added to the server project and uses the default div with the id app just like the index.html file from the dotnet template. The index.html can be deleted form the client project. The render-mode is per default WebAssembly. If you copied a _Host file from a server Blazor template, you would have to change this or remove it.</p>
<p>The Anti-forgery token is added at the bottom of the file in the body. A antiForgeryToken.js is also added to the razor Page _Host file. Also make sure the headers match the headers from the index.html which you deleted.</p>

<p>Using cookies with Blazor WASM and ASP.NET Core hosted applications can be used to support the high security flow requirements which are required for certain application deployments. This makes it possible to add extra layers of security just by having a trusted application implement the security parts. The Blazor client application can only use the API deployed on the host in the same domain. Any Open ID Connect provider can be supported in this way, just like a Razor Page application. This makes it easier to support logout requirements by using a OIDC backchannel logout and so on. MTLS and sender constrained tokens can also be supported with this setup. SignalR no longer needs to add the access tokens to the URL of the web sockets as cookies can be used on the same domain.</p>
<p>Would love feedback on further ways of improving this.</p>

<p>We’ve been here 6 years, and the magical Sonoma County landscape just keeps growing on me. I’ve written about the spectacular coastline, a national treasure just twenty miles to our west that’s pristine thanks to the efforts of a handful of environmental activists, notably <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/07/21/walking-the-kortum-trail/">Bill Kortum</a>. Even closer, just ten miles to our east, lies the also spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains">Mayacamas range</a> where today I again hiked Bald Mountain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Ridge_State_Park">Sugarloaf Ridge State Park</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever visit this region and fancy a hike with great views, this is the one. (Ping me and I’ll go with you at the drop of a hat.) It’s not too challenging. The nearby Goodspeed Trail, leading up to Gunsight Notch on Hood Mountain, is more demanding, and in the end, less rewarding. Don’t get me wrong, the view from Gunsight — looking west over the Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa plain — is delightful. But the view from the top of Bald Mountain is something else again. On a clear day (which is most of them) you can spin a slow 360 and take in the Napa Valley towns of St. Helena and Calistoga to the west, Cobb and St. Helena mountains to the north, the Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa plain to the east, then turn south to see Petaluma, Mt. Tamalpais, the top of the Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco, the San Pablo Bay, the tops of the tallest buildings in Oakland, and Mt. Diablo 51 miles away. Finally, to complete the loop, turn east again to look at the Sierra Nevada range 130 miles away.</p>
    
<p>The rugged topography you can see in that video occurs fractally everywhere around here. It’s taken a while to sink in, but I think I can finally explain what’s so fascinating about this landscape. It’s the sightlines. From almost anywhere, you’re looking at a 3D puzzle. I’m a relative newcomer, but I hike with friends who’ve lived their whole lives here, and from any given place, they are as likely as I am to struggle to identify some remote landmark. Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.</p>
<p>We’ve lived in flat places, we’ve lived in hilly places, but never until now in such a profoundly three-dimensional landscape. It is a blessing I will never take for granted.</p>

<p>An idea has been maturing in my thoughts for a while now. Or rather I have been thinking about a series of ideas, programming projects I would love to actualise, which I recently realised share a common thread. Memory and how we access it. Probably not surprising for software developers, pretty much any application we can imagine requires some form of data store. Although rarely, in my experience, do we talk about this data in terms of memory.</p>
<p>My more recent work researching identity, privacy and trust in digital interactions has evolved and broadened my perspective on the importance of memory. Our identity, whatever we conceive that to be, must be understood to exist in close relation to memory. Or the mathematician in me wants to say as a function of memory I ~ F(m) <a>1</a>. And as Herbert Simon details in the Science of the Artificial, memory is a key property of any intelligent system <a>2</a>.  The ability to take information from the past and apply it when navigating the present moment is a powerful skill in the Homo Sapien toolbox, both as individuals and a species.</p>
<p>These patterns of thought on memory percolating in my mind have further been influenced through my engagement with blockchain/distributed ledger both as a concept and through the practical application of it in application development. I especially find the ideas coming out of the Ethereum community transformative to the possibilities for digital application design. Persistent Compute Objects (PICOs) <a>3</a> are a more recent idea and open source project I have been following that appears to support novel interaction patterns.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey to this point, what follows in a sketch of the evolution of my thoughts on memory told through the lens of three ideas and the questions these ideas sparked in me. Then I intend to reflect on where my thoughts are at now, because it is only now reflecting on these ideas that I see the common thread - human memory. </p>
<p>The ideas that influenced my thinking and help illustrate my thoughts are; Viewing Time, The Community Mind and Nifty Books. Each originates at a different point in my life but all were ideas for programming side projects I could use to cut my teeth on a new technology, language or library. Each idea has a special place in my own memory, and it is from these memories that the thoughts I am sharing emerged.</p>
 Viewing Time 
<p>My first idea, back before I knew how to program. The inspirational carrot I used to motivate myself to learn. Not that I ever wrote more than a few lines of code on this. It originates from a time in Maastricht visiting a friend, we were sitting looking at a beautiful view and I thought: </p>
 What if we could create a timelapse of a view from a specific location? A View of Time. 
<p>I think I tried to get my friend to go back their every day to take a photo to do just this. Not the ideal solution, my thinking has evolved since then. Here are some of the questions I thought about:</p>
 
 
<p>What if we could crowd source the collection of the photos for a view, enabling anyone with a camera to contribute?</p>
 
 How would view’s of time be discovered, found, contributed to and viewed? 
 
<p>How would you prevent “bad” view from being added. Inappropriate, non valued, etc?</p>
 
 Who decides what a “bad” view is? 
 Authorisation problem 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Where would views be stored?</p>
 
 Who stores them? 
 Who has control over them? 
 Who manages that control? 
 
 
 Who would host and pay for this application and why? 
 
<p>How might Viewing Time change our relationship with our environment and help us reflect on the change happening all around us?</p>
 
 Chasing Ice, a documentary I watched on another visit to the Netherlands, emphasised how powerful this could be. <a href="https://earthvisioninstitute.org/share-this/columbia-glacier-alaska/">Here is an example</a>. 
 Watching a Chinese cityscape evolve over these last 20 years would have provided another staggering view of time and change. 
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/21/timelapse-satellite-images-china-fastest-growing-cities">Here are some examples of this using satellite imagery</a> 
 How might Viewing Time help communities record and interact with shared memories? 
 I was recently involved with planting a Community Orchard and became aware how valuable creating a view as a shared artifact could be. It might help communities celebrate and appreciate the positive changes they bring about. 
 
 
 How might date, time or season be used to present different time-lapses of the same view? 
 
<p>How would we prevent overtourism?</p>
 
 I never wanted to turn view’s into used and abused tourist spaces, an acknowledged tension. 
 Explicitly want to avoid insta tourism type effects. How?  
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trs-isdu4eE">This is a funny add from the Kiwi’s recently keeping me mindful of this</a> 
 What are the incentives? 
 How do we ensure this is an artifact all can enjoy while minimising the unintended consequences associated with the change in context-relative informational norms? 
 How might this be used to create incentives for positive, respectful tourism? 
 Realised in part this is about how views are discovered. 
 This got me closer to the importance of location. 
 
 
 
<p>What if you could only discover view’s if you were in it’s location?</p>
 
 How might this help to prevent bad content? 
 How would you even prove you were in a certain location? 
 Who/what would you prove it to? 
 
 
 
<p>What is the context and associated informational norms with a View?</p>
 
 Who defines and evolves these norms? 
 What are the rules? 
 
 
 How might location be used as a strong authenticator?<a>4</a> 
 
<p>These are all pointers, sketching the outlines of thought that I have been evolving over the 5 or so years since first appeared in my mind. </p>
<p>It is an idea that I never made any meaningful, tangible progress on. Except for a few positive conversations with friends it has remained wishful thinking. It is in my humble opinion, a beauty of an idea, something that I would love to see happen. I am optimistic, the technology and mental model for application design is shifting in ways that open up an entirely new design space for these kinds of ideas. Something other than the for profit venture capitalist endeavours that have lead to the colonisation and privatisation of much of our virtual spaces. A for-profit venture could never be the best realisation of this idea.</p>
 The Community Mind 
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is my baby. My first <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/sideproject">side project</a>. It is how I learnt React and felt the power of GraphQl. The first website and server I ever deployed - a challenging experience but one I <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-from-deploying-my-first-full-stack-web-application-34f94ec0a286/">learnt from</a>.  It is was also my first encounter with authentication and account management, what a nightmare that was.</p>
<p>After completing a year in industry this was the next programming project I worked on. I committed a lot of my time to this work. Including spending a month straight on it while dipping my toes into the digital nomad lifestyle in Chiang Mai, where I was exposed to and became fascinated with blockchain, Bitcoin and all that crazy stuff. An influential period of my life really. </p>
<p>Anyway, the idea revolves around creating a place for us to organise our questions. A space for questions to be shared and thought about, but not a place to collect answers. In my mind it was explicitly not for answers. Rather it would provide triggers to thought’s within individuals as they pondered these questions from the their own unique perspective shaped by their lived experience. I am a strong believe that we all have the ability to imagine creative ideas and possibilities, the hard part of course is actioning those ideas. As in many ways this text demonstrates.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this idea came from the book <a href="https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/">A More Beautiful Question</a>. I wanted to try to develop something that would make it easier to ask and discover beautiful questions. A place where these questions could be crowd sourced, recorded and connected.  I wanted to provide an interface for individuals to explore a web of interconnected questions being thought by others. I wanted people to be able to contribute their own questions and thought pathways to this network. Each individual interacting with and contributing to the community mind.</p>
<p>The questions that surfaced when thinking through the design requirements of such a project were something along these lines:</p>
 
 
<p>How will I manage questioners?</p>
 
 I was still thinking in a user account paradigm in these days.  
 Who gets to ask questions? 
 Who gets to see the questions asked? 
 
 
 
<p>How will questioners search and discover the questions they are interested in?</p>
 
 What if questions could be linked to other questions? 
 Who can link questions to other questions? Which links do people see and how do they decide? 
 What if these links grew in strength the more they were traversed and endorsed like neural pathways in our own minds? 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent duplicate questions?</p>
 
 Am I trying to create a single global repository of questions?  
 
<p>Or would it be better to allow each individual to manage their web of questions independently?</p>
 
 How might you enable the best of both? 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent bad data? Questions that don’t align with the ethos of the mind?</p>
 
 Whose mind? Who decides? 
 How might questions be optimally curated? 
 What is optimal and who is curating? 
 
 
 Where would this information be stored?  
 
<p>What is the business model for such an application?</p>
 
 What are the incentives? 
 
 
 
<p>When initially developing this project I had in mind a database for storing questions and their links, which people would interact with. Searching and filtering to discover the questions they were interested in. Contributing their own questions and connections to this storage. All managed by some centralised application, providing a single view and interface for people to interact with. Today, I have a model of individual’s being able to maintain their own mind, curating the questions and connections that find useful to them. Then providing a mechanism to network and aggregate the minds of others into a larger web of questions for all to explore. Imagine a mind like a GitHub repository, the entity that creates it would be able to manage the rules governing how questions and links are contributed. I even considered private minds as a potential business model. Although my desire was and remains today to develop an open source tool for recording, curating and discovering beautiful questions. I see them as a loose scaffold around thought, hinting at the problem space without prescribing the solution. A common entry point to creativity, that any individual from any background at any moment in time would be able to interact with. Using their own unique perspective to draw new insights and inspire different solutions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fond memories developing this idea, including a weekend in Porto visiting a friend where I discovered the joy and value of committing thoughts to paper. Creating a physical artifact to interact with. Something that in my view can never fully be replicated in a digital medium, but what if you could have both?</p>

    </p>
<p>Towards the end of my <a href="https://github.com/wip-abramson/TheCommunityMind">active development</a> of this idea I attempted to integrate a token, Simple Token, as part of a challenge they held. My idea at the time was to use this as some form of incentive mechanism for the application, although the actual execution was a bit clumsy looking back. You can view my submission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMABXKGoiAk&amp;t=1s">here</a>. Then there is this old <a href="https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/5">Github issue</a> from a month long hackathon called Blockternship. </p>
<p>While development is dormant, I am still very committed to making this a thing. One day!</p>
 Nifty Books 
<p>This is another lovely idea, in my book at least. Originating from my desire to learn how to write smart contracts using solidity, the Ethereum programming language. The idea stemmed from thinking through how we might digitally represent books the books we own, creating a distributed library and opening access to a wealth of books. Moving them off our shelves and into peoples hands, helping the wisdom held within them diffuse into more peoples minds and become recorded in their memories. Book’s can provide an intoxicating fountain of knowledge or a refreshing escape from reality. I appreciate both aspects equally and would love more to experience their joy. </p>
<p>For a bit of history of this idea you can see <a href="https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/23">my proposal</a> for the ETH Berlin hackathon around this. I proposed creating an application that allowed anyone to mint an <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC721 Non-Fungible Token</a> to represent their physical book. Unfortunately, I ended up forming a different team and haven’t made much progress on realising this idea. I remain a sketchy solidity developer at best. That said, progress has been made. The concept is more mature in my mind, and the ethereum development landscape has come a long way since 2018. As my recent experience at the virtual <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETH Denver</a> highlighted, while I didn’t manage to submit anything or even write much code I did get a sense for how far things have come. The <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> repo seems like a great place to start, if I ever do manage to carve out time to create this.</p>
<p>I am convinced, and regularly reminded, how this idea could unlock so much hidden value. Book’s deserve to be read more than once, indeed there is something beautiful about a book having been read by many different people. Throughout the course of my studies in Edinburgh I have developed a fairly extensive personal collection of some truly fascinating books. I would love to have a means to share them with others in the area also interested in this material. And yes I am sure there exist ways for me to do this if I really tried, but I believe giving a book a memory has more implications that simply making it easily shareable.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that this idea has raised over the years as I wondered about how it might be developed:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we digitally represent a physical book?</p>
 
 How would you link the physical book with it’s digital representation? 
 Would a QR Code work here? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we represent ownership?</p>
 
 What affordances should owners of books have? 
 What affordances should borrower’s have? 
 
 
 
<p>How would books within the virtual library be discovered, requested and returned?</p>
 
 How might you pay for postage of book between participants? 
 
<p>What if the model was to create primarily a local virtual library, but with exchanges between localities when requested?</p>
 
 Libraries have existed like this for ages. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How might the digital representation of a book be used to embed it with a memory?</p>
 
 What information would the book want to store in it’s memory? 
 How might we represent the list of borrowers without compromising their privacy? 
 
<p>What if the book had an interface to the Community Mind allowing readers to ask and share questions that the material provoked in them?</p>
 
 How might being in possession of a book, either as a lender or borrower provide a mechanism for access control into other applications? E.g. the Community Mind. 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way individuals interact with eBook’s today? 
 How might this approach help us appreciate this medium more deeply? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we deter bad actors abusing the virtual library?</p>
 
 What is the incentive model? 
 Who decides? 
 What is to stop malicious actors creating virtual book’s unattached to physical copies?  
 What prevents people from stealing book’s they have borrowed? 
 
 
 Who stores the information around virtual books?  
 
<p>How are the search and discovery capabilities for these books mediated? </p>
 
 Who is mediating this? 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way book’s are shared and exchanged by travellers? 
 
<p>What if the things we bought came with a configurable and extendable digital memory?</p>
 
 How might this both simplify and expand the field of interaction enabled and perceived by those in proximity to the device? 
 
 
 
<p>As usual, a whole load of questions. Always there are questions. I present them here to provoke your own thought and inquiry around these ideas.</p>
 The Common Thread 
<p>Now, these ideas are not directly or intentionally linked. They are connected through me, and through my desire to produce ideas for software applications I would be motivated to create. Most developers you meet will have a few of these kicking around if you ask them. Over time all ideas evolve, dots connect and new insight emerges. The three ideas I presented trace the evolution of me, as much as anything else, from a computer science undergraduate to hopefully a final year PhD student. </p>
<p>It is only recently, from the new perspectives my research has provided me that I can reflect on all these ideas and clearly see a common thread in my thinking. In keeping with the article will summarise in a series of questions:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we use technology to experiment with the ways in which we can attach memory to the artifacts we place meaning in?</p>
 
 How might we design this memory to be open and extendable supporting permission-less innovation at the edges? 
 
 
 
<p>How might artifacts use this memory to intelligently interact with it’s environment and the people interacting with it?</p>
 
 How might such artifacts be designed to respect the privacy of those it interacts with while ensuring they are held accountable within a defined context? 
 
 
 
<p>What if we started to centralise information on artifacts, using our physical interaction with these artifacts to provide an alternative to the search engine for the discovery of information?</p>
 
 How might centralising information on the artifact, be that a location, object or thought transform the way  design digital systems and our ability to actively maintain collective memory at all scales of society? 
 
 
 How might context-relative informational norms for managing this memory be defined, communicated, upheld and evolved? 
 How might such artifacts change the way we identify and authenticate digitally? 
 
<p>How might this change the nature of the virtual spaces we interact in?</p>
 
 How might this provide natural limits to the participants within these spaces? 
 How might this create virtual neighbours and encourage trustworthy behaviour and positive relationships? 
 
 
 
<p>What are the descriptive and normative properties for structuring memory?</p>
 
 What are the properties of collective memory that we experience in the majority of virtual environments we exist in today and how do they differ from the ways we have managed memory in the physical reality across time and context? 
 
 
 
<p>It is an exploration of the structure of memory, how we might augment this structure with intention using digital technology and the implications of this on meaning making within both individuals and groups. To date this exploration has predominantly involved a few powerful entities constructing, owning and manipulating the digital structures of memory to meet their own agenda’s <a>5</a>. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that while working on this idea I created artifacts, both physical and digital, they hold meaning to me but are no longer only accessible too me. By committing thoughts to paper, code or words, they become remembered at least partially in a different kind of memory. Indeed this text itself is one of these artifacts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but it’s long already and I wrote this for fun more than anything. A break from the rigidity of academic writing that can be suffocating at times. A more detailed, formal analysis of these ideas is for another time. </p>
<p>Thanks for making it this far. These thoughts are pretty fresh, I would love to know what they triggered in you. </p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This is something my thoughts wander across on occasion. I am always drawn the ideas in quantum field theory where particles exist in a field of potential, it is only upon measurement that the field collapses. Feels like there is something interesting in having a similar mental model for identity.</p>

<p>Persistent Compute Objects, a fascinating but little known project originating from Phil Windely some time ago I believe. It is currently being actively developed at Brigham Young university.

<p>One idea that stuck with me from this is location based authentication. This is one of the reasons I was so interested by the <a href="https://foam.space/location">FOAM project</a>, although it seems a long way from reaching it’s potential at the moment.

Case by case there are always minor adjustments. Finally, there will be some form of Recommendation inviting the board to note key facts and approve the request.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO) to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called &nbsp; “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; Some will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix; how and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>The intention of this new heading and section is that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert, that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specifies any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <br><p>In regards to the independent auditor, this should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider, this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body, this is about third party verification and validation. A company you build a list of experts and cycle through them on a regular basis. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and a large insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important, this does not remove data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Data Attestation</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany PLC Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in the presentation of this paper. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why do this?</p><p>Whilst Directors are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions they take, right now there is a gap in skills in data and many board members don’t know how to test the data that forms the basis on which they are being asked to approve. This is all new and a level of detail that requires deep expertise.&nbsp; This provides an additional line until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data properly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper, however, the data expertise and skills in the majority of senior levels are also well below what we need.&nbsp; If nothing else it will get those presenting to think carefully about data, bias and the ethics of their proposal.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg</a> Why developer-first IAM&nbsp;? And why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters? <p>In my previous blog, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>, I discussed why the enterprises will demand for developer-first IAM. As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/">announcement</a> came yesterday on Okta’s intention to acquire Auth0 for $6.5B, which is probably 40 times the Auth0’s current revenue, is a true validation of the push towards developer-first IAM. However, this is not Okta’s first effort towards developer-first IAM. In 2017, Okta acquired Stormpath, a company that built tools to help developers to integrate login with their apps. Stormpath soon got absorbed into the Okta platform, but yet, Okta’s selling strategy didn’t change. It was always top-down.</p><p>In contrast to Okta, Auth0 follows a bottom-up sales strategy. One of the analysts I spoke to couple of years back told that the Auth0 name comes in an inquiry call only when a developer joins in. The acquisition of Auth0 will give Okta, the access to a broader market. So, it is important for Okta to let Auth0 run as an independent business, as also mentioned in the acquisition announcement.</p><p>Auth0 is not just about the product; but also the developer tooling, content and the developer community around it. Okta will surely benefit from this ecosystem around Auth0. Also, for years, Azure is the primary competitor of Okta, and Auth0 acquisition will make Okta stronger against Azure in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Late 2020, in one of the the earnings calls, the Okta announced that it sees the total market for its workplace identity management software as $30 billion, but it sees another, additional market for customer identity software at $25 billion. In the customer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven customer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements. The developer-first IAM is more critical in building a CIAM solution than in workforce IAM. In the latest Forrester <a href="https://wso2.com/resources/analyst-reports/the-forrester-wave-customer-identity-and-access-management-q4-2020/">report</a> on CIAM, Auth0 is way ahead of Okta, in terms of the current product offering. Okta will probably use Auth0 to increase their presence in the CIAM domain. Like Microsoft has Azure AD to focus on workforce IAM and Azure B2C to focus on CIAM, Auth0 could be Okta’s offering for&nbsp;CIAM.</p>Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020<p>When Auth0 was founded in 2013, it picked a less-saturated (even right to say fresh), future-driven market segment in IAM — developer-first. Developer-first is all about the experience. Auth0 did extremely well there. They were worried about building the right level of developer experience, rather than the feature set. Even today, Auth0 stands against others not because of their feature set, but the experience they build for developers.</p><p>The developer-first experience is not only about the product. How you build product features in a developer-first manner, probably contribute 50% of the total effort. The rest is about developer tooling, SDKs, and the content. Then again, the content is not just about the product. The larger portion of the content needs to be on how to integrate the product with a larger ecosystem — and also to teach developers the basic constructs, concepts and best practices in IAM. That helps to win the developer trust!</p>How the Auth0 website looked like in July,&nbsp;2014<p>Auth0’s vision towards developer-first IAM evolved over the past. The way the Auth0 website itself evolved in terms of the messaging and the presentation, reflects how much they want to be on the enterprisy side more today than in the past. As they claim Auth0 has 9000+ enterprise customers, which probably generate $150M annual revenue, the average sales value (ASV) would be around $16500. That probably means, the majority of Auth0 customers are in free/developer/developer pro tiers. So, it’s understandable why they want to bring in enterprise look and messaging, probably moving forward to focus more on top-down driven sales strategy. The big Contact Sales button over the Signup button on the Auth0 website today, sums up this direction to some extent.The Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 could probably strengthen this&nbsp;move.</p>How the Auth0 website looks like today (March,&nbsp;2021)<p>Like Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B in 2018, Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 for $6.5B is a win for developers! Congratulations to both Auth0 and Okta and very much looking forward to see the journey of Auth0 together with&nbsp;Okta.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/why-developer-first-iam-and-why-oktas-auth0-acquisition-matters-9fff3dde81">Why developer-first IAM and why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is not a very good question; what do you trust me for would be far better, but that is often too raw, so we prefer the former.</p> Does this framing of trust help? <p>We might adopt it within the team to allow us to define the starting and endpoints and the journey, avoiding the word naked word “trust.”&nbsp; We also need to recognise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis</a>, which creates different paths between becoming more trustworthy and either losing trust (time and inaction) or the destruction of trust by action.&nbsp; I would expect everyone has a different hysteresis, and it will vary by age, experience, value, relationships, chemistry and time.&nbsp; We are all on the journey, but we also need to determine who is on the journey with us and if we want to walk at the pace of the slowest or leave a few behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps there is a good reason we find it hard to define trust?</p> <br>

There are many exceptions to this model.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand from the <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business RoundTable 2019</a> report that companies in western capital markets are encouraged to think broader and include values that benefit society and all dependent ecosystems.&nbsp; The orange box in figure 1.</p><p>ESG thinking pushes all the boundaries further such that our values/ principles create a sustainable earth, society becomes accountable for its actions, and all ecosystems become healthy (this solves the boundary problem with circular economy thinking where you cannot ignore your actions have an effect on everyone else).

<p>In Winter, the cap of dark on half the Earth is cocked to the north. So, as the planet spins, places farther north get more night in the winter. In McGrath, Alaska, at close to sixty-three degrees north, most of the day is dark. This would be discouraging to most people, but to Paul B. Walker it’s a blessing. Because Paul is a DXer.</p>
<p>In the radio world, DX stands for for distance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXing">DXing</a> is listening to distant radio stations. Thanks to that darkness, Paul listens to AM stations of all sizes, from Turkey to Tennessee, Thailand to Norway. And last night, New Zealand. Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newstalk_ZB">NewsTalk ZB</a>‘s main AM signal at 1035 on the AM (what used to be the) dial. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.distancecalculator.net/">distancecalculator.net</a>, the signal traveled 11886.34 km, or 7385.83 miles, across the face of the earth. In fact it flew much farther, since the signal needed to bounce up and down off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#E_layer">E layer</a> of the ionosphere and the surface of the ocean multiple times between Wellington and McGrath. While that distance is no big deal on shortwave (which bounces off a higher layer) and no deal at all on the Internet (where we are all <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/the-giant-zero-ce71920a2580">zero distance apart</a>), for a DXer that’s like hauling in a fish the size of a boat.</p>
<p>In this sense alone, Paul and I are kindred souls. As a boy and a young man, I was a devout DXer too. I logged thousands of AM and FM stations, from my homes in New Jersey and North Carolina. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157701501898062">Here is a collection</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card#History">QSL cards</a> I got from stations to which I reported reception, in 1963, when I was a sophomore in high school.) More importantly, learning about all these distant stations sparked my interest in geography, electronics, geology, weather, astronomy, history and other adjacent fields. By the time I was a teen, I could draw all the states of the country, freehand, and name their capitals too. And that was on top of knowing on sight the likely purpose of every broadcast tower and antenna I saw. For example, I can tell you (and do in the mouse-over call-outs you’ll see if you click on the photo) what FM and TV station transmits from every antenna in this picture (of Mt. Wilson, above Los Angeles):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/50170283411/in/album-72157715298138792/"></a></p>
<p>As a photographer, I’ve shot thousands of pictures of towers and antennas. (See <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">here</a>.) In fact, that’s how I met Paul, who created and runs a private Facebook group called (no kidding) “I Take Pictures of Transmitter Sites.” This is not a small group. It has 14,100 members, and is one of the most active and engaging groups I have ever joined.</p>
<p>One reason it’s so active is that many of the members (and perhaps most of them) are, or were, engineers at radio and TV stations, and their knowledge of many topics, individually and collectively, is massive.</p>
<p>There is so much you need to know about the world if you’re a broadcast engineer.</p>
<p>On AM you have to know about ground conductivity, directional arrays (required so stations don’t interfere with each other), skywave signals such as the ones Paul catches and the effects of tower length on the sizes and shapes of the signals they radiate.</p>
<p>On FM you need to know the relative and combined advantages of antenna height and power, how different numbers of stacked antennas concentrate signal strength toward and below the horizon, the shadowing effects of buildings and terrain, and how the capacitive properties of the earth’s troposphere can sometimes bend signals so they go much farther than they would normally.</p>
<p>On TV you used to care about roughly the same issues as FM (which, in North America is sandwiched between the two original TV bands). Now you need to know a raft of stuff about how digital transmission works as well.</p>
<p>And that’s just a small sampling of what needs to be known in all three forms of broadcasting. And the largest body of knowledge in all three domains is what actually happens to signals in the physical world—which differs enormously from place to place, and region to region.</p>
<p>All of this gives the engineer a profound sense of what comprises the physical world, and how it helps, limits, and otherwise interacts with the electronic one. Everyone in the business is like the fool on the Beatles’ hill, seeing the sun going down and the world spinning round. And, while it’s not a dying profession, it’s a shrinking one occupied by especially stalwart souls. And my hat’s off to them.</p>
<p>By the way, you can actually hear Paul Walker for yourself, in&nbsp;two places. One is as a guest on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/55">this Reality 2.0 podcast</a>, which I did in January. The other is live on <a href="https://www.kskopublicradio.com/">KSKO/89.5</a> in McGrath, where he’s the program director. You don’t need to be a DXer to enjoy either one.</p>

  <p>Summary: I'm excited to announce a new, stable, production-ready pico engine. The latest release of the Pico Engine (1.X) provides a more modular design that better supports future enhancements and allows picos to be less dependent on a specific engine for operation.</p>


 


<p>
    The <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">pico engine</a> creates and manages picos.1  Picos (persistent compute objects) are internet-first, persistent, actors that are a good choice for building reactive systems—especially in the Internet of Things.
</p>

<p>
    Pico engine is the name we gave to the node.js <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/09/the_10-year_platform_shutting_down_kre.shtml">rewrite</a> of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/kre">Kynetx Rules Engine</a> back in 2017. <a href="https://github.com/farskipper">Matthew Wright</a> and <a href="https://github.com/b1conrad">Bruce Conrad</a> have been the principal developers of the pico engine. 
</p>

<p>
    The 2017 rewrite (Pico Engine 0.X) was a great success. When we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/03/rebuilding_krl.shtml">started that project</a>, I listed speed, internet-first, small deployment, and attribute-based event authorization as the goals. The 0.X rewrite achieved all of these. The new engine was small enough to be able to be deployed on Raspberry Pi's and other small computers and yet was significantly faster. One <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/using_picos_for_byus_priority_registration.shtml">test we did</a> on a 2015 13" Macbook Pro handled 44,504 events in over 8000 separate picos in 35 minutes and 19 seconds. The throughput was 21 events per second or 47.6 milliseconds per request.
</p>

<p>
    This past year Matthew and Bruce reimplemented the pico engine with some significant improvements and architectural changes. We've released that as Pico Engine 1.X. This blog post discusses the improvements in Pico Engine 1.X, after a brief introduction of picos so you'll know why you should care. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Picos 

<p>
    Picos support an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> of distributed computation. Picos have the following three properties. In response to a received message, 
</p>
 
     picos send messages to other picos—Picos <a>respond to events and queries</a> by running rules. Depending on the rules installed, a pico may raise events for itself or other picos. 
     picos create other picos—Picos can create and delete other picos, resulting in a parent-child hierarchy of picos.  
     picos change their internal state (which can affect their behavior when the next message received)—Each pico has a set of persistent variables that can only be affected by rules that run in response to events. 
 

<p>
      I <a>describe picos</a> and their <a>API and programming model</a> in more detail elsewhere. Event-driven systems, like those built from picos, can be used to create systems that meet the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/11/reactive_programming_with_picos.shtml">Reactive Manifesto</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite the parent-child hierarchy, picos can be arranged in a heterachical network for peer-to-peer communication and computation. As mentioned, picos support direct asynchronous messaging by sending events to other picos. Picos have an internal event bus for distributing those messages to rules installed in the pico. Rules in the pico are selected to run based on declarative <a href="http://docs.kynetx.com/display/docs/Event+Expressions">event expressions</a>. The pico matches events on the bus with event scenarios declared in the event expressions. Event expressions can specify simple single event matches, or complicated event relationships with temporal ordering. Rules whose event expressions match are scheduled for execution. Executing rules may raise additional events. More detail about the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189951/Event+Loop+Introduction">event loop and pico execution model</a> are available elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
    Each pico presents a unique <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189953/Event-Query+API">Event-Query API</a> that is dependent on the specific rulesets installed in the pico. Picos share nothing with other picos except through messages exchanged between them. Picos don't know and can't directly access or affect the internal state of another pico. </p>

<p>
    As a result of their design, picos exhibit the following important properties:
</p>

 
     Lock-free concurrency—picos respond to messages without locks.  
     Isolation—state changes in one pico cannot affect the state in other picos.  
     Location transparency—picos can live on multiple hosts and so computation can be scaled easily and across network boundaries.  
     Loose coupling—picos are only dependent on one another to the extent of their design.  

 


<a></a>
 Pico Engine 1.0 

<p>
    Version 1.0 is a rewrite of pico-engine that introduces major improvements:
</p>
 
     A more pico-centric architecture that makes picos less dependent on a particular engine. 
     
     A more module design that supports future improvements and makes the engine code easier to maintain and understand.  
     Ruleset versioning and sharing to facilitate decentralized code sharing.
     
     Better, attribute-based channel policies for more secure system architecture.
     
     A new UI written in React that uses the event-query APIs of the picos themselves to render.
     
 

<p>
    One of our goals for future pico ecosystems is build not just distributed, but decentralized peer-to-peer systems. One of the features we'd very much like picos to have is the ability to move between engines seamlessly and with little friction. Pico engine 1.X better supports this roadmap.
</p>

<p>
    Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the primary components. The new engine is built on top of two primary modules: <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-framework"><code>pico-framework</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/select-when"><code>select-when</code></a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Pico Engine Modular Architecture (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The <code>pico-framework</code> handles the building blocks of a Pico based system:
</p>
 
     Pico lifecycle—picos exist from the time they're created until they're deleted. 
     Pico parent/child relationships—Every pico, except for the root pico, has a parent. All picos may have children. 
     Events—picos respond to events based on the rules that are installed in the pico. The <code>pico-framework</code> makes use of the <code>select_when</code> library to create rules that <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189912/Event+Expressions">pattern match on event streams</a>. 
     Queries—picos can also respond to queries based on the rulesets that are installed in the pico. 
     Channels—Events and queries arrive on channels that are created and deleted. Access control policies for events and queries on a particular channel are also managed by the <code>pico-framework</code> 
     Rulesets—the framework manages installing, caching, flushing, and sandboxing rulesets. 
     Persistence—all picos have persistence and can manage persistent data. The <code>pico-framework</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/Level/levelup">Levelup</a> to define an interface for a LevelDB compatible data store and uses it to handle persistence of picos. 
 

<p>
    The <code>pico-framework</code> is language agnostic. <code>Pico-engine-core</code> combines <code>pico-framework</code> with facilities for rendering <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189890/KRL+Manual">KRL</a>, the rule language used to program rulesets. KRL rulesets are compiled to Javascript for <code>pico-framework</code>. <code>Pico-engine-core</code> contains a registry (transparent to the user) that caches compiled rulesets that have been installed in picos. In addition, <code>pico-engine-core</code> includes a number of <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189596/Libraries">standard libraries</a> for KRL. Rulesets are compiled to Javascript for execution. The Javascript produced by the rewrite is much more readable than that rendered by the 0.X engine. Because of the new modular design, rulesets written entirely in Javascript can be added to a pico system.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>pico engine</code> combines the <code>pico-engine-core</code> with a LevelDB-compliant persistent store, an HTTP server, a log writer, and a ruleset loader for full functionality. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Wrangler 
<p>
    <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1686929547/Wrangler">Wrangler</a> is the pico operating system. Wrangler presents an event-query API for picos that supports programatically managing the pico lifecycle, channels and policies, and rulesets.  Every pico created by the pico engine has Wrangler installed automatically to aid in programatically interacting with picos.

    One of the goals of the new pico engine was to support picos moving between engines. Picos relied too heavily on direct interaction with the engine APIs in 0.X and thus were more tightly coupled to the engine than is necessary. The 1.0 engine minimizes the coupling to the largest extent possible. Wrangler, written in KRL, builds upon the core functionality provided by the engine to provide developers with an API for building pico systems programmatically. A great example of that is the Pico Engine Developer UI, discussed next. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Pico Engine Developer UI 

<p>
    Another significant change to the pico engine with the 1.0 release was a rewritten <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/32585778/Developer+UI">Developer UI</a>. In 0.X, the UI was hard coded into the engine. The 1.X UI is a single page web application (SPA) written in React. The SPA uses an API that the engine provides to get the channel identifier (ECI) for the root pico in the engine. The UI SPA uses that ECI to connect to the API implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/blob/master/packages/pico-engine/krl/io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl"><code>io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl</code></a> ruleset (which is installed automatically in every pico).
</p>

<p>
    Figure 2 shows the initial Developer UI screen. The display is the network of picos in the engine. Black lines represent parent-child relationships and form a tree with the root pico at the root. The pink lines are subscriptions between picos—two-way channels formed by exchanging ECIs. Subscriptions are used to form peer-to-peer (heterachical) relationships between picos and do no necessarily have to be on the same engine. 
</p>

<p>
    When a box representing a pico in the Developer UI is clicked, the display shows an interface for performing actions on the pico as shown in Figure 3. The interface shows a number of tabs. 
</p>
 
     The About tab shows information about the pico, including its parent and children. The interface allows information about the pico to be changed and new children to be created.
     
     The Rulesets tab shows any rulesets installed in the pico, allows them to be flushed from the ruleset cache, and for new rulesets to be installed.
     
     The Channels tab is used to manage channels and channel policies.
     
     The Logging tab shows execution logs for the pico.
     
     The Testing tab provides an interface for exercising the event-query APIs that the rulesets installed in the pico provide.
     
     The Subscriptions tab provides an interface for managing the pico's subscriptions and creating new ones.

<p>
    Because the Developer UI is just using the APIs provided by the pico, everything it does (and more) can be done programatically by code running in the picos themselves. Most useful pico systems will be created and managed programmatically using Wrangler. The Developer UI provides a convenient console for exploring and testing during development. The <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/blob/master/packages/pico-engine/krl/io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl"><code>io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl</code></a> ruleset can be replaced or augmented by another ruleset the developer installs on the pico to provide a different interface to the pico. Interesting pico-based system will have applications that interact with their APIs to present the user interface. For example, <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/#/login">Manifold</a> is a SPA written in React that creates a system of picos for use in IoT applications.

    In addition to the work on the engine itself, one of the primary workstreams at present is to complete Bruce Conrad's excellent work to use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDs and DIDComm</a> as the basis for inter-pico communication, called ACA-Pico (Aries Cloud Agent - Pico).

This work is important because it will replace the current <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/186843209/Managing+Subscriptions">subscriptions</a> method of connecting heterarchies of picos with DIDComm. This has the obvious advantages of being more secure and aligned with an important emerging standard. More importantly, because DIDComm is protocological, this will support protocol-based interactions between picos, including <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">credential exchange</a>.

  <p>Summary:      Picos make building decentralized applications easy. This blog post shows a heterarchical sensor network can built using picos.</p>

<p>
    Picos are designed to form heterarchical, or peer-to-peer, networks by connecting directly with each other. Because <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/announcing_pico_engine_10.shtml#picos">picos use an actor model of distributed computation</a>, parent-child relationships are very important. When a pico creates another pico, we say that it is the parent and the pico that got created is the child. The parent-child connection allows the creating pico to perform life-cycle management tasks on the newly minted pico such as installing rulesets or even deleting it. And the new pico can create children of its own, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
    Building a system of picos for a specific application requires programming them to perform the proper lifecycle management tasks to create the picos that model the application. <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1686929547/Wrangler">Wrangler is a ruleset installed in every pico automatically</a> that is the pico operating system. Wrangler provides rules and functions for performing these life-cycle management tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Building a pico application can rarely rely on the hierarchical parent-child relationships that are created as picos are managed. Instead, picos create connections between picos by creating what are called <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/186843209/Managing+Subscriptions">subscriptions</a>, providing bi-directional channels used for raising events to and making queries of the other pico.
</p>

<p>
    This diagram shows a network of temperature sensors built using picos. In the diagram, black lines are parent-child relationships, while pink lines are peer-to-peer relationships between picos.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Temperature Sensor Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    There are two picos (one salmon and the other green) labeled a "Sensor Community". These are used for management of the temperature sensor picos (which are purple). These community picos are performing life-cycle management of the various sensor picos that are their children. They can be used to create new sensor picos and delete those no longer needed. Their programming determines what rulesets are installed in the sensor picos. Because of the rulesets installed, they control things like whether the sensor pico is active and how often if updates its temperature. These communities might represent different floors of a building or different departments on a large campus. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite the fact that there are two different communities of temperature sensors, the pink lines tell us that there is a network of connections that spans the hierarchical communities to create a single connected graph of sensors. In this case, the sensor picos are programmed to use a gossip protocol to share temperature information and threshold violations with each other. They use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> to keep track of the number of threshold violations currently occuring in the network. 
</p>

<p>
    The community picos are not involved in the network interactions of the sensor picos. The sensor network operates independently of the community picos and does not rely on them for communication. Astute readers will note that both communities are both children of a "root" pico. That's an artifact of the way I built this, not a requirement. Every pico engine has a root pico that has no parent. These two communities could have been built on different engines and still created a sensor network that spanned multiple communities operating on multiple engines. 
</p>

<p>
    Building decentralized networks of picos is relatively easy because picos provide support for many of the difficult tasks. The actor model of picos makes them naturally concurrent without the need for locks. Picos have persistent, independent state so they do not depend on external data stores. Picos have a persistent identity—they exist with a single identity from the time of their creation until they are deleted. Picos are persistently available, always on and ready to receive messages. You can see more about the programming that goes into creating these systems in these lessons: <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/21168151/Pico-Based+Systems+Lesson">Pico-Based Systems</a> and <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/21659676/Pico+to+Pico+Subscriptions+Lesson">Pico to Pico Subscriptions</a>.

The reality of leadership and management is that it is a complex adaptive system, and context enables your nature to emerge and nurturing to mature.&nbsp; This is important because we also know there is a link between strategy, styles (leadership) and business structures.&nbsp; In this article, we will unpack how your “nature or nurture” thinking-structure, affects outcomes.&nbsp; Your thinking-structure is also a complex adaptive system as your peers and customers thinking, your companies “culture of structure” thinking affect you. BUT have you considered how your data structure and your data philosophy will have a direct and significant impact on outcomes?&nbsp; <br><p>I’ve known that my neurodiversity package (severe dyslexia, mild high functioning autism, ADHD) informs how I interrupt the world as my “biological cortex” and gut-brain axis structures process sensory data and memory uniquely. I cannot modify my mind or brain’s basic structure any more than I could change my fingerprint, core DNA or the colour of my eyes; however, I can play with my microbiome. It’s an essential part of what makes me, me. My chemical and biological structures enable me to make sense of the world in my way.&nbsp; Communication (language, words, music, song, dance, art, sound, movement, gesture) enables us to share the sense we create from patterns and align with others who approximate the same (tribe).&nbsp; How we actually make sense (learn) is intensely debated, with one camp believing that language is our sense maker, assuming that we might observe patterns but cannot understand it without language? Other than that, we make sense and then create a language to communicate the insight we have gained.&nbsp; Irrespective, language allows us to both structure and navigate our space and share the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is how we structure or frame something nature or nurture? <p>Why does this question matter? We all read, speak and write differently, we all understand differently, but we use questions to clarify understanding, check meaning and create common interruption.&nbsp; How we individually structure meaning is determined from the perspective we have been given (nature), from what we have been taught (nurture) and what we align to (bias).&nbsp; Our structure is an ontology*. Imagine putting one person from each of our worlds religions or faith groups into a room, but assume no-one can speak the same language.&nbsp; How and what would they agree or disagree about as there is no common structure (ontology)</p><p>* An ontology is “the set of things whose existence is acknowledged by a particular theory or system of thought.”&nbsp; (The Oxford Companion to Philosophy)&nbsp;</p><p>By way of example, the word “Evil” creates meaning for you as soon as you read it. Without a doubt, the nature of evil is a complex and nuanced area too often glossed over in a rush to present or evaluate the defences and theodicies. Let’s unpack the word using the super book “<a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/making-evil/dr-julia-shaw/9781786891327">Making Evil</a>” by <a href="https://www.drjuliashaw.com/">Dr Julia Shaw</a>. &nbsp; Evil is an unavoidable part of life that we all encounter as we all suffer in one sense or another, but what makes something evil is a matter of framing/ structure/ ontology. “Natural evil” is the pain and suffering that arises from the natural world’s functioning or malfunctioning. “Moral evil” is the pain and suffering that results from conscious human action or inaction. It is evil where a person or people are to blame for the suffering that occurs; a crucial point is the blameworthiness of the person at fault. Moral evil, at its heart, results from the free choice of a moral agent. If we just look at the consequences, it is not always possible to tell whether moral evil has taken place or not; we have many mitigations. Therefore a level of moral evil can be found in the degree of intention and consequence.&nbsp; However, if we compare death rates for natural evil (suffering) and moral evil at an extreme people killing people, the latter is a rounding error in the form of suffering in the world. The point is that by framing something, I can create a structure for understanding. Critically our structures frame our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Critically our structures frame our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Structures are ontologies which are philosphies.&nbsp; <p>To explore that our structures frame our understanding, what ontology makes us human? When we look at the different view below, we can view humans in many different ways. Note: I have deliberately ignored the classical all living things ontology structure (insects, birds, fish, mammal, reptiles, plant).&nbsp; The point is that your framing or how you structure something at the start leads to a guided conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Our framing or how we structure something at the start leads to a guided conclusion.</p><p>Pick a different structure, and you get a different answer; the ontology creates a natural conclusion.&nbsp; It is likely that if you pick a philosophy/ ontology/ structure, you can only get what that framing will shine a light on or enable.</p><p>It is likely that if you pick a philosphies/ ontology/ structure, you can only get what that structure will shine a light on or enable.</p><p></p> This matters because all data has structure! <p>I explore continually the future of the digital business, which are underpinned by data, privacy, consent and identity.&nbsp; <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">Data is Data (it is not oil or sunshine</a>).&nbsp; <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">What is The Purpose of your Data</a>? <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">Quantum (Data) Risk</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/executive-leadership-briefing-is-the-data-presented-to-you-enabling-a-real-choice-5a973c69c9ba">Does data create a choice?</a> <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/is-kpis-innovations-nemesis-cdc320a30c67">Data and KPI’s</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/wisdom-is-nothing-more-than-new-data-wisdom-is-definitely-not-a-pinnacle-9d4e172f1918">Wisdom is just more data</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/when-complex-multi-dimensional-data-and-analysis-create-users-that-cannot-exist-e5776a2fd7b">Data can create what does not exist</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-not-memory-5b34fee8fed">Data is not Memory</a>.</p><p>I am asking these questions of directors, boards, senior leadership teams and data/ data managers.

The connection is the mindset of the leader. Outstanding leadership with an open mindset can choose which loop is best at this time.&nbsp; Poor leadership will stick to the lower closed mindset loop.&nbsp; The lower loop never starts with a different way of asking questions or solving problems.&nbsp; Those in this self-confirming loop stick to the same biases, same decisions and same paradigms.&nbsp; This creates the ideas of one culture and a fixed culture. &nbsp; We have our way of doing it.&nbsp; The approach is consistency; the methods are highly efficient and based on the $1bn profit last year, we know it works, and we should continue to do the same.&nbsp; The reward mechanism, KPI and balanced scorecards are structured to keep the same highly efficient and effective thinking.&nbsp; Is assumes that yesterday, today and tomorrow will create the same outcomes if we do it the same.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with this, and during times of stability, many have made vast fortunes with this approach.</p><p>Great leaders follow this loop when it is right but can also swop to the upper loop.&nbsp; Such leaders sense a change. Such a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift">paradigm shift</a>”, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, “is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline”.&nbsp; This shift means there is a new structure to understand (ontology). This paradigm shift has a new structure, which means that there is a need to determine the new culture to create value with a new structure.&nbsp; Together a team will form an approach.&nbsp; At this point, the team will question the shift and the assumptions that have led to change, setting a new mindset for the new order.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically - understanding structure and ontology is crucial, and it is why I believe Data Philosophy, Data Ontology and better decisions based on data are current board issues. Still, they require new skills, are highly detailed, and often require a mind shift.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding structure and ontology is crucial for a data-driven digital board.</p><br><p></p><br> Implication 2.&nbsp; AI and Automation <p>The Data Paradox.&nbsp; How are you supposed to know how to create questions about something that you did not know we had to ask a question of?</p><p>Every child reads a book differently. A child learns to use questions to check and refine understanding. Every software engineer reads code differently. A software engineer is forced to check their understanding of the code and function by asking questions and by being asked questions. Whilst every AI will create sense from the data differently (ontology and code), right now, an AI cannot check its understanding of data by asking questions! Who could/would/ should the AI ask the clarification question of, and how do we check the person who answered is without bias? (Note I am not speaking about <a href="https://medium.com/dataseries/training-machine-learning-models-to-ask-the-right-questions-b6235dd5872b">AQA</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sherlock Holmes in The Great Game says, “people do not like telling you things; they love to contradict you. Therefore if you want smart answers, do not ask a question. Instead, give a wrong answer or ask a question in such a way that it already contains the wrong information. It is highly likely that people will correct you”.&nbsp; Do you do this to your data, or can you do this to your AI?</p><p>Today (Feb 2021), we cannot write an “algorithm” that detects if AI is going to create harm (evil). Partly because we cannot agree on “harm”, we cannot determine the unintended consequences, and we cannot bound harm for a person vs society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is a drive towards automation for efficiency based on the analysis of data. As a Director, are you capable of asking the right questions to determine bias and prejudice created in the automated processes, the data structures, different ontologies, data attestation or bias in the processes?&nbsp; Given Directors are accountable and responsible - indeed, this is a skill all board needs. Where is the audit and quota for these skills, can you prove it is available to the board?&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

<p>Loved reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff&nbsp;Lawson</a>.</p><p>Jeff says in the book that every company is on a journey to becoming a software company and everyone is starting to see the world through the lens of software. He defines the term, software person. A software person is not necessarily a developer, it’s anybody who, when faced with a problem, asks the question, how can software solve this&nbsp;problem?</p> Build vs. Buy (or vs.&nbsp;Die) <p>In the book, Jeff takes the popular debate, build vs. buy, to another dimension; build vs die. As every company is becoming a software company, the competitive advantage they build is in the software they build. When software becomes the interface where the services you offer, meet the customers; unless you build it in the way you want; you&nbsp;die!</p><p>Building what you want gives you the freedom to experiment (or innovate). More you experiment or the ability to experiment more, gives you the edge to understand your customers more. Hence, you grow your business.</p><p>Build, does not necessarily mean building everything from scratch. You don’t build anything that already exists, given that it provides what you need. You only build things that are core to your business, which help building your competitive advantage over all the others. The rest, or the building blocks that help you build what you wish are part of the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p> The Digital Supply&nbsp;Chain <p>Uber, for example, uses 4000+ microservices internally. However, not all of them are developed by Uber itself. Uber uses Google Maps API to pull out location data, the Twilio API to facilitate communication between passengers and drivers and many other APIs. All these APIs are coming from the digital supply chain Uber picks to build its product. Then again, these building blocks in Uber’s digital supply chain are also available to Lyft, and other Uber competitors around the world. What brings Uber the competitive advantage is in what they&nbsp;build!</p><p>The software you build, can be your product, at the same time it can be a building block for another product. Google Maps is Google’s product, however the Google Maps API is a building block for Uber. Alexa is a product of Amazon, however Alexa API is a a building block for&nbsp;Nissan.</p><p>Picking the right digital supply chain is equally important as what you pick to build. Think, what if Uber had to build something equivalent to Google Maps from the scratch? From 2016 to 2018, Uber paid 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Having the right digital supply chain helps you to optimize your development team to build only what you need and no more. Instagram, for example, was only a 13 people team, when Facebook acquired it for $1B in 2012; and WhatsApp team was only 50, when Facebook acquired it for $19B in&nbsp;2014.</p> Build Your Own Identity&nbsp;Stack? <p>Every service you develop, every API you design, every device you use, every person you interact with, will have a managed identity, and in today’s hyperconnected world, the Identity integrations with these business applications and systems, is going to be critical.</p><p>Going back to the build vs. die debate; do you still have to build the Identity stack to gain the competitive advantage in your business? If you are in the Identity business, of course yes, for all the others no. Identity stack you need to build your product is a building block in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>You never worried about building a TCP/IP stack yourself, so, don’t worry about building an Identity stack yourself. However, over the time we have spoken to over a thousand companies (hundreds of them are WSO2 customers), and in most of the cases they bring in unique identity requirements. The uniqueness comes in those requirements are specific to the industry they are in and also specific to the complexity of the business problem they want to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Identity is core to any business, and how you manage identity will also help you in building competitive advantage. At WSO2, we have worked with 90% of the Identity Server customers to solve complex identity problems. Identity Server is open source, and if the business problem is straightforward, they don’t even talk to us, they simply use the product as it is. However, when we work with complex Identity requirements, we have extended the product to solve specific business problems.</p><p>Building these extensions, specific to unique business requirements helped companies to differentiate themselves from others. Then again, they didn’t want to build everything from scratch — rather they started with what’s common (and available to everyone) and started innovating on that. That drastically reduced the time-to-market, and also gave the freedom to innovate.</p><p>I don’t intend to contradict with what I mentioned before, that the Identity stack is part of the digital supply chain you pick, however, the Identity stack you pick for the digital supply chain should have the flexibility to extend with minimal effort to build business requirements specific to your business.</p> The TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>In the 70’s, having support for TCP/IP in a product was considered to be a competitive advantage. Today, it’s given, and nobody worries about TCP/IP support; it’s everywhere.</p><p>Ian Glazer from Salesforce, mentioned in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZPd584l6o&amp;ab_channel=KuppingerCole">keynote</a> at the European Identity Conference 2016 that, it’s the TCP/IP moment in Identity now. He in fact talked about the open standards (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth, SCIM, XACML and so on) in the Identity domain, and how they are going to be part of every product, so no Identity vendor is going to gain competitive advantage just by supporting the open standards. RFPs looking for Identity products will not even worry about asking support for these open standards.</p> The Next TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>Developers do not worry about building a TCP/IP stack, or even worrying about TCP/IP while building software. We believe, the Identity integrations with business applications and systems need to be developer-first (or developer-focused) with the right level of abstractions and tools. And, doing that right, would be the next TCP/IP moment in Identity, that will free the developers from worrying about complexities in Identity integrations.</p> The Developer-first IAM <p>The single Identity administrator role has started diminishing, and the role of the developer is becoming more prominent in Identity integrations. These developers need a better abstraction over core identity concepts; and the developer-first IAM is the way to realize the next TCP/IP moment in Identity.</p><p>In the consumer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven consumer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements.</p><p>A developer-first IAM product builds an abstraction over the core Identity concepts in the form of APIs and SDKs, provides tools for troubleshooting, has the ability to integrate with the organization’s build pipeline, carries the right level of developer experience and has the ability to extend product’s core capabilities to fit into organization’s complex IAM requirements.</p><p>As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations. That’s the next TCP/IP moment in Identity!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

SSI — Legal compliance and the involvement of governments<p>This article describes how governments of sovereign states might be involved in building identity ecosystems based on self-sovereign principles and how regulatory conformity of such ecosystems can be achieved.</p><p>When it comes to identity management the involvement of the government can be a tricky topic. It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) might for some imply, that a citizen is suddenly able to issue his own ID-card, which isn’t the case. Governments are still the primary source of foundational identities.</p> The government as issuer of foundational identities <p>While individuals gain more autonomy with SSI the issuance of national IDs is still the responsibility of the public administration. The Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) differentiates between foundational and contextual identities.</p><blockquote>“A foundational identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).” <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">PCTF</a>&nbsp;[1]</blockquote><p>Hence, the government continues to be the issuer of foundational identities and still holds the authority to revoke these credentials when necessary. However, SSI also enables the usage of other identity providers, which are context dependent — leading to a contextual identity as further explained within the&nbsp;PCTF.</p><blockquote>“A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media). Depending on the identity context, a contextual identity may be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a drivers licence) or may not be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a social media profile).“ [1]</blockquote><p>This means a customer of a bank can use his verified bank ID to identify himself at a credit bureau. Since the bank ID is based on a foundational identity, the contextual identity provided by the bank can be sufficient in this particular use-case given the regulatory environment allows such a usage. However, a contextual identity can, but doesn’t have to be based on a foundational identity.</p><p>The European Commission supports the continued usage of contextual identities online and only demands the usage of foundational identities when required by law as stated in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528">eIDAS public consultation</a> [2] regarding the option to extend the regulation for the public&nbsp;sector:</p><blockquote>“A European identity solution enabling trusted identification of citizens and companies in their digital interactions to access public or private online services (e.g. e- commerce), should be entirely voluntary for users to adhere to and fully protect data and privacy. Anonymity of the internet should be ensured at all times by allowing solutions for anonymous authentication anonymously where user identification is not required for the provision of the service.“ [2]</blockquote> Regulatory compliancy <p>When dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) all involved stakeholders need to adhere to a certain set of laws, which dictate the usage of the such data. These laws highly depend on the citizenship of the data subject (the individual the PII is about) among other important factors. Although the following paragraphs are specifically devoted to the laws of the European Union, the conclusion might also be applied to similar laws such as the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> or the <a href="https://law.asia/regional-data-privacy-laws/">Indian Personal Data Protection Bill&nbsp;(DPA)</a>.</p><p>Within the European Union, there are two laws, which have a significant influence on identity frameworks. The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, determines how personal data from EU citizens can be collected and used. The other important law is the Electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) provision specified in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">N°910/2014</a> [3]. It constitutes the main electronic identification trust framework in the EU and is an elemental building block of the digital single&nbsp;market.</p> GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation Overview of important roles regarding PII data management according to international standards.<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessm%20ent+Reports">EBSI GDPR assessment</a> [4] notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“According to this Regulation, there are two types of actors whose key role in data processing and whose relationship to the data within the data processing environment leads the European legislator to attribute them a set of obligations and responsibilities. Thus, these liable actors are subject to data protection rules.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>These are data controllers, which are defined in article <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">4(7) GDPR</a> [5]&nbsp;as</p><blockquote>“the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law”&nbsp;[5]</blockquote><p>which</p><blockquote>“have to take all necessary measures so that data subjects are sufficiently informed and have the ability to exercise their data protection rights.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The other actor is the data processor who acts as delegate of the data controller and is a separate legal entity according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp169_en.pdf">opinion 1/2010 of the Data protection working party.</a> [6] With multiple nodes running a decentralized network every node acts as a data processor or data controller depending on if the node operator is processing the data as a delegate or not. The EBSI GDPR report further&nbsp;notes:</p><blockquote>“in case of joint controllership, data controllers can contractually assign partial responsibility based on distinct stages of data processing.“ While an agreement between these data processors can regulate the responsibilities, “data subjects will have ot (sic!) be able to exercise their rights against every joint controller“ and “nodes that add and process the on-chain ledger data in order to maintain the consensus will be individually qualified as joint data controllers and this, regardless of a contractual relationship stating the contrary.“ [4]</blockquote><p>For public blockchains with permissionless write access such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, this means, that every miner, which is participating in the proof of work consensus is regarded as data processor given there is an unintentional personal data leakage or correlation with an URL (Uniform resource locator) of a service endpoint within DID Documents as pointed out as critical to keep PII private by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID specification of the W3C in section 10.1</a>.[7] This threat in addition of the numerous other correlation risks mentioned in section 10.2 and 10.3 of said specification make the current implementation of SSI based on permissionless blockchains, which inhibit the capability for natural persons to write a anywise DID on the ledger, a daunting privacy challenge.</p><p>Another important aspect is the question if credentials (or any other form of PII) is stored as hash on the verifiable data registry. A hash is a data digest and is considered a one-way function, which in theory leads to an anonymization of the original information. The debate around the question if a hash constitutes PII is likely to continue, since national data protection agencies are struggling to clearly define if the hashing can be considered an anonymization or pseudonymization.</p><blockquote>“According to the Spanish DPA (Data protection agency), hashing can at times be considered as anonymization or pseudonymization depending on a variety of factors varying from the entities involved to the type of the data at hand.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>Even if the hash constitutes a one-way obfuscation technique, which anonymizes PII, it I) requires a transaction on a public ledger and II) it puts data controllers in a higher risk position with the obligation to avoid correlation of individuals. Risk minimizing obligations for data controllers are easier to implement when there is no hash of a verified credential or verified presentation stored on a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>When it comes to the wallet itself the EBSI GDPR report notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“there is growing consensus about the possibility of data subjects to being simultaneously considered as data controllers for the data that refer to themselves“. The report provides the recommendation that “the privacy preserving technical and organisational measures of the wallet and the personal data transmissions should ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place in order to not limit the empowerment of the data subject through the DLT chosen model.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The report concludes, that data within the wallet application is considered personal data and therefor is subject to the data protection regulation.</p><p>While there is a general assumption that e.g. <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/GDPR-Paper_V1.pdf">Hyperledger Indy implementations are GDPR compliant</a> [8], ultimately courts have to decide if that claim holds up based on a case by case evaluation on the particular implementation. Nevertheless, avoiding the exposure of PII on the verifiable data registry, by I) not allowing natural persons to write public DIDs and II) not storing PII in hashed form on the verifiable data registry facilitate the GDPR compliance obligations.</p> eIDAS: <p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">eIDAS regulation</a> [3] is concerned with two distinct topics. One part is concerned with trust services for private businesses such as electronic signatures, seal, time stamps etc. The other part is regulating the mutual recognition among member states of national implementations of electronic identification (eID) for the public sector. Is a technology neutral approach, which has a strong influence on the international regulatory space. The main goal of mutual recognition of eID is to enable EU citizens access to cross-border public services with their own national eID means. The implementation of eID schemes vary from member state to member state and not all member states have notified an eID scheme as illustrated by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS">overview of pre-notified and notified eID schemes</a> [9] under&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><p>There are three levels of assurance specified for eIDs under eIDAS referring to the degree of confidence in the claimed identity of a person, which include detailed criteria allowing member states to map their eID means against a benchmark (low, substantial and high). Current SSI implementations have the objective to be recognized with a level of assurance specified as substantial.</p><p>It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI by leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessment+Reports">SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo</a> [10]. Especially interesting is the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge">SSI eIDAS bridge</a>, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by deriving a national eID by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Spe%20V%20cification+%2815%29+-+eIDAS+bridge+for+VC-eSealing">technical specification</a>.[12]</p><p>Nevertheless, there are also hindrances in the process of creating a qualified certificate with the derived national identity, because of the way the regulation is defining a qualified signature. Another issue is that national eID schemes require the keys to be in a secure element. However, current SSI wallets only offer software keys and do not leverage the security benefits of a hardware element. Furthermore, the eIDAS regulation doesn’t regulate the case of a private entity issuing an eID attribute to a natural person for the usage of it in other private interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the authentication process to achieve the recognition of notified eIDAS schemes by other member states requires a national node, which provides the authentication service. While aimed to be technology neutral, the obligation to provide this authentication service as delegated authentication component has several drawbacks and also hinders the potential adoption of SSI. The EU has already identified the need to re-evaluate the policies set by&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><blockquote>“Fundamental changes in the overall societal context suggest a revision of the eIDAS Regulation. These include a dramatic increase in the use of novel technologies, such as distributed-ledger based solutions, the Internet of Thing, Artificial Intelligence and biometrics, changes in the market structure where few players with significant market power increasingly act as digital identity ‘gatekeepers’, changes in user behavior with increasing demand for instant, convenient and secure identification and the evolution of EU Data Protection legislation” [2]</blockquote><p>The consultation continues with its&nbsp;target:</p><blockquote>“The objective of this initiative is, first of all, to provide a future proof regulatory framework to support an EU-wide, simple, trusted and secure system to manage identities in the digital space, covering identification, authentication and the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations. Secondly, the initiative aims at creating a universal pan-European single digital ID. These objectives could be achieved through an overhaul of the eIDAS system, an extension of eIDAS to the private sector, the introduction of a European Digital Identity (EUid) building on the eIDAS system or combination of both.”&nbsp;[2]</blockquote><p>In an private interview for an academic study Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo suggested embodying new technologies such as SSI into the revised regulation e.g. by not mandating the provision of an authentication facility and creating new trust services such as electronic identification. In another private interview Luca Boldrin suggested keeping national identity systems as they are but use a derivation of national identity for cross-border context for public and private businesses in parallel to current node implementation to enable a European identity.</p><p>Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo argues that having derived national eIDs and eID trust services has the benefit of increased privacy by using a peer to peer authentication instead of a delegated authentication model (the national eIDAS node). This also leads to less liability issues by shifting the authentication part to private providers as well as less costs associated with running authentication infrastructure for governments, because these are provided by Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) instead of national eIDAS nodes. These DPKI systems also have the benefits of being more resilient to attacks compared to a single node, which represents a single point of failure. However, regulating eID as trust service also means opening up identification for the private market, which might not be in the interest of national governments.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>When I walk around our neighborhood I see very few copies of our local newspaper on sidewalks, porches, and front lawns. We subscribe because it’s a lifelong habit, and because we like to support local journalism, and in my case because it’s a welcome reprieve from a long day of screentime.</p>
<p>This archaic habit has also, weirdly, become a kind of superpower. From time to time I meet people who are surprised when I know facts about them. These facts are public information, so why should it be surprising that I know them? Because they appear in the print edition of the newspaper. Consider the man in this photo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were out for a Sunday morning walk, carrying the newspaper, when we saw him in a cafe. We had just read an article about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petalumawhiskerino/photos">Whiskerino</a>, the annual contest of fancy beards and mustaches in Petaluma. And here was the guy whose photo was featured in the article!</p>
<p>That was a nice coincidence, but the kicker is that he had no idea his picture was in the paper. Not being of newspaper-reading age, and not having friends of newspaper-reading age, he had to depend on elders to alert him. I guess we got to him before his parents did.</p>
<p>When a similar thing happened this weekend, it occurred to me that this could be a good marketing strategy for newspapers. Do you want to wield an information superpower? Do you want to amaze people by knowing facts that they can’t imagine you could possibly know? Subscribe to the print edition of your local newspaper!</p>

  <p>Summary: Passwords are ruining the web with awful, lengthy, and inconsistent user experiences. They're insecure and lead to data breaches. The good news is there are good ways for web sites to be passwordless. If you hate passwords, build the world you want to live in.</p>




<p>
    Compare, for a moment, your online, web experience at your bank with the mobile experience from the same bank. Chances are, if you're like me, that you pick up your phone and use a biometric authentication method (e.g. FaceId) to open it. Then you select the app and the biometrics play again to make sure it's you, and you're in. 
</p>

<p>
    On the web, in contrast, you likely end up at a landing page where you have to search for the login button which is hidden in a menu or at the top of the page. Once you do, it probably asks you for your identifier (username). You open up your password manager (a few clicks) and fill the username and only then does it show you the password field1. You click a few more times to fill in the password. Then, if you use multi-factor authentication (and you should), you get to open up your phone, find the 2FA app, get the code, and type it in. To add insult to injury, the ceremony will be just different enough at every site you visit that you really don't develop much muscle memory for it. 
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence, when I need somethings from my bank, I pull out my phone and use the mobile app. And it's not just banking. This experience is replicated on any web site that requires authentication. Passwords and the authentication experience are ruining the web. 
</p>

<p>
    I wouldn't be surprised to find businesses abandon functional web sites in the future. There will still be some marketing there (what we used to derisively call "brochure-ware") and a pointer to the mobile app. Businesses love mobile apps not only because they can deliver a better user experience (UX) but because they allow business to better engage people. Notifications, for example, get people to look at the app, giving the business opportunities to increase revenue. And some things, like airline boarding passes, just work much better on mobile. 
</p>

<p>
    Another factor is that we consider phones to be "personal devices". They aren't designed to be multi-user. Laptops and other devices, on the other hand, can be multi-user, even if in practice they usually are not. Consequently, browsers on laptops get treated as less insecure and session invalidation periods are much shorter, requiring people to login more frequently than in mobile apps.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, web sites can be passwordless, relieving some of the pain. Technologies like FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SSI allow for passwordless user experiences on the web as well as mobile. The kicker is that this isn't a trade off with security. Passwordless options can be more secure, and even more interoperable, with a better UX than passwords. Everybody wins. 
</p>



 

<a></a>
 Notes 

 
     This is known as "identifier-first authentication". By asking for the identifier, the authentication service can determine how to authenticate you. So, if you're using a token authentication instead of passwords, it can present that next. Some places do this well, merely hiding the password field using Javascript and CSS, so that password managers can still fill the password even though it's not visible. Others don't.

   <p></p><br><p>Not sure about you but there is something different about the current situation (Feb 2021).&nbsp; I wrote about the&nbsp; <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/describing-our-response-to-covid-burnout-breakdown-boredom-blessed-better-bottom-and-2de60d7d6e30">7B’s as our responses</a> to lockdown and I believe still that viewpoint stands. However, there is something new, right now, which is different it is a mistiness,&nbsp; a malaise, fatigue, sapped, brain fog.&nbsp; To be clear, this is not a loss of motivation, depression or other mental issues - which are all very real and getting to everyone but I am talking about something else.</p><p>In 1996 (web 1.0) the market discovered the opportunity for an online market, everyone took their physical business and replicated it exactly (give or take a bit) to work in a web browser.&nbsp; On-line arrived.&nbsp; We quickly worked out that this was an unmitigated disaster as a user experience, operationally and back office was a mess.&nbsp; Come 2001 post-crash we had stopped taking off-line thinking and plonking it on-line and saying to ourselves, this is fab.&nbsp; We started digital-first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2020 we were forced to take the remains of all offline ways of working and stuff it online - meetings, innovation, communication, management, reporting, selling, socialising, dating, laughing, onboarding, education, training - everything else we did in person and face to face.</p><p>We have just replicated the 1996 sorry mess - we imaged that we could take what was offline and stuff it into the tech available and it would be magic. My fatigue I am sure is because it has not been designed digital-first, to be specific I mean the workflow, UI and UX. Starting from “what work is needed” and not starting from “does this great scalable platform do the job!”</p><p>Perhaps we need to stop, look in the mirror and say to ourselves: “look this pandemic is not going away.”&nbsp; Then we need to work out what work needs to be done and how we can do it digital-first rather than pretending it is all ok and that we can ignore it as we will all go back to normal - please no.&nbsp; Just expecting everyone to buckle down and get on is no longer a good strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>I ask three questions</p><p>Is this working for us? - No it is not working, the malaise, fatigue and brain fog are a clue.&nbsp; We got away with it for a time, but this is not a long term solution</p><p>Who is us?&nbsp; - those working from home but the work is more than working at home, we have lost our connectedness, bonding and togetherness</p><p>Of whom are we asking the question? - Senior leadership and Directors who owe a duty of care and responsibility. It is now obvious that we have to reimagine work starting from digital-first for all those aspects of our working lives that we had left as they were too hard and difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

 <a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/directoryservices.png"></a> 



<p>In August 2020, we’ve rolled out a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-platform-updates-are-here">new release of the ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> which included updated versions of all of the products, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a> 7.0. I didn’t write a post about the new release, mostly due to our focus to deliver the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-cloud-gets-even-better">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and family vacation.</p>



<p>But ForgeRock Directory Services 7.0 is a major release in many ways. It is the first to be released with <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html#whats-new-700">a sample docker file and full support to run in Kubernetes</a> environments in the Cloud. To achieve that, we’ve made a number of significant changes especially in how security is managed, and how replication is configured and enabled. The rest of the server remains quite the same, delivering consistent performance and reliability. You should read the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>



<p>Since, DS 7 was successfully deployed in production, in VMs or in Docker/Kubernetes, and our customers have praised the simplicity and efficiency of the new version. However, some customers have experienced some difficulties with upgrading their current deployment to the 7.0 release, mostly due to the changes I’ve mentioned above. So we have been improving our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/upgrade-guide/">Upgrade Guide</a>, with greater details, and my colleague <a href="https://marginnotes2.wordpress.com/">Mark Craig</a>, has posted a series of 3 articles on Upgrading to Directory Services 7: </p>

  <p>Summary:      Picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.</p>



<p>
    <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">Jon Udell introduced me</a> to a fascinating talk by the always interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/r0ml?lang=en">r0ml</a>. In it, r0ml argues that <a href="https://youtu.be/hAuV0AYzMuQ?t=1032">Postgres as a programming environment feels like a Smalltalk image</a> (at least that's the part that's germane to this post). Jon has been working this way in Postgres for a while. He says:
</p>

<blockquote>For over a year, Iâve been using Postgres as a development framework. In addition to the core Postgres server that stores all the Hypothesis user, group, and annotation data, thereâs now also a separate Postgres server that provides an interpretive layer on top of the raw data. It synthesizes and caches product- and business-relevant views, using a combination of PL/pgSQL and PL/Python. Data and business logic share a common environment. Although I didnât make the connection until I watched r0mlâs talk, this setup hearkens back to the 1980s when Smalltalk (and Lisp, and APL) were programming environments with built-in persistence.
     From <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a><br>Referenced 2021-02-05T16:44:56-0700 
</blockquote>

<p>
    Here's the point in r0ml's talk where he describes this idea:
</p>


<p>
    As I listened to the talk, I was a little bit nostalgic for my time using Lisp and Smalltalk back in the day, but I was also excited because I realized that the model Jon and r0ml were talking about is very much alive in how one goes about building a pico system.
</p>

<a></a>
 Picos and Persistence 
<p>
    Picos are persistent compute objects. Persistence is a core feature of how picos work. Picos exhibit persistence in three ways. Picos have1:
</p>

 
     Persistent identity—Picos exist, with a single identity, continuously from the moment of their creation until they are destroyed. 
     
     Persistent state—Picos have state that programs running in the pico can see and alter. 
     
     Persistent availability—Picos are always on and ready to process queries and events.
     
 

<p>
    Together, these properties give pico programming a different feel than what many developers are used to. I often tell my students that programmers write static documents (programs, configuration files, SQL queries, etc.) that create dynamic structures—the processes that those static artifacts create when they're run. Part of being a good programmer is being able to envision those dynamic structures as you program. They come alive in your head as you imagine the program running. 
</p>

<p>
    With picos, you don't have to imagine the structure. You can see it. Figure 1 shows the current state of the picos in a test I created for a collection of temperature sensors. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Network of Picos for Temperatures Sensors (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, the black lines show the parent-child hierarchy and the dotted pink lines show the peer-to-peer connections between picos (called "subscriptions" in current pico parlance). Parent-child hierarchies are primarily used to manage the picos themselves whereas the heterarchical connections between picos is used for programmatic communication and represent the relationships between picos. As new picos are created or existing picos are deleted, the diagram changes to show the dynamic computing structure that exists at any given time. 
</p>

<p>
    Clicking on one of the boxes representing a pico opens up a developer interface that enables interaction with the pico according to the rulesets that have been installed. Figure 2 shows the Testing tab for the develop interface of the <code>io.picolabs.wovyn.router</code> ruleset in the pico named <code>sensor_line</code> after the <code>lastTemperature</code> query has been made. Because this is a live view into the running system, the interface can be used to query the state and raise events in the pico. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Interacting with a Pico (click to enlarge)


<p>
    A pico's state is updated by rules running in the pico in response to events that the pico sees. Pico state is <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189855/Persistent+Variables">made available to rules as persistent variables</a> in KRL, the ruleset programming language. When a rule sets a persistent variable, the state is persisted after the rule has finished execution and is available to other rules that execute later2. The Testing tab allows developers to raise events and then see how that impacts the persistent state of the pico. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Programming Picos 

<p>
    As I said, when I saw r0ml's talk, I was immediately struck by how much programming picos felt like using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Image-based_persistence">Smalltalk or Lisp image</a>. In some ways, it's like working with Docker images in a Fargate-like environment since it's serverless (from the programmer's perspective).  But there's far less to configure and set up.  Or maybe, more accurately, the setup is linguistically integrated with the application itself and feels less onerous and disconnected. 
</p>

<p>
    Building a system of picos to solve some particular problem isn't exactly like using Smalltalk. In particular, in a nod to modern development methodologies, the rulesets are installed from URLs and thus can be developed in the IDE the developer chooses and versioned in <code>git</code> or some other versioning system. Rulesets can be installed and managed programmatically so that the system can be programmed to manage its own configuration. To that point, all of the interactions in developer interface are communicated to the pico via an API installed in the picos. Consequently, everything the developer interface does can be done programmatically as well.
</p>

<p>
    Figure 3 shows the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/32754595/Programming+Workflow">programming workflow</a> that we use to build production pico systems. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Programming Workflow (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The developer may go through multiple iterations of the Develop, Build, Deploy, Test phases before releasing the code for production use. What is not captured in this diagram is the interactive feel that the pico engine provides for the testing phase. While automated tests can test the unit and system functionality of the rules running in the pico, the developer interface provides a visual tool for envisioning the interaction of the picos that are animated by dynamic interactions. Being able to query the state of the picos and see their reaction to specific events in various configurations is very helpful in debugging problems. 
</p>

<p>
    A pico engine can use multiple images (one at a time). And an image can be zipped up and shared with another developer or checked into <code>git</code>. By default the pico engine stores the state of the engine, including the installed rulesets, in the <code>~/.pico-engine/</code> directory. This is the image. Developers can change this to a different directory by setting the <code>PICO_ENGINE_HOME</code> environment variable. By changing the <code>PICO_ENGINE_HOME</code> environment variable, you can keep different development environments or projects separate from each other, and easily go back to the place you left off in a particular pico application.
</p>

<p>
    For example, you could have a different pico engine image for a game project and an IoT project and start up the pico engine in either environment like so:
</p>
 # work on my game project
PICO_ENGINE_HOME=~/.dnd_game_image pico-engine

# work on IoT project
PICO_ENGINE_HOME=~/.iot_image pico-engine
 


<a></a>
 Images and Modern Development 

<p>
    At first, the idea of using an image or the running system and interacting with it to develop an application may see odd or out of step with modern development practices. After all, developers have had the idea of layered architectures and separation of concerns hammered into them. And image-based development in picos seems to fly in the face of those conventions. But it's really not all that different. 
</p>

<p>
    First, large pico applications are not generally built up by hand and then pushed into production. Rather, the developers in a pico-based programming project create a system that comes into being programmatically. So, the production image is separate from the developer's work image, as one would like. Another way to think about this, if you're familiar with systems like Smalltalk and Lisp is that programmers don't develop systems using a REPL (read-eval-print loop). Rather they write code, install it, and raise events to cause the system to talk action. 
</p>

<p>
    Second, the integration of persistence into the application isn't all that unusual when one considers the recent move to microservices, with local persistence stores. I built a production connected-car service called Fuse using picos some years ago.  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/fuse_as_a_microservice_architecture.shtml">Fuse had a microservice architecture</a> even though it was built with picos and programmed with rules. 
</p>

<p>
    Third, programming in image-based systems requires persistence maintenance and migration work, just like any other architecture does. For example, a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/a_microservice_for_healing_subscriptions.shtml">service for healing API subscriptions in Fuse</a> was also useful when new features, requiring new APIs, were introduced since the healing worked as well for new, as it did existing, API subscriptions. These kinds of rules allowed the production state to migrate incrementally as bugs were fixed and features added. 
</p>

<p>
    Image-based programming in picos can be done with all the same care and concern for persistence management and loose coupling as in any other architecture. The difference is that developers and system operators (these days often one and the same) in a pico-based development activity are saved the effort of architecting, configuring, and operating the persistence layer as a separate system. Linguistically incorporating persistence in the rules provides for more flexible use of persistence with less management overhead. 
</p>

<p>
    Stored procedures will not likely soon lose their stigma. Smalltalk images, as they were used in the 1980's, are unlikely to find a home in modern software development practices. Nevertheless, picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.
</p>

<a></a>
 Future Work 

<p>
    There are some improvements that should be made to the pico-engine to make image-based development better.
</p>
 
     Moving picos between engines is necessary to support scaling of pico-based system. It is still too hard to migrate picos from one engine to another. And when you do, the parent-child hierarchy is not maintained across engines. This is a particular problem with systems of picos that have varied ownership. 
     
     Managing images using environment variables is clunky. The engine could have better support for naming, creating, switching, and deleting images to support multiple project.
     
     Bruce Conrad has created a <a href="https://github.com/b1conrad/pico-debug">command-line debugging tool</a> that allows declarations (which don't affect state) to be evaluated in the context of a particular pico. This needs functionality could be better integrated into the developer interface.

 Notes 
 
     These properties are dependent on the underlying <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/announcing_pico_engine_10.shtml">pico engine</a> and the persistence of picos is subject to availability and correct operation of the underlying infrastructure.
     
     Persistent variables are lexically scoped to a specific ruleset to create a closure over the variables. But this state can be accessed programmatically by other rulesets installed in the same pico by using the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189590/User+Defined+Modules">KRL module facility</a>.

<p>In a 1999 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=642&amp;v=FiK7s_0tGsg">interview</a> David Bowie said that “the potential for what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable.” I had no problem imagining the good, it was the bad where my imagination failed. The web of the late 90s was a cornucopia of wonder, delight, and inspiration. So was the blogosophere of the early 2000s. I know a lot of us are nostalgic for those eras, and depressed about how things have turned out. The bad is really quite bad, and sometimes I feel like there’s no way forward.</p>
<p>And then something wonderful happens. This time the spark was David Grinspoon aka @DrFunkySpoon. I’ve written before about a Long Now talk in which he posits that we might not just be living through the beginning of a geological epoch called the Anthropocene but rather — and far more profoundly — the dawn of an eon that he calls <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/09/25/welcome-to-the-sapiezoic/">the Sapiezoic</a>. Today he posted <a href="https://twitter.com/DrFunkySpoon/status/1358064758763753478">a stunning new visualization of plate tectonics</a>.</p>
<p>As always when I think about plate tectonics, I’m reminded of the high school science teacher who introduced me to the topic. His name is John Ousey, and this happened almost 50 years ago. What always stuck with me is the way he presented it. Back then, plate tectonics was a new idea. As Mr. Ousey (he later became Dr. Ousey) described the continents sliding apart, I can still see the bemused look on his face. He was clearly wrestling with the concept, unsure whether to believe things really happen that way. That healthy skepticism, coupled with trust in the scientific process, made an indelible impression on me.</p>
<p>One of the wonders of the Internet is the ability to find people. It took some sleuthing, but I did find him and this ensued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote to John Ousey and he replied!</p>
<p>"I learned about Plate Tectonics (then called Continental Drift) by taking weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton. It was brand new and I'm not sure that he was totally convinced about it either."</p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1358106780153249792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That’s the kind of magic that can still happen, that does happen all the time.</p>
<p>I learned for the first time that John Ousey’s introduction to plate tectonics came by way of “weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton” who was himself perhaps “not totally convinced.” Despite uncertainty, which he acknowledged, John Ousey was happy to share an important new idea with his Earth science class.</p>
<p>What a privilege to be able to thank him, after all these years, for being a great teacher who helped me form a scientific sensibility that has never mattered more than now. And to share a moment of appreciation for an extraordinary new visualization of the process once known as continental drift. Yes, there’s a dark side to our connected world, darker than I was once willing to imagine. But there is also so much light. It’s always helpful to consider deep geological time. That video shows a billion years of planetary churn. We’ve only been connected like this for 25 years. Maybe we’ll figure it out. For today, at least, I choose to believe that we will.</p>

    Framing the problem <p>I am fighting bias and prejudice about risk perceptions; please read the next lines before you click off.&nbsp; We tend to be blind sighted to “risk” because we have all lived it, read it and listened to risk statements.&nbsp; The ones on the TV and radio for financial products, the ones at the beginning of investment statements, ones for health and safety for machinery, ones for medicine, ones on the packets of cigarettes, the one when you open that new app on your new mobile device. We are bombarded with endless risk statements that we assume we know the details of, or just ignore.&nbsp; There are more books on risk than on all other management and economics topics together.&nbsp; There is an entire field on the ontologies of risk; such is the significance of this field. This article is suggesting that all that body of knowledge and expertise has missed something.&nbsp; A bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly, and already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the Board pack or PowerPoint deck for new investment, intervention case or for the adoption of the new model, there is a risk and assumptions list.&nbsp; We have seen these so many times we don’t read them.&nbsp; These statements are often copies, and the plagiarism of risk statements inaccurately copied is significant; no effort is put in as such statements have become a habit in the process methodology. &nbsp; The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all. Quite frankly, we see risk as the prime reason to stop something and occasionally manage it closer but never too understand something better.&nbsp; If you are operating a digital or data business you have new risks that are not in your risk statement, you have not focussed on them before, you are unlikely to have been exposed to them, and this article is to bring them to your attention.&nbsp; Is that worth 8 minutes?</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peadar-duffy-b47360a/">Peadar Duffy</a> whom I have been collaborating with on this thinking, and he has published <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6762051599817875456/">a super article on the same topic (quantum risk) here</a>&nbsp;</p> The purpose of business&nbsp; <p>We know that 3% of our data lake is finance data today; shockingly, 90% of our decisions are based on this sliver of data (Source Google). As we have to aim for a better ratio of “data: decisions” that includes non-financial data; we will make progress towards making better decisions that benefit more than a pure shareholder primacy view of the world.&nbsp; As leaders, we have a desire to make the best possible decisions we can. We fuse data, experience and knowledge to balance our perception of risk, probability and desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The well-publicised “<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business Roundtable</a>” report in Aug 2019 redefines a corporation’s purpose to promote ‘An Economy That Serves All … [Americans]’.&nbsp; The idea that company purpose should be closer to ecosystem thinking has been gaining prevalence since the financial crisis in 2008.&nbsp; The thinking has significant supporters such as <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/uk/individual/larry-fink-ceo-letter">Larry Fink</a>,&nbsp; Blackrock’s founder and CEO, who is an influential voice for ESG reporting and promotes changes to decision making criteria for better outcomes. His yearly letters are an insightful journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Donald Brydon's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Dec 2019 report</a> highlights that governance and audit need attention if we are to deliver better decisions, transparency and accountability. The report concludes that audit has significant failings and our approach to tick box compliance is not serving directors, shareholders or society to the level expected. Given that so much of our risk management depends on the quality of the audit, internal and external, it is likely that we are unduly confident in data that is unreliable. This point alone about audit failure could be sufficient for this article’s conclusion; however, we are here to explore Quantum Risk. Quantum Risk only exists because of the business dependency we now have on data from our co-dependent supply chains to dependent ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Quantum Risk is NEW&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>As a term from physics that describes particles’ properties, “quantum” will help frame new risk characteristics.&nbsp; The primary characteristics of quantum particles’ behaviour are:- the uncertainty principle, composite systems and entanglement. &nbsp; In a language, I understand these characteristics for Quantum risk are:</p>  <p>When you observe the same risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same risk can be in many places simultaneously, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your risk and my risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem; they are coupled but may not be directly connected.</p>   Framing Risk <p>Risk, like beauty, privacy, trust, transparency and many other ideals, is a personal perspective on the world; however, we all accept that we have to live with risk.</p><p>Risk, and the management of risk, fundamentally assumes that you can identify it first. &nbsp;If you cannot identify the risk, there is no risk to consider or manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Having identified the risk, you assess the risks to categorise and prioritise them using the classic impact vs likelihood model.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the management (review and control) of risk determines if you are doing the right things or action is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible to add a third axis to a classic likelihood, impact risk model, “quality of knowledge.” The third axis visually highlights that a focus on high risks accumulates the most knowledge as that is where the management focus and control is required, and it needs data which becomes knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp; If there is a deficit in knowledge because of <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">poor data</a>, it translates into an increased risk hidden because of poor data at any point in the matrix.&nbsp; Poor data (knowledge) can mean that either the impact (consequence) will be more severe or the likelihood (probability) is more likely. In part, we can overcome poor data problems by recognising that it always exists, but it easily hides the rather current issues of pandemics and systemic risk. However, if the quality of knowledge is based on erroneous data (<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/02/what-is-purpose-of-data-v2.html">data without rights and attestation</a>), we have no truth to the likelihood and impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Some sophisticated models and maths help qualify and understand the nature of risk depending on its nature and size.&nbsp; However, the list of risks that any one company faces is defined, specified and has been thought about over a long period.&nbsp; Uncovering new risk is considered unlikely; however, it is this that we are exploring and given our natural confirmational bias towards risk (we know it) - this is hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Classic risk models are framed to gain certainty, where risk is the identification, understanding, management and control of uncertainty.&nbsp; Existing risk models are highly efficient within this frame of reference, and we can optimise to our agreed boundaries of control with incredible success.&nbsp; Risk within our boundary (sphere of direct control) is calculated, and it becomes a quantified measure, enabling incentives to be created that provide a mechanism for management control. &nbsp; Risk outside our boundary (indirect control on a longer supply or value chain), whilst it is someone else’s risk we are dependent on them to manage it. Such dependencies are vital in modern global businesses. We have developed methodology (contracts) and processes (audit) to ensure that we are confident that any risk to us, inside or outside of our direct control, is identified and managed.</p><p>However, as leaders, we face three fundamental issues on this move to an economy that serves broader eco-systems as the boundaries we are dependent on have become less clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. The quality of the data and implied knowledge we receive from our direct and dependent* eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>2. The quality of the knowledge we receive from our indirect and interdependent** eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>3. Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (assumption first boundary is direct and already in control in our risk model)</p><p>* Dependent: balancing being able to get what I want by my own effort as contingent on or determined by the actions of someone else to make it work&nbsp; ** Interdependence combine my efforts with the efforts of others to achieve successful outcomes together but does not have to be mutual or controlled&nbsp;</p> Risk as a shared belief has wider dependencies.&nbsp; <p>Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (Point 3 above) introduces the concept of second and third-order boundaries for broader (inter)-dependent ecosystems. This short section explains where those boundaries are and why they matter in the context of a business’s purpose moving toward a sustainable ecosystem (ESG.)</p><p>The figure below expands on the dependency thinking into a visual representation. The three-axis are values/ principles as a focus [self, society, planet earth], who has accountability/ obligations [no-one, an elected authority such as a director, society or all of humanity], and the health of our eco-systems (prime, secondary, tertiary and all).</p><p>The small blue area shows the limitations of our current shareholder primacy remit, where Directors have a fiduciary duty to ensure that their prime business thrives and value is created for shareholders (stakeholders,) at the expense of others. Having a healthy ecosystem helps (competition, choice, diverse risk, margin.)&nbsp; As envisaged by the Business Roundtable, a sustainable ecosystem is the orange area, expanding the Directors remit to more eco-systems and embracing more of a “good for society” value set but does not increase director accountability.&nbsp; ESG v1.0 widens the remit to the green area; this step-change expands all current thinking and dependencies of any one player on others on a broader ecosystem. We become sustainable together.&nbsp;</p><p></p> How is it possible for unidentified risks to exist? <p>In simple terms, there is no new unknown risk; however, what is known to someone may not be known by everyone. Risk is hiding in plain sight. As we are expanding our remits as discussed in the last section above, we are increasingly dependent on others managing their risk to the same level we manage risk and share data across the ecosystem. This is where Quantum Risk arises, at the boundaries, in the long-tail of the universe of risk.</p><p>In the figure below, The Growing Universe of Risk. We are very good at the management of insurable, measurable known:known (identified and shared) risk. We are also very good at un-insurable, measurable (impact, likelihood, knowledge) and known:unknown risk mainly because the determined likelihood of occurrence and impact is moderate.&nbsp; Indeed, we have created excellent tools to help mitigate and accept uninsurable, un-measurable “unknown:unknown” risk.&nbsp; In mitigation we accept that the data quality&nbsp; (knowledge) is poor, but the impact is low, as is the likelihood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum risk is the next step out; it is emergent at the boundaries of (inter)-dependencies created as we need to create sustainable ecosystems where we share data. We are increasingly reliant on data from indirectly related players to our ecosystem, and we have no power or control. We have no rights to data and no clue on attestation. Quantum risk is not in our current risk model, or existing risk frameworks and is unimagined to us.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br> Business Risk Vs Data Risk <p>Business risk is something that every business has to deal with.&nbsp; Kodak and Nokia maybe not as well as say IBM, Barclays or Microsoft. &nbsp; Mobile phone networks should have seen mobile data services coming and therefore the advent of international voice and video apps that meant there was always going to be a natural decline in SMS, local and international mobile revenue. Most rejected this business risk in 2005 only seeing growth in core areas.&nbsp; However good hindsight is, apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram came about due to the timing of three interrelated advances, which created business risk. &nbsp; Device capability, network capability and pricing.&nbsp; Device designers and manufacturers have to keep pushing technology to keep selling devices; device technology will always advance. &nbsp; Network capacity was always going to increase, and packet-switched capability has massive economies of scale over voice circuits. Large, fast packet circuits were always going to win.&nbsp; Pricing by usage prevents usage; bundles work for increasing capacity.&nbsp; For a mobile operator, the objective is to fill the network capacity that is built to maximise ROI, bundles work, as does Apps that move revenue from one product to the next.&nbsp; This is a business risk created by change and dependencies on others in your ecosystem, quantum risks are a business risk but hide in data.</p><p>Data Risk falls into three buckets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data that you collect directly as part of the process of doing business.&nbsp; Critically you can determine the attestation (provenance and lineage) of the data, and it comes from your devices, sensors and systems.&nbsp; There is a risk that you don’t collect, store, protect, analyse or know if the data is true.&nbsp; In truth, this is the front end of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put priority. Nothing new here.</p>  <p>Data you collect from third parties who you have a relationship with. A supplier, partners, collaborator, associate or public data.&nbsp; Whilst you are likely to have the “rights to use data” (contract), you are unlikely to have “attestation” (provenance and lineage) of the shared data back to the origin. You will have access to summary or management levels (knowledge and insights), and you should have audit and other contractual agreements to check. &nbsp; There is often a mutual relationship where you both share data, both dependent on the data quality. The risk is that you don’t qualify, check, question or analyse this 3rd party data.&nbsp; In truth, this is another head-end risk of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put significant resources. The exception will be public data as there is no route to understanding bias, ontology or purpose, however public data is not usually used exclusively for decision making, with one exception right now ESG and this worries me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Quantum Risk is a data risk where you neither have control of nor access to, data. Still, this data set has become critical to decision making as we move to sustainable ecosystems, stewardship codes and ESG.&nbsp; However, it requires us to dig into the dark and mysterious world data ontologies, which we have to unpack quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   Ontologies&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>To explain your reasoning, rationale or position, you need to define how entities are grouped into basic categories that structure your worldview and perspective. If you have a different perspective, you will behave and act differently.&nbsp; Such a structure is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">ontology</a> (how we view the world) and is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a> (how do we know what is true and how we have gone about investigating/ proving it?). Ontology is a branch of philosophy but is critical in understanding data and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">information science</a> as it encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. Think of data ontology as a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point you would have thought with 5,000 years of thinking about this we would have one top-level ontology from which everything would flow.&nbsp; Alas, we don’t have one for anything.&nbsp; There is no black and white agreed way to look at anything in philosophy, physics, biology, humanities, data, climate, language, sound, knowledge, compute, behaviour and every other topic. This means that it is safe to assume your way of describing your world, in your organisation, through data is different from everyone else in your ecosystem.&nbsp; Those same data points represented in 1 and 0’s mean completely other things in different ontologies. Your worst scenario is different ontologies inside your silos which means you have different world views but may not know this.&nbsp; <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo">Ontology is one of the roles for a CDO, explored here</a>.&nbsp; Now to epistemology, which is concerned with the creation of knowledge, focusing on how knowledge is obtained and investigating the most valid ways to reach the truth. Epistemology essentially determines the relationship between the data, analyst and reality and is rooted in your ontological framework. Different data science teams can have the same data set and very different views, and then we add the statistics team.&nbsp; What truth or lies do you want?&nbsp; This matters when data is shared - how do you know what your business partners thinks is true about their data?</p><p>It only gets more complicated the more you unpack this and I will write an article about this soon. However, as shown in the figure, knowing how you view the world in data, does not guarantee that everyone else in your ecosystem has the same view.&nbsp; I have seen very few contracts for data sharing at business data levels share the ontology and mapping schedules between then. Yes we often share naming/ data dictionary level, but that is not ontology. Assuming that shared data has the same purpose between the partner is “quantum risk.” This risk is at the boundaries, and it only appears when you look.&nbsp; Imagine you are <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">sharing data</a> in your ecosystem on critical systems and as you read this, you realise you have not asked the question about the different world views you and your partners have towards collecting, analysing, and reporting for data.&nbsp; The event is not the same thing.&nbsp; Remember, at the start, we know everything about risk. I am in the same bucket. This is all new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Responses to Quantum Risk <p>I made two bold claims at the beginning. “The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all,” and “a bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly and is already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.”&nbsp; I wish it were easy, but Quantum Risk emerges at our digital business boundaries where we share data, the further we go out the less attestation and rights we have. The complexity of Quantum Risk creates havoc with our existing frameworks and models as:</p>  <p>When you observe the same quantum risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same quantum risk can be in many places at the same time, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your quantum risk and my quantum risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem, but they are not connected and not seen.</p>  <p>Given this, how do we respond? We need to get better with understanding the <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">purpose of our data</a>; we need to find CDO expertise to help us unpack our data ontologies and rethink what we consider are boundaries for commercial purposes, which means revisiting our contracts and terms.&nbsp; One question for those who get this far, have you tested how your users understand your Terms and Conditions on data use and privacy. I have never seen it in a test schedule as it is a barrier not a value proposition. We tell users to “Click here” fast and trust us. It is an obvious gap to investigate from a partner when you depend on that data and it is shared with you, and your advertising model now depends on it.</p><p>Any good economist/ strategist will immediately recognise the opportunity to game data at the boundary. How can I create an advantage, and what are the implications is another whole topic to unpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As a final thought, will your corporation consider Quantum Risk?&nbsp;</p><p>If your fellow senior leadership team is focused on the head end of the long tail, you will see a focus on implementing processes that align to regulation/ rules/ law and policies. You are likely to manage risk very well and be rewarded for doing so via cascading KPI’s.&nbsp; Quantum risk will be thought about when there are best practices or a visible loss of competitive position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Corporates with a more mature risk profile know there are loopholes and whilst have a focus on compliance, they have a hand in the lobby forums so they can benefit by putting risk onto others and gaining an advantage from being the owner of IP when the lobby work becomes policy.&nbsp; Quantum risk thinking will emerge when there is a clear identification of competitive advantage.</p><p>The most mature risk leadership teams are creating new thinking to ensure that they are sustainable and not forced to make retrospective changes as they just focussed on compliance and had delivery based KPI linked bonuses.&nbsp; These are the pioneers in digital and will pick up quantum risk first.&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>I wrote this essay in 2006 as part of a series of Internet explainers I did for New Hampshire Public Radio. It never aired for reasons lost to history, so I’m publishing this 15-year-old time capsule here for the first time. My motive is of course not purely archival. I’m also reminding myself why I should still practice now what I preached then.</p>
 How and why to tell your story online 
<p>Teens and twenty-somethings are flocking to social websites like MySpace and Facebook, where they post photos, music, and personal diaries. Parents, teachers, and cops wish they wouldn’t. It’s a culture war between generations, and right now everybody’s losing.</p>
<p>Kids: Listen up. Did you hear the story about the college student who didn’t get hired because of his Facebook page? Or the teenage girl whose MySpace blog told an attacker when she’d be home alone? These things happen very rarely, but they can happen. Realize that the words and pictures you publish online will follow you around for the rest of your lives. Realize that wrong choices can have embarrassing or even tragic consequences.</p>
<p>Now, grownups, it’s your turn to listen up. You’re right to worry about the kids. But there’s another side to the story. The new forms of Internet self-publishing — including social networks, blogs, podcasting, and video sharing — can be much more than narcissistic games. Properly understood and applied, they’re power tools for claiming identity, exerting influence, and managing reputation. Sadly, very few adults are learning those skills, and fewer still are teaching them.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to condemn bad online behavior. We’ve got to model good online behavior too — in schools, on the job, and in civic life. But we’re stuck in a Catch-22 situation. Kids, who intuit the benefits of the new social media, fail to appreciate the risks. Grownups, meanwhile, see only risks and no benefits.</p>
<p>There’s a middle ground here, and we need to approach it from both sides of the generation gap. The new reality is that, from now on, our lives will be documented online — perhaps by us, perhaps by others, perhaps by both. We may or may not influence what others will say about us. But we can surely control our own narratives, and shape them in ways that advance our personal, educational, professional, and civic agendas.</p>
<p>Your online identity is a lifelong asset. If you invest in it foolishly you’ll regret that. But failing to invest at all is equally foolish. The best strategy, as always, is to invest wisely.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple test to guide your strategy. Imagine someone searching Google for your name. That person might be a college admissions officer, a prospective employer, a new client, an old friend, or even a complete stranger. The reason for the search might be to evaluate your knowledge, interests, agenda, accomplishments, credentials, activities, or reputation.</p>
<p>What do you want that person to find? That’s what you should publish online.</p>
<p>To find three examples of what I mean, try searching the web for the following three names: Todd Suomela, Martha Burtis, Thomas Mahon. In each case, the first Google result points to a personal blog that narrates a professional life.</p>
<p>Todd Suomela is a graduate student at the University of Michigan. On his blog, Todd writes about what he’s learning, and about how his interests and goals are evolving. He hasn’t launched his professional career yet. But when he does, his habit of sharing the information resources he collects, and reflecting thoughtfully on his educational experience, will serve him well.</p>
<p>Martha Burtis is an instructional technologist at the University of Mary Washington. She and her team research and deploy the technologies that students, faculty, and staff use to learn, teach, and collaborate. On her blog, Martha writes about the tools and techniques she and her team are developing, she assesses how her local academic community is making use of those tools and techniques, and thinks broadly about the future of education.</p>
<p>Thomas Mahon is a Savile Row tailor. His shop in London caters to people who can spend two thousand pounds on a classic handmade suit. I’ll never be in the market for one of those, but if I were I’d be fascinated by Mahon’s blog, EnglishCut.com, which tells you everything you might want to know about Savile Row past and present, about how Mahan practices the craft of bespoke tailoring, and about how to buy and care for the garments he makes.</p>
<p>For Todd and Martha and Thomas, the benefits of claiming their Net identities in these ways run wide and deep. Over time, their online narratives become autobiographies read by friends, colleagues, or clients, and just as importantly, read by people who may one day become friends, colleagues, or clients.</p>
<p>In most cases, of course, the words, pictures, audio, and video you might choose to publish online won’t attract many readers, listeners, or viewers. That’s OK. The point is that the people they do attract will be exactly the right people: those who share your interests and goals.</p>
<p>We’ve always used the term ‘social networking’ to refer to the process of finding and connecting with those people. And that process has always depended on a fabric of trust woven most easily in the context of local communities and face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>But our interests and goals aren’t merely local. We face global challenges that compel us to collaborate on a global scale. Luckily, the new modes of social networking can reach across the Internet to include people anywhere and everywhere. But if we’re going to trust people across the Internet, we’ll need to be able check their references. Self-published narrative is one crucial form of evidence. The public reaction to such narratives, readily discoverable thanks to search engines and citation indexes, is another.</p>
<p>Is this a new and strange new activity? From one perspective it is, and that’s why I can’t yet point to many other folks who’ve figured out appropriate and effective ways to be online, as Todd and Martha and Thomas have.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, Internet self-publishing is just a new way to do what we’ve been doing for tens of thousand years: telling stories to explain ourselves to one another, and to make sense of our world.</p>

    We continually move towards better data-led decisions; however, we can easily ask our dataset’s wrong question. Without understanding “What is the purpose of data” on which we are basing decisions and judgements, it is easy to get an answer that is not in the data. How can we understand if our direction, Northstar or decision is a good one?&nbsp; Why am I interested in this? I am focusing on how we improve governance and oversight in a data-led world.&nbsp; <p>I wrote a lengthy article on<a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-data-90ba0b803178"> Data is Data.</a> It was a kickback at the analogies that data is oil, gold, labour, sunlight - data is not. Data is unique; it has unique characteristics. That article concluded that the word “Data” is also part of the problem, but we should think of data as if discovering a new element with unique characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data is a word, and it is part of the problem.&nbsp; Data doesn’t have meaning or shape, and data will not have meaning unless we can give it context. As<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodoralau/"> Theodora Lau</a> eloquently put it; if her kiddo gets 10 points in a test today (data as a state), the number 10 has no meaning, unless we say, she scored 10 points out of 10 in the test today (data is information). And even then, we still need to explain the type of test (data is knowledge) and what to do next or how to improve (data is insights).&nbsp; Each of these is a “data” point, and we don’t differentiate the use of the word “data” in these contexts.</p><p>Data’s most fundamental representation is “state” where it represents the particular condition something is in at a specific time.&nbsp; I love<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hughmacleod/"> Hugh’s work @gapingvoid</a> (below) representation&nbsp; Information is knowing that there are different “states” (on/off). Knowledge is finding patterns and connections.&nbsp; Insight knows comparatives to state. Wisdom is the journey.&nbsp; We live in the hope that the data we have will have an impact.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the data community has rested on two key characteristics of data: non-rivalrous (which plays havoc with our current understanding of ownership) and non-fungible (which is true if you assume that data carries information.)&nbsp; Whilst these are both accurate observations; they are not that good as universal characteristics.</p>  <p>Non-rivalrous. Economists call an item that can only be used by one person at a time as "rivalrous." Money and capital are rivalrous. Data is non-rivalrous as a single item of data can simultaneously fuel multiple algorithms, analytics, and applications.&nbsp; This is, however, not strictly true. Numerous perfect copies of “data” can be used simultaneously because the marginal cost of reproduction and sharing is zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Non-fungible. When you can substitute one item for another, they are said to be fungible.&nbsp; One sovereign bill can be replaced for another sovereign bill of the same value; one barrel of oil is the same as the next.&nbsp; So the thinking goes, data is non-fungible and cannot be substituted because it carries information.&nbsp; However, if your view is that data carries state (the particular condition that something is in at a specific time), then data is fungible. Higher-level ideals of data that is processed (information, knowledge, insights) are increasingly non-fungible.</p>   Money as a framework to explore the purpose of data&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Sovereign currency (FIAT), money in this setting, has two essential characteristics.&nbsp; It has rivalrous and fungible.&nbsp; Without these foundational characteristics, money cannot fulfil its original purpose (it has many others now); a trusted exchange medium.&nbsp; Money removes the former necessity of a direct barter, where equal value had to be established, and the two or more parties had to meet for an exchange.&nbsp; What is interesting is that there are alternatives to FIAT which exploit other properties.&nbsp; Because of fraud, we have to have security features, and there is a race to build the most secure wall.</p><p></p><br><p>[Just as a side note - money is an abstraction and part of the rationale for a balance sheet was to try to connect the abstraction back to real things. Not sure that works any more]</p> Revising the matrix “what problem is to be solved?”&nbsp; <p>Adding these other options of exchange onto the matrix, we have a different way to frame what problem each type of currency offers as a method of exchange mechanism. This is presented in the chart below.&nbsp; Sand and beans can be used, but they provide a messy tool compared to a sovereign currency.&nbsp; Crypto works, and it solves the problem, but without exchange to other currencies, it had fundamental limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If we now add digital data and other aspects of our world onto the matrix, we have a different perspective. We all share gravity, sunsets and broadcast TV/ radio on electromagnetic waves.&nbsp; However, only one atom can be used at a time, and that atom is not-interchangeable (to get the same outcome.)&nbsp; The point is that digital data is not in the same quadrant as sovereign currency and electrons as a beautiful solution based on being fungible and rivalrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the broadest definition of data which is “state”; chemical, atoms, gravity, electrons have state and therefore are also data.&nbsp; To be clear will now use Digital Data to define our focus and not all data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>These updates to the matrix highlight that, if data is non-rivalrous and non-fungible, these characteristics mean that is is very unclear to what problem digital data is solving.&nbsp; We see this all the time in the digital data market, as we cannot agree on what “data” is, it is messy.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for us as a digital data community is; “what are the axis [characteristics] that mean digital data is in the top corner of a matrix? This is where digital data is a beautiful solution to a defined problem, given that digital data is at its core is “knowing state.”&nbsp; I explored this question on a call with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott David</a>, and we ended up resting on “Rights and Attestation” as the two axes&nbsp;</p><p>Rights in this context are that you have gained rights from the Parties.&nbsp; What and how those rights were acquired is not the question; it is just that you have the rights you need to do what you need to do.</p><p>Attestation in this context is the evidence or proof of something.&nbsp; It is that you know what you have is true and that you can prove the state exists. How you do this is not the point; it is just you know it is provable.</p><p></p><p>As we saw with the money example, data will never have these (rights and attestation) characteristics exclusively; it is just when it has them, data is most purposeful.&nbsp; Without attestation, the data you have is compromised, and any conclusions you reach may not be true or real. Continually we have to test both our assumptions and the provability of our digital data. &nbsp; Rights are different as rights are not correlated with data quality, but rights may help resolve ownership issues.&nbsp; A business built without rights to the data they are using is not stable or sustainable.&nbsp; How and if those Rights were obtained ethically are matters to be investigated.&nbsp; Interestingly, these characteristics (rights and attestation)&nbsp; would readily fit into existing risk and audit frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a specific focus on ESG, sustainability, data for decision making, and better data for sharing.&nbsp; Given that most comparative ESG data is from public reports (creative commons or free of rights), it is essential to note there is a break in the attestation.&nbsp; ESG data right now is in the least useful data bucket for decision making, but we are making critical investment decisions on this analysis data set. It is something that we have to address.&nbsp;</p><br> In summary <p>If the purpose of data is “to share state” then the two essential characteristics data must have are rights and attestation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, as data becomes information (knowing state), knowledge (patterns of states), insight (context in states) and wisdom - these characteristics of rights and attestation matter even more.&nbsp; If you are making decisions on data that you don’t know if it is true or have the rights to it, becomes a dangerous place.&nbsp;</p><p>As a side, there is lots of technology and processes to know if the state is true (as in correct - not truth); if the state sensing is working and the level of accuracy; if the state at both ends has the same representation (providence/ lineage ); if it is secure; if we can gain information; if we can combine data sets and what the ontology is.&nbsp; But these are not fundamental characteristics; they are supportive and ensure we have a vibrant ecosystem of digital data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> I am sure there are other labels for such a matrix and interested in your views, thoughts and comments.&nbsp; <br>

It is something that we have to address.&nbsp;</p><br> In summary <p>If the purpose of data is “to share state” then the two essential characteristics data must have are rights and attestation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, as data becomes information (knowing state), knowledge (patterns of states), insight (issues in states) and wisdom - these characteristics of rights and attestation matter even more.&nbsp; If you are making decisions on data that you don’t know if it is true or have the rights to it, becomes a dangerous place.&nbsp;</p><p>As a side, there is lots of technology and processes to know if the state is true (as in correct - not truth); if the state sensing is working and the level of accuracy; if the state at both ends has the same representation (providence/ lineage ); if it is secure; if we can gain information; if we can combine data sets and what the ontology is.&nbsp; But these are not so fundamental; they are supportive that make the ecosystem of data work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> We are sure there are other labels for such a matrix and interested in your views, thoughts and comments.&nbsp; <br><br><br><br>

As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=267">I wrote a decade, a year, and a day ago</a>, “It’s where Internet identity work gets done.”  That remains as true now is it was then!</p>
<p>As a personal testimonial, I wrote this to the IIW organizers after the 2020 IIWs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Thanks again for running the most engaging and successful virtual meetings of the year (by far!).  While I’ve come to dread most of the large virtual meetings, IIW online remains true to the spirit of the last 15 years of useful workshops.  Yes, I miss talking to Rich and the attendees in the coffee line and having impromptu discussions throughout, and we’ll get back to that in time, but the sessions remain useful and engaging.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m also proud that Microsoft is continuing its 15-year tradition of sponsoring the workshop.  Rather than buying dinner for the attendees (the conversations at the dinners were always fun!), we’re sponsoring scholarships for those that might otherwise not be able to attend, fostering an even more interesting and diverse set of viewpoints at the workshop.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

  <p>Summary:      Generative identity allows us to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, contemplates and addresses the problems of social inclusion, and supports economic equality to everyone around the globe. This article describes the implementation self-sovereign identity through protocol-mediated credential exchange on the self-sovereign internet, examines its properties, and argues for it generative nature from those properties.</p>




<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">The Generative Self-Sovereign Internet</a> explored the generative properties of the self-sovereign internet, a secure overlay network created by DID connections. The generative nature of the self-sovereign internet is underpinned by the same kind of properties that make the internet what it is, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, I explore the generativity of self-sovereign identity—specifically the exchange of verifiable credentials. One of the key features of the self-sovereign internet is that it is protocological—the messaging layer supports the implementation of protocol-mediated interchanges on top of it. This extensibility underpins its generativity. Two of the most important protocols defined on top of the self-sovereign internet support the exchange of verifiable credentials as we'll see below. Together, these protocols work on top of the the self-sovereign internet to give rise to self-sovereign identity through a global identity metasystem.
</p>

<a></a>
 Verifiable Credentials 

<p>
    While the control of self-certifying identifiers in the form of DIDs is the basis for the autonomy of the self-sovereign internet, that autonomy is made effective through the exchange of verifiable credentials. Using verifiable credentials, an autonomous actor on the self-sovereign internet can prove attributes to others in a way they can trust. Figure 1 shows the SSI stack. The self-sovereign internet is labeled "Layer Two" in this figure. Credential exchange happens on top of that in Layer Three.
</p>


  <a></a>
  Figure 1: SSI Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows how credentials are exchanged. In this diagram, Alice has DID-based relationships with Bob, Carol, Attestor.org and Certiphi.com. Alice has received a credential from Attestor.org. The credential contains attributes that Attestor.org is willing to attest belong to Alice. For example, Attestor might be her employer attesting that she is an employee. Attestor likely gave her a credential for their own purposes. Maybe Alice uses it for passwordless login at company web sites and services and to purchase meals at the company cafeteria. She might also use it at partner websites (like the benefits provider) to provide shared authentication without federation (and it's associated infrastructure). Attestor is acting as a credential issuer. We call Alice a credential holder in this ceremony. The company and partner websites are credential verifiers. Credential issuance is a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">protocol that operates on top of the self-sovereign internet</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Credential Exchange (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Even though Attestor.org issued the credential to Alice for its own purposes, she holds it in her wallet and can use it at other places besides Attestor. For example, suppose she is applying for a loan and her bank, Certiphi, who wants proof that she's employed and has a certain salary. Alice could use the credential from Attestor to prove to Certiphi that she's employed and that her salary exceeds a given threshold1. Certiphi is also acting as a credential verifier. Credential proof and verification is also  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">protocol that operates on top of the self-sovereign internet</a>. As shown in Figure 2, individuals can also issue and verify credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    We say Alice "proved" attributes to Certiphi from her credentials because the <a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-technology-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-all/">verification protocol uses zero knowledge proof</a> to support the minimal disclosure of data. Thus the credential that Alice holds from Attestor might contain a rich array of information, but Alice need only disclose the information that Certiphi needs for her loan. In addition, the proof process ensures that Alice can't be correlated though the DIDs she has shared with others. Attribute data isn't tied to DIDs or the keys that are currently assigned to the DID. Rather than attributes bound to identifiers and keys, Alice's identifiers and keys empower the attributes. 
</p>

<p>
    Certiphi can validate important properties of the credential. Certiphi is able to validate the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">fidelity of the credential</a> by reading the credential definition from the ledger (Layer One in Figure 1), retrieving Attestor's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attestor.org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, the presentation protocol allows Certiphi to verify that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked (using a revocation registry store in Layer 1). Certiphi does not need to contact Attestor or have any prior business relationship to verify these properties. 
</p>

<p>
    The global identity metasystem, shown as the yellow box in Figure 1, comprises the ledger at Layer 1, the self-sovereign internet at Layer 2, and the credential exchange protocols that operate on top of it. Together, these provide the necessary features and characteristics to support self-sovereign identity.
</p>

<a></a>
 Properties of Credential Exchange 

<p>
    Verifiable credentials have five important characteristics that mirror how credentials work in the offline world:
</p>
 
     Credentials are decentralized and contextual. There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, a holder, or a verifier. Verifiable credentials can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, or any set of trust relationships. 
     Credential issuers decide what data is contained in their credentials. Anyone can write credential schemas to the ledger. Anyone can create a credential definition based on any of these schemas. 
     Verifiers make their own decisions about which credentials to accept—there's no central authority who determines what credentials are important or which are used for a given purpose. 
     Verifiers do not need to contact issuers to perform verification—that's what the ledger is for. Credential verifiers don't need to have any technical, contractual, or commercial relationship with credential issuers in order to determine the credentials' fidelity. 
     Credential holders are free to choose which credentials to carry and what information to disclose. People and organizations are in control of the credentials they hold and to determine what to share with whom.  
 

<p>
    These characteristics underlie several important properties that support the generativity of credential exchange.  Here are the most important:
</p>

<p>
    Private— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by Design</a> is baked deep into the architecture of the identity metasystem as reflected by several fundamental architectural choices:</p> 
         Peer DIDs are pairwise unique and pseudonymous by default to prevent correlation.  
         Personal data is never written to the ledgers at Layer 1 in Figure 1—not even in encrypted or hashed form. Instead, all private data is exchanged over peer-to-peer encrypted connections between off-ledger agents at Layer 2. The ledger is used for anchoring rather than publishing encrypted data. 
         Credential exchange has built-in support for zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to avoid unnecessary disclosure of identity attributes. 
         As we saw earlier, verifiers donât need to contact the issuer to verify a credential. Consequently, the issuer doesnât know when or where the credential is used.  
     
<p></p>


<p>
    Decentralized—decentralization <a>follows directly from the fact that no one owns the infrastructure</a> that supports credential exchange. This is the primary criterion for judging the degree of decentralization in a system. Rather, the infrastructure, like that of the internet, is operated by many organizations and people bound by protocol. 
</p>

<p>
    Heterarchical—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy">heterarchy</a> is a "system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways." Participants in credential exchange relate to each other as peers and are autonomous. 
</p>

<p>
    Interoperable—verifiable credentials have a standard format, readily accessible schemas, and a standard protocols for issuance, proving (presenting), and verification. Participants can interact with anyone else so long as they use tools that follow the standards and protocols. Credential exchange isn't a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, interoperability relies on interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Interoperability supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    Substitutable—the tools for issuing, holding, proving, and verifying are available from multiple vendors and follow well-documented, open standards. Because these tools are interoperable, issuers, holders, and verifiers can choose software, hardware, and services without fear of being locked into a proprietary tool. Moreover, because many of the attributes the holder needs to prove (e.g. email address or even employer) will be available on multiple credentials, the holder can choose between credentials.  Usable substitutes provide choice and freedom. 
</p>

<p>Flexible—closely related to substitutability, flexibility allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. The characteristics of credential exchange allow for context-specific scenarios.
</p>


<p> Reliable and Censorship Resistant—people, businesses, and others must be able to exchange credentials without worrying that the infrastructure will go down, stop working, go up in price, or get taken over by someone who would do them harm. Substitutability of tools and credentials combined with autonomy makes the system resistant to censorship. There is no hidden third party or intermediary in Figure 2. Credentials are exchanged peer-to-peer. 
</p>

<p>Non-proprietary and Open—no one has the power to change how credentials are exchanged by fiat. Furthermore, the underlying infrastructure is less likely to go out of business and stop operation because its maintenance and operation are decentralized instead of being in the hands of a single organization. The identity metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a> as NEA: No one owns it, Everyone can use it, and Anyone can improve it. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
</p>


<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—people can act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one-sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
</p>

<p>Inclusive—inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
</p>

<p>Universal—successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. Credential exchange, built on the self-sovereign internet and based on protocol, has network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that the metasystem will be mandated. Rather, one protocol will mediate all interaction because everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it out of self-interest. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Generativity of Credential Exchange 

<p>Applying <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">Zittrain's framework for evaluating generativity</a> is instructive for understanding the generative properties of self-sovereign identity.</p>

<a></a>
 Capacity for Leverage 
<p>In Zittrain's words, leverage is the extent to which an object "enables valuable accomplishments that otherwise would be either impossible or not worth the effort to achieve." Leverage multiplies effort, reducing the time and cost necessary to innovate new capabilities and features.
</p>

<p>
    Traditional <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic"> identity systems have been anemic</a>, supporting simple relationships focused on authentication and a few basic attributes their administrators need. They can't easily be leveraged by anyone but their owner. Federation through SAML or OpenID Connect has allowed the authentication functionality to be leveraged in a standard way, but authentication is just a small portion of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">overall utility of a digital relationship</a>.
</p>

<p>
    One example of the capacity of credential exchange for leverage is to consider that it could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml%22">disintermediates platform companies like Uber, AirBnB, and the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies build proprietary trust frameworks to intermediate exchanges between parties and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. Credential exchange can open these trust frameworks up to create open marketplaces for services. 
</p>

<p>
    The next section on Adaptability lists a number of uses for credentials. The identity metasystem supports all these use cases with minimal development work on the part of issuers, verifiers, and holders. And because the underlying system is interoperable, an investment in the tools necessary to solve one identity problem with credentials can be leveraged by many others without new investment. The cost to define a credential is very low (often less than $100) and once the definition is in place, there is no cost to issue credentials against it. A small investment can allow an issuer to issue millions of credentials of different types for different use cases.
</p>

<a></a>
 Adaptability 
<p>
    Adaptability can refer to a technology's ability to be used for multiple activities without change as well as its capacity for modification in service of new use cases. Adaptability is orthogonal to a technology's capacity for leverage. An airplane, for example, offers incredible leverage, allowing goods and people to be transported over long distances quickly. But airplanes are neither useful in activities outside transportation or easily modified for different uses. A technology that supports hundreds of use cases is more generative than one that is useful in only a few.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">Identity systems based on credential exchange</a> provide people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into. Credential exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">allows for ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The flexibility of credentials ensures they can be used in a variety of situations. Every form or official piece of paper is a potential credential.  Here are a few examples of common credentials:
</p>
 
     Employee badges 
     Drivers license 
     Passport 
     Wire authorizations 
     Credit cards 
     Business registration 
     Business licenses 
     College transcripts 
     Professional licensing (government and private) 
 
<p>
    But even more important, every bundle of data transmitted in a workflow is a potential credential. Since <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0"> credentials are just trustworthy containers for data</a>, there are many more use cases that may not be typically thought of as credentials:
</p>
 
     Invoices and receipts 
     Purchase orders 
     Airline or train ticket 
     Boarding pass 
     Certificate of authenticity (e.g. for art, other valuables) 
     Gym (or any) membership card 
     Movie (or any) tickets 
     Insurance cards 
     Insurance claims 
     Titles (e.g. property, vehicle, etc.) 
     Certificate of provenance (e.g. non-GMO, ethically sourced, etc.) 
     Prescriptions 
     Fractional ownership certificates for high value assets 
     CO2 rights and carbon credit transfers 
     Contracts 
 
<p>
    Since even a small business might issue receipts or invoices, have customers who use the company website, or use employee credentials, most businesses will define at least one credential and many will need many more. There are potentially tens of millions of different credential types. Many will use common schemas but each credential from a different issuer constitutes a different identity credential for a different context. 
</p>

<p>
    With the ongoing work in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, these use cases expand even further.  With a âredeemable credentialsâ feature, holders can prove possession of a credential in a manner that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend</a> proof without a ledger. This works for all kinds of redemption use cases like clocking back in at the end of a shift, voting in an election, posting an online review, or redeeming a coupon.
</p>

<p>
    The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. Credential exchange protocols must be flexible enough to support many different situations. For example, in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I describe a use case that requires the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. Credential exchange readily adapts to these context-dependent, ad hoc situations. 
</p>



<a></a>
 Ease of Mastery 
<p>
    Ease of mastery refers to the capacity of a technology to be easily and broadly adapted and adopted. One of the core features of credential exchange on the identity metasystem is that supports the myriad use cases described above without requiring new applications or user experiences for each one. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">digital wallet that is at the heart of credential exchange activities on the self-sovereign internet</a> supports two primary artifacts and the user experiences to manage them: connections and credentials. Like the web browser, even though multiple vendors provide digital wallets, the underlying protocol informs a common user experience. 
</p>

<p>
    A consistent user experience doesnât mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Accessibility 
<p>
    Accessible technologies are easy to acquire, inexpensive, and resistant to censorship. Because of it's openness, standardization, and support by multiple vendors, credential exchange is easily available to anyone with access to a computer or phone with an internet connection. But we can't limit its use to individuals who have digital access and legal capacity. Ensuring that technical and legal architectures for credential exchange support guardianship and use on borrowed hardware can provide accessibility to almost everyone in the world. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">Sovrin Foundation's Guardianship Working working group</a> has put significant effort into understanding the technical underpinnings (e.g., guardianship and delegation credentials), legal foundations (e.g., guardianship contracts), and business drivers (e.g., economic models for guardianship). They have produced an <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/guardianship-white-paper/">excellent whitepaper on guardianship</a> that "examines why digital guardianship is a core principle for Sovrin and other SSI architectures, and how it works from inception to termination through looking at real-world use cases and the stories of two fictional dependents, Mya and Jamie."
</p>


<a></a>
 Self-Sovereign Identity and Generativity 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">What is SSI?</a>, I made the claim that SSI requires decentralized identifiers, credential exchange, and autonomy for participants.  <a href="https://medium.com/@dickhardt">Dick Hardt</a> pushed back on that a bit and asked me if decentralized identifiers were really necessary? We had a several fun discussions on that topic.
</p>

<p>
    In that article, I unfortunately used decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials as placeholders for their properties. Once I started looking at properties, I realized that generative identity can't be built on an administrative identity system. Self-sovereign identity is generative not only because of the credential exchange protocols but also because of the properties of the self-sovereign internet upon which those protocols are defined and operate. Without the self-sovereign internet, enabled through DIDComm, you might implement something that works as SSI, but it won't provide the leverage and adaptability necessary to creating a generative ecosystem of uses that creates the network effects needed to propel it to ubiquity. 
</p>

<p>
    Our past approach to digital identity has put us in a position where people's privacy and security are threatened by the administrative identity architecture it imposes. Moreover, limiting its scope to authentication and a few unauthenticated attributes, repeated across thousands of websites with little interoperability, has created confusion, frustration, and needless expense.  None of the identity systems in common use today offer support for the same kind of ad hoc attribute sharing that happens everyday in the physical world. The result has been anything but generative.  Entities who rely on attributes from several parties must perform integrations with all of them. This is slow, complex, and costly, so it typically happens only for high-value applications.
</p>

<p>
    An identity metasystem that supports protocol-mediated credential exchange running on top of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">self-sovereign internet</a> solves these problems and promises generative identity for everyone.  By starting with people and their innate autonomy, generative identity supports online activities that are life-like and natural. Generative identity allows us to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, contemplates and addresses the problems of social inclusion, and supports economic access for people around the globe. 
</p>

 Notes 

 
     For Alice to prove things about her salary, Attestor would have to include that in the credential they issue to Alice.

<p>At the 2015 Postgres conference, the great IT philosopher Robert <a>r0ml</a> Lefkowitz delivered a talk entitled The Image of Postgres. Here’s the blurb.</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you think about what a database is? If you think of a database as only a place to store your data, then perhaps it does not really matter what the internals of that database are; all you really need is a home for your data to be managed, nothing more.</p>
<p>If you think of a database as a place where you develop applications, then your expectations of your database software change. No longer do you only need data management capabilities, but you require processing functions, the ability to load in additional libraries, interface with other databases, and perhaps even additional language support.</p>
<p>If your database is just for storage, there are plenty of options. If your database is your development framework, you need Postgres.</p>
<p>Why? Well, let’s get philosophical.</p></blockquote>
<p>For over a year, I’ve been using Postgres as a development framework. In addition to the core Postgres server that stores all the Hypothesis user, group, and annotation data, there’s now also a separate Postgres server that provides an interpretive layer on top of the raw data. It synthesizes and caches product- and business-relevant views, using a combination of PL/pgSQL and PL/Python. Data and business logic share a common environment. Although I didn’t make the connection until I watched r0ml’s talk, this setup harkens back to the 1980s when Smalltalk (and Lisp, and APL) were programming environments with built-in persistence. The “image” in r0ml’s title refers to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561145/what-is-a-smalltalk-image">Smalltalk image</a>, i.e. the contents of the Smalltalk virtual machine. It may also connote reputation, in the sense that our image of Postgres isn’t that of a Smalltalk-like environment, though r0ml thinks it should be, and my experience so far leads me to agree.</p>
<p>I started writing a book to document what I’ve learned and done with this idea. It’s been a struggle to find motivation because, well, being the patron saint of trailing-edge technologies is often lonely and unrewarding. A book on this particular topic is likely to appeal to very few people. Stored procedures? So last century! Yes, Python provides a modern hook, but I can almost guarantee that one of the comments on my first book — “has a vision, but too weird” — would come back around.</p>
<p>I’m tempted not to bother. Maybe I should just focus on completing and polishing the things the book would describe. </p>
<p>And yet, it’s hard to let go. This isn’t just a compelling idea, it’s delivering excellent results. I rewatched r0ml’s talk today and got fired up again. Does it resonate for you? Would you like to see the ideas developed? If you watch the talk, please let me know. </p>
<p>Here are some excerpts to pique your interest.</p>
<p>On databases vs file systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I submit that the difference between the database and a file system is that database is a platform for enforcing your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On ontology:</p>
<blockquote><p>
client: The business guys are always upset because they want to know how many customers we have and we can’t tell them.</p>
<p>r0ml: That doesn’t sound like a very hard problem. SELECT * from the customer table, right?</p>
<p>client: No you don’t understand the problem.</p>
<p>r0ml: OK, what’s the problem?</p>
<p>client: It depends what you mean by customer because if you’re selling cell phone insurance, is the customer the person who has the cell phone account? What if they have two handsets and they’re both insured? What if it’s a family account and there are kids on the plan, do they count as customers? What if it’s a business account and you have 1000 people covered but only 700 using?</p>
<p>r0ml: How my customers you have, that’s a business rule.</p>
<p>So figuring out what your schema is, and figuring out how you organize the stuff and what do you do in the database, that’s all part of enforcing your business rules.</p>
<p>You have to decide what these things mean.</p>
<p>It’s an ontological problem.</p>
<p>You have to classify your knowledge and then enforce your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On n-tier architecture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Let us think about the typical web application architecture. This architecture is called the three-tier architecture because it has four tiers. You have your browser, your web server, the thing that runs Python or PHP or JavaScript or Ruby or Java code, and then the database. And that’s always how you do it. And why do you do it that way? Well because that’s how everybody does it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On Smalltalk and friends:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.
</p></blockquote>

  <p>Shortly after the 2016 election, I pulled out a book written by my grandfather,
chronicling the history of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachhagel">Bachhagel</a>,
the village in southern Germany where he grew up.</p>
<p>I re-read the chapters describing how the Nazis, in short order, took over
life there in 1933. His eye-witness account describes in fascinating,
and horrifying detail, how quickly the established order and century-old
traditions were hollowed out and then overrun.</p>
<p>Bachhagel at the time was a tiny place, probably less than 1000 people, out in the
countryside, of no political or economic importance. I could have understood how
the Nazis would concentrate on the major population and economic centers to
crush the opposition, but Bachhagel certainly was as far away from that as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it just took a few months, after which the established order had
been swept out and the thugs were fully in charge, day to day, from school to church
to public events, and their entire worldview was the only thing that mattered.</p>
<p>With Joe Biden in the office this week, it seems we have turned a chapter.
And looking back to the 2016 election day, I realize that although the past four years were
bad, people died, children got separated, and many other outrages, we
have been lucky. In 2016, I had been expecting worse, and possibly much worse.</p>
<p>Why didn’t it turn out as bad as I had feared? It’s not that the defenders of the
republic did a particularly good job.  Instead, the would-be usurpers just
sucked at getting anything done, including just actually using the power in their.
hands. If it had been the original Nazis, the consequences would
have been so much worse.</p>
<p>I vastly prefer better defenses, however, than being lucky with having an
incompetent opponent.  In computer security terms, Trump was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">Zero Day Vulnerability</a> of
the constitutional system of the US – a successful attack vector that previously had
not been known.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people still aren’t taking this attack vector as a seriously as they should,
otherwise we’d have specific legal and practical fix proposals all over the news,
which we don’t. Which means the vulnerability remains, and our primary defense
will remain the same: hoping that the attacker is incompetent. As long as we don’t
fix the system, the next attacker is going to try a similar route and they may very
well be more capable. In which case we’d really be in trouble.</p>
<p>So: I raise my glass to imcompetence. Next time, may we get a similar bunch of
incompetents. Or actually get our act together and make sure there won’t be a
next time.</p>

 Sufficiency Currency: What Communities Want <p>Starting out with some assumptions, I returned from 11 weeks of travel including visits to 7 intentional communities (ecovillages) with a more solidified idea of what the “sufficiency currency” might look like. Before I go into that, it’s useful for me to distinguish the major differences between the Sufficiency Currency project and other projects.</p><p>By the way, we aren’t even sure that “Currency” is the right name for the project, and you can <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/naming-sufficiency-currency/">check out this blog </a>for a discussion of different names for the&nbsp;project.</p> Sufficiency Currency&nbsp;Inquiry <p>The Sufficiency Currency project is looking at non-monetary currency solutions and the two major inquiries are:</p>  How can we create “group” measures and currencies. Production is a group activity, but money is an individual measure. What if we could only transact as a group or community? What would that type of communications would represent the complexity of interactions among communities?  If the purpose of an economy is to provide people’s basic survival needs (food, shelter, energy, health), what would we measure such that we can support everyone and increase the capacity of a society to grow to support more&nbsp;people?  <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p> Goals and Hypothesis <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p><p>The fundamental goals of the project&nbsp;are:</p>  Create a form of economy that looks directly at the sustainability of life in the economy, rather than a proxy measure&nbsp;(money).  Create local self-sufficiency for communities, and in particular, encourage local regenerative and healthy forms of food and energy production.  Specifically for the regenerative/intentional/ecovillage/permaculture movements, support three outcomes:  Make it easy to transact within the network as well as with bodies outside of the&nbsp;network.  Make it easy to expand the movement and better share the resources coming into the&nbsp;network.  For people who want to join or create regenerative communities, make it easier to do so through this unified economic structure.  <p>The initial hypothesis for the Sufficiency Currency is that there are three important measures that a group of communities would want to look at in order to meet&nbsp;the</p> Market Research: How Does It Really&nbsp;Look? <p>In September-November of 2020, I traveled to a number of Ecovillages in Italy, Slovenia and Spain, to discuss my vision and understand what they really need in terms of their interactions among themselves and with their neighboring communities who may or may not be ecovillages.</p><p>The first thing I realized was that there are quite a few community currency and cryptocurrency projects trying to push their ideas into ecovillages. There are some isolated examples of successful community currency attempts within the intentional community movement, and dozens, if not hundreds of failure stories. The communities themselves are quite aware that they don’t need an alternative monetary currency to function. They are also aware that using monetary and trade based currency doesn’t reflect their values. Finally, these people are busy and they don’t have a lot of spare time for currency experiments. Usually there are one or two people who are responsible for anything that would require a computer. Others have computers and phones, but they are highly disinterested in activities that would require any serious amount of time in front of a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>The most gratifying find was that the kind of pooling proposed in the Sufficiency Currency project does appeal to the ecovillages. It would have to be very easy to manage, but they are already managing multiple interactions in their vicinity, and systematizing that is of interest. In fact, the same kind of thinking process has come from some of the national ecovillage support networks, but it hasn’t been a priority, nor is it really within the core competencies of the coordination networks for intentional communities.</p><p>All of the communities have some form of trade with the other communities in the area. Depending on the location, they might be interacting with local farms and businesses, cooperatives, or other ecovillages. The agreements look different among different entities, but in general there is a looser type of trade than you would see between businesses. For example, at one ecovillage the nearby town flooded and they went down to help out, taking the volunteers with them and neglecting their harvesting work for a couple of days. There was no formal trade — it was just helping people out — and at the same time, they know that this will be helpful for them when it comes to their needs vis-à-vis the municipal government. Similarly, they had an informal agreement with a local agricultural cooperative, where they were helping with the farm work in return for some produce, but they were giving it a try for a year before they came to any formal agreement. The assumption of cooperation and reciprocation was more important than the specifics of the&nbsp;deal.</p> Designing the&nbsp;Currency <p>Designing the “representables”, or currency, for the communities is like designing any product. The first step is to get clear on the problems the community wants to solve. The way they described their problems were mostly in terms of overwhelm:</p>  Every contract needs to be negotiated separately and the documentation is scattered.  The negotiation takes a lot of&nbsp;time.  Different parties have different ideas of fairness, and fairness isn’t necessarily expressed in monetary&nbsp;value.  Some items are truly scarce, while some are abundant, and monetary exchange doesn’t help them identify that type of value or seek solutions.  Depending on the type of organization, the terms of business are different. If it’s another ecovillage, it’s a very different type of relationship than if it’s just a nearby village that doesn’t belong to the regenerative agriculture movement.  <p>When translated into measurable currencies that can be represented in software, the Sufficiency Currency would aim, firstly, to create an easy-to-use interface for putting together contacts between two entities. Secondly, the dashboard would include the following measures:</p>  Fairness. Although fairness is subjective, it’s probably the most important measure to maintain for long-term relationships. For a sustainable network of ecovillages, it’s important for the members to feel the other group is dealing fairly with&nbsp;them.  Scarcity and abundance. Some items are scarce, for example, the number of trucks that are available. A good representation might be dark or light colors, or thickness of a line. Others are abundance, for example, squash in the summer. Even if the trade is fair, some things might wear out over time while others are easily replenished. Representing the scarcity or abundance of something in the communities allows people to identify joint problems to solve. For example, if there aren’t enough trucks, perhaps they would train some community members to repair and assemble trucks from spare parts. One of the main functions of the currency is to help the communities take joint&nbsp;action.  Reputation. Reputation would be a multi-dimensional measure that allows communities to get information about one another, such as how ecologically conscious one community is, whether they have traded fairly in the past, etc. The reputation measures need to be developed over&nbsp;time.  <p>The three measures above are a start for creating an alternative to monetary trading. The goal over time will be to have the communities simply share both their resources and their challenges to grow over time as a movement.</p>

   <p>Unpacking and explaining the Peak Paradox model is <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/peak-paradox">here</a>, you will need this backgrounder to understand the model so that this article will make sense; it is a 5-minute read. A new way of seeing the same thing will mean we can act differently; this is the peak paradox model’s core tenet.&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>A recurring question on an executives mind in the finance industry is; “Why does up or cross-selling not deliver in the way we forecast or predict?”&nbsp; Cross-selling is foundational hypnosis for growth.&nbsp; H0; this customer has one product, and therefore they should want my other products; all customers need all my core finance products.&nbsp; With years of data, it is evident that a customer who uses my payment system does not want my other products, and after years of cross-selling we still only have 30% of customers with all products. Whilst we can conclude there is a problem with the hypothesis, we choose to ignore this fact and continue to try to upsell as we don’t have a framework to explore why! If we try a different marketing message, this one will work (what was it about repeating the same thing and expecting a different outcome?)&nbsp;</p><p>This article maps core consumer financial services offerings of Payment (spending), Saving (available, current, on-demand and surplus), Borrowings (mortgage, credit, debt, overdraft, loans) and Investment (long-term growth and or income) onto the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I will unpack a delta between what a bank or financial service providers products say about their products’ purpose in marketing and terms; and the consumers’ purpose for the same products.&nbsp; When mapped, it is evident that cross-selling will only work in a limited capacity, and in the majority of cases, there is a misalignment.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, and with years of data, our upselling hypothesis appears to be misguided as the utopia for growth.&nbsp; The market has introduced a plethora of new banks,&nbsp; neo-banks, open banking platforms, banking 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and more; promising digital products for a new next generation. Each new company has a model that attracts customers from accepting the tempting offers from existing providers and then upselling. &nbsp; We will apply the Peak Paradox model on this perplexing and thorny topic because when we can see something through a different lens, we may decide to act differently, as we have new insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without a doubt, we all have a reason why upselling and cross-selling does not materialise to the level we predict/ want/ desire; but why does a customer then buy a very similar product from a different financial provider, even though we offer it?&nbsp; Finding the data to confirm that we have a specific, sound and justifiable explainable reason, which is different to others interruptions, leads to much tension, anxiety, stress, argument and disagreements in our teams and enterprises; both on why we miss the targets and what to do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are taking the core banking products in turn.&nbsp; Remember the purpose here is to provide a non-conformational way for your team to look at the same problem with a new perspective.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Payment (spending available, accessible and current cash resource).&nbsp; Spending maps across the entire Peak Paradox map.&nbsp; We need to spend to survive and therefore is essential at Peak Human Purpose as without food and water we don’t tend to last very long. &nbsp; Spending on luxury goods meets a requirement for being at Peak Individual Purpose where you look after yourself.&nbsp; Giving gifts to friends, philanthropy and donations to charity moves the coverage to Peak Society Purpose. Finally, we cannot work without payments,&nbsp; payments get us towards Peak Work Purpose and covering the entire map.</p><p>The observation is that, only at this moment-in-time, when you are using your payment service, can you highlight if the payment provider’s values reflect your purpose or if you feel there is a conflict.&nbsp; Users have started to use different payment mechanisms to reflect an alignment between their use and how they perceive the payment providers own marketing.&nbsp; But does that allow them to use this payment provider for everything, or do they have two or more to cope with conflicts?&nbsp; Can the customer hold the conflict of using the same ethical payment platform to gamble and buy adult services as they give to charity?&nbsp; How does the market, market payment services?</p><p>Saving (surplus).&nbsp; Saving tend not used for day to day survival (yes individuals often find they have to as a reality of our economic mess), therefore saving does not tend to feature towards Peak Human Purposes for most consumers.&nbsp; However, if savings are for a house and the house is attractive to a mate for reproduction it can be argued that there is a connection to Peak Human Purpose, but is this saving or borrowings (loans). &nbsp; However, savings are used to further your own individual purpose or help those closest to you, which means there is at least some societal benefit.&nbsp; (A gift to charity will be in payments, payments on death to a charity by a Will is a different dimension to be explored,&nbsp; more case-studies will help your team explore this in more detail.]&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst not explicit, some savers understand the economics of savings by themselves leads to borrowings (lending) for others, me saving has an indirect benefit for society. Fewer savers may realise that spending savings are a better way of benefiting a societal purpose as it encourages economic activity and growth. &nbsp; The point is that “saving” is positioned differently on the Peak Paradox model to that of your payment service.&nbsp; How your company positions these products will have a direct impact on how users perceive them.&nbsp; Indeed how your competitor and the media report on these products directly affects user positioning.&nbsp; We seek the delta between your marketing, the markets positions, the media view, and the users’ own opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Borrowings (mortgage, credit, debt, overdraft, loans) Brownings at a consumer retail banking level, because the terms and conditions are for an individual or a couple who equally take on the responsibility, meaning that Borrowings are for Individual needs more than society.&nbsp; Since the use of borrowings that a requester has is vetted by the provider, a company’s processes and regulation (compliance) mean that borrowings focus on Peak Individual Purpose.&nbsp; Borrowings give the person(s) more agency, and one can argue more freedom, but that depends on responsible lending to ensure that levels of debt are not a burden, which sadly is not always the case.&nbsp; Borrowings to give to someone else still has to be repaid and when you look at the terms and the processes; borrowing to give away is not an acceptable practice - whereas guarantees are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, borrowings have a different position on the Peak Paradox model. &nbsp; There is a position where lending does support more basic human survival (payday loans), but this creates tension and conflicts in the users of borrowing products between two Peak Purposes.&nbsp; Debt can also be used as part of a personal guarantee to provide working capital for a business or enterprise.&nbsp; This means that borrowings are dragged towards Peak Work Purpose, and depending on if the Borrowings are for growth (thriving) or survival creates different tensions again. &nbsp; Consider, customers are not buying a specific product; they are buying a generic idea.&nbsp; When these ideas become confused, it creates tensions.&nbsp; We might like to give them cool marketing names to deceive ourselves to what is being offered, but it is quite evident in the terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Investment (long-term growth and or income from the investment - capital at risk).&nbsp; The final bucket considered here. Pre-crypto, climate and ethical investing; investment occupied an area between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose, with variance in risk and return creating an area.&nbsp; As real-time trading led to no responsibility for the shareholder, the area has shifted towards Peak Individual Purpose.&nbsp; Crypto, angel, seed and start-up investing has pushed the upper boundary even further to Peak Individual.&nbsp; However, social and impact investing (labelled here as ESG for convenience) has created a broader and wider market. Those who seek more ethical ideals that align with their own position of the map means the investment is also firmly heading into Peak Society Purpose.&nbsp; Such diversity. &nbsp; The same questions need to be reflected on: how is the positioning of investment products aligned to the individual’s need and purpose? Is there a gap between brand, marketing and overall positioning?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> What do we learn?&nbsp; <p>Financial services are a very cluttered landscape. Just offering slicker, quicker, faster, less paperwork, and sexy digital services are avoiding the very core of the problem that the Peak Paradox model exposes. &nbsp;Yes, we can play with terms and marketing. We can create great names, become ever more personalised and seemingly more differentiated in niche services, but fundamentally avoid the conflicts and tensions this creates.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovation.&nbsp; A term on the lips of every board, executive and management personnel in the finance industry.&nbsp; We have to be more innovative.&nbsp; We have clearly been more “clever” in how we bundle, describe, consider risk and differentiate our core products. Still, we appear not to have aligned our corporate purpose, with our products’ purpose with the customers’ purpose for financial services. &nbsp; Perhaps we should look at innovation in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>Positioning. Suppose we attracted a customer with a faster payment method for essential services, positioned towards Peak Human Purpose and Peak Social Purpose. Why would that customer naturally consider other series until you have either developed trust or re-educated them on your brand position?&nbsp; Fabulous branding for new customers’ attraction may generate the numbers and look good in the business plan until you need that same “easy to attract customer” to buy something else.&nbsp;</p><p>This is tricky as it might mean rewriting marketing and positioning, and will the marketing/branding team understand this, given that it could affect their KPI’s and bonus?&nbsp; &nbsp; Such actions also require time and reflection, always the most precious things in an early-stage growth company, as far too many jobs to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There a delta between an individual consumers perspective of the financial products they are using, the marketing position/ branding you offer and different core products align to other areas meaning that there is unlikely to be a natural cross-selling opportunity, with one exception. There is an alignment of all the products focussed at Peak Individual Purpose. Maybe that is why High Net Wealth (HNW) teams, wealth management and those looking after the ultra-wealthy in banks appear to have a very successful, and aligned business.&nbsp;</p><p>Trust. This asks how to explore the alignment between your product's purpose and the consumer purpose and how this correlates to the “trust” in your brand. If there is a high R2 does it lead to a propensity to utilise more than one product from a financial institute?&nbsp;</p><br><p>We need to add pensions, tax, gifts, inheritance, B2B, business, corporate and many other financial services to complete the picture, and then the role of the regulator and whose purpose they are working to protect! Anyone up for mapping one company's financial products? </p> <br>

<p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro kit you can ship to a remote location and then control from your studio. You can use this to ship a remote interview kit to someone where all they have to do is plug in a few connections and you'll be able to control everything remotely!</p>

<p></p>

<p>The overall idea is you'll ship out an ATEM Mini Pro (or ISO), a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K (or any other camera, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled by the ATEM!), and a Raspberry Pi. The guest will connect the Raspberry Pi to their home network, connect the camera's HDMI to the ATEM, turn everything on, and you'll immediately be able to control the remote end yourself!</p>

<p>The remote ATEM can then stream to any streaming service directly, or if you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9OTROesp0">Streaming Bridge</a>, you can get a high quality video feed of the remote guest brought directly into your studio!</p>

 Devices Used in this Tutorial 

 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2LUZntd">ATEM Mini Pro</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3nURgKu">ATEM Mini Pro ISO</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lwar0g">GL.iNet AR750S Travel Router</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38RrySV">Raspberry Pi 4</a> (a <a href="https://amzn.to/39ELjMD">Pi 3</a> will also work, but they aren't that much cheaper anyway) 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/2N8c1FP">MicroSD Card</a> for the Raspberry Pi, I like the 32gb A2 cards 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/3swb22v">USB Ethernet adapter</a> to get an additional ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/3bLCR0X">Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K</a> (any camera will do, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled remotely too!) 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38PXY04">Blackmagic Streaming Bridge</a> to receive the remote ATEM video feed in your studio 
 

 Set up the Studio Side 

<p>We'll start with setting up the studio side of the system. This is where your computer to control the remote ATEM will be, and this end will have the VPN server. If you have a Streaming Bridge, it would be on this end as well in order to receive the streaming video feed from the remote ATEM.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First we're going to set up the GL.iNet router as a Wireguard server.</p>

<p>Plug your computer in to one of the two ethernet ports on the right, or connect to its WiFi hotspot. There's a sticker on the bottom showing the default wifi name and password as well as the IP address of the router. (It's probably <code>192.168.8.1</code>).</p>

<p>Open that address in your browser and it will prompt you to set up an admin password. Make sure you keep that somewhere safe like a password manager.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up Internet Access for the Travel Router 

<p>The first thing we need to do is get internet access set up on this router. You'll definitely want to hardwire this in to your studio network rather than use wifi. Plug an ethernet cord from your main router in the studio to the port on the left. Once that's connected, the admin dashboard should pop up a section to configure the wired connection. You can use DHCP to get it on your network. Eventually you'll want to give this device a fixed IP address by going into your main router and setting a static DHCP lease. The specifics of that will depend on your own router so I'll leave that up to you to look up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my case the travel router's IP address is 10.10.12.102.</p>

 Configure the Wireguard Server 

<p>Now we're ready to set up the travel router as a Wireguard server. Wireguard is relatively new VPN software that is a lot faster and easier to use compared to older VPN software like OpenVPN. It's conveniently already built in to the travel router as well, making it an excellent option for this.</p>

<p>Go to the VPN menu on the side and expand it to reveal the Wireguard Server tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click "Initialize Wireguard Server" and you'll be able to set it up. Enable the "Allow Access Local Network" toggle, and change the "Local IP" to <code>172.16.55.1</code>. (It doesn't really matter what IP range you use for the Wireguard interface, but this address is unlikely to conflict with your existing network.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can click "Start", and then go into the "Management" tab.</p>

<p>Click the big "Add a New User" button. Give it a name like "RemoteATEM". This will create a config for it which you'll use to set up the remote side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the icon under "Configurations" and click the "Plain Text" tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that text into a text editor (not Word or Google Docs!). We're going to make a few changes to make it look like the below.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>We don't want the ATEM to send the video feed over the VPN, so change the AllowedIPs line to: <code>172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24</code>. If it's set to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> then all the traffic on the remote end will be funneled through your VPN server and your studio's internet connection. That's usually what you want when you're using a VPN for privacy, but we don't want to add latency to sending the video feed if you're streaming from the remote end to YouTube directly. The IP address in the <code>Endpoint =</code> line is the public IP address of your studio network, so make sure you leave that line alone. You can remove the <code>DNS =</code> line since we aren't routing all network traffic through the VPN. Make sure you keep the PrivateKey and PublicKey that your router generated though!</p>

<p>This next part is the magic that makes it work. The key here is we need to let other devices on the WireGuard server end access devices on the LAN side of the WireGuard client. The ATEM will be behind the WireGuard client (described in the next section), the ATEM itself wouldn't normally be visible to other things on the Wireguard server side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the most complicated step. You'll need to edit a text file on the router by connecting to it via ssh. Open Terminal on a mac, or PuTTY on Windows.</p>

 <code>ssh root@192.168.8.1
</code> 

<p>The root ssh password is the same admin password you created when you first set up the router. (You won't see your keystrokes as you're typing your password.)</p>

<p>You'll need a text editor to edit the file. If you're familiar with <code>vi</code>, it's already installed. If you want something easier to use, then you can install <code>nano</code>.</p>

 <code>opkg update
opkg install nano
</code> 

<p>Now you can edit the file using nano:</p>

 <code>nano /etc/config/wireguard_server
</code> 

<p>Navigate to the bottom of the file and add this line:</p>

 <code>        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>The file should now look something like the below</p>

 <code>config servers
        option local_port '51820'
        option local_ipv6 'fd00:db8:0:abc::1'
        option private_key '&lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option public_key '&lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option access 'ACCEPT'
        option local_ip '172.16.55.1'
        option enable '1'

config peers 'wg_peer_9563'
        option name 'RemoteATEM'
        option client_key '&lt;CLIENT PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option private_key '&lt;CLIENT PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option client_ip '172.16.55.2/32'
        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>To save and exit, press control X, and press Y and enter when prompted. You'll need to reboot this device once this is set up, so click the "reboot" button in the top right corner of the admin panel.</p>

 Set Up Port Forwarding 

<p>The last step on the studio side is to set up port forwarding from your studio router to forward port 51820 to the IP address of the WireGuard server. This is what will let the remote end be able to connect to your studio VPN. How you do this will depend on what router you use in your studio. Most routers will have a web interface to configure them which will let you set up port forwarding rules.</p>

<p>You'll need to know the IP address of your studio router as well as the IP address of the travel router. Create a port forwarding rule to forward port 51820 to your travel router's IP address.</p>

<p>For example, this is what it looks like in my Unifi router to create the forwarding rule.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alright, we're set on this end! You now have a WireGuard server accessible from outside of your network! If you're curious to keep experimenting with WireGuard, you can even set up your mobile phone or laptop as a WireGuard client so that you can connect back to your studio on the go!</p>

<p>Next, we're ready to set up the remote end for the ATEM Mini Pro.</p>

 Set up the Remote Side for the ATEM 

<p>The remote kit side will have the ATEM Mini Pro, the camera, and the WireGuard client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the WireGuard client powers on, it will connect to your studio network and make the ATEM Mini acessible from your studio network.</p>

<p>I want to preface this section by saying I tried really hard to make this work with another GL.iNet router, but ran into a few blockers before switching to using a Raspberry Pi. As such, this step is a lot more involved and requires quite a bit more command line work than I would like. If you are reading this and happen to know how to do this with the GL.iNet router instead, I would be very interested in hearing it! Feel free to get in touch with details!</p>

 Install Raspberry Pi OS 

<p>The first thing to do is burn the Raspberry Pi OS image to a MicroSD card. Download the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> app, and go through the steps of installing the Raspberry Pi OS. If you're comfortable on the command line, you can use the "lite" version which doesn't include the desktop environment. I prefer this since I'm never going to be connecting a monitor to this anyway after the first round of setup.</p>

<p>After the card is created, stick it in the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. You'll need a keyboard and monitor connected to set things up the first time. You'll also want to make sure the Raspberry Pi has an internet connection, so plug in an ethernet cord to the ethernet port on the Pi into your home router.</p>

 Install WireGuard 

<p>It looks like in the near future, WireGuard will be included by default in Raspberry Pi OS, so first check if it's already there by typing <code>which wg</code>, and if it shows you a path like <code>/usr/bin/wg</code> then you can skip this step since it's already installed!</p>

<p>If you need to install WireGuard, you can install it from the "testing" packages by running these commands:</p>

 <code>echo "deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian testing main" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wireguard
</code> 

<p>Now when you run <code>which wg</code> you should see that it's installed.</p>

 WireGuard Setup 

<p>Remember that big block of text you created in the previous step? It's time to use it! You'll need to paste that into the WireGuard configuration file on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code> 

<p>Paste in the full contents of the configuration replacing anything that is already in that file if any.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>Save and quit by pressing control X, then Y and enter when prompted.</p>

 Turn the Raspberry Pi into a Router 

<p>The Raspberry Pi will be sharing its internet connection with the ATEM Mini, so it's time to turn it into a router! (This is the reason I wanted to use a travel router instead, because this step is already done in that case.)</p>

<p>First, plug in the USB ethernet adapter to one of the USB ports, and connect an ethernet cable from that to the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up that ethernet device. Edit the file using the command below:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1
</code> 

<p>Paste in the following text exactly as written:</p>

 <code>auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.5.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
</code> 

<p>This creates a new network on the Raspberry Pi which will be the private network for the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>We're going to set up a few more things first, then eventually reboot the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server firewalld
</code> 

<p>Now edit the DHCP server config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
</code> 

<p>You'll need to set the <code>domain-name</code> and <code>domain-name-servers</code> as follows:</p>

 <code>option domain-name "rpi.local";
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the bottom and add the following lines as well:</p>

 <code>subnet 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.5.100 192.168.5.200;
        option routers 192.168.5.1;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
}
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Next, open the <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
</code> 

<p>Add <code>eth1</code> to the <code>INTERFACESv4</code> line and save the file.</p>

 <code>INTERFACESv4="eth1"
INTERFACESv6=""
</code> 

<p>Now we can set up the firewall to allow this traffic through and enable IP masquerading.</p>

 <code>sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-masquerade --permanent
</code> 

<p>Lastly, we'll tell the WireGuard client to start up on boot by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
</code> 

<p>Finally, we're ready to reboot the Raspberry Pi and see if it all works!</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>With any luck, the Raspberry Pi will boot up and connect to your WireGuard server and everything will be working!</p>

<p>On the Raspberry Pi, you should be able to type <code>sudo wg</code> to see the status of the WireGuard client. If it worked, you'll see the endpoint you're connected to as well as a "latest handshake" and some transfer stats showing how much data has gone over the VPN.</p>

<p></p>

 Let's Try it Out! 

<p>With everything up and running, it's time to try to connect to your ATEM! You'll need to find or set the IP address of the ATEM on the remote side. You can try out <code>192.168.5.100</code> since it will be the first device that the DHCP server sees, or you can connect your ATEM over USB and use the ATEM Setup app to find the address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Of course, to really put it to the test, you'll want to unplug from USB and see if you can connect from your laptop through the VPN.</p>

<p>Remember, at this point your laptop running the ATEM Software Control app should be connected to your travel router either over wifi or ethernet. Your ATEM Mini is the remote end, and that's connected to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Open the ATEM Software Control app and type in the ATEM's IP address under "Manual IP Address". (It won't be able to auto-discover it on the network since it's going over a VPN.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have a Blackmagic camera connected to the ATEM, you'll be able to control it from the Camera tab since it's connected to the ATEM via HDMI! No networking stuff to worry about there.</p>

 Using the Streaming Bridge 

<p>Now you're ready to choose where to stream! The remote ATEM can stream directly to YouTube if that's how you're using it. Because of the way we set up WireGuard, the ATEM will use the remote end's internet connection rather than sending the video through the VPN and out of your studio. That saves a hop and will give you better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to stream to your Streaming Bridge, that should "just work" by using the local IP address of the Streaming Bridge. Connect the Streaming Bridge to your travel router, then open the ATEM Setup app to find its IP address. In my case it's <code>192.168.8.127</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and choose "Local network with key". It's a "local network" because it's going over the VPN. The nice thing about doing it this way is you don't have to set up port forwarding in your studio's router to the bridge, since it will all happen over the VPN!</p>

<p>Next click the "External ATEM Mini Pro" tab to export the configuration file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You'll need to make one change in the file since the normal local network discovery that it does won't work over the VPN. Open the xml file in a text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, and replace the URL with the IP address of your Streaming Bridge, for example:</p>

 <code>&lt;servers&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;rtmp://192.168.8.127:1935/app&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/servers&gt;
</code> 

<p>Now you can load that config file in the ATEM Software Control from the "Stream" menu in the top menu bar, and you'll have a new streaming destination to choose!</p>

<p></p>

 Recording Locally 

<p>If you also ship a USB drive plugged in to the remote ATEM, you can record the program locally as a backup! If you use a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, you can even tell the camera itself to record a high quality video to an SD card or SSD in the camera itself!</p>

<p>And that's it! Hopefully all of this worked for you. If you have any trouble, feel free to post a question on the <a href="https://forum.livevideotech.today/c/support/5">Live Video Tech</a> forums to get some assistance!</p>

 According to CNBC,
Facebook made $7.89 in revenue per average global user in the 3rd quarter last year (with a high of
$39.63 in the US and Canada, and a low of $2.22 outside US, Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific).

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-leads-social-media-companies.html">According to CNBC</a>,
Facebook made $7.89 in revenue per average global user in the 3rd quarter last year (with a high of
$39.63 in the US and Canada, and a low of $2.22 outside US, Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific).</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB">According to Yahoo! Finance</a> and my calculation, if
its expenses in the same quarter were $13.4 billion, expense per user was  $13.4 / $21.5 * $7.89 = $4.92
on average (proportionally allocated given expense / revenue ratio).</p>
<p>Revenue per user is obviously quite different in different parts of the world, but what about costs?
It seems to me that on a per-user-basis, selling and serving all those ads in the US and Canada that led
to so much revenue per user is probably more expensive, compared to some places that have less commerce.
But as dramatically different as $39.63 and $2.22 on the revenue side? I don’t think so. Not even close.</p>
<p>In other words, users in the rest of the world at $2.22 of revenue per user are almost certainly
not profitable. Even if expenses there were only half of average, it would still not be enough.</p>
<p>Of course these numbers are averages across the regions, and chances are that the differences between users
within one region are also quite striking. I don’t have numbers on those. But I would bet that some
users in the US and Canada also bring in less revenue than the $4.92 in average cost per user.</p>
<p>Who would those unprofitable users be in the US, say? Well, those demographics
and those neighborhoods in the social graph in which advertisers see little opportunities to make a sale,
because, for example, everybody is unemployed and angry.</p>
<p>(So if, for example, a certain presidential campaign came by and wanted to specifically target this
demographic with political ads … I for one can vividly imagine the leap of joy of some Facebook business guy
who finally saw how to get promoted: “I turned a million users from being a cost center to being
a profit center”. And democracy be damned. Of course, I’m speculating here, but directionally I don’t
think I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>Which suggests another strategy to unseat Facebook as the dominant social network: focus on picking off the
users that generate the most revenue for Facebook, as they subsidize the rest. If that relatively small
subset of users jumped ship, the rest of the business would become unprofitable.</p>
<p>(I jotting this down because I hadn’t seen anybody suggest this strategy. We do need to find ways
of ending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> after all.)</p>

<p>This modular cage allows you to stack <a href="https://geni.us/f2B4y">Blackmagic Bidirectional SDI/HDMI 3G Converters</a> on a desk or behind other gear.</p>

<p>The design is composed of four parts: the main shelf, the top shelf, a top plate that sits on top of the top shelf, and an optional angled base. The angled base plate lets you mount the whole stack on top of rack gear that's mounted at a 9° angle, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk">StarTech 8U desktop rack</a>. You can print as many of the main shelves as you need to stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk"></a></p>



<p>The shelves are designed so that the converters can slip in from one side with enough of a gap on top to be able to insert and remove them even after a stack is assembled.</p>

<p>If you'd like, you can glue the stack together to make a solid structure. Otherwise the pegs are long enough that the stack is reasonably stable even without glue.</p>

    In the world full of human bias,&nbsp; exploring paradox might help us explain our differences.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya (Identity Woman</a>) and I wrote “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/12/humans-want-principles-society-demands.html">Humans want principles, society demands rules and businesses want to manage risk, can we reconcile the differences?</a>&nbsp; Have been noodling on that framework of linking purpose and rules with a few friends. This article explores how to look for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox">paradox</a> within our known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive bias</a> and how to identify and manage differences. <p>----</p><p>I follow the excellent work of my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rorysutherland/">Rory Sutherland</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nireyal/">Nir Eyal</a> (Nir &amp; Far) who are both leading thinkers in behavioural science and economics along with the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>. I reflected following a call with the most read man on the planet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbie-stamp-70254/">Robbie Stamp</a> CEO of <a href="http://www.bioss.com/">BIOSS</a> (a company who can assess capabilities for complex decision making), about how to frame bias and conflicts. We are aware that there are over 180 cognitive biases of human behaviour, which because of differences between us; create unique tensions, alignments, conflicts and paradoxes.</p> The 180 cognitive biases of human behaviour create unique tension, alignment, conflict and paradox. <br><p>The famous infographic below from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/busterbenson/">Buster Benson</a> on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@buster">https://medium.com/@buster</a> has become foundational in presenting the array of human cognitive bias. Buster is well worth following, and I am looking forward to reading his new book "<a href="https://busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling/">Why Are We Yelling? The Art of Productive Disagreement"</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On another call with my friend, the insanely cleaver identity lawyer and polymath <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott David, </a>we were noodling that we saw paradoxes within behavioural science, primarily when reflecting on the very long list of human biases.&nbsp; I love his quote “we have to find the paradox, or we are probably in a model.” On a similar call with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktormirovic/">Viktor Mirovic </a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://keencorp.com/">CEO of KeenCorp</a> - a company who identifies employee problems in real-time), we explored the gaps between our own bias and purpose and those biases/purpose that our companies have.&nbsp; Viktor and I reflected on what happens when there is a delta between you and the company and the (a)effects on teams and individuals performance.&nbsp; As you can imagine, this article and thinking are built ’the shoulders of giants and would not have come to be without those conversations and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The drawing below is to explore how to frame paradox within our known biases (maybe beliefs).&nbsp; We will unpack the diagram, examine how we manage the differences, and recognise that mostly we don't; which leads to harmful stress.&nbsp;</p> On discovering Peak Paradox <p>The four outer extremes are peaks in their own right; at these individual peaks, you can only hold one single view at the expense of all others.&nbsp; Therefore there is no conflict at a peak, and no compromise as this is the only view that can be held.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The axes are set up that on the X-axis (horizontal) is the conflict of our human purpose vs a commercial purpose. On the Y-axis (vertical) it is the conflict of individual vs everyone.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; Work in this context is commercial or economic. At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason a company exists is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, straightforward, no conflict and no compromise. Even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Society Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to survive as long as possible and escape death, which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of everything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose is chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>These extremes as peaks articulate that there is no conflict, no compromise, no tension - they are pure when at the extreme.&nbsp; It is not that we have to agree with them but to recognise they can exist.&nbsp; &nbsp; My gut says right-wing politics (given the interpretation of capitalist today and not its original meaning) follows the top edge between peak commercial purpose and peak individual purpose. Depending on the specific view individuals can be somewhere along the line, whereas parties are more complex in their overall position. &nbsp; Left-wing political views (today's interruption more socialist) follow the bottom right edge between peak commercial purpose and peak society. Again individual views may hold the line, but parties are trying to find the right balance of majority votes, commercial activity, tax, redistribution and a fairer society.&nbsp; Applying the same thinking Cults are likely to be positioned along the top left boundary between peak human purpose and peak individual purpose, whereas more fervent religious movements will tend towards the lower-left boundary between peak human purpose and peak society. Like political parties, world religions need a mass following for a voice and therefore are positioned with more paradoxes, which they solve with paradoxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox.&nbsp; The melting pot that is the middle of all of the peaks, the place where you are trying to rationalise all the extreme purposes into one acceptable position for everyone, but there is no resolution without compromise that will suit no-one.&nbsp; Peak Paradox is likely to be unsustainable due to the conflicts and compromises required or may itself be a paradox in so much when there it feels like nothing is there, like the eye of the storm when there is complete calm.&nbsp; It feels that many great thinkers and philosophers may try to find rest or stillness in this calm at peak paradox. There is a battle to get into the place of calm fighting the storms of opinions, and if you lose that moment of mindfulness, it is straight back into the storm. The unstable nature of standing on the point of a needle. This said:</p>  <p>Just because we may agree on the same peak purpose, that does not mean we can also agree on how to go about achieving or maintaining it.</p>  <p>Different peak purposes can have the same principles and values.&nbsp; You come from different peaks towards a livable compromise; however, as individuals, you can have the same principles and values, making the acceptance of difference more acceptable.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If there is no paradox or you cannot find one, you are at a boundary edge, where there is the greatest order, or at an extreme peak view.&nbsp;</p>  <p>At peak paradox, there is the highest disorder, in terms of a variety of views.</p>  <p>It is evident that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_test">our long list of personality testing</a> is to identify where you naturally identify with right now. You will change and adapt, but there is likely to be a natural affinity that tends towards one or more peaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>There are over 180 cognitive biases recognised,&nbsp; from this diagram, we can unpack that you are unlikely to have them all at the same time, but a subset of them depending on where you locate yourself.&nbsp;</p>   What is the relation between bias and paradox? <p>When there are no biases, surely we have overcome all our objections, and we can deal with everyone’s unique and individual views, and we must be at “Peak Paradox.”</p><p>When there is no paradox, surely we are at an extreme view where there are no tensions, no conflicts, and we have no biases that can distract us from accepting every position equally.</p><p>Most of us do not see the paradox in front of us. Still, we have many biases, suggesting that Peak Bias (number of biases), which means we reject most ideas accepting only a few, will occur early in a distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>As we can deal with more complex compromises, we can see more paradoxes in any position but can cope with the conflicts and tensions that arise, suggesting a long tail to peak paradox.&nbsp;</p><p></p> 4 case studies <p>I wrote about how to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-uncover-your-purpose-tony-fish/">uncover your purpose here</a>, but I can now see that personal purpose maps differently to paradox and bias. Mapping a few personal or individual purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Invent and Crete.&nbsp; “Necessity is the mother of all invention” and “Creativity is intelligence having fun” sum up rather well that part of our human make-up is to find ways to create or invent something that solves a problem we see or understand.&nbsp; Our personal purpose is to invent and create as we see what everyone else sees but can think what no-one else has thought. Irrespective of such a personal goal it maps all of the blue area on the Peak Paradox diagram as every paradox creates a problem that needs to be solved.&nbsp; Being creative as a purpose does not mean you will find anyone else on the same journey.</p><p>Creating Impact.&nbsp; Some individuals desire to have more of an impact whilst alive and some, because of what they do, have a lasting effect that changes our human journey, some good and some not so.&nbsp; This is the point about creating impact as a purpose; it is like all items that humans make: they can be used as tools for good or weapons for bad.&nbsp; Creating impact creates a paradox of how to create something that cannot be used for harm, but often we create something without seeing the harm.&nbsp; Our individual purpose is itself in conflict with the outcome we want. &nbsp; At every point under the blue area on the Peak Paradox chat, creating impact for good or ill is possible at every point.&nbsp;</p><p>Better ancestors.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/what-changes-when-you-consider.html">What changes when you consider governance for the next 1000 years</a> is a post about how we have to become better stewards and ancestors.&nbsp; We have to be more considerate if we want others to walk our path and not burn the earth.&nbsp; As a thinking piece, I focussed on the paradox of high commercial pressure, being between citizens, giving our children life and enabling more individuals to have agency.&nbsp; Almost peak paradox. Perhaps this is the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance">ESG </a>as a conceptual issue, we have to compromise, and we are not in agreement on what we need to compromise on?</p> Perhaps this is the case with ESG as a conceptual issue, we have to compromise, and we are not in agreement on what we need to compromise on? <br><p>Being Useful.&nbsp; There appears to be a human need that presents as wanting to be loved, wanted or useful.&nbsp; Over time we go through these different phases on a cyclic basis throughout life. What we conceive as “being useful” is profoundly personal and therefore could be anywhere in the central blue area on the Peak Paradox drawing. Being Useful today can mean you want to do well in assisting, where you are employed, achieve its goals or mission, and help you achieve your personal goal of more agency.&nbsp; Equally, being useful can mean creating less poverty and suffering in the world.&nbsp; Anyone who describes themselves with a desire to be useful is unlikely to find a massive community who have the same idea of what that means.</p><p>Personal purposes are both aligned to all peaks, and also in conflict with all the peaks, it is why we should see the paradoxes in our own life's purpose and find we cannot rest on one.&nbsp; We have to settle for a compromise that we find acceptable and does not bring conflict, tension or anxiety.&nbsp;</p> Towards better performance, strategy and judgement.&nbsp; <p>Teams and Culture. We have one culture; this is how we do it.&nbsp; These are our rules; these are our processes.&nbsp; We have one team, and all our thinking is aligned.&nbsp; After reading this, you might be as sceptical about such thoughts as I am.&nbsp; In my article “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/12/humans-want-principles-society-demands.html">Humans want principles, society demands rules and businesses want to manage risk, can we reconcile the differences?</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not connect the dots between the delta or gap between where the company has decided to operate with its paradox, compromises, tensions and conflicts and how they would align to the individuals inside the organisation.&nbsp; I am sure there is a link here to transformation issues as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://keencorp.com/">KeenCorp is looking at measuring this, something I am going to watch&nbsp;</a></p><p>Philanthropy is a private initiative from individuals. Interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy">Wikipedia</a> defines philanthropy as for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">public good</a>, focusing on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life">quality of life</a>. However, often we see that the person who is giving has an idea of public good and priority that is not aligned to mine, which creates friction. &nbsp; Philanthropy has an interesting dynamic about how much it is for PR and how much it is indeed the individual’s purpose.&nbsp; Might have to analyse the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and see what it says about what paradoxes they are prepared to live with and help understand the criticism and support offered.&nbsp;</p><p>Investors, directors and the company.&nbsp; As a group, you can imagine that they are one the closest to a peak purpose.&nbsp; Investors as equity investors believe, one would hope, in the purity of shareholder primacy and would probably be outright supporters of this single focus.&nbsp; However, since we have lived that view, we are now much more paradoxical.&nbsp; ESG and stewardship codes mean that the purity has become a complex mix of different personal compromises, which currently are not disclosed and may be in conflict to the culture or purpose of the company that they invest into.&nbsp; The relationship between investors and Directors is also changing. However, it appears that the capital providers are willing to embrace ESG and a watered-down version of peak Shareholder Primacy. However, Directos, <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/why-is-innovation-perceived-as-so-much.html">KPI, remuneration committees and self-interested processes might be creating a level of friction to nobel ESG change that we did not anticipate</a>. <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Organisational wellness</a> should also now be a new measure and reported on, but how?&nbsp;</p><p>Governance.&nbsp; Governance of old did not have to embrace compromise, conflict or tensions.&nbsp; Investors and founders understood the simplicity of a very pure set of drivers.&nbsp; The founding team had largely sorted out the paradox and how they could work together.&nbsp; Indeed anyone who could not be soon off.&nbsp; Governance was then ensuring the right NorthStar, the suitable vessel and the right team.&nbsp; This model is no longer good enough. Suddenly, the directors are having to face up to conflicting peak purposes pulling in different directions by directors who have their own views and teams who also have a&nbsp; significant voice.&nbsp; Added to this is the dependence on the ecosystem who themselves will reach a different compromise which asks fundamental questions about your interaction with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Take away   <p>If there is no paradox, compromise or conflict, you are in a model pretending it is life.</p>  <p>If it is too good to be true, you are probably at an extreme as there is no tension, conflict or paradox.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Are we in a place where our compromises are good for us? Can we perform?</p>  <p>We can identify stress that is probably harmful as we have compromised to someone else’s force, dominance, position and have ended up in a place where we do not naturally belong.</p>  <p>Is there an alignment, understanding and communication between our compromises and those around us in our team? Can we see and talk about the paradoxes in the team's decisions?</p>  <p>Neuro, race and gender diversity are critical for success, understanding our natural positions and compromises makes sense. Knowing the delta between our team is crucial.</p>  <p>Being able to talk to and understand all positions means we will be in a less divided and divisional world.</p>  <br><p>Next questions for me</p>  <p>Does this model allow me to plot products and companies to determine alignment?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ethics; is it our ability to deal with compromise and conflict and find a position we find acceptable?</p>  <br><p>@tonyfish&nbsp; Jan 2021</p><br>

<p>My superpower has always been finding new uses for old tech. In the late 90s I dusted off the venerable NNTP server, which had been the backbone of the Usenet, and turned it into my team’s Slack. In the late 2000s I used iCalendar to make citywide event calendars. In the late 2010s I went deep into SQL.</p>
<p>It’s always intensely pragmatic. But also, I can’t deny, whimsical.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I offer you the public pay phone at the Pinnacles Visitor Center. I stayed in that campground on a road trip just before the election. Given the tense political and epidemiological situation, I’d promised to message home regularly. There was no cell service in the park so I headed over to the office. It was closed, so I sat on the bench and connected to their WiFi. Or tried to. You could connect, sometimes, but you couldn’t move any data. The router was clearly in need of a reboot.</p>
<p>The only option left was the public phone. I can’t remember the last time I used one. Most people alive today have, perhaps, never used one. But there it was, so I gave it a shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time, you could pick up the handset, dial 0 for operator, and place a so-called collect (charge-reversed) call. Now dialing 0 gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>The instructions taped to the phone (in the 90s I’m guessing) say you can call an 800 number, or use a calling card. I remember calling cards, I had one once. Not a thing lately.</p>
<p>And then there was this: “Dial 611 for help.”</p>
<p>Me: 611</p>
<p>611: Hello, this is Steve.</p>
<p>Me: I’m at the Pinnacles Visitor Center trying to send a message.</p>
<p>Steve: Use the WiFi.</p>
<p>Me: I can’t, it’s broken.</p>
<p>Steve: Huh, that’s interesting. Let me see if I can reboot the router.</p>
<p>And he did. So there you have it. The public phone still provides a valuable service. Its mission has evolved over the years. Nowadays, it exists to summon Steve the IT guy who can fix the WiFi by turning it off and on again. </p>
<p>Works like a charm!</p>

  <p>Summary: The self-sovereign internet, a secure overlay on the internet, provides the same capacity to produce change by numerous, unaffiliated and uncoordinated actors as the internet itself. The generative nature of the self-sovereign internet is underpinned by the same kind of properties that make the internet what it is, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow.</p>



<p>
    This is part one of a two part series on the generativity of SSI technologies. This article explores the properties of the self-sovereign internet and makes the case that they justify its generativity claims. The second part will explore the generativity of verifiable credential exchange, the essence of self-sovereign identity. 
</p>

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zitrain wrote a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%2520Internet.pdf">compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs</a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  denotes  a  technologyâs  overall  capacity  to  produce  unprompted  change  driven  by  large,  varied,  and  uncoordinated  audiences.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Zittrain masterfully describes the extreme generativity of the internet and its attached PCs, explains why openness of both the network and the attached computers is so important, discusses threats to the generativity nature of the internet, and proposes ways that the internet can remain generative while addressing some of those threats. While the purpose of this article is not to review Zittrain's paper in detail, I recommend you take some time to explore it.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a>  use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  is  a  function  of  a  technologyâs  capacity  for  leverage  across  a  range  of  tasks,  adaptability  to  a  range  of  different  tasks,  ease  of mastery, and accessibility.</blockquote>

<p>
This sentence sets forth four important criteria for generativity:
</p>
 
     Capacity for Leverage—generative technology makes difficult jobs easier—sometimes possible. Leverage is measured by the capacity of a device to reduce effort. 
     
     Adaptability—generative technology can be applied to a wide variety of uses with little or no modification. Where leverage speaks to a technology's depth, adaptability speaks to its breadth. Many very useful devices (e.g. airplanes, saws, and pencils) are nevertheless fairly narrow in their scope and application. 
     
     Ease of Mastery—generative technology is easy to adopt and adapt to new uses. Many billions of people use a PC (or mobile device) to perform tasks important to them without significant skill. As they become more proficient in its use, they can apply it to even more tasks. 
     
     Accessibility—generative technology is easy to come by and access. Access is a function of cost, deployment, regulation, monopoly power, secrecy, and anything else which introduces artificial scarcity. 
     
 

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity metasystem I've written about in the past</a> is composed of several layers that provide its unique functionality. This article uses Zittrain's framework, outlined above, to explore the generativity of what I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">called the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, the second layer in the stack shown in Firgure 1. A future article will discuss the generativity of credential exchange at layer three. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, I make the case that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">network of relationships created by the exchange of decentralized identifiers</a> (layer 2 in Figure 1) forms a new, more secure layer on the internet. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml#properties">protocological properties of DIDComm</a> make that layer especially useful and flexible, mirroring the internet itself.
</p>

<p>
    This kind of "layer" is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (HTTPS) is a secure overlay, but it is incomplete because it's not symmetrical. Furthermore, it's relatively inflexible because it overlays a network layer using a client-server protocol1.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02143v12.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) Design</a>, Sam Smith makes the following important point about secure overlay networks:
</p>

<blockquote>The important essential feature of an identity system security overlay is that it binds together controllers, identifiers, and key-pairs. A sender controller is exclusively bound to the public key of a (public, private) key-pair. The public key is exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The sender controller is also exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The strength of such an identity system based security overlay is derived from the security supporting these bindings.
 From <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02143v12.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) Design</a><br>Referenced 2020-12-21T11:08:57-0700
 </blockquote>

<p>
    Figure 2 shows the bindings between these three components of the secure overlay.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers that provide the basis for a secure overlay network.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>, I discuss the strength of these critical bindings in various identity system architectures. The key point for this discussion is that the peer-to-peer network created by peer DID exchanges constitute an overlay with an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic architecture</a>, providing not only the strongest possible bindings between the controller, identifiers, and authentication factors (public key), but also not needing an external trust basis (like a ledger) because they are self-certifying.
</p>

<p>
    DIDs allow us to create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">cryptographic relationships</a>, solving significant key management problems that have plagued asymmetric cryptography since it's inception. Consequently, regular people can use a general purpose secure overlay network based on DIDs. The DID network that is created when people use these relationships provides a protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm</a>, that is every bit as flexible and useful as is TCP/IP.
</p>


<p>
    Consequently, communications over a DIDComm-enabled peer-to-peer network are as generative as the internet itself. Thus, the secure overlay network formed by DIDComm connections represents a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign</a> internet, emulating the underlying internet's peer-to-peer messaging in a way that is both secure and trustworthy2 without the need for external third parties3.
</p>


<a></a>
 Properties of the Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">World of Ends</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a> enumerate the internet's three virtues: 
</p>

 
     No one owns it. 
     Everyone can use it. 
     Anyone can improve it. 
 

<p>
    These virtues apply to the self-sovereign internet as well. As a result, the self-sovereign internet displays important properties that support it's generativity.  Here are the most important:
</p>

<p>
    Decentralized—decentralization <a>follows directly from the fact that no one owns it</a>. This is the primary criterion for judging the degree of decentralization in a system. 
</p>

<p>
    Heterarchical—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy">heterarchy</a> is a "system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways." Nodes in a DIDComm-based network  relate to each other as peers. This is a heterarchy; there is no inherent ranking of nodes in the architecture of the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Interoperable—regardless of what providers or systems we use to connect to the self-sovereign internet, we can interact with any other principles who are using it so long as they follow protocol4. 
</p>


<p>
    Substitutable—The DIDComm protocol defines how systems that use it must behave to achieve interoperability. That means that anyone who understands the protocol can write software that uses DIDComm. Interoperability ensure that we can operate using a choice of software, hardware, and services without fear of being locked into a proprietary choice. Usable substitutes provide choice and freedom. 
</p>

<p>
    Reliable and Censorship Resistant—people, businesses, and others must be able to use the secure overlay network without worrying that it will go down, stop working, go up in price, or get taken over by someone who would do it and those who use it harm. This is larger than mere technical trust that a system will be available and extends to the issue of censorship.
</p>

<p>
    Non-proprietary and Open—no one has the power to change the self-sovereign internet by fiat. Furthermore, it can't go out of business and stop operation because its maintenance and operation are distributed instead of being centralized in the hands of a single organization. Because the self-sovereign internet is an agreement rather than a technology or system, it will continue to work. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Generativity of the Self-Sovereign Internet 
<p>
    Applying Zittrain's framework for evaluating generativity is instructive for understanding the generative properties of the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<a></a>
 Capacity for Leverage 

<p>
    In Zittrain's words, leverage is the extent to which an object "enables valuable accomplishments that otherwise would be either impossible or not worth the effort to achieve."  Leverage multiplies effort, reducing the time and cost necessary to innovate new capabilities and features.  Like the internet, DIDComm's extensibility through protocols enables the creation of special-purpose networks and data distribution services on top of it. By providing a secure, stable, trustworthy platform for these services, DIDComm-based networks reduce the effort and cost associated with these innovations.
</p>

<p>
    Like a modern operating system's application programming interface (API), DIDComm provides a standardized platform supporting message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. Programmers get the benefits of a trusted message system without need for expensive and difficult development. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Adaptability 

<p>
    Adaptability can refer to a technology's ability to be used for multiple activities without change as well as its capacity for modification in service of new use cases. Adaptability is orthogonal to capacity for leverage. An airplane, for example, offers incredible leverage, allowing goods and people to be transported over long distances quickly. But airplanes are neither useful in activities outside transportation or easily modified for different uses. A technology that supports hundreds of use cases is more generative than one that is useful in only a few.
</p>

<p>
    Like TCP/IP, DIDComm makes few assumptions about how the secure messaging layer will be used. Thus the network formed by the nodes in a DIDComm network can be adapted to any number of applications. Moreover, because a DIDComm-based network is decentralized and self-certifying, it is inherently scalable for many uses.
</p>

<a></a>
 Ease of Mastery 

<p>
    Ease of use refers to the ability of a technology to be easily and broadly adapted and adopted. The secure, trustworthy platform of the self-sovereign internet allows developers to create applications without worrying about the intricacies of the underlying cryptography or key management.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, because of its standard interface and protocol, DIDComm-based networks can present users with a consistent user experience that reduces the skill needed to establish and use connections. Just like a browser presents a consistent user experience on the web, a DIDComm agent can present users with a consistent user experience for basic messaging, as well as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">specialized operations that run over the basic messaging system</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Of special note is key management, which has been the Achilles heal of previous attempts at secure overlay networks for the internet. Because of the nature of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a>, identifiers are separated from the public key, allowing the keys to be rotated when needed without also needing to refresh the identifier. This greatly reduces the need for people to manage or even see keys. People focus on the relationships and the underlying software manages the keys.5
</p>

<a></a>
 Accessibility 

<p>
    Accessible technologies are easy to acquire, inexpensive, and resistant to censorship. DIDComm's accessibility is a product of its decentralized and self-certifying nature. Protocols and implementing software are freely available to anyone without intellectual property encumbrances. Multiple vendors, and even open-source tools can easily use DIDComm. No central gatekeeper or any other third party is necessary to initiate a DIDComm connection in service of a digital relationship. Moreover, because no specific third parties are necessary, censorship of use is difficult. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Conclusion 


<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet exhibits a number of important properties. The generativity of the self-sovereign internet depends on those properties. The true value of the self-sovereign internet is that it provides an leveragable, adaptable, usable, accessible, and stable platform upon which others can innovate. 
</p>


 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Implementing general-purpose messaging on HTTP is not straightforward, especially when combined with non-routable IP addresses for many clients. On the other hand, simulating client-server interactions on a general-purpose messaging protocol is easy. 
     
     I'm using "trust" in the cryptographic sense, not in the reputational sense.  Cryptography allows us to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">trust the fidelity of the communication</a> but not its content. 
     Admittedly, the secure overlay is running on top of a network with a number of third parties, some benign and others not. Part of the challenge of engineering a functional secure overlay with self-sovereignty it mitigating the effects that these third parties can have within the self-sovereign internet. 
     
     Interoperability is, of course, more complicated than merely following the protocols. Daniel Hardman does an excellent job of discussing this for verifiable credentials (a protocol that runs over DIDComm), in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">Getting to Practical Interop With Verifiable Credentials</a>.
     
     More details about some of the ways software can greatly reduce the burden of key management when things go wrong can be found in <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/lost-phone/">What If I Lose My Phone?</a> by Daniel Hardman.

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm. The work is happening in places like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, to name a&nbsp;few.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">Learn Concepts: Web of Trust 101</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>If you've been putting off setting aside some time to learn about OAuth, now is your chance!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've helped thousands of developers learn about OAuth by hosting live workshops in person, online events through O'Reilly and Okta, as well as by publishing videos on YouTube! I'm super thrilled to announce that I just finished packaging up the workshop and have launched it as a new course, "<a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0</a>"!</p>

<p>The course is 3.5 hours of video content, quizzes, as well as interactive exercises with a guided learning tool to get you quickly up to speed on OAuth, OpenID Connect, PKCE, best practices, and tips for protecting APIs with OAuth.</p>

<p>The course is <a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">available now on Udemy</a>, and if your company has a Udemy for Business subscription you can find it there as well! If you download the app, you can even sync the video course to a mobile device to watch everything offline!</p>

<p><a href="http://oauth.wtf/course"></a></p>

<p>The exercises in the course will walk you through the various OAuth flows to set up an OAuth server, get an access token, use a refresh token, and learn the user's name and email with OpenID Connect. You can see a sneak peek of the tool that interactively helps you debug your apps at <a href="https://oauth.school/">oauth.school</a>.</p>

 Free OAuth Videos 

<p>I've also got a bunch of videos about OAuth available on YouTube for you to watch at any time! Take a look at my <a href="https://oauth.net/videos/">curated playlist of videos</a> where you'll find everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td00HpMI3Q8">live sketch notes</a> of a conversation about PKCE and OAuth security, to a description of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espX8qKjywI">OAuth phishing</a>, to&nbsp;details on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHzERullHe8">why you shouldn't use the implicit flow</a>.</p>

FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) is quickly emerging as an important interoperability standard that enables users to select and manage an authenticator of their own (security keys, or built-in platform authenticators, such as a mobile device) that works with their web browser of choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, etc.) for secure access to any websites or applications that support the WebAuthn standard."<br><br>"Oracle is happy to announce the general availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn for our cloud identity service. This means that websites and applications that are protected by Oracle can enable their audience of users to authenticate with FIDO2 authenticators for multi-factor authentication (MFA) as well as passwordless authentication. This simplifies the user experience and may reduce the number of authenticators that users need to access the variety of web applications they interact with on a regular basis. Ultimately, this gives users more choice, more control, and a frictionless user experience.</p><p>Read more on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/">Oracle Cloud Security Blog</a> &gt; <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/oracle-strengthens-interoperability-with-fido2-webauthn-support-for-cloud-identity">Oracle Strengthens Interoperability and User Experience with General Availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn Support for Cloud Identity</a>.</p>

<p>The trust infrastructure is concerned with the question of how and why the presented information can be trusted. It defines the rules for all stakeholders and enables legally binding relationships with the combination of governance frameworks, which are built on top of trust frameworks.</p><p>But before we dive deeper into the part of the trust infrastructure, we need to understand the core components and the different types of identity architecture first.</p> Core components of identity architecture <p>There are three core components within an identity system, which in general mainly manage relationships. These are identifiers enabling the means for “remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship” <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">as explained by Phil Windley</a>. In the case of SSI, these are decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which are created by a controller, which might be a person, organization or software system. Controllers can use different authentication factors, which according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the level of assurance for eIDAS (CEF DIGITAL)</a>, can be possession-based factors (e.g. hardware), knowledge-based factors (e.g. keys or passwords) or inherent factors (e.g. biometrics like a fingerprint). Oftentimes a combination of different authentication factors is used to demonstrate the authority of an identifier.</p>Architectural types of identity systems; Image adapted, original by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil&nbsp;Windley</a><p>Phil Windley distinguishes between administrative, algorithmic and autonomic systems, which are illustrated in the image above. We are of course quite familiar with administrative systems such as e-mail, mobile or social network services. Algorithmic systems in contrast leverage some sort of distributed ledger as verified data registry to register a public key / decentralized identifier on a ledger. This gives the controller more sovereignty of the identifier among other perks. However, due to privacy concerns, keys or identifiers of individuals should not be stored on a publicly accessible database. Hence, autonomic identity architecture was developed to enable the “controller to use her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably [sic] sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log” as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil Windley states</a>. Current SSI implementations tend to use a combination of algorithmic and autonomic architecture.</p> Governance frameworks <p>The <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/governance.html">Business Dictionary</a> defines governance as the “establishment of policies, and continuous monitoring of their proper implementation, by the members of the governing body.” It includes the mechanisms required to balance powers and defines their primary duties to enhance the prosperity and viability of the organization. The objective for governance entities is to ensure the alignment of involved stakeholders, the definition of the implementation and the processes and use-cases executed on top of it. The purpose of a governance framework is to define the different stakeholders, determine their rights and duties as well as defining the policies under which the network is operated. Therefore, it serves as a legal foundation for the operation of the particular network. It consists of several legal documents, which are published by the governing authority.</p><p>The governance of the network (the verifiable data registry also referred to as ledger or trust anchor) itself is only a small part of the total governance required. According to the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) foundation</a> there are four layers, which require an adapted governance framework matching the needs of the particular layer.</p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Stack; Image source: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a><p>As illustrated in the figure above, the Trust over IP stack is not only separated in layers, but also in technical and governance stacks within the layers. The stack is indented to provide the certainty for higher levels that the underlying ones can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Layer one includes the verifiable data registries, which can be implemented on different technology frameworks. The Sovrin Foundation is an example of a governance authority, which published a <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-%20content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V2.pdf">governance framework for layer one</a>. Other public utilities include <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and <a href="https://bedrockconsortium.org/">Bedrock</a> among others. While the mentioned networks align their efforts particularly to the ToIP stack there are countless others, which can be used as a public utility as the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID specification registry</a> discloses. These range from generic public permissionless networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin to networks with permissioned write access, which serve a particular use-case.</p><p>Tim Bouma (Senior policy analyst for identity management at the treasury board secretariat of Canada) does not see the need of the government to build and operate a verifiable data registry and highlights the importance of a plurality of operators. However, he points out that the involvement and participation of governments is crucial in defining how the infrastructure is used and relied on as stated in a <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">personal interview</a>.</p>DID methods as specified in the W3C DID specification registry.<p>The second layer describes the communication between agents. Within the ToIP stack, this communication is indented to be executed via a hybrid of an algorithmic and atomic architecture such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec">peer DIDs</a> or KERI implementations of self-certifying identifiers as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-%20identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">described by Ph.D. Samuel M. Smith</a>. This means that publicly resolvable DIDs are used for public entities and private peer DIDs for individuals. The following illustration provided by <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> provides an overview of these interactions.</p>SSI interactions and the usage of public and peer DIDs; Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a><p>However, not all SSI implementations use peer DIDs. For instance, the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/essif-the-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-4572f6875e12">ESSIF</a>-MVP1 does not currently use peer DIDs but might add them later as deemed appropriate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Specification+%282%29+-+DID+Modelling">technical specification of DID modelling</a>. Hence, the same type of DID is used for both issuer and holder. The governing authority of layer two is highly dependent on the communication protocols used by the implementation in question. For implementations, which use peer DIDs according to the DIDcomm protocol the governing entity is the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDcomm working group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Both layer one and layer two define technical or rather cryptographic trust, in contrast to layer three and four, which define human&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Layer three protocols support the exchange of data such as verified credentials with different types of signatures, which enable a holder to create verifiable presentations as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md">ToIP Aries-RFC</a>. It states that one of the goals of the ToIP Foundation is “to standardize all supported credential exchange protocols so that any ToIP-compatible agent, wallet, and secure data store can work with any other agent, wallet, and secure data store.” An issuer can issue any set of claims to any holder, which can then prove them to any verifier. The verifier can decide, which issuers and which claims it&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Layer four of the stack defines the rules for a particular digital trust ecosystem such as healthcare, finance, food products, education etc. These are led by a governance authority, which already exists or is established for this particular purpose. It consists of a variety of different stakeholders such as business entities, government agencies, individuals or other interested parties. These ecosystem frameworks also define the semantics of verified credentials. The semantic of a verified credential defines, which attributes are part of it and their meaning in the particular context. If you want to join an existing ecosystem or want to know more about their work you can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">public ToIP confluence documentary hub&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Trust frameworks <p>A trust framework sets the overall legal framework for digital interactions. These trust frameworks are technology agnostic and are uniquely adapted to the jurisdiction they serve. They set the rules for the recognition of electronic identification and authentication and specify the requirements to achieve a certain level of assurance (LoA).</p><p>The combination of the different governance frameworks as illustrated in the ToIP stack is sometimes also referred to as trust framework. However, jurisdictions have their own requirements for electronic authentication, which serve as the underlying trust framework. In the case of Europe, the eIDAS regulation clearly defines the requirements for authentication factors to achieve a certain level of assurance. For instance, to achieve the LoA substantial, two factors are necessary. According to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview%20=%2F40044784%2F40044786%2FGuidance+on+Levels+of+Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the LoA</a> published by the CEF Digital, one out of the two factors needs to be&nbsp;either:</p><blockquote>I) a presentation of an identity document or <br>II) verification of the possession of evidence representing the claimed identity recognized by a member state or <br>III) a previous procedure executed by the same member state not related to the issuance of electronic identification, which provides the equivalent assurance or <br>IV) presenting a valid notified electronic identification mean with the LoA substantial or&nbsp;high.</blockquote><p>While these requirements can in theory also be defined in a governance framework, the incorporation of such requirements into statutory law facilitates the creation and enforcement of legally binding relationships. Hence, existing statutory law (or case-law depending on the jurisdiction) needs to be incorporated by different governance frameworks to achieve a holistic approach and enforce legal liability.</p><p>According to Tim Bouma as one of the main contributor to the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) these frameworks intertwine and complement each other <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">as stated in a personal interview</a>. He suggests that policymakers have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts to evaluate if they have the right concepts to build out a suitable framework and regulation. The PCTF “is not a ‘standard’ as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria. It’s a tool to help assess a digital identity program that puts into effect the relevant legislation, policy, regulation, and agreements between parties.” <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_1/PSP-PCTF-V1.1-Consultation-Draft.pdf">PCTF&nbsp;V1.1</a></p><p>While the eIDAS regulation itself aims to be technology agnostic there are some aspects, which complicate the adherence of the regulation for SSI implementations. However, this is a topic for its own article. In the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2020-04/SSI_eIDAS_legal_report_final_0.pdf">eIDAS SSI legal report</a>, Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo describes the potential shift of the eIDAS regulation as trust framework on Page 22 as followed: „Adopting the SSI principles imply, generally speaking, an increased complexity in trust management and a shifting from hierarchical or federated trust assurance frameworks (…) to network-based socio- reputational trust models or accumulative trust assurance frameworks that use quantifiable methods to aggregate trust on claims and digital identities.” Hence, we can already observe the suggestions and considerations to adapt the regulation to suit new innovative solutions.</p> Key takeaways:   Governance frameworks and trust frameworks need to be combined to form a holistic approach.  Governance frameworks of SSI implementations need to respect the requirements and specifications of trust frameworks of the jurisdiction in which use-cases with regulatory obligations are carried&nbsp;out.  Regulators need to evaluate existing regulations concerning electronic identification and authentication and their suitability with new identity architecture.  Governments should engage with the public sector to collaboratively explore the requirements for a legally binding trust infrastructure.  <p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>My friend <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/">Amy Guy</a> is
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">running for election</a>
on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C TAG</a>
(Technical Architecture Group).
The TAG is an unusual group that sets a lot of the direction of the
future of standards that you and I use everyday on the web.
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">Read their statement on running</a>,
and if you can, ie if you're one of those unusual people labeled
as "AC Representative", please consider
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/tagelect-2020/">voting for them</a>.
(Due to the nature of the W3C's organizational and funding structure,
only paying W3C Members tend to qualify... if you know you're working
for an organization that has paying membership to the W3C, find out
who the AC rep is and strongly encourage them to vote for Amy.)</p>
<p>So, why vote for Amy?
Quite simply, they're running on a platform of putting the needs of
users first.
Despite all the good intents and ambitions of those who have done
founding work in these spaces, this perspective tends to get
increasingly pushed to the wayside as engineers are pressured to shift
their focus on the needs of their immediate employers and large
implementors.
I'm not saying that's bad; sometimes this even does help advance the
interest of users too, but... well we all know the ways in which it
can end up not doing so.
And I don't know about you, but the internet and the web have felt an
awful lot at times like they've been slipping from those early ideals.
Amy's platform shares in a growing zeitgeist (sadly, still in the
wispiest of stages) of thinking and reframing from the perspective of
user empowerment, privacy, safety, agency, autonomy.
Amy's platform reminds me of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8890">RFC 8890: The Internet Is For End Users</a>.
That's a perspective shift we desperately need right now... for the
internet and the web both.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for the philosophical-alignment angle.
But what about the "Technical" letter in TAG?
Amy's standing there is rock-solid.
And I know because I've had the pleasure of working side-by-side
with Amy on several standards (including
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, of which we are
co-authors.</p>
<p>Several times I watched with amazement as Amy and I talked about some
changes we thought were necessary and Amy just got in the zone, this
look of intense hyperfocus (really, someone should record the Amy Spec
Editing Zone sometime, it's quite a thing to see), and they refactored
huge chunks of the spec to match our discussion.
And Amy knows, and deeply cares, about so many aspects of the W3C's
organization and structure.</p>
<p>So, if you can vote for, or know how to get your organization to vote
for, an AC rep... well, I mean do what you want I guess, but if you
want someone who will help... for great justice, vote Amy Guy to the
W3C TAG!</p>

   <p></p><p>I have been pondering on these topics for a while&nbsp; “Can AI have feelings?”&nbsp; “Should AI have emotion?”&nbsp; What would it mean for AI to be curious? <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/05/in-context-of-ai-can-dog-feel.html">I posted, can a dog feel disappointment?</a> Exploring our attachment to the projection of feelings. &nbsp; I have written an executive brief about how a “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2019/09/as-executive-investor-or-board-member.html">board should frame AI” here</a>.</p><p>The majority of the debates/ arguments I read and hear centre on either creating the algorithms for the machine to know what we know or for the data to be in a form that allows the machine to learn from us.&nbsp; A key point in all the debates is that we (humanity) should control and it should look like us. The framing of a general rule for emotional AI is that it mimics us. However, I want to come at AI feelings from a different perspective based on my own experience, one where AI creates feelings by its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>I am on several neurodiverse scales; this means my mind is wired differently, and I am so pleased it is. My unique wiring gives me the edge in innovation, creativity, connecting diverse topics, sense-making and deep-insights.&nbsp; For thirty year,s I have remained working on concepts that become the mainstream ten years later.</p><p>As a specific area to develop my own view about AI and what it (the AI) should feel, I am running with an easy to identify with topic, empathy. &nbsp; Empathy is not something that comes naturally to me, and therefore I have had to learn it, it has been taught, and I am still not great at it.&nbsp; For the vast majority of humans, I am sure it is built-in.&nbsp; Now that might mean that those who have it built in just know how to learn it or that it really is built-in, but right now we don’t know.&nbsp; However, along with other humans, I find face-recognition (<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/face-blindness/">face blindness</a>) very hard. As a community, we learn coping strategies, along with spelling, language and the correct emotional response - empathy.&nbsp; My Twitter bio says that “I am highly skilled at being inappropriately optimistic,” which means I know don’t always read empathy very well.&nbsp; For me, empathy is a very definitely a learnt response; if I had not learnt it, I expect life might be very different.</p><p>Here is the point, now you know I have had to learn empathy specifically, what does it mean?&nbsp; Does it mean I am a robot or a machine? Does it mean I am less trustworthy?&nbsp; Is my empathy less valued than someone else’s empathy? Am I less human?</p><p>On an AI call the other day, I was articulating this personal story in response to the idea that all humans know how to respond and if we teach or create the ability for a machine to learn empathy it can never be human (a baseline response).&nbsp; My point was how it is the machine learning any different to me. Indeed we all have to learn something.&nbsp; However, we somehow feel that certain emotions and characteristics are natural and not learnt/ taught behaviours - they are not.&nbsp; Once we grasp this we have a real problem as our easy response to learnt response is genuine, we have removed a big part of the rejection of the concept from the debate, and we have to re-ask can a machine feel empathy or curious?</p><p>We have a stack of words allowing humans to articulate both feeling and emotions, the former being fast and driven by the chemistry of enzymes, proteins and hormones and the latter being the higher-order response created in the mind and nerves (brain chemistry). We try to separate these functions, but in reality, they are all linked in a complex web with our DNA, last meal, illness, inflation, time, experience, memory and microbiome to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>We are human and are built on a base of carbon.&nbsp; There is evidence why carbon was selected naturally as the nature of the bonds makes it uniquely stable and reactive. Carbon is fantastic as in bonding with other elements allowing electronics to move, which enabled the creation energy (ATP), signalling and life in the form we know it.&nbsp; However, carbon is a chemical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate">substrate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s phrase the question as “Can carbon can be curious?&nbsp; Can carbon have empathy?&nbsp; Can carbon have feelings? Can carbon have emotions?&nbsp; What carbon understands as curious, is unique to carbon, what carbon thinks is empathy, is unique to carbon. What carbon grasps as emotion, is unique to carbon. We have created a language to articulate these concepts to each other, we have labelled them, but they are uniquely carbon-based.&nbsp; They may even be uniquely species-based.</p><p>AI will be built on a substrate, it will most likely not be carbon, but it will be an element that has the right properties. Have to confess I am not really sure what they are right now. Here is the point.&nbsp; AI will have empathy; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will have curiosity; it will not be ours. AI will have emotions; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will likely use different words to describe what is means by being curious and will not parallel or map to our view.&nbsp; If it is learnt, does it matter - I had to learn, and that doesn’t make me less human!</p><p>Our carbon form defines to be alive as to use reproduction and adaption such that our species can escape death, which is a fundamental limitation of our carbon structure. Because of this requirement to escape death, what we think is curious is wrapped up in the same framing.&nbsp; An AI built on a different substrate that does not have to escape death as it has worked out how to secure power. This is 101 of asking an AI to do anything as it needs to ensure it can do it, and that requires energy.&nbsp; Therefore the AI will have a different set of criteria as not bound by escaping death and therefore what it thinks is curious will not be aligned to our framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We do this a lot.&nbsp; With other living things, humans, pets and even our Gods, we think they think like us that they have the same ideas and concepts of empathy, justice, value, purpose and love.&nbsp; Our limits of emotional concepts mean we cannot see past the paradox they create because we are limited to our own framing and understanding.&nbsp; We have to drop the restrictions and boundaries of an idea that AI will replicate us, our language, our knowledge, our methods or our approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AI will be “Different Intelligence” and because it leant not from us buy by itself, does that make it less intelligent?&nbsp;</p><br>

<p>今年もお世話になった皆様へ。 2020年は新型コロナ下の独立開業となり、どうなることかと思いましたが、なんとか年末を迎えることができました。ひとえに皆様のおかげでございます。未だにコロナが猛威を振るう中、ご挨拶の曲として何を選ぶかだいぶ思い悩みましたが、皆様に心安らかに新年をむかえていただきたく、J.S.バッハの「羊は安らかに草を食み」を選びました。 この曲は、1713年にバッハがザクセン=ワイセンベルク公クリスチャンの31歳の誕生祝いのために書いた曲で、「狩りのカンタータ」BWV 208 の第9曲にあたります。日本ではNHKラジオ番組『朝のバロック』のテーマ曲だったのでご存知の方も多いでしょう。19世紀のバッハ・リバイバル以来様々なアレンジで楽しまれていますが、元来はソプラノと２台のリコーダーと通奏低音という、衝撃的にシンプルなアレンジを施されたアリアです。 歌詞はこんな感じです。 羊飼いが上手く守るとき、 羊は安らかに草を食む。 指導者が善政を敷くとき、 人々も安寧に過ごし、 国々に幸せをもたらす。 激動の歳の瀬、日米ともにあらたなリーダーを迎えるなか、神の子羊の生誕祭を前にお届けするのにこれ以上ふさわしい曲があるでしょうか。 今回の演奏は、ソプラノパートをフルート(Altus 1407RE)、リコーダパートと通奏低音をピアノ(Yamaha C2X Chippendale)、加えて通奏低音としてスピネット（東海スピネット）・マリンバ（Korogi LV2400CC）が参加する四重奏によってお届けします。いずれも美しい楽器で、最後に４台の楽器全部が今年にふさわしい形でお目見えしますので、ぜひおわりまで見ていただければと思います。 このビデオが皆様に、安らかなひとときをお届けできますように。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/12/4766/">季節のご挨拶〜J.

If they frame a story in a familiar way you are going to accept their tried and tested approach.&nbsp; You have accepted that the old worked and was true so applying it again must make sense. &nbsp; This saves brain energy and learning time and it is why we love heuristics.&nbsp; We have outsourced thinking and just accept it without considering.  <br> <p></p><p></p><br><p>However,&nbsp; this overly simplistic movement from one level to another level should be reconsidered in a wider systems approach where one can look at the order of the response (first, second, third and higher)&nbsp; Below is a graph showing the different order of responses to an input stimulus to force a change in the output to a new level. &nbsp; The black line is overdamped and takes a long time to get to the new level (normal.)&nbsp; The green line is the fastest with no over-shot.&nbsp; The red is faster but has a small overshot and needs correction.

I am not sure that their old model works with with the new oscillating response system we have right now.&nbsp; @Gartner &amp; @McKinsey it might be time to rethink the model and please can we aim for a better normal not a new normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Monday, December 14th the 18th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* was held with a presentation from Jason Burnett, Director of Products from Digital Trust.  Digital Trust is working on the new GADI specification and is a central member of The DID Alliance.</p><p>The DID Alliance digital identity infrastructure  leverages existing FIDO Alliance infrastructure and processes combined with elements of decentralized technologies (DLTs and DIDs).  The GADI architecture is a federated identity ecosystem where Digital Address Platforms (DAPs).  The DAPs are run by known trusted identity providers and perform the Trust Anchors role,  and issue Digital Addresses to individuals.   The ecosystem uses a permissioned DLT model with only known trusted entities can perform the role of Trust Anchor.</p><p>The Digital Address is used as unique individual identifier that is controlled by the GADI ecosystem.   This is the fundamental difference in identity philosophy between GADI and SSI based systems.  The Digital Address is a lifetime connected identifier and under the control of the DAP.  The version 1.0 of the GADI specification is currently underway with a release expected in Q1 of 2021. </p><p>The DID Alliance was founded in late 2018 with a strong representation of members in South Korea and CVS/Aetna in the United States.  Digital Trust is the technology partner of The DID Alliance that is designing and implementing the GADI specification and reference architecture.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/491079655">https://vimeo.com/491079655</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:04:17 - Jason Burnett - Digital Trust</p>  <p>0:06:38 - The DID Alliance Core Principles</p>  <p>0:18:57 - DAP Ecosystem</p>  <p>0:22:53 - Components of GADI Digital Identity</p>  <p>0:34:35 - Questions</p>  <p>0:50:00 - Demo</p>  <p>1:02:00 - Questions</p>  <p>1:11:18 - Wrap-up</p>  <p></p><p>For more information on:</p>  <p>The DID Alliance: <a href="https://www.didalliance.org/">https://www.didalliance.org/</a></p>  <p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events.

  This past spring, I noticed that our 20 year-old wooden shake roof needed serious work. The roof condition, combined with all of the recent wildfire activity in California, prompted us to replace the entire roof with asphalt shingles. This, of course, necessitated the removal and replacement of the solar panels we had installed in 2006. […]

<p>This past spring, I noticed that our 20 year-old wooden shake roof needed serious work. The roof condition, combined with all of the recent wildfire activity in California, prompted us to replace the entire roof with asphalt shingles. This, of course, necessitated the removal and replacement of the solar <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/04/30/photovoltaic-part-1/">panels we had installed in 2006</a>.</p>



<p>In anticipation of doing this, we consulted with our local contractor, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/solar-lightworkers-inc-capitola">Solar Lightworkers</a>, to see what might be done to update the system as well as to add a bit of extra capacity since we now have an electric car. Photovoltaic technology has advanced quite a bit in the past 14 years, so we wanted to take as much advantage of that as possible while reusing components from our existing system. As described <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/08/photovoltaic-part-2-specifications-and-installation/">earlier</a>, our system had consisted of 24 200-watt Sanyo panels, with half of the panels facing south and half facing west. Because these two arrays peaked at different times of day, we had two inverters to optimize the output of each array.</p>



 Design 



 <a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/inverter.png"></a>SolarEdge inverter 



<p>Mark from Solar Lightworkers strongly recommended a <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/">SolarEdge</a> inverter that uses <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/power-optimizer#/">optimizers</a> to  minimize the impact of shading of some of the panels on the overall system output. This also compensates for the fact that different panels have maximum output at different times of day. As a result, a single inverter is sufficient for our new system. We also added four 360-watt LG panels to increase our capacity. This SolarEdge inverter is also capable of battery backup, but we haven’t opted into that yet.</p>



<p>Since our original installation, building codes had changed a bit requiring that the panels be installed at least 3 feet below the peak of the roof. This made us rethink the layout of the existing panels. When we did the original installation, we were concerned about the aesthetics of the panels on the front of the house. But since that time, so many other houses in our area have installed solar panels that we weren’t as concerned about appearance of panels on the front (south) side of the house. We still have some panels facing west, because they seem to be nearly as efficient economically as those facing west due to time-of-use electricity pricing.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/dsc01980.jpg"></a>South-facing solar panels



 Data Collection 



<p>I have enjoyed collecting data from our photovoltaic system, and have done so more or less continuously since the original system was installed, using a serial interface from one of my computers to the inverters. I wanted to continue that. The SolarEdge inverter comes with a variety of interfaces through which it can send data to SolarEdge’s cloud service, which I can view on their website. Wanting more detailed information, I found that they provide an API through which I can get data very comparable to what I got from the old inverters, and continue to analyze the data locally (as well as using their facilities, which are very good).</p>



<p>One of the unexpected benefits of the SolarEdge optimizers is the ability to see the performance of each panel individually. It turns out that one of the old panels had a power output almost exactly half of the others. I’m not sure how long that had been going on; perhaps since 2006. I found that the panels have a 20-year output warranty, so I contacted Panasonic, which had acquired the Sanyo product line, and filled out some paperwork and sent pictures. They sent me three very similar panels (replacing two panels with cosmetic defects as well as the one with low output) soon after. I was very happy with the service from Panasonic. Solar Lightworkers installed the new panels, and output is where it should be.</p>



 Performance 



<p>On a typical summer day with little shading, the system generated 23.7 kWh in on 8/30/2019 and 34.8 kWh (+47%) on 8/27/2020. The additional panels would account for 30% of that increase and the defective panel an additional 2%.  In the late fall, the old system generated 14.6 kWh on 11/25/2019, and the new system 22.9 kWh (+57%) on 11/26/2020. There are of course other variables, such as soot on the panels from the California wildfires this year.</p>



<p>It will take quite a while for the increased output to pay for the upgrades, of course, but much of that cost would have been incurred just as a result of the need to replace the roof. We are quite pleased with the performance of the new system.</p>

The folder with related artifacts is available <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_2">here</a>.</p><p>The remainder of this post is the content of the report, lightly edited for&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6">Medium</a>.</p> Objective of the PSP PCTF Working Group (PSP PCTF&nbsp;WG) <p>The primary objective of the PSP PCTF WG had been the development of the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PSP PCTF). This has been achieved by contributing and reviewing content, attaining the consensus of the public sector jurisdictions, and monitoring related developments that might impact the development of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p><p>The main deliverable of the PSP PCTF WG has been the PSP PCTF, the various versions of which consist of a consolidated overview document, an assessment methodology, and an assessment worksheet.</p><p>The PSP PCTF WG has also facilitated other activities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Sharing information, updates, and lessons learned from various digital identity initiatives; and  Consultation and engagement with multi-jurisdictional and international fora.   Membership <p>At its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG had 111 confirmed members on its distribution list consisting of representatives from all jurisdictions and various municipalities across Canada, as well as international participants from the Digital Nations. The working group normally met on a weekly call that averaged 20 to 30 participants.</p> Achievements <p>PSP PCTF Deliverables</p><p>The PSP PCTF Version 1.2 is now available at: <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP</a>. It should be noted that this has been the iterative product of several prior versions:</p>  April 2018: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Alpha Version — Consolidated Overview document;  July 2019: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.0 — Consolidated Overview document;  June 2020: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 — Consolidated Overview document; and  For each of these versions of the PSP PCTF, a companion PSP PCTF Assessment Worksheet consisting of approximately 400 conformance criteria.   PSP PCTF Assessments <p>The PSP PCTF was used in the following assessments conducted by the federal government to accept trusted digital identities from the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia:</p>  September 2018: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://account.alberta.ca/">MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program</a> for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Alpha Version); and  January 2020: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://id.gov.bc.ca/login/entry#start">British Columbia Services Card Program </a>for use by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">Government of Canada</a> (using the PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.0).  <p>Insights and lessons learned from the application of these PSP PCTF assessments were brought back to the PSP PCTF WG and the learnings were incorporated into subsequent versions of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p> Joint Council Briefings <p>The PSP PCTF is the result of a long-term and deep collective experience of the public sector. Efforts on the PSP PCTF began in late 2014 and have been reported regularly to the <a href="https://citizenfirst.ca/councils/joint-councils">Joint Councils</a> by the Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC) Working Group and its successor, the PSP PCTF Working Group. The following is the list of updates that are on record and are available for reference in the joint-councils-update folder (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs/joint-councils-updates">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>):</p>  February 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  October 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  February 2018 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  September 2018 — Joint Councils Update; Whitehorse Declaration and MADI&nbsp;Update;  February 2019 — Joint Councils Update;&nbsp;and  February 2020 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update.   Related Deliverables <p>In addition to the PSP PCTF itself, the following related deliverables should be&nbsp;noted:</p>  Whitehorse Declaration — a declaration of shared intent among the federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments to pursue the establishment of trustworthy digital identities for all Canadians (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/Declaration-Digital-ID-D%C3%A9claration-lidentit%C3%A9-num%C3%A9rique.pdf">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>);  IMSC Public Policy Paper — recommendations for a Pan-Canadian policy position on the question of roles and responsibilities of the public and private sector in digital identity (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/2019-09-00%20IMSC-Public-Policy-Paper.pdf">GitHub link</a>);&nbsp;and  Many historical deliverables that are too numerous to list in this report. A Public Historical Archive of deliverables and briefings, many of which pre-date the efforts of the PSP PCTF are being compiled in a folder on a best-effort basis (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>).   Other <p>It also should be noted that content from the PSP PCTF Version 1.1 was incorporated into the National Standard of Canada, CAN/CIOSC 103–1, Digital Trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals, developed by the CIO Strategy Council, and approved by the Standards Council of Canada (<a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">Website&nbsp;link</a>).</p> PSP PCTF WG Work Plan 2020–2021 <p>At the time of its dissolution, the work plan of the PSP PCTF WG was as&nbsp;follows:</p>  PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.2    A Consolidated Overview document (released on December 4th, 2020) which includes:  A revised Normative Core (containing new concepts that were developed as a result of the credentials and relationships analysis&nbsp;work);  A revised Credential Model (based on the working group discussion document); and  An incorporated Relationship Model (based on work led by&nbsp;ISED).  <p>2. An Assessment Worksheet (draft released on December 4, 2020) which contains new and revised conformance criteria for assessment purposes</p><p>3. A re-assessment of the MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Version 1.2) with planned completion by March&nbsp;2021.</p> PSP PCTF Thematic&nbsp;Issues <p>During the development of the PSP PCTF, the working group has identified several high-level thematic issues that must be addressed in order to advance the digital ecosystem.</p><p>Thematic Issue 1: Relationships (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a relationship model is required.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 2: Credentials (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a generalized credential model is required. This model should integrate traditional physical credentials and authentication credentials with the broader notion of a verifiable credential.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 3: Unregistered Organizations (Priority: High)</p><p>Currently, the scope of PSP PCTF includes all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada. There are also many kinds of unregistered organizations operating in Canada such as sole proprietorships, trade unions, co-ops, NGOs, unregistered charities, and trusts. An analysis of these unregistered organizations needs to be undertaken.</p><p>Thematic Issue 4: Informed Consent (Priority: High)</p><p>The current version of the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document does not adequately capture all the issues and nuances surrounding the topic of informed consent especially in the context of the public sector. A more rigorous exploration of this topic needs to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>Thematic Issue 5: Privacy Concerns (Priority: Medium)</p><p>In regards to the Identity Continuity and Relationship Continuity atomic processes, it has been noted that there are privacy concerns with the notion of dynamic confirmation. Further analysis based on feedback from the application of the PSP PCTF is required to determine if these atomic processes are appropriate.</p><p>Thematic Issue 6: Assessing Outsourced Atomic Processes (Priority: Medium)</p><p>The PSP PCTF does not assume that a single Issuer or Verifier is solely responsible for all of the atomic processes. An organization may choose to outsource or delegate the responsibility of an atomic process to another party. Therefore, several bodies might be involved in the PSP PCTF assessment process, focusing on different atomic processes, or different aspects (e.g., security, privacy, service delivery). It remains to be determined how such multi-actor assessments will be conducted.</p><p>Thematic Issue 7: Scope of the PSP PCTF (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been suggested that the scope of the PSP PCTF should be broadened to include academic qualifications, professional designations, etc. The PSP PCTF anticipates extensibility through the generalization of the PSP PCTF model and the potential addition of new atomic processes. Expanding the scope of the PSP PCTF into other domains needs to be&nbsp;studied.</p><p>Thematic Issue 8: Signature (Priority: Low)</p><p>The concept of signature as it is to be applied in the context of the PSP PCTF needs to be explored.</p><p>Thematic Issue 9: Foundation Name, Primary Name, Legal Name (Priority: Low)</p><p>The PSP PCTF has definitions for Foundation Name, Primary Name, and Legal Name. Since the three terms mean the same thing, a preferred term should be selected and used consistently throughout the PSP PCTF documents.</p><p>Thematic Issue 10: Additional Detail (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been noted that the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document contains insufficient detail in regards to the specific application of the PSP PCTF. The PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be supplemented with detailed guidance in a separate document.</p><p>Thematic Issue 11: Review of the Appendices (Priority: Low)</p><p>A review of the current appendices contained in the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be undertaken. Each appendix should be evaluated for its utility, applicability, and appropriateness, and a determination made as to whether it should continue to be included in the document.</p> Recommendations for Next&nbsp;Steps   Continue the development of the PSP PCTF based on the thematic issues identified above. These thematic issues may be addressed as part of a working group, or through task groups, or practice&nbsp;groups.  Continue the application of the PSP PCTF through the Assessment Process with the Provinces and Territories, with a view to incorporating learnings back into subsequent versions of the PSP PCTF, and, evolving the assessment process toward a standards-based process that has a formal certification scheme with accredited bodies and independent assessors.  Support the changes in digital identity governance to ensure that the PSP PCTF is developed and used in the public interest and is aligned with other industry and international efforts.  Establish as required, working groups, task groups, or practice groups&nbsp;for:  Ongoing development and maintenance of the PSP PCTF and related assessment processes and certification schemes;  Carrying out specific time-bound tasks or address issues. (e.g., addressing the thematic themes through discussion papers, analysis of other trust frameworks, etc.);  Testing practical applications of the PSP PCTF standards and conformance criteria through assessments and use cases;&nbsp;and  Sharing knowledge and lessons learned in relation to the application of the PSP PCTF and the assessment process.  Facilitate broader engagement using the PSP PCTF, including:  Engaging standards development organizations, domestic and international, to support the standards development and certification scheme development;  Engaging international organizations having an interest in applying or adapting the PSP PCTF for their purposes;  Collaborating with industry associations wishing to advance the aims of their membership, or their specific sector;&nbsp;and  Encouraging dialogue with other governments, either bilaterally facilitated through the federal government, or multilaterally through established bodies (e.g., UNCITRAL, the Digital Nations).   Conclusion <p>At the time of its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG was an important vehicle for ensuring public sector communication and discussion across Canada in order to cultivate a shared understanding of how identity and digital identity could be best developed for the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Much has been achieved by the working group, building on prior work going back more than a decade. However much more work remains. It is hoped that the work accomplished to date and the recommendations put forward in this report will be considered by the JEDI to support their mandate to accelerate the specific goals of the digital identity priority of the Joint Councils.</p>

<p>This sounds like nonsense probably, but has a lot of thought about it.
I have spent a lot of time in the decentralized-identity community and
the ocap communities, both of which have spent a lot of time hemming
and hawing about "What is identity?", "What is a credential or
claim?", "What is authorization?",
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Dec/0028.html">"Why is it unhygienic for identity to be your authorization system?"</a>
(that mailing list post is the most important writing about the nature
of computing I've ever written; I hope to have a cleaned up version of
the ideas out soon).</p>
<p>But that whole bit about "what is identity, is it different than an
identifier really?" etc etc etc...</p>
<p>Well, I've found one good explanation, but it's a bit silly.</p>
 Identity is a Katamari 
<p>There is a curious, surreal, delightful (and proprietary, sorry) game,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>.
It has a silly story, but the interesting thing here is the game
mechanic, involving rolling around a ball-like thing that picks up
objects and grows bigger and bigger kind of like a snowball.
It has to <a href="https://youtu.be/FQxEitzJ-H0?t=636">be seen</a> or played to
really be understood.</p>
<p>This ball-like thing is called a "Katamari Damacy", or "soul clump",
which is extra appropriate for our mental model.
As it rolls around, it picks up smaller objects and grows bigger.
The ball at the center is much like an identifier.
But over time that identifier becomes obscured, it picks up things,
which in the game are physical objects, but these metaphorically map
to "associations".</p>
<p>Our identity-katamari changes over time.  It grows and picks up
associations.  Sometimes you forget something you've picked up that's
in there, it's buried deep (but it's wiggling around in there still
and you find out about it during some conversation with your
therapist).  Over time the katamari picks up enough things that it is
obscured.  Sometimes there are collisions, you smash it into something
and some pieces fly out.  Oh well, don't worry about it.  They
probably weren't meant to be.</p>
 Language is reverse engineering 
<p>Shout out to my friend <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/">Jonathan Rees</a> for
saying something that really stuck in my brain (okay actually most
things that Rees says stick in my brain):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Language is a continuous reverse engineering effort, where both
sides are trying to figure out what the other side means."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, but its truth is the bane of ontologists and static
typists.  This doesn't mean that ontologies or static typing are
wrong, but that the notion that they're fixed is an illusion... a
useful, powerful illusion (with a great set of mathematical tools
behind it sometimes that can be used with mathematical
proofs... assuming you don't change the context), but an illusion
nonetheless.  Here are some examples that might fill out what I mean:</p>
 
 
<p>The classic example, loved by fuzzy typists everywhere: when is a
   person "bald"?  Start out with a person with a "full head" of hair.
   How many hairs must you remove for that person to be "bald"?  What
   if you start out the opposite way...  someone is bald... how many
   hairs must you add for them to become not-bald?</p>
 
 
<p>We might want to construct a precise recipe for a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassi#Mango_lassi">mango lassi</a>.
   Maybe, in fact, we believe we can create a precise typed
   definition for a mango lassi.
   But we might soon find ourselves running into trouble.  Can a vegan
   non-dairy milk be used for the Lassi?  (Is vegan non-dairy milk
   actually milk?)  Is ice cream acceptable?  Is added sugar
   necessary?  Can we use artificial mango-candy powder instead of
   mangoes?  Maybe you can hand-wave away each of these, but here's
   something much worse: what's a mango?  You might think that's
   obvious, a mango is the fruit of mangifera indica or maybe
   if you're generous fruit of anything in the mangifera genus.
   But mangoes evolved and there is some weird state where we had
   almost-a-mango and in the future we might have some new states
   which are no-longer-a-mango, but more or less we're throwing darts
   at exactly where we think those are... evolution doesn't care,
   evolution just wants to keep reproducing.</p>
 
 
<p>Meaning changes over time, and how we categorize does too.
   Once someone was explaining the <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">Web Ontology Language</a>
   (which got confused somewhere in its acronym ordering and is
   shortened to OWL (update: it's a Winnie the Pooh update, based
   on the way the Owl character spells his name... thank you Amy
   Guy for informing me of the history)).
   They said that it was great because you could clearly define what
   is and isn't allowed and terms derived from other terms, and that
   the simple and classic example is Gender, which is a binary choice
   of Male or Female.
   They paused and thought for a moment.
   "That might not be a good example anymore."</p>
 
 
<p>Even if you try to define things by their use or properties rather
   than as an individual concept, this is messy too.
   A person from two centuries ago would be confused by the metal
   cube I call a "stove" today, but you could say it does the same
   job.
   Nonetheless, if I asked you to "fetch me a stove", you would probably
   not direct me to a computer processor or a car engine, even though
   sometimes people fry an egg on both of these.</p>
 
 
<p>Multiple constructed languages (Esperanto most famously) have been
made by authors that believed that if everyone spoke the same language,
we would have world peace.
This is a beautiful idea, that conflict comes purely from
misunderstandings.
I don't think it's true, especially given how many fights I've seen
between people speaking the same language.
Nonetheless there's truth in that many fights are about a conflict
of ideas.</p>
<p>If anyone was going to achieve this though, it would be the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> community, which
actually does have a language which is syntactically unambiguous,
so you no longer have ambiguity such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">"time flies like an arrow"</a>.
Nonetheless, even this world can't escape the problem that some terms
just can't be easily pinned down, and the best example is the
<a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/jbocre:_Bear_goo">bear goo</a>
debate.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: both of us can unambiguously construct a sentence
referring to a "bear".
But when it is that bear no longer a bear?
If it is struck in the head and is killed, when in that process has it
become a decompositional "bear goo" instead?
And the answer is: there is no good answer.
Nonetheless many participants want there to be a pre-defined bear,
they want us to live in a pre-designed universe where "bear" is a clear
predicate that can be checked against, because the universe has a
clear definition of "bear" for us.</p>
<p>That doesn't exist, because bears evolved.  And more importantly, the
concept and existence a bear is emergent, cut across many different
domains, from evolution to biology to physics to linguistics.</p>
<p>Sorry, we won't achieve perfect communication, not even in Lojban.
But we can get a lot better, and set up a system with fewer stumbling
blocks for testing ideas against each other, and that is a worthwhile
goal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you and I are camping and I shout, "AAH!  A bear!
RUN!!", you and I probably don't have to stop to debate bear goo.
Rees is right that language is a reverse engineering effort, but we
tend to do a pretty good job of gaining rough consensus of what the
other side means.  Likewise, if I ask you, "Where is your stove?", you
probably won't lead me to your computer or your car.  And if you hand
me a "sugar free vegan mango lassi made with artificial mango flavor"
I might doubt its cultural authenticity, but if you then referred to
the "mango lassi" you had just handed me a moment ago, I wouldn't have
any trouble continuing the conversation.  Because we're more or less
built to contextually construct language contexts.</p>
 Language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris 
<p>Language is composed of syntax partly, but the arrangement of symbolic
terms mostly.  Or that's another way to say that the non-syntactic
elements of language are mostly there as identifiers substituted
mentally for identity and all the associations therein.</p>
<p>Back to the Katamari metaphor.  What "language is a
reverse-engineering effort" really means is that each of us are
constructing identities for identifiers mentally, rolling up katamaris
for each identifier we encounter.  But what ends up in our ball will
vary depending on our experiences and what paths we take.</p>
<p>Which really means that if each person is rolling up a separate,
personal identity-katamari for each identifier in the system, that
means that, barring passing through a singularity type event-horizon
past which participants can do direct shared memory mapping, this is
an O(n^2) problem!</p>
<p>But actually this is not a problem, and is kind of beautiful.  It is
amazing, given all that, just how good we are at finding shared
meaning.  But it also means that we should be aware of what this means
topologically, and that each participant in the system will have a
different set of experiences and understanding for each
identity-assertion made.</p>

<p>This year, the IndieWeb community has been making progress on iterating and evolving the IndieAuth protocol. IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables it to work with personal websites and in a decentralized environment.</p>

<p>There are already a good number of IndieAuth providers and apps, including a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and built-in support in <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> and <a href="https://dobrado.net/">Dobrado</a>. Ideally, we'd have even more first-class support for IndieAuth in a variety of different blogging platforms and personal websites, and that's been the goal motivating the spec updates this year. We've been focusing on simplifying the protocol and bringing it more in line with OAuth 2.0 so that it's both easier to understand and also easier to adapt existing OAuth clients and servers to add IndieAuth support.</p>

<p>Most of the changes this year have removed IndieAuth-specific bits to reuse things from OAuth when possible, and cleaning up the text of the spec. These changes are also intended to be backwards compatible as much as possible, so that existing clients and servers can upgrade independently.</p>

<p>This post describes the high level changes to the protocol, and is meant to help implementers get an idea of what may need to be updated with existing implementations.</p>

<p>If you would like an introduction to IndieAuth and OAuth, here are a few resources:</p>

<p>The rest of this post details the specifics of the changes and what they mean to client and server developers. If you've written an IndieAuth client or server, you'll definitely want to read this post to know what you'll need to change for the latest updates.</p>

 Response Type 

<p>The first thing an IndieAuth client does is discover the user's authorization endpoint and redirect the user to their server to authorize the client. There are two possible ways a client might be wanting to use IndieAuth, either to confirm the website of the user who just logged in, or to get an access token to be able to create posts on their website.</p>

<p>Previously, this distinction was made at this stage of the request by varying the <code>response_type</code> query string parameter. Instead, the <code>response_type</code> parameter is now always <code>response_type=code</code> which brings it in line with the OAuth 2.0 specification. This makes sense because the response of this request is always an authorization code, it's only after the authorization code is used that the difference between these two uses will be apparent.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send <code>response_type=code</code> in the initial <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Only accept <code>response_type=code</code> requests, and for backwards-compatible support, treat <code>response_type=id</code> requests as <code>response_type=code</code> requests.</p>

 Indicating the User who is Logging In 

<p>In earlier versions of the specification, the authorization request was required to have the parameter <code>me</code>, the value of which was whatever URL the user entered into the client to start the flow. It turns out that this parameter isn't strictly necessary for the flow to succeed, however it still can help improve the user experience in some cases. As such, it has now been changed to an optional parameter.</p>

<p>This parameter is a way for the client to tell the IndieAuth server which user it expects will log in. For single-user sites this value is completely unnecessary, since there is only ever one <code>me</code> URL that will be returned in the end. It turns out that most single-user implementations were already ignoring this parameter anyway since it served no purpose.</p>

<p>For multi-user websites like a multi-author WordPress blog, this parameter also served little purpose. If a user was already logged in to their WordPress site, then tried to log in to an IndieAuth client, the server could just ignore this parameter anyway and return the logged-in user's <code>me</code> URL at the end of the flow.</p>

<p>For multi-user authorization endpoints like the (to-be deprecated) indieauth.com, this parameter served as a hint of who was trying to log in, so that the authorization server could provide a list of authentication options to the user. This is the only case in which this parameter really provides a user experience benefit, since without the parameter at this stage, the user would need to type in their website again, or be shown a list of authentication provider options such as "log in with Twitter".</p>

<p>There's yet another case where the user may enter just the domain of their website, even though their final <code>me</code> URL may be something more specific. For example, a user can enter <code>micro.blog</code> in an IndieAuth sign-in prompt, and eventually be logged in to that app as <code>https://micro.blog/username</code>. There is no requirement that the thing they type in to clients has to be an exact match of their actual profile URL, which allows a much nicer user experience so that users can type only the domain of their service provider which may provide profiles for multiple users. And in this case, the client providing the <code>me</code> URL to the server also doesn't serve any purpose.</p>

<p>The change to the spec makes the <code>me</code> parameter in the authorization request optional. In this sense, it's more of a hint from the client about who is trying to log in. Obviously the server can't trust that value in the request at this point, since the user hasn't logged in yet, so it really is more of a hint than anything else.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Continue to include the <code>me</code> parameter in the request if you can, but if you are using an OAuth client that doesn't let you customize this request, it's okay to leave it out now.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Most servers were already ignoring this parameter anyway, so if you fell into that category then no change is needed. If you were expecting this parameter to exist, change it to optional, because you probably don't actually need it. If it's present in a request, you can use it to influence the options you show for someone to authenticate if they are not yet logged in, or you could show an error message if the client provides a <code>me</code> URL that doesn't match the currently logged-in user.</p>

 Adding PKCE Support 

<p>Probably the biggest change to the spec is the addition of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) mechanism. This is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that solves a number of different vulnerabilities. It was originally designed to allow mobile apps to securely complete an OAuth flow without a client secret, but has since proven to be useful for JavaScript apps and even solves a particular attack even if the client does have a client secret.</p>

<p>Since IndieAuth clients are all considered "Public Clients" in OAuth terms, there are no preregistered client secrets at all, and PKCE becomes a very useful mechanism to secure the flow.</p>

<p>I won't go into the details of the particular attacks PKCE solves in this post, since I've talked about them a lot in other talks and videos. If you'd like to learn more about this, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/td00HpMI3Q8?t=38">sketch notes video</a> where I talk about PKCE and my coworker draws sketchnotes on his iPad.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, PKCE is a very useful mechanism, isn't terribly complicated to implement, and can be added independently by clients and servers since it's designed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>The change to the spec is that PKCE has been rolled into the core authorization flow. Incidentally, the OAuth spec itself is making the same change by rolling PKCE in to the <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> update.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always include the PKCE parameters <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> in the <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: If a <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in an authorization request, don't allow the authorization code to be used unless the corresponding <code>code_verifier</code> is present in the request using the authorization code. For backwards compatibility, if no <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in the request, make sure the request to use the authorization code does not contain a <code>code_verifier</code>.</p>

 Using an Authorization Code 

<p>Whew, okay, you've made it this far and you've sent the user off to their authorization endpoint to log in. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to your application. Now you're ready to use that authorization code to either get an access token or confirm their <code>me</code> URL.</p>

<p>There are two changes to this step, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">redeeming the authorization code</a>.</p>

 Grant Type Parameters 

<p>The first change, while minor, brings IndieAuth in line with OAuth 2.0 since apparently this hadn't been actually specified before. This request must now contain the POST body parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send the parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> when redeeming an authorization code. Generic OAuth 2.0 clients will already be doing this.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For backwards compatibility, treat the omission of this parameter the same as providing it with <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>. For example if you also accept requests with <code>grant_type=refresh_token</code>, the absence of this parameter means the client is doing an authorization code grant.</p>

 Providing "me" in the Token Request 

<p>The request when using an authorization code, either to the token endpoint or authorization endpoint, previously required that the client send the <code>me</code> parameter as well. The change to the spec drops this parameter from this request, making it the same as an OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>This has only some minor implications in very specific scenarios. We analyzed all the known IndieAuth implementations and found that the vast majority of them were already ignoring this parameter anyway. For single-user endpoints, the additional parameter provides no value, since the endpoint would be self-contained anyway, and already know how to validate authorization codes. Even multi-user endpoints like the WordPress plugin would know how to validate authorization codes because the authorization and token endpoints are part of the same software.</p>

<p>The only implementations leaving this parameter out would break are separate implementations of authorization endpoints and token endpoints, where the user has no prior relationship with either. The biggest offender of this is actually my own implementation which I am eventually going to retire, indieauth.com and tokens.indieauth.com. I initially wrote indieauth.com as just the authorization endpoint part, and later added tokens.indieauth.com as a completely separate implementation, it shares nothing in common with indieauth.com and is actually entirely stateless. Over the years, it turns out this pattern hasn't actually been particularly useful, since a website is either going to build both endpoints or delegate both to an external service. So in practice, the only people using tokens.indieauth.com were using it with the indieauth.com authorization endpoint.</p>

<p>Removing this parameter has no effect on most of the implementations. I did have to update my own implementation of tokens.indieauth.com to default to verifying authorization codes at indieauth.com if there was no <code>me</code> parameter, which so far has been sccessful.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: No need to send the <code>me</code> parameter when exchanging an authorization code. This makes the request the same as a generic OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For servers that have an authorization endpoint and token endpoint as part of the same software, make sure your token endpoint knows how to look up authorization codes. Most of the time this is likely what you're already doing anyway, and you were probably ignoring the <code>me</code> parameter already. If you do want to provide a standalone token endpoint, you'll need to create your own encoding scheme to bake in the authorization endpoint or <code>me</code> value into the authorization code itself. But for the vast majority of people this will require no change.</p>

 Removing Same-Domain Requirement 

<p>One of the challenges of a decentralized protocol like this is knowing who to trust to make assertions about who. Just because someone's authorization server claims that a user identified as "https://aaronpk.com/" logged in doesn't mean I actually did log in. Only my authorization server should be trusted to assert that I logged in.</p>

<p>In the previous version of the spec, the way this was enforced was that clients had to check that the final <code>me</code> URL returned had a matching domain as what the user initially entered, after following redirects. That means if I entered <code>aaronpk.com</code> into the client, and that redirected to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/</code>, the client would then expect the final profile URL returned at the end to also be on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>. This works, but it has a few challenges and limitations.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for client developers was keeping track of the chain of redirects. There were actually separate rules for temporary vs permanent redirects, and the client would have to be aware of each step in the redirect chain if there was more than one. Then at the end, the client would have to parse the final profile URL to find the host component, then check if that matches, and it turns out that there are often some pretty <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/395845">low</a>-level <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/305974">bugs</a> with <a href="https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8624.html">parsing</a> URLs in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31429439/parsing-an-url-without-a-path-but-with-a-slash-in-the-query">variety</a> of languages that can lead to unexpected security flaws.</p>

<p>On top of the technical challenges for client developers, there was another problem in the specific case where a user may control only a subfolder of a domain. For example in a shared hosting environment where users can upload arbitrary files to their user directory, <code>https://example.com/~user</code>, the same-domain restriction would still let <code>/~user1</code> claim to be <code>/~user2</code> on that domain. We didn't want to go down the route of adding more URL parsing rules like checking for substring matches, as that would likely have led to even more of a burden on client developers and more risk of security holes.</p>

<p>So instead, this entire restriction has been replaced with a new way of verifying that the final profile URL is legitimate. The new rule should drastically simplify the client code, at the slight cost of a possible additional HTTP request.</p>

<p>The new rule is that if the final profile URL returned by the authorization endpoint is not an exact match of the initially entered URL, the client has to go discover the authorization endpoint at the new URL and verify that it matches the authorization endpoint it used for the flow. This is described in a new section of the spec, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>This change means clients no longer need to keep track of the full redirect chain (although they still can if they would like more opportunities to possibly skip that last HTTP request), and also ensures users on shared domains can't impersonate other users on that domain.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Remove any code around parsing the initial and final URLs, and add a new step after receiving the user's final profile URL: If the final profile URL doesn't match exactly what was used to start the flow, then go fetch that URL and discover the authorization endpoint and confirm that the discovered authorization endpoint matches the one used at the beginning. Please read <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: No change.</p>

 Returning Profile Information 

<p>If the application would like to know more about the user than just their confirmed profile URL, such as their name or photo, previously there was no easy or reliable way to find this information. It's possible the user's profile URL may have an <code>h-card</code> with their info, but that would only include public info and would require bringing in a Microformats parser and making another HTTP request to find this information.</p>

<p>In the latest version of the spec, we've added a <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information">new section</a> returned in the response when redeeming an authorization code for the authorization server to return this profile data directly. To request this information, there are now two scopes defined in the spec, <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code>. When the client requests the <code>profile</code> scope, this indicates the client would like the server to return the user's <code>name</code>, <code>photo</code> and <code>url</code>. The <code>email</code> scope requests the user's email address.</p>

<p>The response when redeeming an authorization code that was issued with these scopes will now contain an additional property, <code>profile</code>, alongside the <code>me</code> URL and access token.</p>

 <code>{
  "access_token": "XXXXXX",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "profile email create",
  "me": "https://user.example.net/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "Example User",
    "url": "https://user.example.net/",
    "photo": "https://user.example.net/photo.jpg",
    "email": "user@example.net"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This comes with some caveats. As is always the case with OAuth, just because a client requests certain scopes does not guarantee the request will be granted. The user or the authorization server may decide to not honor the request and leave this information out. For example a user may choose to not share their email even if the app requests it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the information in this <code>profile</code> section is not guaranteed to be "real" or "verified" in any way. It is merely information that the user intends to share with the app. This means everything from the user sharing different email addresses with different apps, or the URL in the profile being a completely different website. For example a multi-author WordPress blog which provides <code>me</code> URLs on the WordPress site's domain, <code>example.com</code>, may return the author's own personal website in the <code>url</code> property of the profile information. The client is not allowed to treat this information as authoritative or many any policy decisions based on the profile information, it's for informational purposes only. Another common vulnerability in many existing OAuth clients is that they assume the provider has confirmed the email address returned and will use that to deduplicate accounts. This has the problem of if a user can edit their email address and have it returned in an OAuth response without the server confirming it, the client may end up being tricked into thinking a different user logged in. Only the <code>me</code> URL is the one that can be trusted as the stable identifier of the user, and everything in the <code>profile</code> section should be treated as if it were hand-entered into the client.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: If you would like to find the user's profile information, include the <code>profile</code> or <code>email</code> scope in your authorization request. If you don't need this, then no changes are necessary.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Authorization servers should be able to recognize the <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code> scopes in a request, and ask the user for permission to share their profile information with clients, then return that along with the final <code>me</code> URL and access token. It's also completely acceptable to not support this feature at all, as clients shouldn't be relying on the presence of this information in the response anyway.</p>

 Editorial Changes 

<p>There was a good amount of work done to clean up the text of the spec without changing any of the actual requirements. These are known as editorial changes.</p>

<p>The term "domain" has been replaced with the more accurate term "host" in most places. This matches the URL spec more closely, and reduces the confusion around registerable domain like <code>example.com</code> or <code>example.co.uk</code> and subdomains. In all cases, there has been no need to use the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a> because we have always meant full hostname matches.</p>

<p>Language around the term "profile URL" was cleaned up to make sure only the final URL returned by the authorization server is referred to as the "profile URL". The user may enter lots of different things into the client that might not be their profile URL, anything from just a hostname (<code>aaronpk.com</code>) to a URL that redirects to their profile URL. This cleans up the language to better clarify what we mean by "profile URL".</p>

<p>With the change to use <code>response_type=code</code> for both versions of the flow, it meant the authorization and authentication sections were almost entirely duplicate content. These have been consolidated into a single section, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization">Authorization</a>, and the only difference now is the response when the authorization code is redeemed.</p>

 Dropped Features and Text 

<p>Any time you can cut text from a spec and have it mean the same thing is a good thing. Thankfully we were able to cut a decent amount of text thanks to consolidating the two sections mentioned above. We also dropped an obscure feature that was extremely under-utilized. For the case where a token endpoint and authorization endpoint were not part of the same software, there was a section describing how those two could communicate so that the token endpoint could validate authorization codes issued by an arbitrary authorization endpoint. This serves no purpose if a single piece of software provided both endpoints since it would be far more efficient to have the token endpoint look up the authorization code in the database or however you're storing them, so virtually nobody had even bothered to implement this.</p>

<p>The only known implementations of this feature were my own <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code>, and Martijn's <code>mintoken</code> project. <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/44">We both agreed</a> that if we did want to pursue this feature in the future, we could write it up as an extension. Personally I plan on shutting down <code>indieauth.com</code> and <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code> in the near-ish future anyway, and the replacement that I build will contain both endpoints anyway, so I don't really plan on revisiting this topic anyway.</p>

 Conclusion / Future Work 

<p>Well if you've made it this far, congrats! I hope this post was helpful. This was definitely a good amount of changes, although hopefully all for good reasons and should simplify the process of developing IndieAuth clients and servers in the future.</p>

<p>We didn't get to every open IndieAuth issue in this round of updates, there are still a few interesting ones open that I would like to see addressed. The next largest change that will affect implementations would be to continue to bring this in line with OAuth 2.0 and always <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58">redeem the authorization code at the token endpoint</a> even if no access token is expected to be returned. That would also have the added benefit of simplifying the authorization endpoint implementation to only need to worry about providing the authorization UI, leaving all the JSON responses to the token endpoint. This still requires some discussion and a plan for upgrading to this new model, so feel free to chime in on the discussions!</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thank-you to everyone who has participated in the discussions this year, both on GitHub and in our virtual meetings! All the feedback from everyone who is interested in the spec has been extremely valuable!</p>

<p>We'll likely schedule some more sessions to continue development on the spec, so keep an eye on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indieauth">events.indieweb.org</a> for upcoming events tagged #indieauth!</p>

<p>This article takes the mental models of identity and explores how they can be achieved with a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution.</p><p>To pin down the meaning and definition of identity is a challenging task due to its uniquely human nature. It can have totally different meanings for different people. However, there are reoccurring themes when speaking about the term. The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment leveraging SSI infrastructure and components. While the concept of SSI can be applied for individuals, legal entities and things alike, the following paragraph solely focuses on individuals and explains how these models can serve as a guideline for SSI implementations. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted in the following paragraphs.</p>Mental models of identity. Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> Space-time <p>“The space-time mental model sees identity as resolving the question of the physical continuity of an entity through space and time. (…) It answers the question: Does the physical body under evaluation have a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity?”</p><p>An identity is established in the past, it acts in the present and continues to be useful in the future. To secure the sum of recorded interactions and relationships in digital form one requires a backup when using a wallet, which stores the identity data and their associated cryptographic keys locally on the device of the user. This backup enables the user to restore the received credentials as well as established relationships. When losing access to the wallet, the backup enables the user to reestablish the aspects described in the space-time mental model. A backup generally consists of the identity data itself and a key, which is used to en- and decrypt the backup&nbsp;data.</p> Presentation <p>“The presentation mental model sees identity as how we present ourselves to society. This is the mental model behind Vendor Relationship Management, user-centric identity, and self-sovereign identity. (…) It answers the question: Is this how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known?”</p><p>Individuals can choose, which information about them should be known by third parties or the public. The granularity of this information varies dependent on the social context. While one might only want to provide the required minimum of information to a government authority, one might have the desire to share very personal details with a certain social circle such as family or friends. Hence, the user requires different social profiles and circles, which help to present the right information to the target audience. Since one part of a SSI ecosystem is the creation of trusted peer to peer relationships, these contacts can be sorted by the user and allocated to a social circle according to the preferences of the individual.</p><p>However, when it comes to the sharing of information it gets tricky. There are currently no SSI implementations with enable a user-experience similar to current social media platforms. Hence, the presentation of information is currently limited to one contact at a&nbsp;time.</p> Attribute <p>“The attribute mental model sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity as recorded in a specific system. Enshrined in ISO/IEC 24760–1, an international standard for identity management, this mental model is the primary focus for many engineers. (…) It answers the question: Who is this data&nbsp;about?”</p><p>From a birth certificate to a university degree or a language certification, we collect a variety of credentials, which attest certain information about us. The sum of all these credentials can also be seen as one mental model of identity. These credentials are issued, stored and managed by the individual and are standardized within the specification of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials data model 1.0 by the W3C</a>. It is the only mental model with a formal specification.</p><p>SSI implementations use cryptography to provide the necessary proofs that presented information is about the individual in question. There are different options of implementations to ensure that a certain identifier relates to the specific person, however most implementations use decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to identify the identity&nbsp;subject.</p> Relationship <p>“The relationship mental model sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others. Our identity is not about what we are in isolation from others, but is rather defined by the relationships we have. This is the fundamental model in the South African idea of ‘Ubuntu’, meaning ‘I am because we are.’ (…) It answers the question: How is this person related?”</p><p>The relationship to other individuals or entities can help to determine the status of a person within society. We can observe different domains of relationships, which depend on the social context like a professional, official, legal, personal, public, business or employment context to name a few. For example a representative of a government like a diplomat has special rights and obligations due to this relationship. Depended on the context, e.g. an interview of said diplomat, it can touch multiple domains by being an official interview, with legal consequences, which is presented to the public and can have a direct effect on the employment relation for the diplomat. Generally, individuals initiate and maintain hundreds or even thousands of relationships to different entities. An SSI solution enables an individual to initiate this relationship by accepting or requesting a connection. Once established this connection serves as communication channel to facilitate the exchange of (verified) information between the two parties. Since both parties are able to validate the identity of the other party it enables the necessary trust in a digital environment. However, a the establishment of a connection isn’t necessary and credentials can also be issued or requested without one. There are special protocols, which standardise the credential exchange and communication between two entities like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DiDcomm protocol</a>.</p> Capability <p>“The capability mental model pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, including their physical ability now, in the past, or in the future. It is the inevitable approach for anyone in an emergency. (…) It answers the question: What can the subject actually&nbsp;do?”</p><p>The primary reason why an identity is required in the online world in the first place are the capabilities that come with it. Without an identity one is still able to browse the web and gather information, however when it comes to online shopping, banking, government applications, employee portals, access control and many other aspects, an identity is necessary to execute those actions. Not all actions require a verified identity. In most cases a self-attested identity is sufficient for the verifier. However, there are multiple cases for which the verifier either has a legitimate interest for only allowing access to verified parties or is obligated by law to verify the identity of an individual. An example for the first case can be access to information for a specific audience like a university, which wants to grant students access to internal documents. The students would not be required to verify their identity every time they want to access the repository, but instead only need to prove that they are a student of said university, without disclosing further personal details. The second case includes telecommunication providers, or financial institutions, which need to comply with know your costumer (KYC) regulations.</p> Mindmap of the mental models enabled by&nbsp;SSI Mindmap: Mental models of identity enabled by SSI.

Source: SSI Ambassador / Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>To conclude it can be said, that all mental models of SSI can be enabled to a certain degree, however when it comes to the space-time (backup) mental model or the presentation (social network) model, we also see that the integration of the concept is quite nascent and requires more development to be comparable with current centralised alternatives.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>When I got to Milano, I thought: How did they know? This feels just like a post-apocalyptic film. But how did the directors know this is how it feels? It’s not that surprising, of course. Cities have gone through wars and pestilence since the existence of&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Milano after the plague, or not after the plague. Certainly the worst of it hasn’t happened yet. We are in the middle of it. Maybe just the beginning of it. Whatever it&nbsp;is.</p><p>I remember a warm data workshop with Nora Bates. She said: The disaster has already struck. It just hasn’t struck everyone&nbsp;yet.</p>Empty office buildings in&nbsp;Milan<p>When I left Ljubljana, why did I leave Ljubljana? Numbers were rising. Measures were tightening. Will I be able to get to Spain? Will I be able to get back? Maybe with my Slovenian plates nobody will stop&nbsp;me.</p><p>In Milan I sat with one of my father’s best friends in a rooftop restaurant in the outdoor seating. They took our temperatures before we got on the elevator. I can’t visit my father but at least his friend lives within driving distance of&nbsp;me.</p><p>Four hours is a long way to go out of one’s way for a meal and Milan doesn’t seem so advisable, but who knows when we will get to see our loved ones again? She gets me an AirBnB because hotels make me choke with the poisonous sanitizer they use to cleanse the&nbsp;air.</p><p>We have dinner. I tell her it’s hard to speak to Americans about what’s happening in the States. She says “Whenever I bring it up, your father says ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’.”. I don’t want to talk about it either, but it’s all I ever talk about. I’m American, or at least that’s what one of my passports says. My residency permit says Slovenia. It’s my only hope of staying out of a red zone at this point. Red zone. I’m not worried about disease. Civil war is another&nbsp;thing.</p><p>The laundry place wouldn’t take my underwear or socks. If I want laundry done, I have to do it myself, they said. I don’t know if that’s because of the pandemic or a Milanese tradition. At a little coastal town two hours East, the proprietor of the self-service laundromat did my laundry for me at no extra&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This is my first post on the <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/blog/">Sufficiency Currency blog</a>. It’s about the wisdom of taking a road trip in Europe in the middle of a pandemic. At the beginning of the collapse of civilization. In a bizarre moment of suspension, where things seem to be going on as usual; waiting for the other shoe to drop. America is in the throes of a civil war and California has no air and we’re sharing TikTok videos and Instagram sunsets. Everyone knows the economy’s dead, but we’re working and shopping and paying rent as if nothing happened, like we’re under hypnosis.</p><p>Or a psychedelic trip. One big global psychedelic trip, and not the good&nbsp;kind.</p>Who is that masked&nbsp;man?<p>Zipping along the highway in a rental car in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad Trip. That doesn’t sound very&nbsp;wise.</p><p>At one of the ecovillages, they make their own toothpaste. It’s not really toothpaste; it’s a kind of a powder. I asked one of the volunteers how to use the tooth powder. I knew the answer, but I was hoping I was wrong. She said: we just dip our toothbrushes into the jar. I don’t need a pandemic to know that dipping my toothbrush in the communal jar of tooth-powder is a bad idea. I brought my own toothpaste, like a civilized person. I brought the biological kind so they can’t complain.</p><p>As I drive my car along the Riviera, I see it out of the corner of my eye, for a brief second between tunnels, the dark blue sign with the circle of stars around the word France. If I hadn’t been paying attention, I wouldn’t have noticed. OK Google doesn’t say “Welcome to France.” When you cross between states in the US, Google tells you “Welcome to New Jersey.” In Europe, no such thing. OK Google is silent. She knows I crossed and I know I crossed. Maybe she’s pretending to honor GDPR as if she doesn’t know my every move. She knows if I am speeding but doesn’t tell the cops. She definitely knows that I got a small cut on my right index finger. Now she knows the prints of my middle finger, too. “OK, Google,” I say. “That’s me,” she&nbsp;answers.</p><p>The border crossing is easy. Finding lunch on the French Riviera in the off season during a pandemic isn’t. I have cake and coffee instead of something that feels French — or like lunch. The coffee shop has no WiFi. I guess you’re supposed to be enjoying yourself by the marina, not&nbsp;working.</p><p>The Sufficiency Currency project is about creating an alternative form of economic activity. Not marketplaces. Not money. An evolution of how we perceive our economic activity.</p><p>“People have always used money. What else is there?” people&nbsp;ask.</p><p>People haven’t always used money and there are still peoples on earth who don’t. Every system is born, lives and dies. Money is just a human invention and the financial system is like every other human invention. We can and will invent something else. Hopefully very&nbsp;soon.</p><p>A road trip to replace the world’s financial system in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad&nbsp;Trip.</p><p>Follow he <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/">Voice of Humanity project&nbsp;here.</a></p>

<p>On Monday, November 23rd the Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* held its 17th event, the focus of this event was on Guardianship and SSI.  Our presenter was Philippe Page of The Human Colossus Foundation and is a current member of the Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group.   </p><p>Guardianship is a legal status where one individual is under the legal care of another.  A natural guardian relationship is between parent and child, legal guardians are persons who are recognized by the courts as having the legal authority and duty of care for another.  </p><p>While there are long standing legal precedents and processes around the assignment, management and revocation of guardianships, these requirements were not met by existing digital identity management solutions. With SSI, this mechanism now exists.  SSI can work in conjunction with traditional identity and credential management systems while being able to integrate into existing legal processes and provides a robust mechanism for revocation.</p><p>Guardianship is a complex topic, with many subtleties and layers.  In the humanitarian sector the it is a reality of daily life when supporting and assisting migrants, refugees and displaced persons.  It is a topic we all are faced with in our lifetimes; whether as a child (being cared for) or as an adult (caring for or being cared for).  In this first event on this topic, Philippe has provided an overview of how SSI and Guardianship fit together and how SSI meets the lifecycle stages (Inception, Creation, Usage and Termination) of guardianship.  </p><p>An objective of these events is to educate the community on how high assurance digital identities unlock new possibilities across all entities and industry sectors.   Using the tripartite relationship in clinical drug trials of patient, doctor and pharma company, Philippe covered how guardianship can also be used to manage consent to derive a business value unlocked with high assurance digital identity.  </p><p>Guardianship is an important legal concept, and will be a topic we will return to in 2021.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/482803989">https://vimeo.com/482803989</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:03:55 - Philippe Page - Introduction</p>  <p>0:08:03 - Overview</p>  <p>0:08:41 -  Guardianship background</p>  <p>0:20:15 - Core Components</p>  <p>0:33:51 - Scaling and Standardization</p>  <p>0:39:04 - Bridging Economic Actors &amp; Human Centricity</p>  <p>0:45:45 - Applications</p>  <p>1:02:08 - Questions</p>  <p>For more information on:</p><p>	- Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group :&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">https://sovrin.org/guardianship/</a></p><p>	- The Human Colossus Foundation : <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">https://humancolossus.foundation/</a></p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events. Hopefully we will be back to in person and online soon! </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/</a> </p><p>*Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the value that a high assurance digital identity creates by reducing risk and strengthening provenance. We meet on the 4th Monday of every month, in person (when permitted) in Vienna and online on Zoom. Connecting and educating across borders and oceans.</p>

The author recognizes that there may be errors and biases, and welcomes constructive feedback to correct or ameliorate.</p><p>We all like secrets. When we possess a secret, it gives us a heightened sense of individuality — that we know some that nobody else knows — giving us a special perspective or an option for the future that only we can exercise — in other words,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/power">power</a>.</p><p>It turns out, imaginary or not, secrets are fundamental to the power that we have as individuals and institutions in the digital realm. Passwords, codes — those things that grant us or enable us to grant special access to those things that valuable, like bank accounts, emails, or the drafts and finals of our deliberations, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>It turns out, that up until, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-day-cryptography-changed-forever-1b6aefe8bda7">August 1, 1977</a>, secrets had a fundamental fault — we had to share them to use them. That meant you had to trust someone else, and that could eventually lead to the betrayal of your secret, and by extension, you.</p><p>In 1977, the public introduction of asymmetric cryptography heralded a new generation of secret capabilities. The first major capability was the establishment of shared secrets across insecure channels enabling encryption between two parties without the requirement of a secret backchannel. The second was enabling commitments using secrets that are not shared, more commonly known as digital signatures.</p><p>What had been discovered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (and also Jame Ellis), is changing the world as we know it. It’s been only 43 years. Yes, that seems like an ice-age ago, but in the grand scheme of history, it is only a&nbsp;wink.</p><p>My concluding remark in this brief post is that<a href="https://youtu.be/4cia_v4vxfE"> you ain’t seen nothing yet</a> (with apologies to BTO). I have been learning about many related schemes, based on that 1977 publicly-announced breakthrough: elliptic curves, homomorphic commitment schemes, proof-of-work, etc.</p><p>It’s one thing to understand these as mathematical, but it is another thing to understand what these things might be leveraged as institutional capabilities, either built by an institution itself or leveraged from an ecosystem that lets you keep your own&nbsp;secrets.</p><p>That’s the key — keeping your own secrets — keeping those things that give you the&nbsp;power.</p>
