<p>This article shows how to add Fido2 multi-factor authentication to an OpenID Connect identity provider using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core Identity. OpenIddict implements the OpenID Connect standards and ASP.NET Core Identity is used for the user accounting and persistence of the identities.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict</a></p>



<p>I began by creating an <a href="https://documentation.openiddict.com/">OpenIddict</a> web application using ASP.NET Core Identity. See the OpenIddict <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-samples">samples</a> for getting started. </p>



<p>I use the fido2-net-lib <a href="https://github.com/passwordless-lib/fido2-net-lib">Fido2</a> Nuget package which can be use to add support for Fido2 in .NET Core applications. You can add this to the web application used for the identity provider.</p>


  &lt;PackageReference Include="Fido2" Version="3.0.0-beta6" /&gt;
  


<p>Once added, you need to add the API controllers for the webAuthn API calls and the persistence classes using the Fido2 Nuget package. I created a set of classes which you can copy into your project. You need to switch the ApplicationUser class with IdentityUser if you are not extending the ASP.NET Core Identity. I use the ApplicationUser class in this example.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/Fido2">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/Fido2</a></p>



<p>In the ApplicationDbContext, the DBSet with the FidoStoredCredential entity is added to persist the Fido2 data.</p>


  using Fido2Identity;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace OpeniddictServer.Data;

public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt; FidoStoredCredential =&gt; Set&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt;();

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.Entity&lt;FidoStoredCredential&gt;().HasKey(m =&gt; m.Id);

        base.OnModelCreating(builder);
    }
}
  


<p>The Fido2 Identity services are added to the application. I use an SQL Server to persistent the data. The ApplicationUser is used for the ASP.NET Core services. The Fido2 Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider class is used to add a new Fido2 MFA to the ASP.NET Core Identity. A session is used to store the webAuthn requests and the Fido2 store was added for the persistence.  </p>


  services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
{
	// Configure the context to use Microsoft SQL Server.
	options.UseSqlServer(Configuration
		.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));

	// Register the entity sets needed by OpenIddict.
	// Note: use the generic overload if you need
	// to replace the default OpenIddict entities.
	options.UseOpenIddict();
});

services.AddIdentity&lt;ApplicationUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
  .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
  .AddDefaultTokenProviders()
  .AddDefaultUI()
  .AddTokenProvider&lt;Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider&gt;("FIDO2");

services.Configure&lt;Fido2Configuration&gt;(
	Configuration.GetSection("fido2"));
services.AddScoped&lt;Fido2Store&gt;();

services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

services.AddSession(options =&gt;
{
	options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
	options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
	options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});
  


<p>The Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider implements the IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider interface which can be used to add additional custom 2FA providers to ASP.NET Core Identity.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using OpeniddictServer.Data;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Fido2Identity;

public class Fido2UserTwoFactorTokenProvider 
	: IUserTwoFactorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;
{
    public Task&lt;bool&gt; CanGenerateTwoFactorTokenAsync(
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }

    public Task&lt;string&gt; GenerateAsync(string purpose, 
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, 
		ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult("fido2");
    }

    public Task&lt;bool&gt; ValidateAsync(string purpose, 
		string token, 
		UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt; manager, 
		ApplicationUser user)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(true);
    }
}
  


<p>The Session is added as middleware as well as the standard packages.</p>


  app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.UseSession();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
{
	endpoints.MapControllers();
	endpoints.MapDefaultControllerRoute();
	endpoints.MapRazorPages();
});
  


<p>The Javascript classes to implement the webAuthn standard API calls and backend API calls need to be added to the wwwroot of the project. The is added here:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/wwwroot/js">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict/tree/main/OpeniddictServer/wwwroot/js</a></p>



<p>One js file implements the Fido2 register process and the other implements the login.</p>



<p>Now we need to implement the Fido2 bits in the ASP.NET Core Identity UI and add the Javascript scripts to these pages. I usually scaffold in the required ASP.NET Core pages and extend these with the FIDO2 implementations for the MFA. </p>



<p>The following Identity Pages need to be created or updated:</p>



  Account/Login  Account/LoginFido2Mfa  Account/Manage/Disable2fa  Account/Manage/Fido2Mfa  Account/Manage/TwoFactorAuthentication  Account/Manage/ManageNavPages  



<p>The Fido2 registration is implemented in the Account/Manage/Fido2Mfa Identity Razor page. The Javascript files are added in this page. </p>

                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id="fido2logindisplay"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="display:none" id="fido2TapKeyToLogin"&gt;FIDO2_TAP_YOUR_SECURITY_KEY_TO_LOGIN&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="~/js/instant.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="~/js/mfa.login.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  


<p>The other ASP.NET Core Identity files are extended to implement the 2FA providers logic.</p>



<p>I extended the _Layout file to include the sweetalert2 js package used to implement the UI popups as in the FIDO2 demo from the Nuget package passwordless demo. You do not need this and can change the js files to use something else.</p>

// ...
&lt;script type="text/javascript" 
	src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sweetalert2"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" 
	href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/limonte-sweetalert2/6.10.1/sweetalert2.min.css" /&gt;
	
&lt;/head&gt;
  


<p>I used the Feitian Fido2 keys to test the implementation. I find these keys excellent and robust. I used 2 mini and 2 NFC standard keys to test. You should add at least 2 keys per identity. I usually use three keys for all my accounts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ftsafe.com/products/FIDO">https://www.ftsafe.com/products/FIDO</a></p>







<p>Once you login and create an account, you can go to the user settings and setup a 2FA. Choose Fido2. Then you can register a key for you account.</p>







<p>Next time you login, you will be required to authenticate using Fido2 as a second factor.</p>







<p></p>



<p>With Fido2 protecting the accounts against phishing and a solid implementation of OpenID Connect, you have a great start to implementing a professional identity provider.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph).  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM.  



<p>Creating a conditional access authentication context</p>



<p>A continuous access (CA) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the first <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> in this series for details on setting this up.</p>







<p>Force MFA in the Blazor application</p>



<p>Now that the continuous access (CA) authentication context is setup and a policy is created requiring MFA, the application can check that the required acrs with the correct value is present in the id_token. We do this is two places, in the login of the account controller and in the OpenID Connect event sending the authorize request. The account controller Login method can be used to set the claims parameter with the required acrs value. By requesting this, the Azure AD policy auth context is forced. </p>


  [HttpGet("Login")]
public ActionResult Login(string? returnUrl, 
	string? claimsChallenge)
{
  // var claims = 
  //  "{\"access_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  // var claims = 
  //  "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  var redirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";

  var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri };

  if(claimsChallenge != null) 
  {
	string jsonString = claimsChallenge.Replace("\\", "")
		.Trim(new char[1] { '"' });

	properties.Items["claims"] = jsonString;
  }
  else
  {
	// lets force MFA using CAE for all sign in requests.
	properties.Items["claims"] 
	  = "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
  }

  return Challenge(properties);
}
  


<p>In the application an ASP.NET Core authorization policy can be implemented to force the MFA. All requests require a claim type acrs with the value c1, which we created in the Azure tenant using Microsoft Graph.</p>


  services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", scopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("ca-mfa", policy =&gt;
    {
        policy.RequireClaim("acrs", AuthContextId.C1);
    });
});
  


<p>By using the account controller login method, only the login request forces the auth context. If the context needs to be forced everywhere, then a middleware using the OnRedirectToIdentityProvider event can be used to add the extra request parameter on every OIDC authorize request. The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider event can be used to add this to all requests, which has not already added the claims parameter. You could also only use this without the login implementation in the account controller.</p>


  services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .RequireClaim("acrs", AuthContextId.C1)
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
    {
        if(!context.ProtocolMessage.Parameters.ContainsKey("claims"))
        {
            context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter(
            "claims",
            "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}");
        }

        return Task.FromResult(0);
    };
});
  


<p>Now all requests require the auth context which is used to require the CA MFA policy.</p>

  $$ cos^2 \theta + sin^2 \theta  = 1  $$

$$ tan 2 \theta = {2tan \theta  \over 1 - tan^2 \theta}  $$

<p>This post shows how to force an Azure AD policy using Azure AD Continuous Access (CA) in an ASP.NET Core Blazor application. An authentication context is used to require MFA. The “acrs” claim in the id_token is used to validate whether or not an Azure AD CAE policy has been fulfilled. If the claim is missing, an OpenID Connect challenge is sent to the Azure AD identity provider to request and require this. In this sample, MFA is required.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph)  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement the Blazor backend to handle the CA validation correctly  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM  



<p>Setup overview</p>



<p>A Blazor WASM application is implemented and hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. This is one single application, or also know as a server rendered application. The single application is secured using a single confidential client and the security is implemented in the trusted backend with no sensitive token data stored in the browser. Cookies are used to store the sensitive data. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the security. The Microsoft.Identity.Web lib is an OpenID Connect client wrapper from Microsoft with some Microsoft Azure specifics. </p>







<p>Creating a conditional access authentication context</p>



<p>A continuous access evaluation (CAE) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the first <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> in this series for details on setting this up.</p>









<p>Validate the CAE in the Blazor backend</p>



<p>The CaeClaimsChallengeService class is used to implement the CAE check in the application. The class checks for the acrs claim and returns a claims challenge requesting the claim if this is missing.</p>

<p>The AdminApiCallsController is used to provide data for the Blazor WASM UI. If the identity does not have the required authorization, an unauthorized response is returned to the UI with the claims challenge.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace BlazorBffAzureAD.Server.Controllers;

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
[Authorize(AuthenticationSchemes = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AdminApiCallsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CaeClaimsChallengeService _caeClaimsChallengeService;

    public AdminApiCallsController(CaeClaimsChallengeService caeClaimsChallengeService)
    {
        _caeClaimsChallengeService = caeClaimsChallengeService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        // if CAE claim missing in id token, the required claims challenge is returned
        var claimsChallenge = _caeClaimsChallengeService
            .CheckForRequiredAuthContextIdToken(AuthContextId.C1, HttpContext);

        if (claimsChallenge != null)
        {
            return Unauthorized(claimsChallenge);
        }

        return Ok(new List&lt;string&gt;()
        {
            "Admin data 1",
            "Admin data 2"
        });
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Handling the authentication challenge in the Blazor WASM client</p>



<p>The Blazor WASM client handles the unauthorized response by authenticating again using Azure AD. If the claims challenge is returned, a step up authentication is sent to Azure AD with the challenge. The CaeStepUp  method is used to implement the UI part of this flow.</p>


  using System.Net;

namespace BlazorBffAzureAD.Client.Services;

// orig src https://github.com/berhir/BlazorWebAssemblyCookieAuth
public class AuthorizedHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly HostAuthenticationStateProvider _authenticationStateProvider;

    public AuthorizedHandler(HostAuthenticationStateProvider authenticationStateProvider)
    {
        _authenticationStateProvider = authenticationStateProvider;
    }

    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(
        HttpRequestMessage request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
        HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
        if (authState.User.Identity!= null &amp;&amp; !authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // if user is not authenticated, immediately set response status to 401 Unauthorized
            responseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
        }
        else
        {
            responseMessage = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
        }

        if (responseMessage.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
        {
            var content = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            // if server returned 401 Unauthorized, redirect to login page
            if (content != null &amp;&amp; content.Contains("acr")) // CAE
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.CaeStepUp(content);
            }
            else // standard
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.SignIn();
            }
        }

        return responseMessage;
    }
}

  


<p>The CaeStepUp navigates to the authorization URL of the backend application with the claims challenge passed as a parameter.</p>


  public void CaeStepUp(string claimsChallenge, 
	string? customReturnUrl = null)
{
	var returnUrl = customReturnUrl != null ?
		_navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(customReturnUrl).ToString() : null;
		
	var encodedReturnUrl = Uri.EscapeDataString(returnUrl ?? _navigation.Uri);
	
	var logInUrl = _navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(
		$"{LogInPath}?claimsChallenge={claimsChallenge}&amp;returnUrl={encodedReturnUrl}");
		
	_navigation.NavigateTo(logInUrl.ToString(), true);
}
  


<p>The Login checks for claims challenge and starts an authentication process using Azure AD and the Microsoft.Identity.Web client.</p>


  [Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AccountController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("Login")]
    public ActionResult Login(string? returnUrl, string? claimsChallenge)
    {
        // var claims = "{\"access_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
        // var claims = "{\"id_token\":{\"acrs\":{\"essential\":true,\"value\":\"c1\"}}}";
        var redirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/";

        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = redirectUri };

        if(claimsChallenge != null)
        {
            string jsonString = claimsChallenge.Replace("\\", "")
                .Trim(new char[1] { '"' });

            properties.Items["claims"] = jsonString;
        }

        return Challenge(properties);
    }
  


<p>Using CAE is a useful way in applications to force authorization or policies in an Azure applications. This can be implemented easily with an ASP.NET Core application.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement Azure AD Continuous Access (CA) in a Blazor application which uses a Web API. The API requires an Azure AD conditional access authentication context. In the example code, MFA is required to use the external API. If a user requests data from the API using the required access token without the required acr claim, an unauthorized response is returned with the missing claims. The Blazor application returns the claims challenge to the WASM application and the application authenticates again with the step up claims challenge. If the user has authenticated using MFA, the authentication is successful and the data from the API can be retrieved.</p>

<p>Steps to implement </p>



  Create an authentication context in Azure for the tenant (using Microsoft Graph).  Add a CA policy which uses the authentication context.  Implement the CA Azure AD authentication context authorization in the API.  Implement the Blazor backend to handle the CA unauthorized responses correctly.  Implement an authentication challenge using the claims challenge in the Blazor WASM.  



<p>Setup overview</p>







<p></p>



<p>Creating a Conditional access Authentication Context</p>



<p>A continuous access (CA) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and a policy was created to use this. See the previous <a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/04/20/implement-azure-ad-continuous-access-evaluation-in-an-asp-net-core-razor-page-app-using-a-web-api/">blog</a> for details on setting this up.</p>









<p></p>



<p>External API setup</p>



<p>The external API is setup to validate Azure AD JWT Bearer access tokens and to validate that the required continuous access evaluation (CAE) policy is fulfilled. The CAE policy uses the authentication context required for this API. If the user is authorized, the correct claims need to be presented in the access token.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", 
AuthenticationSchemes = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ApiForUserDataController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CAEClaimsChallengeService _caeClaimsChallengeService;

    public ApiForUserDataController(
		CAEClaimsChallengeService caeClaimsChallengeService)
    {
        _caeClaimsChallengeService = caeClaimsChallengeService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
    {
        // returns unauthorized exception with WWW-Authenticate header 
        // if CAE claim missing in access token
        // handled in the caller client exception with challenge returned 
        // if not ok
        _caeClaimsChallengeService
			.CheckForRequiredAuthContext(AuthContextId.C1, HttpContext);
		
        return new List&lt;string&gt; 
		{ 
			"admin API CAE protected data 1", 
			"admin API CAE protected data 2" 
		};
    }
}
  


<p>The CaeClaimsChallengeService class implements the CAE requirement to use the API. If the user access token has insufficient claims, an unauthorized response is returned to the application requesting data from the API. The WWW-Authenticate header is set with the correct data as defined in the OpenID Connect signals and events specification.</p>

<p>The API can be used by any application and user which presents the correct access token including the claims required by the CAE.</p>



<p>Using Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) in an ASP.NET Core hosted Blazor application.</p>



<p>The Blazor application is authenticated using MSAL and the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture. The Blazor application administrator page uses data from the CAE protected API. The Blazor ASP.NET Core hosted WASM application is protected using a MSAL confidential client.</p>


  services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(
	Configuration, 
	"AzureAd", 
	subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents: true)
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(
		new[]

		})
	.AddMicrosoftGraph(
		Configuration.GetSection("GraphBeta"))
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p>The AdminApiClientService class is used to request data from the external API. The http client uses an Azure AD user delegated access token. If the API returns an unauthorized response, a WebApiMsalUiRequiredException is created with the WWW-Authenticate header payload.</p>


  public class AdminApiClientService
{
    private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;

    public AdminApiClientService(
        ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,

    {
        var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

        var scopes = new List&lt;string&gt; 
		{

		};
		
        var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition
			.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(scopes);

        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:44395");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization 
			= new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
			
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept
			.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

        var response = await client.GetAsync("ApiForUserData");
		
        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
        {

            var payload = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(stream);

            return payload;
        }

        throw new WebApiMsalUiRequiredException(
			$"Unexpected status code in the HttpResponseMessage: {response.StatusCode}.", response);
    }
}
  


<p>The AdminApiCallsController implements the API used by the Blazor WASM client. This is protected using cookies. The controller would return an unauthorized response with the claims challenge, if the WebApiMsalUiRequiredException is thrown.</p>


  public class AdminApiCallsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly AdminApiClientService _userApiClientService;
   
    public AdminApiCallsController(
		AdminApiClientService userApiClientService)
    {
        _userApiClientService = userApiClientService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Get()
    {
        try
        {
            return Ok(await _userApiClientService.GetApiDataAsync());
        }
        catch (WebApiMsalUiRequiredException hex)
        {
            var claimChallenge = WwwAuthenticateParameters
				.GetClaimChallengeFromResponseHeaders(hex.Headers);
            return Unauthorized(claimChallenge);
        }
    }
}
  


<p>In the Blazor WASM client, an AuthorizedHandler is implemented to handle the unauthorized response from the API. If the “acr” claim is returned, the CAE step method is called.</p>


  public class AuthorizedHandler : DelegatingHandler
{
    private readonly HostAuthenticationStateProvider _authenticationStateProvider;

    public AuthorizedHandler(
		HostAuthenticationStateProvider authenticationStateProvider)
    {
        _authenticationStateProvider = authenticationStateProvider;
    }

    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(
        HttpRequestMessage request,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider
			.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
        HttpResponseMessage responseMessage;
        if (authState.User.Identity!= null &amp;&amp; 
			!authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            // if user is not authenticated, 
			// immediately set response status to 401 Unauthorized
            responseMessage = new HttpResponseMessage(
				HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized);
        }
        else
        {
            responseMessage = await base.SendAsync(
				request, cancellationToken);
        }

        if (responseMessage.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)
        {
            var content = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

            // if server returned 401 Unauthorized, redirect to login page
            if (content != null &amp;&amp; content.Contains("acr")) // CAE
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.CaeStepUp(content);
            }
            else // standard
            {
                _authenticationStateProvider.SignIn();
            }
        }

        return responseMessage;
    }
}
  


<p>The CaeStepUp method is implemented in the Blazor WASM client and creates a claims challenge with the defined claims challenge and the URL of the WASM client page for the redirect.</p>


  public void CaeStepUp(string claimsChallenge, string? customReturnUrl = null)
{
	var returnUrl = customReturnUrl != null 
		? _navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(customReturnUrl).ToString() : null;
		
	var encodedReturnUrl = 
		Uri.EscapeDataString(returnUrl ?? _navigation.Uri);
	var logInUrl = _navigation.ToAbsoluteUri(
		$"{LogInPath}?claimsChallenge={claimsChallenge}&amp;returnUrl={encodedReturnUrl}");
		
	_navigation.NavigateTo(logInUrl.ToString(), true);
}
  


<p>The account login sends a challenge to Azure AD to request the claims for the CAE. </p>


  [HttpGet("Login")]

<p>This article shows how to use multiple Azure B2C user flows from a single ASP.NET Core application. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the authentication in the client. This is not so easy to implement with multiple schemes as the user flow policy is used in most client URLs and the Microsoft.Identity.Web package overrides an lot of the default settings. I solved this by implementing an account controller to handle the Azure B2C signup user flow initial request and set the Azure B2C policy. It can be useful to split the user flows in the client application, if the user of the application needs to be guided better.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread">https://github.com/damienbod/azureb2c-fed-azuread</a></p>



<p>The Azure B2C user flows can be implemented as simple user flows. I used a signup flow and a signin, signup flow.</p>







<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication is used to implement a standard Azure B2C client. There is no need to implement a second scheme and override the default settings of the Microsoft.Identity.Web client because we use a controller to select the flow.</p>


  string[]? initialScopes = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(
	"UserApiOne:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration, "AzureAdB2C")
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
	.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.Configure&lt;MicrosoftIdentityOptions&gt;(
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
	options.Events.OnTokenValidated = async context =&gt;
	{
		if (ApplicationServices != null &amp;&amp; context.Principal != null)
		{
			using var scope = ApplicationServices.CreateScope();
			context.Principal = await scope.ServiceProvider
				.GetRequiredService&lt;MsGraphClaimsTransformation&gt;()
				.TransformAsync(context.Principal);
		}
	};
});
  


<p>The AzureAdB2C app settings configures the sign in, sign up flow. The SignUpSignInPolicyId setting is used to configure the default user flow policy. </p>


  "AzureAdB2C": {
    "Instance": "https://b2cdamienbod.b2clogin.com",
    "ClientId": "8cbb1bd3-c190-42d7-b44e-42b20499a8a1",
    "Domain": "b2cdamienbod.onmicrosoft.com",
    "SignUpSignInPolicyId": "B2C_1_signup_signin",
    "TenantId": "f611d805-cf72-446f-9a7f-68f2746e4724",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc",
    // "ClientSecret": "--use-secrets--"
},
  


<p>The AccountSignUpController is used to set the policy of the flow we would like to use. The SignUpPolicy method just challenges the  Azure B2C OpenID Connect server with the correct policy.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI.Areas.MicrosoftIdentity.Controllers;

[AllowAnonymous]
[Route("MicrosoftIdentity/[controller]/[action]")]
public class AccountSignUpController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("{scheme?}")]
    public IActionResult SignUpPolicy(
        [FromRoute] string scheme,
        [FromQuery] string redirectUri)
    {
        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        string redirect;
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(redirectUri) &amp;&amp; Url.IsLocalUrl(redirectUri))
        {
            redirect = redirectUri;
        }
        else
        {
            redirect = Url.Content("~/")!;
        }

        scheme ??= OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;

        var properties = new AuthenticationProperties 
           { RedirectUri = redirect };
        properties.Items[Constants.Policy] = "B2C_1_signup";
        return Challenge(properties, scheme);
    }
}
  


<p>The Razor page opens a link to the new controller and challenges the OIDC server with the correct policy.</p>


  &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
	&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" 
href="/MicrosoftIdentity/AccountSignUp/SignUpPolicy"&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
  


<p>With this approach, an ASP.NET Core application can be extended with multiple user flows and the UI can be improved for the end user as required.</p>

<p>In this post, I would like to look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using an implemented gateway service to process all UI API requests, optimize the business and remove some of the complexity from the user interface application.</p>



<p>Setup with UI using APIs directly</p>



<p>Modern public facing applications APIs used by UI apps are mostly protected using user delegated access tokens and the applications APIs are in the public zone because the SPA application or whatever client you use needs to request data. The API data is merged directly in the client. Each API can be secured with a separate scope and the client application would need to manage multiple access tokens. Each API would need to allow CORS for an SPA client. (You could use something like Azure Gateway as a workaround for this.) If a server rendered application was used to access the API, this is not required. With this approach, multiple APIs are exposed in the public zone.</p>







<p>Characteristics of this solution</p>



<p>UI responsible for joining API calls for different views</p>



<p>Multiple UIs per module, API, micro service possible</p>



<p>Setup with gateway implementation (BFF or API implementation)</p>



<p>All applications still need to implement HTTPS and the gateway should not terminate the HTTPS. All applications still require HTTPS only access and HTTP should not be used (in development as well). Then all the security headers can be applied in all services to the max.</p>



<p>Many micro services implementations do not optimize the API for the UI. This is not really a good idea, if using the APIs directly in a UI. By implementing a gateway service, the micro service APIs can be optimized for the UI through the gateway. This makes it possible to remove lots of unrequired or unoptimized APIs calls and reduces the amount of logic required in the UI to implement the required business.</p>



<p>The application gateway should not be used to apply missing security headers to new APIs or APIs created as part of your system. The security headers should be implemented where the responses are created. If using a legacy application where the security headers are missing and cannot be implemented at the source, then using the gateway in this way is good.</p>



<p>The application gateway could be implemented as a reverse proxy to delegate the requests onto further applications, APIs. This is good because the further APIs do not need to be exposed to the internet and the attack surface is reduced as well as the amount of APIs in the public zone. Less is more.</p>







<p>Characteristics of this solution</p>



<p>API calls can be optimized for the UI</p>



<p>Security can be improved by reducing the public attack surface</p>



<p>User authorization could be moved to the gateway service</p>



<p>UI and gateway could be deployed together with improved security (BFF security arch and single security client)</p>



<p>Gateway single point of failure</p>



<p>Comparing the security of the Gateway, no Gateway solutions</p>



<p>Improved application security with Gateway</p>



<p>By using a gateway, the attack surface can be reduced in the public zone. The gateway API can use a user delegated access token (or a cookie if using a server rendered application or BFF architecture) All other applications can use application tokens (OAuth client credentials flow), certificate authentication or Azure managed identities to protect the APIs. It is important that the APIs are secured and that the public user access token does not work with the private APIs.</p>



<p>Easier to implement systems tests for services</p>



<p>It is hard to implement system tests for APIs using user access tokens. These tokens can only be created using a UI test tool. The correct flow requires user interaction to authenticate. Creating a back door with some type of application access is not a good idea as this usually gets deployed in some form or other. With a gateway, it is still hard to test the gateway, but with all the private APIs, system tests can be created to test with little effort.</p>



<p>CORS, same domain, same site</p>



<p>Only the public facing gateway API needs to allow CORS if using from an SPA application. All the private APIs can completely disable this and all can use the full set of security headers. If using cookies, same site and same domain can be forced on the single gateway, UI application.</p>



<p>User authorization</p>



<p>Authorization for identities with users can be reduced and most of the implementation would be rolled out in the gateway as well as been used in the user interface. The private APIs would need less complicated authorization as only the trusted application requests must be validated and not user authorization. It is not a must, that the system implements in this way, different security setups are possible like the OBO flow for the private APIs.</p>



<p>More choice for authorization in the private APIs.</p>



<p>As the private APIs are trusted APP to APP security, managed identities or certificate authentication could be used as well as OAuth client credentials. This allows for more choice but the APIs must still implement security in the application and not relay on the network security alone. I usually use the OAuth CC flow with a scope claim or role claim validation. The access tokens used for access must be validated. I never mix user access tokens and application tokens in a single API.</p>



<p>Notes</p>



<p>KISS is probably the most important way of thinking when producing software. Most solutions can be implemented as a single monolith application and the end client gets what is required with the least amount of effort. Micro services are normally not required for most solutions. Once using micro services, it is important to implement this correctly and with a solid security architecture which requires effort and planning. Do not be afraid to merge services if you see that the are tightly coupled and depend on each other. Define the public zone and private zone and where each micro service belongs. Implement the hosting environment which allows for a good application security implementation as well as a good network infrastructure. HTTP should not be used anywhere.</p>

<p>This post shows how to setup a Keycloak external authentication in an OpenIddict identity provider using ASP.NET Core identity. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreOpeniddict</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solution context implements OpenID Connect clients which use an OpenIddict identity provider and ASP.NET Core Identity to manage the accounts. All clients authenticate using the OpenIddict server. Keycloak is used as an external authentication provider on the OpenIddict identity provider. Users can be created in either identity provider. If only users are created on the Keycloak server, the direct sign in with username, password can be completely disabled in the OpenIddict server. This setup allows for great flexibility and the MFA can be forced anywhere depending on the requirements. Companies using the product can use their own identity provider. </p>







<p>Integrating an OpenID Connect conform client is really simple in ASP.NET Core and no extra Nuget packages are required. You only need extra packages when the IDP are not conform or do something vendor specific.  The AddOpenIdConnect method is used to implement the Keycloak server. I set this up using this <a href="https://github.com/tuxiem/AspNetCore-keycloak">github</a> repo and the Keycloak docs. The SignInScheme needs to be set to the correct value. ASP.NET Core Identity is used to map the external identities and the “Identity.External” is the default scheme used for this. If you need to disable local identity users, the ASP.NET Core Identity logic can be scaffolded into the project and adapted.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddOpenIdConnect("KeyCloak", "KeyCloak", options =&gt;
	{
		options.SignInScheme = "Identity.External";
		//Keycloak server
		options.Authority = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ServerRealm"];
		//Keycloak client ID
		options.ClientId = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ClientId"];
		//Keycloak client secret in user secrets for dev
		options.ClientSecret = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["ClientSecret"];
		//Keycloak .wellknown config origin to fetch config
		options.MetadataAddress = Configuration.GetSection("Keycloak")["Metadata"];
		//Require keycloak to use SSL
		
		options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
		options.Scope.Add("openid");
		options.Scope.Add("profile");
		options.SaveTokens = true;
		options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
		options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; //dev

		options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
		{
			NameClaimType = "name",
			RoleClaimType = ClaimTypes.Role,
			ValidateIssuer = true
		};
	});
  


<p>The Keycloak configuration is added to the app.settings. We do not need much, a standard OpenID connect confidential code flow client with PKCE is setup to authenticate using Keycloak. This can be adapted, changed in almost any way depending on the server requirements. You should stick to the standards when implementing this. Using PKCE is required now on most deployments when using the OIDC code flow. Any identity providers solutions which does not support this should be avoided.</p>


    "Keycloak": {
    "ServerRealm": "http://localhost:8080/realms/myrealm",
    "Metadata": "http://localhost:8080/realms/myrealm/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "ClientId": "oidc-code-pkce",
    // "ClientSecret": "--in user secrets or keyvault--"
  },
  


<p>The Keycloak server is setup to use the standard settings. You could improve the security of this using token exchange or further supported specifications from Keycloak and ASP.NET Core.</p>







<p>Notes:</p>



<p>Using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core to federate to further identity providers, it is really easy to support best practice application security and also integrate any third party identity systems without surprises. Having full control of your identity provider is a good thing and by using federation, you do not need to manage the user accounts. This can be fully implemented on the client system. If the application requires strong MFA like FIDO2, this can also be easily implemented in ASP.NET Core. Using some of the cloud solution IDPs prevents you implementing strong application security. These cloud systems do provide excellent user accounting and it would be nice to use this and combine this with a top identity provider.</p>



<p>If implementing a product which needs to support multiple different identity providers from different clients, then you should implement the identity provider as part of your solution context and federate to the client systems. </p>

<p>This article shows how Azure AD continuous access (CA) can be used in an ASP.NET Core UI application to force MFA when using an administrator API from a separate ASP.NET Core application. Both applications are secured using Microsoft.Identity.Web. An ASP.NET Core Razor Page application is used to implement the UI application. The API is implemented with swagger open API and ASP.NET Core. An Azure AD conditional access authentication context is used to implement the MFA requirement. An Azure AD CAE policy is setup which requires the defines MFA and uses the context.</p>

<p>CAE is available to everyone , including free tenants.<br>CA Auth Context requires AAD P1, as its dependent on the CA feature, which is only available to AAD P1 and above.</p>



<p>Requirements</p>



  Azure AD tenant with P1 license for CA Auth Context  Microsoft Graph   



<p>Create a Conditional access Authentication Context</p>



<p>A Continuous access evaluation (CAE) authentication context was created using Microsoft Graph and can be viewed in the portal. In this demo, like the Microsoft <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-dotnetcore-ca-auth-context-app">sample</a> application, three authentication contexts are created using Microsoft Graph. The Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess permissions are required to change the CAE authentication contexts.</p>



<p>This is only needed to create the CA authentication contexts. Once created, this can be used in the target applications. </p>


  public async Task CreateAuthContextViaGraph(string acrKey, string acrValue)
{
	await _graphAuthContextAdmin.CreateAuthContextClassReferenceAsync(
		acrKey, 
		acrValue, 
		$"A new Authentication Context Class Reference created at {DateTime.UtcNow}", 
		true);
}

public async Task&lt;AuthenticationContextClassReference?&gt; 
	CreateAuthContextClassReferenceAsync(
		string id, 
		string displayName, 
		string description, 
		bool IsAvailable)
{
	try
	{
		var acr = await _graphServiceClient
			.Identity
			.ConditionalAccess
			.AuthenticationContextClassReferences
			.Request()
			.AddAsync(new AuthenticationContextClassReference
			{
				Id = id,
				DisplayName = displayName,
				Description = description,
				IsAvailable = IsAvailable,
				ODataType = null
			});

		return acr;
	}
	catch (ServiceException e)
	{
		_logger.LogWarning(
		"We could not add a new ACR: {exception}",  e.Error.Message);

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>The created conditional access authentication context can be viewed in the portal in the Security blade of the Azure AD tenant. </p>







<p>If you open the context, you can see the id used. This is used in the applications to check the MFA requirement.</p>







<p>Create a CAE policy to use the context</p>



<p>Now that a authentication context exists, a CAE policy can be created to use this. I created a policy to require MFA.</p>







<p>Implement the API and use the CAE context</p>



<p>The API application needs to validate if the access token contains the acrs claim with the c1 value. If CAE is activated and the claim is included in the token, then any policies which use this CAE authentication context must be fulfilled or no events have been received which inform the client that this access token is invalid. A lot of things need to be implemented correctly for this to work. If configured correctly, a MFA step up authentication is required to use the API. The API returns an unauthorized response as specified in the OpenID Connect signals and events specification, if the claim is missing from the access token. This is handled by the calling UI application.</p>

<p>The API uses the CAE scoped service to validate the CAE authentication context and either the data is returned or an unauthorized exception is returned. The Authorize attribute is also used to validate the JWT bearer token and validate that the authentication policy is supported. You could probably implement middleware to check the CAE authentication context as well.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", AuthenticationSchemes = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)]

[Route("[controller]")]
public class ApiForUserDataController : ControllerBase

    }
}
  


<p>The program file adds the services and secure the API using Microsoft.Identity.Web. A policy is created to used on the controllers.</p>


  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;CaeClaimsChallengeService&gt;();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(builder.Configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
    .AddMicrosoftGraph(builder.Configuration.GetSection("GraphBeta"))
    .AddDistributedTokenCaches();

JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims = false;
//IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;

builder.Services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;

    options.AddPolicy("ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", validateAccessTokenPolicy =&gt;

        // If a client certificate was used for authentication, the value is "2".
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
    });
});
  


<p>The program file is used to setup the API ASP.NET Core API project like any Azure AD Microsoft.Identity.Web client.</p>

  "GraphBeta": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta",
    "Scopes": "Policy.Read.ConditionalAccess Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"
  },
  


<p>Now that the unauthorized exception is returned to the calling UI interactive client, this needs to be handled.</p>



<p>Implement the ASP.NET Core Razor Page with step up MFA check</p>



<p>The UI project implements a Web APP project. The Admin API scope is requested to access the admin API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration, 
       "AzureAd", 
       subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents: true)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new[] { 
       builder.Configuration.GetSection("AdminApi")["Scope"] })
    .AddMicrosoftGraph(builder.Configuration.GetSection("GraphBeta"))
    .AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p>The app uses a scoped service to request data from the administrator API. Using the ITokenAcquisition interface, an access token is request for the API. If an unauthorized response is returned, then a WebApiMsalUiRequiredException exception is thrown with the response headers.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;?&gt; GetApiDataAsync()
{
	var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

	var scopes = new List&lt;string&gt; { _adminApiScope };
	var accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition
		.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(scopes);

	client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_adminApiBaseUrl);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = 
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
		new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

	var response = await client.GetAsync("ApiForUserData");
	if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
	{
		var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
		var payload = await JsonSerializer
			.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(stream);

		return payload;
	}

	// This exception can be used to handle a claims challenge
	throw new WebApiMsalUiRequiredException(
		$"Unexpected status code in the HttpResponseMessage: {response.StatusCode}.", 
		response);
}
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core Razor page is used to handled the WebApiMsalUiRequiredException exception. If this is returned, a new ClaimChallenge is created with the request for the authentication context. This is returned to the UI. If this response is returned, the user is redirected to authenticate again for the new scope which must fulfil the CAE policy using this.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet()
{
	try
	{
		Data = await _userApiClientService.GetApiDataAsync();
		return Page();
	}
	catch (WebApiMsalUiRequiredException hex)
	{
		// Challenges the user if exception is thrown from Web API.
		try
		{
			var claimChallenge = WwwAuthenticateParameters
				.GetClaimChallengeFromResponseHeaders(hex.Headers);

			_consentHandler.ChallengeUser(
				new string[] { "user.read" }, claimChallenge);

			return Page();
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			_consentHandler.HandleException(ex);
		}

		_logger.LogInformation("{hexMessage}", hex.Message);
	}

	return Page();
}
  


<p>MFA is configured in a policy using the CAE conditional access authentication context.</p>



<p>Notes</p>



<p>The application will only work with Azure AD and if the continuous access evaluation policies are implemented correctly by the Azure IT tenant admin. You cannot force this in the application, you can only use this. </p>

<p>Azure App registration setup</p>



<p>The Azure App registration is setup as in this blog:</p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/03/28/implementing-oauth2-app-to-app-security-using-azure-ad-from-a-web-app/">Implementing OAuth2 APP to APP security using Azure AD from a Web&nbsp;APP</a></p>



<p>An Azure App registration was then created to request new access tokens. The access_as_application claim is validated in the API.</p>



<p>API</p>



<p>The service API is implemented to validate the access tokens. The azp claim is used to validate that the token was requested using the known client ID and the secret. It does not validate who sent the access token, just that this client ID and secret was used to request the access token. The client credentials flow should only be used by trusted clients. The azpacr is used to validate how the token was requested. This is a confidential client. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the API security.</p>

IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;
JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultMapInboundClaims = false;

services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, HasServiceApiRoleHandler&gt;();

	});
});
  


<p>Microsoft.Identity.Client OAuth Client credentials client</p>



<p>A console application is used to implement the client credentials trusted application. A console application cannot be trusted unless it is deployed to a trusted host. It would be better to use a certificate to secure this and even better if this was not a console application but instead some server deployed Azure service which uses Key Vault to persist it’s secrets and managed identities to access the secret. The ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder is used to create a new CC flow. The access token is used to access the API.</p>

<p>The console application uses app settings to load the trusted client. The Scope is defined to use the application ID from the Azure App registration and the .default scope. Then any API definitions will be added to the access token. It is important to used V2 access tokens which can be defined in the manifest.</p>

<p>The access tokens returned contains the claims with the azp, roles and azpacr claims. These claims as well as the standard claims values are used to authorize each request. Authorize attributes are used with a match scheme and authorization policy which uses the claims to validate. The Azure definitions are used in the policies and the policies are used in the application. You should not use the Azure definitions directly in the application. Avoid using Roles or RequiredScope directly in controllers or specific application parts. Map these in the IClaimsTransformation or the OnTokenValidated method.</p>

<p>Implementing the application permissions in this way makes is possible to secure any daemon application or application flow with no user with a server for any deployment. The client can be hosted in an ASP.NET Core application which authenticates using Azure B2C or a service with no user interaction. The client and the API work alone. It is important that the client can be trusted to secure the secret used to request the access tokens. </p>

<p>Recently, we and a number of our neighbors have been noticing our lights flickering in the evening and early morning. While we have considered it to be mostly an annoyance, this has bothered some of our neighbors enough that they have opened cases with the utility and began raising the issue on our street mailing list.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas and Electric</a> (PG&amp;E) responded to these customers with a visit, and in some cases replaced the service entrance cable to the home. In at least one case PG&amp;E also said they might need to replace the pole transformer, which would take a few months to complete. I have heard no reports that these efforts have made any difference.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://altmode.org/2020/09/08/line-voltage-fluctuations/">isn’t our first recent challenge</a> with voltage regulation in our neighborhood. Our most recent issue was a longer-term voltage regulation problem that occurred on hot days, apparently due to load from air conditioners and the fact that our neighborhood is fed by older 4-kilovolt service from the substation. This is different, and raised several questions:</p>



  How local are the anomalies? Are neighbors on different parts of the street seeing the same anomalies, or are they localized to particular pole transformers or individual homes?  What is the duration and nature of the anomalies?  Are they only happening in the evening and early morning, or do we just notice them at these times?  



<p>To try to answer these questions, I found a test rig that I built several years ago when we were noticing some dimming of our lights, apparently due to neighbors’ air conditioners starting on summer evenings. The test rig consists of a pair of filament transformers: 110 volt to 6 volt transformers that were used in equipment with electronic tubes, which typically used 6 volts to heat the tube’s filament. The transformers are connected in cascade to reduce the line voltage to a suitable level for the line-in audio input on a computer. An open-source audio editing program, <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, is used to record the line voltage. I often joke that this is a very boring recording: mostly just a continuous 60 hertz tone.</p>



<p>At the same time, I started recording the times our lights flickered (or my uninterruptable power supply clicked, another symptom). I asked my neighbors to record when they see their lights flicker and report that back to me.</p>



<p>I created a collection of 24-hour recordings of the power line, and went looking for the reported power anomalies. It was a bit of a tedious process, because not everyone’s clocks are exactly synchronized. But I was successful in identifying several power anomalies that were observed by neighbors on opposite ends of the street (about three blocks). Here’s a typical example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/powerglitch.png"></a>Typical power anomaly



<p>As you can see, the problem is very short in duration, about 60 milliseconds or so.</p>



<p>I was getting a lot of flicker reports, and as I mentioned, searching for these anomalies was tedious. So I began looking at the analysis capabilities of Audacity. I noticed a <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/silence_finder.html">Silence Finder</a> plug-in and attempted to search for the anomalies using that tool. But Silence Finder is designed to find the kind of silence that one might find between tracks on an LP: very quiet for a second or so. Not surprisingly, Silence Finder didn’t find anything for me.</p>



<p>I noticed that Silence Finder is written in a specialized Lisp-like signal processing language known as <a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/nyquist.html">Nyquist</a>. So I had a look at the source code, which is included with Audacity, and was able to understand quite a bit of what was going on. For efficiency reasons, Silence Finder down-samples the input data so it doesn’t have to deal with as much data. In order to search for shorter anomalies, I needed to change that, as well as the user interface limits on minimum silence duration. Also, the amplitude of the silence was expressed in dB, which makes sense for audio but I needed more sensitivity to subtle changes in amplitude. So I changed the silence amplitude from dB to a linear voltage value.</p>



<p>The result was quite helpful. The modified plug-in, which I called “Glitch Finder”, was able to quite reliably find voltage anomalies. For example:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220129-170512-1.png"></a>Power recording 1/29/2022-1/30/2022



<p>The label track generated by Glitch Finder points out the location of the anomalies (at 17:05:12, 23:00:12, and 7:17:56 the next morning), although they’re not visible at this scale. Zoom in a few times and they become quite obvious:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/20220130-071756.png"></a>Power anomaly at 1/30/2022 7:17:56



<p>Thus far I have reached these tentative conclusions:</p>



  The power problems are primarily common to the neighborhood, and unlikely to be caused by a local load transient such as plugging an electric car in.  They seem to be concentrated mainly in the evening (4-11 pm) and morning (6-10 am). These seem to be times when power load is changing, due to heating, cooking, lighting, and home solar power systems going off and on at sunset and sunrise.  The longer term voltage goes up or down a bit at the time of a power anomaly. This requires further investigation, but may be due to switching activity by the utility.  



 Further work 



<p>As usual, a study like this often raises new questions about as quickly as it answers questions. Here are a few that I’m still curious about.</p>



  What is the actual effect on lights that causes people to notice these anomalies so easily? I currently have an oscilloscope connected to a photoelectric cell, set to trigger when the lights flash. It will be interesting to see how that compares with the magnitude of the anomaly.  Do LED lights manifest this more than incandescent bulbs? It seems unlikely that such a short variation would affect the filament temperature of an incandescent bulb significantly.  Do the anomalies correlate with any longer-term voltage changes? My test rig measures long-term voltage in an uncalibrated way, but the processing I’m currently doing doesn’t make it easy to look at longer-term voltage changes as well.

<p>This post exists to collect my notes on displaying a USB webcam on the Raspberry Pi HDMI outputs. This is not the same as streaming the webcam (easy), and this is not for use with the Raspberry Pi camera module. This is specifically for USB UVC webcams.</p>
<p>Note: Do not actually do this, it's terrible.</p>
<p>Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite, you don't want the full desktop environment.</p>
<p>Once you boot the Pi, install VLC and the X windows environment:</p>
 sudo apt install vlc xinit 
<p>Configure your Pi to boot to the command line already logged in, using the tool raspi-config.</p>
<p>Create the file ~/.bash_profile with the following contents which will start X on boot:</p>
   if [ -z $DISPLAY ] &amp;&amp; [ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]
  <br>
  then
  <br>
  startx
  <br>
  fi
 
<p>Create the file ~/.xinitrc to launch VLC streaming the webcam when X launches:</p>
   #!/bin/bash
  <br>
  cvlc v4l2:// :v4l2-dev=/dev/video0
 
<p>Now you can reboot the Pi with a webcam plugged in and you'll get a full screen view of the camera.</p>
<p>If your webcam isn't recognized when it first boots up, you'll need to quit VLC and start it again. You can quit by pressing ctrl-Q, then type startx to restart it after you plug the camera back in. If that doesn't work, you might have to SSH in and kill the process that way.</p>
<p>There are many problems with this approach:</p>
 
   It seems VLC is not hardware accelerated so there is pretty bad tearing of the image 
   Sometimes the webcam isn't recognized when the Pi boots up and I have to unplug it and plug it back in when it boots and restart the script 
   The image tearing and stuttering is completely unusable for pretty much anything 
 
<p>Do you know of a better solution? Let me know!</p>
<p>So far I haven't found anything that actually works, and I've searched all the forums and tried all the solutions with guvcview and omxplayer with no luck so far.</p>
<p>For some other better solutions, check out my blog post and video&nbsp;<a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2022/01/11/8/convert-usb-webcam-to-hdmi">How to Convert USB Webcams to HDMI</a>.</p>

<p>This step-by-step guide will show you how to use the chroma key feature on the YoloBox Pro to green screen yourself onto picture backgrounds and videos, or even add external graphics from a computer.</p>



<p>There are a few different ways to use the green screening feature in the YoloBox. 
You can use it to add a flat virtual background to your video, or you could use it to put yourself over a moving background or other video sources like an overhead or document camera. You could even key yourself over your computer screen showing your slides from a presentation.</p>

 
  
  
 

 
  
  
 

<p>You can also switch things around and instead of removing the background from your main camera, instead you can generate graphics on a computer screen with a green background and add those on top of your video.</p>

 Setting up your green screen 

<p>Before jumping in to the YoloBox, you'll want to make sure your green screen is set up properly. A quick summary of what you'll need to do is:</p>

 
 Light your green screen evenly 
 Light your subject 
 Don't wear anything green 
 

<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH8TWTt51W8">Kevin The Basic Filmmaker's excellent green screen tutorial</a> for a complete guide to these steps!</p>

 Green screening on top of an image 

<p>We'll first look at how to green screen a camera on top of a static image. You can load images in to the YoloBox by putting them on the SD card. I recommend creating your background image at exactly the right size first, 1920x1080.</p>

<p>On the YoloBox, click the little person icon in the top right corner of the camera that you want to remove the green background from.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That will open up the Chroma Key Settings interface.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Turn on the "Keying Switch", and you should see a pretty good key if your green screen is lit well. If you have a blue screen instead of green, you can change that setting here. The "Similarity" and "Smoothness" sliders will affect how the YoloBox does the key. Adjust them until things look right and you don't have too much of your background showing and it isn't eating into your main subject.</p>

<p>Tap on the "Background Image" to choose which image from your SD card to use as the background. Only still graphics are supported.</p>

<p>Click "Done" and this will save your settings into that camera's source.</p>

<p>Now when you tap on that camera on the YoloBox, it will always include the background image in place of the green screen.</p>

<p></p>

 Green screening on top of other video sources 

<p>Green screening yourself on top of other video sources is similar but a slightly different process.</p>

<p>First, set up your HDMI source as described above, but instead of choosing a background image, leave it transparent.</p>

<p>Then click the "Add Video Source" button to create a new picture-in-picture layout.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose "PiP Video" from the options that appear. For the "Main Screen", choose the video angle that you want to use as the full screen background that you'll key yourself on top of. This could be a top down camera or could be your computer screen with alides for a presentation. It will then ask you to choose a "Sub Screen", and that is where you'll choose your camera angle that you've already set up for chroma keying.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is where you can choose how big you want your picture to be, and you can drag it around with your finger to change the position.</p>

<p>Once you save this, your new PiP layout will appear as another camera angle you can switch to.</p>

 Cropping the green screened video 

<p>You may notice that if your green background doesn't cover the entire frame, you'll have black borders on the sides of your chroma keyed image. The YoloBox doesn't exactly have a cropping feature to fix this, but you can use the "Aspect Ratio" setting to crop the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can edit your PiP video settings and choose "1:1" in the Aspect Ratio option to crop your video to a square, removing the black borders from the edges.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding computer graphics using the chroma key 

<p>Lastly, let's look at how to bring in graphics from an external computer source and key them out on the YoloBox.</p>

<p>When you plug in your computer's HDMI to the YoloBox, your computer will see it as an external monitor. Make sure your computer screen isn't mirrored so you can still use your main computer screen separately.</p>

<p>You can generate graphics in any program as long as you can have it use a green background. You can create animated graphics in Keynote for example, but for this tutorial we'll use the app <a href="https://h2r.graphics">H2R Graphics</a>.</p>

<p>In H2R Graphics, you'll first want to make sure you set the background color to a bright green like #00FF00. Then you can open up the main output window and drag it over to your second screen (the YoloBox).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Choose the little person icon in the top right corner of the HDMI input of your computer screen to bring up the keying settings for it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The defaults should look fine, but you can also make any adjustments here if you need. Click "Done" to save the settings.</p>

<p>Now you can create a new PiP layout with your main video as the background and your computer screen keyed out as the foreground or "Sub Screen".</p>

<p>For the Main Screen, choose the video angle you want to use as the background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Sub Screen, choose your computer screen which should now have a transparent background.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now the layout with your H2R Graphics output window is created as the PiP angle you can choose.</p>

<p></p>

 My YoloBox stand 

<p>If you haven't already seen it, be sure to check out my <a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/">YoloBox stand</a> I created! It tilts the YoloBox forward so it's easier to use on a desk, and you can also attach things to the cold shoe mounts on the back.</p>

<p><a href="https://pk1.tv/pk1-yolobox-stand/"></a></p>

<p>We have a version for both the YoloBox Pro and the original YoloBox, and it comes in red and black!</p>

<p>Kim might no longer update his blog, nudge identity products toward his vision or give inspiring, generous talks to audiences large and small, but his influence looms large in the identity industry – an industry Kim changed forever. A lot has been written about Kim’s legacy to the industry already, by people who write far better than yours truly, hence I won’t attempt that here.</p>



<p>I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Kim: I don’t know where I’d be or what I’d be doing if it wouldn’t have been for his ideas and direct sponsorship. That’s something I have firsthand experience on, so I can honor his memory by writing about that.</p>



<p>Back in 2005, still in Italy, I was one of the few Microsoft employees with hands-on, customer deployment experience in WS-STAR, the suite of protocols behind the SOA revolution. That earned me a job offer in Redmond, to evangelize the .NET stack (WCF, workflow, CardSpace) to Fortune 500 companies. That CardSpace thing was puzzling. There was nothing like it, it was ultra hard to develop for, and few people appeared to understand what it was for. One day I had face time with Kim. He introduced me to his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a>, and that changed everything. Suddenly the technology I was working on had a higher purpose, something directly connected to the rights and wellbeing of everyone- and a mission, making user centric identity viable and adopted. I gave myself to the mission with abandon, and Kim helped in every step of the way:</p>



  He invested time in developing me professionally, sharing his master negotiator and genuinely compassionate view of people to counter my abrasive personality back then  He looped me in important conversations, inside and outside the company- conversations way above my pay grade or actual experience at that point. He introduced me to all sorts of key people, and helped me understand what was going on. Perhaps the most salient example is the initiative he led to bring together the different identity products Microsoft had in the late 2000s (and culminating in <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2008/10/28/identity-pdc08-roadmap-session-with-kim-cameron-himself-yours-truly/">a joint presentation we delivered at PDC2008</a>). The company back then was a very different place, and his steely determination coupled with incredible consensus building skills forever changed my perception of what’s possible and how to influence complex, sometimes adversarial organizations.&nbsp;  He really taught me to believe in myself and in a mission. That’s thanks to his encouragement that I approached Joan Murray (then acquisition editor at Addison Wesley) on the expo floor of some event, pitching to her a book that the world absolutely needs about cardspace and user centric identity, and once accepted finding the energy to learn everything (putting together a ToC, recruiting coauthors, writing in English…) as an evenings and weekends project. Kim generously wrote the foreword for us, and <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=927">relentlessly promoted the book</a>.<br>His sponsorship continued even after the CardSpace project, promoting <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1160">my other books</a> and activities (like those <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1095">U-prove videos now lost in time</a>).&nbsp;  



<p>Those are just the ones top of mind. I am sure that if”d dig in his or my blog, I’d find countless more. It’s been a huge privilege to work so closely with Kim, and especially to benefit from his mentorship and friendship. I never, ever took that privilege for granted. Although Kim always seemed to operate under the assumption that everyone had something of value to contribute, and talking with him made you feel heard, he wasn’t shy in calling out trolls or people who in his view would <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=853">stifle community efforts</a>.</p>



<p>When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven stance.</p>



<p>That, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1190">Kim’s temporary retirement from Microsoft</a> and eventually my move to Auth0 made my interactions with Kim less frequent. It was always nice to run into him at conferences; we kept backchanneling whenever industry news called for coordinated responses; and he reached out to me once to discuss SSI, but we never had a chance to do so. As cliche’ as it might be, I now deeply regret not having reached out more myself.<br>Last time I heard from him, it was during a <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet/status/1452848874339454979?s=20">reunion of the CardSpace team</a>. It was a joyous occasion, seeing so many people that for a time all worked to realize his vision, and touched in various degrees by his influence. His health didn’t allow him to attend in person, but he called in – we passed the phone around, exchanging pleasantries without knowing we were saying our goodbyes. I remember his “hello Vittorio” as I picked up the phone from Mike- his cordial, even sweet tone as he put his usual care in pronouncing my name just right- right there to show the kindness this giant used with us all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a handful of interesting USB webcams out there, which naturally work great with a computer. But what if you want to combine video from a USB webcam with your HDMI cameras in a video switcher like the ATEM Mini?</p>
<p>Most video switchers don't have a way to plug in USB webcams. That's because webcams are expected to plug in to a computer, and most video switchers aren't really computers. Thankfully over the past few years, UVC has become a standard for webcams, so there is no more worry about installing manufacturer-specific drivers for webcams anymore. For the most part, you can take any USB webcam and plug it into a computer and it will Just Work™.</p>
<p>I'm going to show you three different ways you can convert a USB UVC webcam to HDMI so you can use them with hardware video switchers like the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>You can see a video version of this blog post on my YouTube channel!</p>



 Method 1: QuickTime Player 
<p>The simplest option is to use QuickTime on a Mac computer. For this, you'll need a Mac of course, as well as an HDMI output from the computer.</p>
<p>First, plug in the HDMI from your computer into your video switcher. Your computer will see it as a second monitor. In your display settings, make sure your computer is not mirroring the display. You want the computer to see the ATEM Mini or other video switcher as a secondary external display.</p>
<p>If you're doing this with the ATEM Mini, it's helpful to have a monitor plugged in to the ATEM Mini's HDMI output port, and then you can show your computer screen full screen on the ATEM's output by selecting that input's button in the "output" selector on the right side of the controls. This is important since you'll want to be able to navigate around the second screen a bit in the next steps.</p>
<p>Next, open QuickTime Player. Plug in your USB webcam into your computer. In the QuickTime "File" menu, choose "New Movie Recording". A window should appear with your default webcam. Click the little arrow next to the record button and you should see all your connected cameras as an option. Choose the USB camera you want to use and you should see it in the main video window.</p>

  

<p>Now drag that QuickTime window onto your second monitor that is actually the ATEM Mini. Click the green button in the top left corner to make the window full screen. Now what you see on the ATEM Mini should be just the full screen video. Make sure you move your cursor back to your main monitor so that it doesn't show up on the screen.</p>
<p>You're all set! You can switch the ATEM back to the multiview and you should see your webcam feed as one of the video inputs you can switch to.</p>
 Method 2: OBS 
<p>OBS is a powerful tool for doing all sorts of interesting things with video on your computer. You can use it to run a livestream, switching between multiple cameras and adding graphics on top. What we're going to use it for now is a simple way to get your USB cameras to show up on a second monitor attached to your computer.</p>
<p>Another benefit of OBS is that it is cross platform, so this method will work on Mac, Windows or Linux!</p>
<p>The basic idea is to create a scene in OBS that is just a full screen video of the webcam you want to use. Then you'll tell OBS to output that video on your second monitor, but the second monitor will actually be your computer's HDMI output plugged in to the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>First, create a new scene, call it whatever you want, I'll call mine "Webcam". Inside that scene, add a new source of type "Video Capture Device". I'll call mine "Webcam Source".</p>

  

<p>When you create the source, it will ask you which video capture device you want to use, so choose your desired webcam at this step.</p>
<p>At this point you should see the webcam feed in the OBS main window. If it's not full screen, that's probably because the webcam is not full 1920x1080 resolution. You can drag the handles on the video to resize the picture to take up the full 1920x1080 screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, right click anywhere in the main video window and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Preview)". Or if you use OBS in "Studio Mode", right click on the right pane and choose "Fullscreen Projector (Program)". Choose your secondary monitor that's plugged in to the ATEM, and OBS should take over that monitor and show just the video feed.</p>
 Method 3: Hardware Encoder 
<p>If you don't want to tie up a computer with this task, or don't have the space for a computer, another option is to use a dedicated hardware encoder to convert the USB webcam to HDMI.</p>
<p>There aren't a lot of options on the market for this right now, likely because it's not a super common thing to need to do. Currently, any device that can convert a UVC webcam to HDMI is basically a tiny computer. One example is the YoloBox which can accept some USB webcams as a video source alongside HDMI cameras. You could use the YoloBox to convert the USB camera to HDMI using the HDMI output of the YoloBox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is this <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS2603au encoder/decoder</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>I originally was sent this device by TBS because I was interested in using it as an RTMP server. I wasn't able to figure that out, and have since switched to using the <a href="https://aaronpk.tv/timestamps/#magewell">Magewell Pro Convert</a> as an RTMP server which has been working great. But as I was poking around in the menus I realized that the TBS2603au has a USB port which can accept webcams!</p>
<p>So here are the step by step instructions for setting up the TBS2603au to output a USB webcam over its HDMI port.</p>
<p>The TBS2603au is controlled from its web interface. I'm going to assume you already know how to connect this to your network and configure the IP address and get to the device's web page. The default username and password are "admin" and "admin". Once you log in, you'll see a dashboard like this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, click on the "Encode" icon in the top bar. At the bottom, turn off the HDMI toggle and turn on the one next to USB.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the "Extend" tab in the top menu and choose "Video Mix".</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the "Output Config" section and change "Mix Enable" to "Off", and choose "USBCam" from the "Video Source" option.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point you should see your webcam's picture out the device's HDMI port!&nbsp;And if that's plugged in to the ATEM Mini, your webcam will appear in your multiview!</p>
<p></p>

<p>I've tried this with a few different webcams and they all work great!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/uHHcs0A">OBSBot Tiny</a> is an auto-tracking PTZ camera that follows your face. The nice thing is that the camera itself is doing the face tracking, so no drivers are required!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Ds8ko3">Elgato FaceCam</a> is a high quality webcam for your PC, and it also works with this device. Although at that point you should probably just get a DSLR/mirrorless camera to use with the ATEM Mini.</p>
<p>This even works with the <a href="https://geni.us/MAcd">Insta360 One X2</a> in webcam mode. You won't get a full 360 picture, since in webcam mode the Insta360 One X2 uses only one of its two cameras. It does do some auto-tracking though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/mevo-3-pack">Mevo Start</a> cameras are another interesting option, since you can crop in to specific parts of the video using a phone as a remote control.</p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with this method to be aware of. I wasn't able to find a way to output audio from the USB webcam, which means you will need to get your audio into the ATEM from another camera or external microphone. Another problem was with certain cameras (mainly the OBSBot Tiny), I left the device running overnight and in the morning it had crashed. I suspect it's because the OBSBot requires more power than other cameras due to its PTZ motor.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://geni.us/Z9hTXE">TBS encoder</a> isn't cheap, so it's not something you'd buy to use a generic webcam with your ATEM. But for use with specialized USB webcams like document cameras or PTZ cameras it could be a good option to use those cameras with streaming encoders like the ATEM Mini!</p>
<p>Let me know what USB webcams you'd like to use with your ATEM Mini or other hardware streaming encoder!</p>

<p>Sunday, November 14, 2021</p>



<p>We got an early start, said good-bye to Celeste (who got to stay in the room a little longer), and headed for Paddington Station about 7 am to catch the <a href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com/#/">Heathrow Express</a>. We bought our tickets, got out on the platform, and were greeted with a message board saying that there were delays on the line and that some trains had been canceled. This made us a little nervous, but the Network Rail application on my phone reassured us that there would, in fact, be a train soon. Although we had a bit more than the usual wait for Heathrow Express, the train proceeded normally and was not excessively crowded.</p>



<p>After the usual long walk, we reached the ticket counter and checked in. They were thorough in checking our vaccination and COVID testing status, although not to the point of actually checking the QR codes associated with each. After checking bags, there was another long walk to the vicinity of the gate. United’s lounge in London is still closed, but in the meantime they have an arrangement with Singapore Airlines for the use of their lounge where we were able to get breakfast.</p>



<p>At the gate, Kenna was diverted for extra security screening because the “SSSS” designation was printed on her boarding pass. Following that inconvenience, our flight departed on time, which given that we have only a 2-hour layover in Chicago (including customs and immigration) we appreciated. However, our arrival gate was occupied by another plane, resulting in about a 30 minute delay which made us understandably nervous.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7860.jpg"></a>Greenland from the air



<p>Having seen US Customs signs back in San Francisco promoting the <a href="https://mobilepassport.us/">Mobile Passport</a> immigration application for our phones, we entered our passport information and customs declaration. But after racing to the immigration hall, we were told, “We don’t use that any more. Get in line.” More nervousness about the time. After getting through Customs (which left us outside security), we took the tram to Terminal 1 for our flight to San Francisco.</p>



<p>Here we noticed that Kenna didn’t have the TSA Precheck designation on her boarding card, probably as a result of the SSSS designation earlier. It may not have mattered; there were signs saying precheck was closed and the people checking boarding passes didn’t seem to know. So we both went through the “slow line”, and unfortunately Kenna set something off and had to go through some extra screening. Apparently they thought there was something about one of her shoes, which they ran through the X-ray machine again; more delay. It was interesting that there were a number of women having their shoes rechecked at the same time.</p>



<p>We raced to our gate, nearly the furthest from the security checkpoint, and made it in enough time, but with not much to spare. The ride to San Francisco was unremarkable, and we collected our bags and caught our ride home, according to plan.</p>



 Epilogue 



  
<p>Arriving home we were severely jet lagged as expected, but tried to stay up as late as we could manage. After a few hours of sleep, I awoke about 2 am. I could hear some water dripping, which I attributed to a downspout being clogged with leaves following some recent rainfall. So I got up to investigate, and instead discovered that there was a substantial amount of water dripping from the ceiling into our guest room. It turns out that a hot water pipe in the attic had developed a pinhole leak and over time had soaked one wall. So we now have a new project.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 13, 2021</p>



<p>London isn’t in Sussex, that’s just the theme of the trip.</p>



<p>Celeste expressed a lot of interest in visiting the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a>, which none of us had visited, so we decided to make that our first destination. After a quick <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> breakfast, we took the Tube to the south side of London. The first thing you notice is the battleship guns at the front. My interest was also piqued by a short segment of Berlin Wall near the front entrance.</p>



<p>The museum has a large collection on several floors, with areas emphasizing World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the Holocaust, etc. One could easily spend several days to see all of the exhibits. Toward the end of our visit, we went in to the World War II gallery (having already seen quite a number of exhibits dealing with WW II), and it went on…and on. The gallery was very large and went into great detail, including many stories about participants in the war, German as well as Allied. We hadn’t expected the gallery to be nearly as large as it was, and might have allocated more time if we had.</p>



<p>Early in the afternoon we tired of the museum and decided to look for lunch. We thought we might like German food, so guided by our phones, we walked north and came to <a href="https://www.mercatometropolitano.com/">Mercato Metropolitano</a>, a large semi-outdoor food court with sustainable food from many world cuisines. Each of us selected something we like, but we never found the German restaurant we thought was there.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7846x-1.jpg"></a>



<p>Continuing north, we got to the <a href="https://boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Market</a>, a large trading market established in 1756. Perhaps because it was a Saturday, it was very crowded. Normally this might not have been as notable but that since the COVID epidemic we have avoided and become unaccustomed to crowds. We walked through quickly and then continued on to the Thames, where we went along the south shore to the Millennium Bridge. We walked out on the bridge, took some pictures, and continued west to the Westminster Bridge. All along the way there were people — lots of people.</p>



<p>After crossing the Westminster bridge, we took a short Tube ride to the West End. Again, everything was crowded. We tried a couple of places for dinner, but nothing was available without an advance booking. The Five Guys burger restaurant was jammed, and there was even a long queue at McDonalds (!). We couldn’t figure out the attraction there.</p>



<p>We finally settled on <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, the same Asian-themed fast food chain that we had tried in Brighton. We were able to find a table and had an enjoyable light meal.</p>



  
<p>The big event of the day was this evening: we had tickets to <a href="https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com/">Back to the Future: The Musical</a>, playing at the <a href="https://lwtheatres.co.uk/theatres/adelphi/">Adelphi Theatre</a> on The Strand. This is a new show that that just opened in July 2021 and has not yet made it to the United States. The theatre was, as expected, nearly full. But we had been told that COVID vaccination, negative tests, and the wearing of masks would be required. In fact, we were never asked about vaccinations or tests, and the majority of the audience did not wear masks. We felt somewhat less safe as a result.</p>
  



<p>Still, the show was very enjoyable. As Celeste pointed out, this is a “tech show” with the strong point being special effects. Most of the performances, particularly Doc Brown, were excellent as well, although Celeste noted that some of the actors had trouble with American accents.</p>



<p>We took the Tube back to our hotel and are retiring quickly. Tomorrow will be an early day for Jim and Kenna’s flight back home.</p>

<p>Friday, November 12, 2021</p>



<p>Since it is now 2 days before our return to the United States, today was the day for our pre-trip COVID test. We were a little nervous about that because, of course, it determines whether we return as planned. Expecting a similar experience as for our Day 2 test, we were a bit surprised that this time we would have to do a proctored test where the proctor would watch us take the test via video chat. The next surprise was that you seem to need both a smartphone to run their app and some other device for the chat session. So we got out our iPads, and (third surprise) there was apparently a bug in their application causing it not to work on an iPad. So we got out my Mac laptop and (fourth surprise) couldn’t use my usual browser, Firefox, but could fortunately use Safari. Each test took about half an hour, including a 15-minute wait for the test to develop. Following the wait, a second video chat was set up where they read the test with you and issued your certificate. Very fortunately, both of our tests were negative.</p>



<p>We checked out of the apartment/hotel just before checkout time and stored our bags. Then the question was what to do until Celeste finished classes so we could all take the train to London. The answer was the <a href="https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/">Sea Life Brighton</a>, apparently the oldest aquarium in the world. While not an extensive collection, many of the exhibits were in a classic style with ornate frames supporting the glass windows. There was a very enjoyable tunnel where you can sit while fish (and turtles!) swim overhead. The aquarium covered a number of regions of the world, with more of an emphasis on fresh-water fish than many others we have seen.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7817.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_7828-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After browsing a bookstore for a while, we collected our bags and headed for the train station. Trains run to Victoria Station in London every half hour, and fortunately that connected well with the train Celeste took from Falmer to meet us.</p>



<p>After the train trip and Tube ride to Paddington Station, we walked the short distance to our hotel, a newly renovated boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.inhabithotels.com/">Inhabit</a>. We chose it largely because it had nice triple rooms, including an actual bed (not sofa bed) for Celeste. No London trip would be complete without a hotel where it’s necessary to lug your bags up a flight of stairs, but fortunately this one only required a single flight. Our room was modern and comfortable.</p>



<p>I had booked a table at the <a href="https://www.victoriapaddington.co.uk/">Victoria</a>, a pub in the Paddington area, and we were seated in a pleasant and not noisy dining room upstairs. Dinner was excellent. Upon returning to the hotel, Celeste immediately collapsed for the night on her cozy bed.</p>

<p>Thursday, November 11, 2021</p>



<p>While Celeste was in classes, Kenna and I set out on foot for Hove, Brighton’s “twin” city to the west. We had a rather pleasant walk through a shopping district, but there wasn’t much remarkable to see. In Hove, we turned south and followed the main road along the Channel back to the west. We stopped to look at one of the characteristic crescent-shaped residential developments, and continued toward Brighton. We considered going on the <a href="https://britishairwaysi360.com/">i360</a> observation tower, but it wasn’t particularly clear and the expense didn’t seem worth it.</p>



<p>Celeste and a friend of hers (another exchange student from Colorado) joined us in the afternoon to go ice skating at the <a href="https://royalpavilionicerink.co.uk/">Royal Pavilion Ice Rink</a>. While I am used to hockey skates, it was a bit of an adjustment to the others who are used to the toe picks on figure skates. We all got the hang of it; the ice was beautifully maintained (although with some puddles) and the rink was not particularly crowded for our 3 pm session.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/img_4511.jpeg"></a>




<p>After skating we sat in the attached cafe to chat until it was time for dinner, which we had at an Italian restaurant, <a href="https://www.bellaitalia.co.uk/italian-restaurant/brighton/market-street#!">Bella Italia</a>, in the Lanes.</p>

<p>Celeste has a busy class schedule the early part of the day, so Kenna and I set out on our own, first for a hearty breakfast at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186273-d467437-Reviews-Billie_s_Cafe-Brighton_East_Sussex_England.html">Billie’s Cafe</a> and then to the <a href="https://brightonmuseums.org.uk/royalpavilion/">Royal Pavilion</a>, one of the sightseeing highlights of Brighton. Originally a country estate, it was remodeled by King George IV into an ornate building, with the exterior having an Indian theme and the interior extensively decorated and furnished in Chinese style.</p>



<p>Brighton’s Royal Pavilion has had a varied history, having been of less interest to Queen Victoria (George IV’s successor in the throne) who moved most of the furnishings to London and sold the building to the City of Brighton. Over the years it has been refurnished in the original style and with many of the original furnishings, some of which have been loaned by Queen Elizabeth. The Pavilion was in the process of being decorated for Christmas, which reminded us of a visit we made two years ago to <a href="https://filoli.org/">Filoli</a> in California.</p>




<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7769.jpg"></a>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7770-1.jpg"></a>




<p>After the Pavilion, we went across the garden to the Brighton Museum, which had a wide range of exhibits ranging from ancient history of the British Isles and ancient Egypt to LGBT styles of the late 20th century and modern furniture.</p>



<p>Having finished her classes, Celeste joined us for lunch at <a href="https://www.itsu.com/">Itsu</a>, one of a chain of Asian-inspired fast food restaurants. We then returned with Celeste to the museum to see a bit more and allow her time to do some research she had planned.</p>



<p>We then made our way behind the Pavilion, where a seasonal ice rink is set up for recreational ice skating. With its location next to the Pavilion it is a particularly scenic place to skate. We are looking forward to doing that tomorrow.</p>



<p>Celeste returned to campus, and Kenna and I, having had a substantial lunch, opted for a light dinner at <a href="https://www.tengreenbottles.com/">Ten Green Bottles</a>, a local wine bar.</p>

<p>Tuesday, November 9, 2021</p>



<p>Somewhat at the midpoint of our trip, it was time to take care of a few things like laundry. It’s also time for the thrice-annual <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> meeting, which was supposed to be in Madrid, but is being held online (again) due to the pandemic. I co-chaired a session from noon to 2 pm local time today, so I needed to be at the hotel for that. Meanwhile Kenna and Celeste did some exploring around the little shops in the Brighton Lanes.</p>



<p>Our downtime day also gave us an opportunity to do some laundry. One of the attractive features of our “aparthotel” is a compact combination washer/dryer. Our room also came with a couple of detergent pods, which were unfortunately and unexpectedly heavily scented. We will be using our own detergent in the future. The dryer was slow, but it did the job.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_4493x.jpg"></a>IETF virtual venue



<p>I am again thankful for the good internet service here; the meeting went without a hitch (my co-chair is in Melbourne, Australia). Kenna and Celeste brought lunch from <a href="https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB">Pret a Manger</a> to eat between meeting sessions I needed to attend. Following the second session we went off for dinner at a pizza place we had discovered, <a href="https://www.francomanca.co.uk/">Franco Manca</a>. The pizza and surroundings were outstanding; we would definitely return (and Celeste probably will). We then saw Celeste off to her bus back to campus and we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>Monday, November 8, 2021</p>



<p>We started our day fairly early, getting a quick Starbucks breakfast before getting on the bus to University of Sussex to meet Celeste at 9:30 am. Celeste has an hour-long radio show, “Oops That Had Banjos”, on the campus radio station, <a href="https://www.urfonline.com/">University Radio Falmer</a>. She invited us to co-host the show. The studio was exactly as I had imagined, and it was a lot of fun doing the show with her. We each contributed a couple of songs to the playlist, and got to introduce them briefly.</p>



<p>After the show, Celeste had classes so we continued on to Lewes. We hadn’t been able to see much on our short visit Sunday evening. We started out at <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/lewes-castle-museum/">Lewes Castle &amp; Museum</a>, again getting an idea of the history of the place and then visiting portions of the castle itself. It was a clear day, and the view from the top was excellent. As with many of these sites, the castle went through many changes through the centuries as political conditions changed.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7759-1.jpg"></a>
Lewes Barbican Gate and view from the Castle



<p>After climbing around the castle, we were ready for lunch. We checked out a few restaurants in town before settling on the Riverside Cafe, in an attractive area on the River Ouse. After lunch, we walked among a number of small shops before entering a <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/">Waterstones bookstore</a>. How we miss spending time in quality bookstores! I expect we’ll be seeking them out more once we return.</p>



<p>We then took the train back to Brighton, since I had a meeting to attend for work. The meeting went well; the internet connection at the hotel is solid and makes it seem like it hardly matters where in the world I am when attending these meetings.</p>



<p>Celeste came down to Brighton to have dinner with us. We decided to go with Latin American food at a local chain called Las Iguanas. The food was quite good although somewhat standard, at least to those of us from California and Colorado.</p>

<p>Sunday, November 7, 2021</p>



<p>Having gone west to <a href="https://altmode.org/2021/11/27/sussex-day-3-chichester-and-fishbourne/">Chichester</a> yesterday, today we went east to Hastings, notable for the Norman conquest of 1066 (although the actual Battle of Hastings was some distance inland). We arranged to meet Celeste on the train as we passed through Falmer, where her campus is located, for the hour-or-so trip along the coast. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s an hour train ride to most sights outside Brighton.</p>



<p>Hastings is an attractive and somewhat touristy town, along the Channel and in a narrow valley surrounded by substantial hills. We walked through the town, stopping for a fish and chips lunch along the way, and admiring the small shops in the Old Town. We took a funicular up one of the two hills and had an excellent view of the surrounding terrain. Unfortunately, the ruins of the castle at Hastings were closed for the season.<br><br></p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7741-1.jpg"></a>
Funicular and view from the top



<p>After returning via funicular, we continued through the town to the <a href="http://www.hmag.org.uk/">Hastings Museum</a>, a well curated (and free!) small museum that was thorough in its coverage of the history of the area, from the Iron Age to the present. It also included an extensive collection from a local family that sailed around the world in the 1800s.</p>



<p>Taking the train back, we had a change of trains in Lewes, which Celeste had visited and enjoyed previously. We stopped at the Lewes Arms pub, but unfortunately (since it was Sunday evening) the kitchen had closed so we couldn’t get food. So Celeste returned to campus and got dinner there, while Kenna and I got take-out chicken sandwiches to eat in our hotel.</p>



<p>Our weekly family Zoom conference is on Sunday evening, England time, so we ate our sandwiches while chatting with other family members back home. It’s so much easier to stay in close touch with family while traveling than it was just a few years ago.</p>

<p>Saturday, November 6, 2021</p>



<p>After a pleasant breakfast at a cafe in The Lanes, we met up with Celeste at the Brighton train station and rode to Chichester, about an hour to the west. Chichester is a pleasant (and yes, touristy) town with a notable cathedral. Arriving somewhat late, we walked through the town and then found lunch at a small restaurant on a side road as many of the major restaurants in town were quite crowded (it is a Saturday, after all).<br><br><br><br></p>



  
<p>One of the main attractions in the area is the <a href="https://sussexpast.co.uk/attraction/fishbourne-roman-palace-gardens/">Fishbourne Roman Palace</a>, one village to the west. We set out on foot, through a bit of rain, for a walk of a couple of miles. But when we arrived it was well worth the trip. This is an actual Roman palace, constructed in about 79AD, that had been uncovered starting in the 1960s, along with many coins, implements, and other artifacts. The mosaic floors were large and particularly impressive. As a teenager, I got to visit the ruins in Pompeii; these were of a similar nature. This palace and surrounding settlements were key to the Roman development of infrastructure in England.</p>
  



  
<p>Returning from Fishbourne to Chichester, we made a short visit to <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/">Chichester Cathedral</a>. Unfortunately, the sun had set and it was difficult to see most of the stained glass. At the time of our visit, there was a <a href="https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/news/50000-people-visited-luke-jerrams-museum-moon-chichester-cathedral">large model of the Moon</a>, traveling to several locations in Europe, that was hanging from the ceiling in the middle of the church. It was a striking thing to see, especially as we first entered.</p>

<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/img_7719-2.jpeg"></a>

  



<p>After our train trip back from Chichester, we parted with Celeste who returned to campus. Since it was a Saturday night, restaurants were crowded, but we were able to get dinner at a large chain pub, <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/east-sussex/the-post--telegraph-brighton">Wetherspoons</a>. The pub was noisy and table service was minimal. We ordered via their website and they only cleared the previous patrons’ dirty dishes when they delivered our food. The food was acceptable, but nothing to blog about.</p>

<p>A Reader’s&nbsp;Guide</p><p>How should crypto be regulated? And by whom? These are the big questions the industry is grappling with in the wake of the infrastructure bill being signed with the haphazardly expanded definition of a broker dealer for tax reporting provisions. So now the industry is *atwitter* with ideas about where to go from&nbsp;here.</p><p>Three large companies have all come out with policy suggestions: FTX, Coinbase and and A16z. While these proposals differ in approach, they all seek to address a few central policy questions. I’ll break down the proposals based on key subject&nbsp;areas:</p><p>Consumer Protection</p><p>A16: Suggests a framework for DAO’s to provide disclosures.</p><p>Coinbase: Sets a goal to “​​Enhance transparency through appropriate disclosure requirements. Protect against fraud and market manipulation”</p><p>FTX: Similarly suggests framework for “disclosure and transparency standards”</p><p>All three of these make ample mention of consumer protections that seem to begin and end at disclosures. Regulators might want something with a little more teeth. FTX provides a more robust outline for combating fraud, suggesting the use of on-chain analytics tools. This is a smart and concrete suggestion of how to improve existing regulation that relies on SARS reports filed AFTER suspicious activity.</p><p>Exactly how Decentralized?</p><p>A16: Seeks to create a definition and entity status for DAO’s, which would ostensibly require a different kind of regulation than more custodial services.</p><p>Coinbase: ​Platforms and services that do not custody or otherwise control the assets of a customer — including miners, stakers and developers — would need to be treated differently</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t mention decentralization.</p><p>These are really varied approaches. I’m not criticizing FTX here, they are focusing on consumer protections and combating fraud which are good things to highlight. However the core regulatory issues is- can we differentiate between decentralized and centralized products and does that create a fundamentally conflict with existing law. A16z’s approach is novel, a new designation without a new&nbsp;agency.</p><p>The Devil You Know vs The Devil you&nbsp;Don’t</p><p>A16- Suggests the Government Office of Accountability “assess the current state of regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, digital assets, and decentralized technology, and to compare the costs and benefits of harmonizing jurisdiction among agencies against vesting supervision and oversight with a federally chartered self-regulatory organization or one or more nonprofit corporations.”</p><p>Coinbase- Argues that this technology needs a new regulatory agency and that all digital assets should be under a single regulatory authority. Also suggests coordination with a Self Regulatory Organization.</p><p>FTX- Doesn’t step into that&nbsp;morass.</p><p>Coinbase has the most aggressive position here. I personally am not convinced of the need for a new regulatory agency. We haven’t tried it the old fashioned way yet, where existing agencies offer clarity about what would bring a digital asset into their jurisdiction and what would exclude it. Creating a new agency is a slow and expensive process. And then that agency would need to justify its existence by aggressively cracking down. It’s a bit like creating a hammer and then inevitably complaining that it sees everything as a&nbsp;nail.</p><p>How to achieve regulatory change in the US for&nbsp;crypto:</p>  Stop tweeting aggressively at the people who regulate you. Negative points if you are a billionaire complaining about&nbsp;taxes.  Spend some time developing relationships with policymakers and working collaboratively with communities you want to support. Lotta talk of unbanked communities- any stats on how they are being served by this tech? (Seriously please&nbsp;share)  Consider looking at who is already doing the work you want to accelerate and consider working with them/learning from and supporting existing efforts rather than whipping out your proposal and demanding attention. Examples: CoinCenter, Blockchain Association. At the state level: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition </a>of course, Cascadia Blockchain Council, Texas Blockchain Council&nbsp;etc.  <p>A16: <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/2021-09-27-andreessen-horowitz-senate-banking-proposals/ec055eb0ce534033/full.pdf#page=9</a></p><p>Coinbase: <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86">https://blog.coinbase.com/digital-asset-policy-proposal-safeguarding-americas-financial-leadership-ce569c27d86</a>c</p><p>FTX: <a href="https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/">https://blog.ftx.com/policy/policy-goals-market-regulation/</a></p>

<p>Today I finished up a tool that you can use to export your complete history from Foursquare and publish the checkins to your website!</p>

<p>In 2017, I created <a href="https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io">OwnYourSwarm</a> to export my future Swarm checkins to my website in real-time. It's been working great, and it's meant that I have had a complete archive of all my checkins on my website ever since then, so I don't have to worry if Foursquare disappears one day. However, I never got around to creating a way to export my past checkins, so I was always missing my checkin history from 2009-2016.</p>

<p>I had been considering building this as a feature of OwnYourSwarm, but realized that it would end up taking a lot of additional effort to make it work well as a web service, in addition to dealing with possible rate limit issues with the Foursquare API. So instead, this is published as a downloadable script you can run on your own computer. This also means you have a bit more flexibility in how you can use it, as well as being able to customize it more if you choose.</p>

<p>You can download the code from GitHub here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import">https://github.com/aaronpk/Swarm-Checkins-Import</a></p>

<p>The readme has installation and usage instructions, so I'll refrain from repeating all that in this post. Make sure to check out the step by step tutorial in the readme if you want to use this with your own account.</p>

<p>The process is broken up into a couple steps.</p>

 
 First, it downloads your entire Foursquare checkin history to JSON files on your computer 
 Second, it downloads all the photos from your checkins 
 Third, it publishes each checkin to your website via <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a> 
 

<p>If your website doesn't support checkins via Micropub, or if you don't want your checkins on your website at all, you can just skip that step entirely, and instead you'll have a complete export of your data locally.</p>

<p>The JSON files contain the raw API response from Foursquare, so you can do what you want with that as well, such as turning it into your own HTML archive using your own custom tools if you want.</p>

<p>The one issue that I don't have a good solution for is handling renamed venues. Unfortunately the API returns the current name for old checkins, so if a venue is renamed, your old checkins will not reflect the name at the time of the checkin. This is particularly strange for businesses that have gone through an acquisition or rebranding, since for example all my old checkins in Green Dragon are now labeled as Rogue Eastside Brewery. As far as I can tell there isn't a good way to handle this, so I may have to go back and manually edit the posts on my website for the venues I know have been renamed.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful to people! I will be sleeping a little easier now knowing that my old checkin history is safely archived on my website now!</p>

<p>This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.</p>

<p>What is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

 What You'll Need 

<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>

 
 An HTTP client. 
 A URL parsing library. 
 A hashing library that supports SHA256. 
 A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML. 
 The ability to show an HTML form to the user. 
 

 IndieAuth Flow Summary 

<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>

 
 Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address. 
 Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server. 
 Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string. 
 Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string. 
 Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server. 
 

 Step by Step 

<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>

 Show the Sign-In Form 

<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type="url"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>

<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>

<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/indieauth/start" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="url" name="url" placeholder="example.com"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign In"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>

 Discover the IndieAuth Server 

<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>

<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#url-canonicalization">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href="https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>

 Start the Flow by Redirecting the User 

<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>

 
 <code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value. 
 <code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app. 
 <code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below. 
 <code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short. 
 <code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server. 
 <code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.) 
 

<p>Calculating the Code Challenge</p>

<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>

 
 Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long 
 Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string 
 Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge 
 

<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>

<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>

 <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code
  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com
  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc
  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256
  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks
  &amp;scope=profile
</code> 

<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>

<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>

 Handle the Redirect Back 

<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>

 <code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
</code> 

<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>

 Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info 

<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
 <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> 
 <code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge. 
 

<p>This is described in additional detail <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>

 <code>{
  "me": "https://indieauth.rocks/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "IndieAuth Rocks",
    "url": https://indieauth.rocks/"
    "photo": "https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>

 
 The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field. 
 If the <code>me</code> URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step. 
 

<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>

<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Now you're done!</p>

<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their <code>me</code> URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the <code>profile</code> object to keep their profile up to date.</p>

 Testing Your IndieAuth Client 

<p>To test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:</p>

 
 <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing. 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress</a> - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well. 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal</a> - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server. 
 <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfauth">Selfauth</a> - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server. 
 

<p>Eventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at <a href="https://indieauth.rocks">indieauth.rocks</a> so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.</p>

 Getting Help 

<p>If you get stuck or need help, feel free to drop by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">IndieWeb chat</a> to ask questions! Myself and many others are there all the time and happy to help troubleshoot new IndieAuth implementations!</p>

After the transition to an academy-internal publication economy, powered by ePrint services hosted across the planet, journals will not be missed. That individual academic libraries should need to continue to pony up for thousands of journal subscriptions for decades to come is now an idea only in the Xeroxed business models of for-profit publishers. Everyone else is looking for a way out; and the internet awaits.

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

  This tutorial will walk you through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro kit you can ship to a remote location and then control from your studio.

<p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro kit you can ship to a remote location and then control from your studio. You can use this to ship a remote interview kit to someone where all they have to do is plug in a few connections and you'll be able to control everything remotely!</p>

<p></p>

<p>The overall idea is you'll ship out an ATEM Mini Pro (or ISO), a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K (or any other camera, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled by the ATEM!), and a Raspberry Pi. The guest will connect the Raspberry Pi to their home network, connect the camera's HDMI to the ATEM, turn everything on, and you'll immediately be able to control the remote end yourself!</p>

<p>The remote ATEM can then stream to any streaming service directly, or if you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9OTROesp0">Streaming Bridge</a>, you can get a high quality video feed of the remote guest brought directly into your studio!</p>

 Devices Used in this Tutorial

 <a href="https://amzn.to/3bLCR0X">Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K</a> (any camera will do, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled remotely too!) 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38PXY04">Blackmagic Streaming Bridge</a> to receive the remote ATEM video feed in your studio 
 

 Set up the Studio Side 

<p>We'll start with setting up the studio side of the system. This is where your computer to control the remote ATEM will be, and this end will have the VPN server. If you have a Streaming Bridge, it would be on this end as well in order to receive the streaming video feed from the remote ATEM.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First we're going to set up the GL.iNet router as a Wireguard server.</p>

<p>Plug your computer in to one of the two ethernet ports on the right, or connect to its WiFi hotspot. There's a sticker on the bottom showing the default wifi name and password as well as the IP address of the router. (It's probably <code>192.168.8.1</code>).</p>

<p>Open that address in your browser and it will prompt you to set up an admin password. Make sure you keep that somewhere safe like a password manager.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up Internet Access for the Travel Router 

<p>The first thing we need to do is get internet access set up on this router. You'll definitely want to hardwire this in to your studio network rather than use wifi. Plug an ethernet cord from your main router in the studio to the port on the left. Once that's connected, the admin dashboard should pop up a section to configure the wired connection. You can use DHCP to get it on your network. Eventually you'll want to give this device a fixed IP address by going into your main router and setting a static DHCP lease. The specifics of that will depend on your own router so I'll leave that up to you to look up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my case the travel router's IP address is 10.10.12.102.</p>

 Configure the Wireguard Server 

<p>Now we're ready to set up the travel router as a Wireguard server. Wireguard is relatively new VPN software that is a lot faster and easier to use compared to older VPN software like OpenVPN. It's conveniently already built in to the travel router as well, making it an excellent option for this.</p>

<p>Go to the VPN menu on the side and expand it to reveal the Wireguard Server tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click "Initialize Wireguard Server" and you'll be able to set it up. Enable the "Allow Access Local Network" toggle, and change the "Local IP" to <code>172.16.55.1</code>. (It doesn't really matter what IP range you use for the Wireguard interface, but this address is unlikely to conflict with your existing network.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can click "Start", and then go into the "Management" tab.</p>

<p>Click the big "Add a New User" button. Give it a name like "RemoteATEM". This will create a config for it which you'll use to set up the remote side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the icon under "Configurations" and click the "Plain Text" tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that text into a text editor (not Word or Google Docs!). We're going to make a few changes to make it look like the below.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>We don't want the ATEM to send the video feed over the VPN, so change the AllowedIPs line to: <code>172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24</code>. If it's set to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> then all the traffic on the remote end will be funneled through your VPN server and your studio's internet connection. That's usually what you want when you're using a VPN for privacy, but we don't want to add latency to sending the video feed if you're streaming from the remote end to YouTube directly. The IP address in the <code>Endpoint =</code> line is the public IP address of your studio network, so make sure you leave that line alone. You can remove the <code>DNS =</code> line since we aren't routing all network traffic through the VPN. Make sure you keep the PrivateKey and PublicKey that your router generated though!</p>

<p>This next part is the magic that makes it work. The key here is we need to let other devices on the WireGuard server end access devices on the LAN side of the WireGuard client. The ATEM will be behind the WireGuard client (described in the next section), the ATEM itself wouldn't normally be visible to other things on the Wireguard server side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the most complicated step. You'll need to edit a text file on the router by connecting to it via ssh. Open Terminal on a mac, or PuTTY on Windows.</p>

 <code>ssh root@192.168.8.1
</code> 

<p>The root ssh password is the same admin password you created when you first set up the router. (You won't see your keystrokes as you're typing your password.)</p>

<p>You'll need a text editor to edit the file. If you're familiar with <code>vi</code>, it's already installed. If you want something easier to use, then you can install <code>nano</code>.</p>

 <code>opkg update
opkg install nano
</code> 

<p>Now you can edit the file using nano:</p>

 <code>nano /etc/config/wireguard_server
</code> 

<p>Navigate to the bottom of the file and add this line:</p>

 <code>        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>The file should now look something like the below</p>

 <code>config servers
        option local_port '51820'
        option local_ipv6 'fd00:db8:0:abc::1'
        option private_key '&lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option public_key '&lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option access 'ACCEPT'
        option local_ip '172.16.55.1'
        option enable '1'

config peers 'wg_peer_9563'
        option name 'RemoteATEM'
        option client_key '&lt;CLIENT PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option private_key '&lt;CLIENT PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option client_ip '172.16.55.2/32'
        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>To save and exit, press control X, and press Y and enter when prompted. You'll need to reboot this device once this is set up, so click the "reboot" button in the top right corner of the admin panel.</p>

 Set Up Port Forwarding 

<p>The last step on the studio side is to set up port forwarding from your studio router to forward port 51820 to the IP address of the WireGuard server. This is what will let the remote end be able to connect to your studio VPN. How you do this will depend on what router you use in your studio. Most routers will have a web interface to configure them which will let you set up port forwarding rules.</p>

<p>You'll need to know the IP address of your studio router as well as the IP address of the travel router. Create a port forwarding rule to forward port 51820 to your travel router's IP address.</p>

<p>For example, this is what it looks like in my Unifi router to create the forwarding rule.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alright, we're set on this end! You now have a WireGuard server accessible from outside of your network! If you're curious to keep experimenting with WireGuard, you can even set up your mobile phone or laptop as a WireGuard client so that you can connect back to your studio on the go!</p>

<p>Next, we're ready to set up the remote end for the ATEM Mini Pro.</p>

 Set up the Remote Side for the ATEM 

<p>The remote kit side will have the ATEM Mini Pro, the camera, and the WireGuard client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the WireGuard client powers on, it will connect to your studio network and make the ATEM Mini acessible from your studio network.</p>

<p>I want to preface this section by saying I tried really hard to make this work with another GL.iNet router, but ran into a few blockers before switching to using a Raspberry Pi. As such, this step is a lot more involved and requires quite a bit more command line work than I would like. If you are reading this and happen to know how to do this with the GL.iNet router instead, I would be very interested in hearing it! Feel free to get in touch with details!</p>

 Install Raspberry Pi OS 

<p>The first thing to do is burn the Raspberry Pi OS image to a MicroSD card. Download the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> app, and go through the steps of installing the Raspberry Pi OS. If you're comfortable on the command line, you can use the "lite" version which doesn't include the desktop environment. I prefer this since I'm never going to be connecting a monitor to this anyway after the first round of setup.</p>

<p>After the card is created, stick it in the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. You'll need a keyboard and monitor connected to set things up the first time. You'll also want to make sure the Raspberry Pi has an internet connection, so plug in an ethernet cord to the ethernet port on the Pi into your home router.</p>

 Install WireGuard 

<p>It looks like in the near future, WireGuard will be included by default in Raspberry Pi OS, so first check if it's already there by typing <code>which wg</code>, and if it shows you a path like <code>/usr/bin/wg</code> then you can skip this step since it's already installed!</p>

<p>If you need to install WireGuard, you can install it from the "testing" packages by running these commands:</p>

 <code>echo "deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian testing main" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wireguard
</code> 

<p>Now when you run <code>which wg</code> you should see that it's installed.</p>

 WireGuard Setup 

<p>Remember that big block of text you created in the previous step? It's time to use it! You'll need to paste that into the WireGuard configuration file on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code> 

<p>Paste in the full contents of the configuration replacing anything that is already in that file if any.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>Save and quit by pressing control X, then Y and enter when prompted.</p>

 Turn the Raspberry Pi into a Router 

<p>The Raspberry Pi will be sharing its internet connection with the ATEM Mini, so it's time to turn it into a router! (This is the reason I wanted to use a travel router instead, because this step is already done in that case.)</p>

<p>First, plug in the USB ethernet adapter to one of the USB ports, and connect an ethernet cable from that to the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up that ethernet device. Edit the file using the command below:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1
</code> 

<p>Paste in the following text exactly as written:</p>

 <code>auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.5.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
</code> 

<p>This creates a new network on the Raspberry Pi which will be the private network for the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>We're going to set up a few more things first, then eventually reboot the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server firewalld
</code> 

<p>Now edit the DHCP server config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
</code> 

<p>You'll need to set the <code>domain-name</code> and <code>domain-name-servers</code> as follows:</p>

 <code>option domain-name "rpi.local";
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the bottom and add the following lines as well:</p>

 <code>subnet 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.5.100 192.168.5.200;
        option routers 192.168.5.1;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
}
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Next, open the <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
</code> 

<p>Add <code>eth1</code> to the <code>INTERFACESv4</code> line and save the file.</p>

 <code>INTERFACESv4="eth1"
INTERFACESv6=""
</code> 

<p>Now we can set up the firewall to allow this traffic through and enable IP masquerading.</p>

 <code>sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-masquerade --permanent
</code> 

<p>Lastly, we'll tell the WireGuard client to start up on boot by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
</code> 

<p>Finally, we're ready to reboot the Raspberry Pi and see if it all works!</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>With any luck, the Raspberry Pi will boot up and connect to your WireGuard server and everything will be working!</p>

<p>On the Raspberry Pi, you should be able to type <code>sudo wg</code> to see the status of the WireGuard client. If it worked, you'll see the endpoint you're connected to as well as a "latest handshake" and some transfer stats showing how much data has gone over the VPN.</p>

<p></p>

 Let's Try it Out! 

<p>With everything up and running, it's time to try to connect to your ATEM! You'll need to find or set the IP address of the ATEM on the remote side. You can try out <code>192.168.5.100</code> since it will be the first device that the DHCP server sees, or you can connect your ATEM over USB and use the ATEM Setup app to find the address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Of course, to really put it to the test, you'll want to unplug from USB and see if you can connect from your laptop through the VPN.</p>

<p>Remember, at this point your laptop running the ATEM Software Control app should be connected to your travel router either over wifi or ethernet. Your ATEM Mini is the remote end, and that's connected to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Open the ATEM Software Control app and type in the ATEM's IP address under "Manual IP Address". (It won't be able to auto-discover it on the network since it's going over a VPN.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have a Blackmagic camera connected to the ATEM, you'll be able to control it from the Camera tab since it's connected to the ATEM via HDMI! No networking stuff to worry about there.</p>

 Using the Streaming Bridge 

<p>Now you're ready to choose where to stream! The remote ATEM can stream directly to YouTube if that's how you're using it. Because of the way we set up WireGuard, the ATEM will use the remote end's internet connection rather than sending the video through the VPN and out of your studio. That saves a hop and will give you better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to stream to your Streaming Bridge, that should "just work" by using the local IP address of the Streaming Bridge. Connect the Streaming Bridge to your travel router, then open the ATEM Setup app to find its IP address. In my case it's <code>192.168.8.127</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and choose "Local network with key". It's a "local network" because it's going over the VPN. The nice thing about doing it this way is you don't have to set up port forwarding in your studio's router to the bridge, since it will all happen over the VPN!</p>

<p>Next click the "External ATEM Mini Pro" tab to export the configuration file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You'll need to make one change in the file since the normal local network discovery that it does won't work over the VPN. Open the xml file in a text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, and replace the URL with the IP address of your Streaming Bridge, for example:</p>

 <code>&lt;servers&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;rtmp://192.168.8.127:1935/app&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/servers&gt;
</code> 

<p>Now you can load that config file in the ATEM Software Control from the "Stream" menu in the top menu bar, and you'll have a new streaming destination to choose!</p>

<p></p>

 Recording Locally 

<p>If you also ship a USB drive plugged in to the remote ATEM, you can record the program locally as a backup! If you use a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, you can even tell the camera itself to record a high quality video to an SD card or SSD in the camera itself!</p>

<p>And that's it! Hopefully all of this worked for you. If you have any trouble, feel free to post a question on the <a href="https://forum.livevideotech.today/c/support/5">Live Video Tech</a> forums to get some assistance!</p>

<p>This modular cage allows you to stack <a href="https://geni.us/f2B4y">Blackmagic Bidirectional SDI/HDMI 3G Converters</a> on a desk or behind other gear.</p>

<p>The design is composed of four parts: the main shelf, the top shelf, a top plate that sits on top of the top shelf, and an optional angled base. The angled base plate lets you mount the whole stack on top of rack gear that's mounted at a 9° angle, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk">StarTech 8U desktop rack</a>. You can print as many of the main shelves as you need to stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk"></a></p>



<p>The shelves are designed so that the converters can slip in from one side with enough of a gap on top to be able to insert and remove them even after a stack is assembled.</p>

<p>If you'd like, you can glue the stack together to make a solid structure. Otherwise the pegs are long enough that the stack is reasonably stable even without glue.</p>

<p>If you've been putting off setting aside some time to learn about OAuth, now is your chance!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've helped thousands of developers learn about OAuth by hosting live workshops in person, online events through O'Reilly and Okta, as well as by publishing videos on YouTube! I'm super thrilled to announce that I just finished packaging up the workshop and have launched it as a new course, "<a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0</a>"!</p>

<p>The course is 3.5 hours of video content, quizzes, as well as interactive exercises with a guided learning tool to get you quickly up to speed on OAuth, OpenID Connect, PKCE, best practices, and tips for protecting APIs with OAuth.</p>

<p>The course is <a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">available now on Udemy</a>, and if your company has a Udemy for Business subscription you can find it there as well! If you download the app, you can even sync the video course to a mobile device to watch everything offline!</p>

<p><a href="http://oauth.wtf/course"></a></p>

<p>The exercises in the course will walk you through the various OAuth flows to set up an OAuth server, get an access token, use a refresh token, and learn the user's name and email with OpenID Connect. You can see a sneak peek of the tool that interactively helps you debug your apps at <a href="https://oauth.school/">oauth.school</a>.</p>

 Free OAuth Videos 

<p>I've also got a bunch of videos about OAuth available on YouTube for you to watch at any time! Take a look at my <a href="https://oauth.net/videos/">curated playlist of videos</a> where you'll find everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td00HpMI3Q8">live sketch notes</a> of a conversation about PKCE and OAuth security, to a description of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espX8qKjywI">OAuth phishing</a>, to&nbsp;details on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHzERullHe8">why you shouldn't use the implicit flow</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the IndieWeb community has been making progress on iterating and evolving the IndieAuth protocol. IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables it to work with personal websites and in a decentralized environment.</p>

<p>There are already a good number of IndieAuth providers and apps, including a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and built-in support in <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> and <a href="https://dobrado.net/">Dobrado</a>. Ideally, we'd have even more first-class support for IndieAuth in a variety of different blogging platforms and personal websites, and that's been the goal motivating the spec updates this year. We've been focusing on simplifying the protocol and bringing it more in line with OAuth 2.0 so that it's both easier to understand and also easier to adapt existing OAuth clients and servers to add IndieAuth support.</p>

<p>Most of the changes this year have removed IndieAuth-specific bits to reuse things from OAuth when possible, and cleaning up the text of the spec. These changes are also intended to be backwards compatible as much as possible, so that existing clients and servers can upgrade independently.</p>

<p>This post describes the high level changes to the protocol, and is meant to help implementers get an idea of what may need to be updated with existing implementations.</p>

<p>If you would like an introduction to IndieAuth and OAuth, here are a few resources:</p>

<p>The rest of this post details the specifics of the changes and what they mean to client and server developers. If you've written an IndieAuth client or server, you'll definitely want to read this post to know what you'll need to change for the latest updates.</p>

 Response Type 

<p>The first thing an IndieAuth client does is discover the user's authorization endpoint and redirect the user to their server to authorize the client. There are two possible ways a client might be wanting to use IndieAuth, either to confirm the website of the user who just logged in, or to get an access token to be able to create posts on their website.</p>

<p>Previously, this distinction was made at this stage of the request by varying the <code>response_type</code> query string parameter. Instead, the <code>response_type</code> parameter is now always <code>response_type=code</code> which brings it in line with the OAuth 2.0 specification. This makes sense because the response of this request is always an authorization code, it's only after the authorization code is used that the difference between these two uses will be apparent.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send <code>response_type=code</code> in the initial <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Only accept <code>response_type=code</code> requests, and for backwards-compatible support, treat <code>response_type=id</code> requests as <code>response_type=code</code> requests.</p>

 Indicating the User who is Logging In 

<p>In earlier versions of the specification, the authorization request was required to have the parameter <code>me</code>, the value of which was whatever URL the user entered into the client to start the flow. It turns out that this parameter isn't strictly necessary for the flow to succeed, however it still can help improve the user experience in some cases. As such, it has now been changed to an optional parameter.</p>

<p>This parameter is a way for the client to tell the IndieAuth server which user it expects will log in. For single-user sites this value is completely unnecessary, since there is only ever one <code>me</code> URL that will be returned in the end. It turns out that most single-user implementations were already ignoring this parameter anyway since it served no purpose.</p>

<p>For multi-user websites like a multi-author WordPress blog, this parameter also served little purpose. If a user was already logged in to their WordPress site, then tried to log in to an IndieAuth client, the server could just ignore this parameter anyway and return the logged-in user's <code>me</code> URL at the end of the flow.</p>

<p>For multi-user authorization endpoints like the (to-be deprecated) indieauth.com, this parameter served as a hint of who was trying to log in, so that the authorization server could provide a list of authentication options to the user. This is the only case in which this parameter really provides a user experience benefit, since without the parameter at this stage, the user would need to type in their website again, or be shown a list of authentication provider options such as "log in with Twitter".</p>

<p>There's yet another case where the user may enter just the domain of their website, even though their final <code>me</code> URL may be something more specific. For example, a user can enter <code>micro.blog</code> in an IndieAuth sign-in prompt, and eventually be logged in to that app as <code>https://micro.blog/username</code>. There is no requirement that the thing they type in to clients has to be an exact match of their actual profile URL, which allows a much nicer user experience so that users can type only the domain of their service provider which may provide profiles for multiple users. And in this case, the client providing the <code>me</code> URL to the server also doesn't serve any purpose.</p>

<p>The change to the spec makes the <code>me</code> parameter in the authorization request optional. In this sense, it's more of a hint from the client about who is trying to log in. Obviously the server can't trust that value in the request at this point, since the user hasn't logged in yet, so it really is more of a hint than anything else.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Continue to include the <code>me</code> parameter in the request if you can, but if you are using an OAuth client that doesn't let you customize this request, it's okay to leave it out now.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Most servers were already ignoring this parameter anyway, so if you fell into that category then no change is needed. If you were expecting this parameter to exist, change it to optional, because you probably don't actually need it. If it's present in a request, you can use it to influence the options you show for someone to authenticate if they are not yet logged in, or you could show an error message if the client provides a <code>me</code> URL that doesn't match the currently logged-in user.</p>

 Adding PKCE Support 

<p>Probably the biggest change to the spec is the addition of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) mechanism. This is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that solves a number of different vulnerabilities. It was originally designed to allow mobile apps to securely complete an OAuth flow without a client secret, but has since proven to be useful for JavaScript apps and even solves a particular attack even if the client does have a client secret.</p>

<p>Since IndieAuth clients are all considered "Public Clients" in OAuth terms, there are no preregistered client secrets at all, and PKCE becomes a very useful mechanism to secure the flow.</p>

<p>I won't go into the details of the particular attacks PKCE solves in this post, since I've talked about them a lot in other talks and videos. If you'd like to learn more about this, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/td00HpMI3Q8?t=38">sketch notes video</a> where I talk about PKCE and my coworker draws sketchnotes on his iPad.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, PKCE is a very useful mechanism, isn't terribly complicated to implement, and can be added independently by clients and servers since it's designed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>The change to the spec is that PKCE has been rolled into the core authorization flow. Incidentally, the OAuth spec itself is making the same change by rolling PKCE in to the <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> update.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always include the PKCE parameters <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> in the <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: If a <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in an authorization request, don't allow the authorization code to be used unless the corresponding <code>code_verifier</code> is present in the request using the authorization code. For backwards compatibility, if no <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in the request, make sure the request to use the authorization code does not contain a <code>code_verifier</code>.</p>

 Using an Authorization Code 

<p>Whew, okay, you've made it this far and you've sent the user off to their authorization endpoint to log in. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to your application. Now you're ready to use that authorization code to either get an access token or confirm their <code>me</code> URL.</p>

<p>There are two changes to this step, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">redeeming the authorization code</a>.</p>

 Grant Type Parameters 

<p>The first change, while minor, brings IndieAuth in line with OAuth 2.0 since apparently this hadn't been actually specified before. This request must now contain the POST body parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send the parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> when redeeming an authorization code. Generic OAuth 2.0 clients will already be doing this.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For backwards compatibility, treat the omission of this parameter the same as providing it with <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>. For example if you also accept requests with <code>grant_type=refresh_token</code>, the absence of this parameter means the client is doing an authorization code grant.</p>

 Providing "me" in the Token Request 

<p>The request when using an authorization code, either to the token endpoint or authorization endpoint, previously required that the client send the <code>me</code> parameter as well. The change to the spec drops this parameter from this request, making it the same as an OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>This has only some minor implications in very specific scenarios. We analyzed all the known IndieAuth implementations and found that the vast majority of them were already ignoring this parameter anyway. For single-user endpoints, the additional parameter provides no value, since the endpoint would be self-contained anyway, and already know how to validate authorization codes. Even multi-user endpoints like the WordPress plugin would know how to validate authorization codes because the authorization and token endpoints are part of the same software.</p>

<p>The only implementations leaving this parameter out would break are separate implementations of authorization endpoints and token endpoints, where the user has no prior relationship with either. The biggest offender of this is actually my own implementation which I am eventually going to retire, indieauth.com and tokens.indieauth.com. I initially wrote indieauth.com as just the authorization endpoint part, and later added tokens.indieauth.com as a completely separate implementation, it shares nothing in common with indieauth.com and is actually entirely stateless. Over the years, it turns out this pattern hasn't actually been particularly useful, since a website is either going to build both endpoints or delegate both to an external service. So in practice, the only people using tokens.indieauth.com were using it with the indieauth.com authorization endpoint.</p>

<p>Removing this parameter has no effect on most of the implementations. I did have to update my own implementation of tokens.indieauth.com to default to verifying authorization codes at indieauth.com if there was no <code>me</code> parameter, which so far has been sccessful.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: No need to send the <code>me</code> parameter when exchanging an authorization code. This makes the request the same as a generic OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For servers that have an authorization endpoint and token endpoint as part of the same software, make sure your token endpoint knows how to look up authorization codes. Most of the time this is likely what you're already doing anyway, and you were probably ignoring the <code>me</code> parameter already. If you do want to provide a standalone token endpoint, you'll need to create your own encoding scheme to bake in the authorization endpoint or <code>me</code> value into the authorization code itself. But for the vast majority of people this will require no change.</p>

 Removing Same-Domain Requirement 

<p>One of the challenges of a decentralized protocol like this is knowing who to trust to make assertions about who. Just because someone's authorization server claims that a user identified as "https://aaronpk.com/" logged in doesn't mean I actually did log in. Only my authorization server should be trusted to assert that I logged in.</p>

<p>In the previous version of the spec, the way this was enforced was that clients had to check that the final <code>me</code> URL returned had a matching domain as what the user initially entered, after following redirects. That means if I entered <code>aaronpk.com</code> into the client, and that redirected to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/</code>, the client would then expect the final profile URL returned at the end to also be on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>. This works, but it has a few challenges and limitations.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for client developers was keeping track of the chain of redirects. There were actually separate rules for temporary vs permanent redirects, and the client would have to be aware of each step in the redirect chain if there was more than one. Then at the end, the client would have to parse the final profile URL to find the host component, then check if that matches, and it turns out that there are often some pretty <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/395845">low</a>-level <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/305974">bugs</a> with <a href="https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8624.html">parsing</a> URLs in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31429439/parsing-an-url-without-a-path-but-with-a-slash-in-the-query">variety</a> of languages that can lead to unexpected security flaws.</p>

<p>On top of the technical challenges for client developers, there was another problem in the specific case where a user may control only a subfolder of a domain. For example in a shared hosting environment where users can upload arbitrary files to their user directory, <code>https://example.com/~user</code>, the same-domain restriction would still let <code>/~user1</code> claim to be <code>/~user2</code> on that domain. We didn't want to go down the route of adding more URL parsing rules like checking for substring matches, as that would likely have led to even more of a burden on client developers and more risk of security holes.</p>

<p>So instead, this entire restriction has been replaced with a new way of verifying that the final profile URL is legitimate. The new rule should drastically simplify the client code, at the slight cost of a possible additional HTTP request.</p>

<p>The new rule is that if the final profile URL returned by the authorization endpoint is not an exact match of the initially entered URL, the client has to go discover the authorization endpoint at the new URL and verify that it matches the authorization endpoint it used for the flow. This is described in a new section of the spec, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>This change means clients no longer need to keep track of the full redirect chain (although they still can if they would like more opportunities to possibly skip that last HTTP request), and also ensures users on shared domains can't impersonate other users on that domain.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Remove any code around parsing the initial and final URLs, and add a new step after receiving the user's final profile URL: If the final profile URL doesn't match exactly what was used to start the flow, then go fetch that URL and discover the authorization endpoint and confirm that the discovered authorization endpoint matches the one used at the beginning. Please read <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: No change.</p>

 Returning Profile Information 

<p>If the application would like to know more about the user than just their confirmed profile URL, such as their name or photo, previously there was no easy or reliable way to find this information. It's possible the user's profile URL may have an <code>h-card</code> with their info, but that would only include public info and would require bringing in a Microformats parser and making another HTTP request to find this information.</p>

<p>In the latest version of the spec, we've added a <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information">new section</a> returned in the response when redeeming an authorization code for the authorization server to return this profile data directly. To request this information, there are now two scopes defined in the spec, <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code>. When the client requests the <code>profile</code> scope, this indicates the client would like the server to return the user's <code>name</code>, <code>photo</code> and <code>url</code>. The <code>email</code> scope requests the user's email address.</p>

<p>The response when redeeming an authorization code that was issued with these scopes will now contain an additional property, <code>profile</code>, alongside the <code>me</code> URL and access token.</p>

 <code>{
  "access_token": "XXXXXX",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "profile email create",
  "me": "https://user.example.net/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "Example User",
    "url": "https://user.example.net/",
    "photo": "https://user.example.net/photo.jpg",
    "email": "user@example.net"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This comes with some caveats. As is always the case with OAuth, just because a client requests certain scopes does not guarantee the request will be granted. The user or the authorization server may decide to not honor the request and leave this information out. For example a user may choose to not share their email even if the app requests it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the information in this <code>profile</code> section is not guaranteed to be "real" or "verified" in any way. It is merely information that the user intends to share with the app. This means everything from the user sharing different email addresses with different apps, or the URL in the profile being a completely different website. For example a multi-author WordPress blog which provides <code>me</code> URLs on the WordPress site's domain, <code>example.com</code>, may return the author's own personal website in the <code>url</code> property of the profile information. The client is not allowed to treat this information as authoritative or many any policy decisions based on the profile information, it's for informational purposes only. Another common vulnerability in many existing OAuth clients is that they assume the provider has confirmed the email address returned and will use that to deduplicate accounts. This has the problem of if a user can edit their email address and have it returned in an OAuth response without the server confirming it, the client may end up being tricked into thinking a different user logged in. Only the <code>me</code> URL is the one that can be trusted as the stable identifier of the user, and everything in the <code>profile</code> section should be treated as if it were hand-entered into the client.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: If you would like to find the user's profile information, include the <code>profile</code> or <code>email</code> scope in your authorization request. If you don't need this, then no changes are necessary.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Authorization servers should be able to recognize the <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code> scopes in a request, and ask the user for permission to share their profile information with clients, then return that along with the final <code>me</code> URL and access token. It's also completely acceptable to not support this feature at all, as clients shouldn't be relying on the presence of this information in the response anyway.</p>

 Editorial Changes 

<p>There was a good amount of work done to clean up the text of the spec without changing any of the actual requirements. These are known as editorial changes.</p>

<p>The term "domain" has been replaced with the more accurate term "host" in most places. This matches the URL spec more closely, and reduces the confusion around registerable domain like <code>example.com</code> or <code>example.co.uk</code> and subdomains. In all cases, there has been no need to use the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a> because we have always meant full hostname matches.</p>

<p>Language around the term "profile URL" was cleaned up to make sure only the final URL returned by the authorization server is referred to as the "profile URL". The user may enter lots of different things into the client that might not be their profile URL, anything from just a hostname (<code>aaronpk.com</code>) to a URL that redirects to their profile URL. This cleans up the language to better clarify what we mean by "profile URL".</p>

<p>With the change to use <code>response_type=code</code> for both versions of the flow, it meant the authorization and authentication sections were almost entirely duplicate content. These have been consolidated into a single section, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization">Authorization</a>, and the only difference now is the response when the authorization code is redeemed.</p>

 Dropped Features and Text 

<p>Any time you can cut text from a spec and have it mean the same thing is a good thing. Thankfully we were able to cut a decent amount of text thanks to consolidating the two sections mentioned above. We also dropped an obscure feature that was extremely under-utilized. For the case where a token endpoint and authorization endpoint were not part of the same software, there was a section describing how those two could communicate so that the token endpoint could validate authorization codes issued by an arbitrary authorization endpoint. This serves no purpose if a single piece of software provided both endpoints since it would be far more efficient to have the token endpoint look up the authorization code in the database or however you're storing them, so virtually nobody had even bothered to implement this.</p>

<p>The only known implementations of this feature were my own <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code>, and Martijn's <code>mintoken</code> project. <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/44">We both agreed</a> that if we did want to pursue this feature in the future, we could write it up as an extension. Personally I plan on shutting down <code>indieauth.com</code> and <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code> in the near-ish future anyway, and the replacement that I build will contain both endpoints anyway, so I don't really plan on revisiting this topic anyway.</p>

 Conclusion / Future Work 

<p>Well if you've made it this far, congrats! I hope this post was helpful. This was definitely a good amount of changes, although hopefully all for good reasons and should simplify the process of developing IndieAuth clients and servers in the future.</p>

<p>We didn't get to every open IndieAuth issue in this round of updates, there are still a few interesting ones open that I would like to see addressed. The next largest change that will affect implementations would be to continue to bring this in line with OAuth 2.0 and always <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58">redeem the authorization code at the token endpoint</a> even if no access token is expected to be returned. That would also have the added benefit of simplifying the authorization endpoint implementation to only need to worry about providing the authorization UI, leaving all the JSON responses to the token endpoint. This still requires some discussion and a plan for upgrading to this new model, so feel free to chime in on the discussions!</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thank-you to everyone who has participated in the discussions this year, both on GitHub and in our virtual meetings! All the feedback from everyone who is interested in the spec has been extremely valuable!</p>

<p>We'll likely schedule some more sessions to continue development on the spec, so keep an eye on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indieauth">events.indieweb.org</a> for upcoming events tagged #indieauth!</p>

The editors met yesterday to discuss the issues that were pulled out of the previous draft text and document a process for how to resolve these and future issues. We would like to explain how we plan on using labels on GitHub issues to keep track of discussions and keep things moving. <br> <br>When there are substantive issues or pull requests, the editors will avoid merging or closing those outright, and instead mark them as "pending", so that these can be brought to the attention of the larger group. If no additional discussion happens on these, the merge or close action will be taken in 7 days. Note for this first round we are setting the deadline for the issues below as Dec 11th due to the US holiday and the fact that this is the first time using this process. <br> <br>"Pending Merge" <br>When specific text is proposed in a PR (by anyone, not limited to the editors), and the editors believe this text reflects the consensus of the working group, this marks that the PR will be merged in 7 days unless there is a clear alternative proposal accepted by the working group. <br> <br>"Pending Close" <br>When the editors believe an issue no longer needs discussion, we'll mark it "Pending Close". The issue will be closed in 7 days unless someone brings new information to the discussion. This tag is not applied to issues that will be closed by a specific pull request. <br> <br>There are two additional labels we will use to flag issues to the group. <br> <br>"Needs Text" <br>The editors suggest this issue needs additional text in the spec to clarify why this section is needed and under what circumstances. Without a concrete proposal of text to be included in the spec, this section will be removed in a future update. <br> <br>"Postponed" <br>This issue can be reconsidered in the future with a more concrete discussion but is not targeted for immediate concrete changes to the spec text. When used on its own, this label does not indicate that an issue is targeted to be closed. An issue may also be marked "Pending Close", and this is used so that we can distinguish closed issues between discussions that have concluded or things that we may want to revisit in the future. Remember that closed issues are not deleted and their contents are still findable and readable, and that new issues can reference closed issues. <br> <br>With these labels in mind, here are the list of issues and their statuses we were able to discuss on our last editor's call. The action on these pending issues will be taken on Dec 11th to give the group enough time to review this list. For this first round, many of the issues are marked "Pending Close" as we're looking for low hanging fruit to prune the list of issues down. In the future, you can expect to see more "Pending Merge" issues as we're bringing proposed text to review by the WG. <br> <br>Postponed: <br> <br>• Generic claim extension mechanism <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131</a> <br> <br>Pending Merge: <br> <br>• Make access token mandatory for continuation API calls <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129</a> <br> <br>Postponed and Pending Close: <br> <br>• Fetchable Keys <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47</a> <br>• Including OpenID Connect Claims <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64</a> <br>• Application communication with back-end <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82</a> <br>• Additional post-interaction protocols <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83</a> <br> <br>Pending Close: <br>     <br>• HTTP PUT vs POST for rotating access tokens <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100</a> <br>• Use of hash with unique callback URL <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84</a> <br>• Interaction considerations <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81</a> <br>• Expanding dynamic reference handles <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76</a> <br>• Post interaction callback nonce <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73</a> <br>• Unique callback URIs  <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55</a> <br>• Instance identifier <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46</a> <br>• Requesting resources by reference <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36</a> <br>• Mapping resource references <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35</a>

<p>After a cup of menstrual blood went flying across the Senate floor, I had assumed 2019 would be California’s wildest legislative session for a while. Covid-19 proved me unfortunately wrong. The Legislative process, calendar and agenda was quickly thrown into the dumpster fire of March and everyone turned back to the white&nbsp;board.</p><p>When the Legislature returned from its two-month long “stay at home” recess in May, it passed a stripped-down state budget which reflected lower revenues given the pandemic-induced recession. They then began prioritizing and shelving hundreds of bills that would no longer make the cut in the truncated legislative calendar. Faced with less time to hold hearings and less money to spend on new proposals, legislators shelved an estimated three-quarters of the bills introduced at the beginning of the two-year&nbsp;session.</p><p>Here’s what happened for BAC’s blockchain/crypto sponsored bills:</p><p>AB 953 (Ting, San Francisco), which would have allowed state and local taxes to be paid with stablecoins, was sadly withdrawn, lacking a clear Covid-19&nbsp;nexus.</p><p>AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next&nbsp;year.</p><p>AB 2150 (Calderon, Whittier) spun through several dizzying iterations. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition worked closely with Assemblymember Calderon’s office to suggest amended language that would have directed the Department of Business Oversight to study the applicability of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce’s Proposal to an intrastate safe harbor. An idea that in previous years seemed far fetched suddenly had political legs and was well received by the agency and several committees. It died in the Senate Appropriations Committee along with nearly everything else that had a significant price tag or wasn’t urgently related to the pandemic.</p><p>Fruitful discussions with the DBO about crypto regulation were well timed, however. Given the microscope on consumer protections due to the economic distress caused by the pandemic, the agency received a $19.2 million allocation and a new name: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (CDFPI- much worse acronym&nbsp;imo).</p><p>HERE’S THE PART YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO:</p><p>With this new agency budget/mission, comes a very likely change in the way cryptocurrency is regulated in <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1864">CA. AB 1864</a> does a few&nbsp;things:</p>  Establishes a Financial Technology Innovation Office based in San Francisco  Requires the department to promulgate rules regarding registration requirements  Charges this department with regulating currently unregulated financial services including issuers of stored value or such&nbsp;business  <p>This marks a departure from the agency’s previous approach. Virtual currency businesses did not have any separate registration requirements or the need to apply for a money transmitter license. BAC participated in stakeholder calls this summer about the agency’s expansion and we are continuing to engage with the agency about how these registration requirements will be created. Cryptocurrency businesses need to understand that the agency has been given the authority to create these standards without going back to the legislature, so early engagement is&nbsp;key.</p><p>Interested in joining our coalition and having a seat at the table? Contact: <a href="mailto:ally@blockadvocacy.org">ally@blockadvocacy.org</a></p><p>BAC has previously facilitated educational workshops with the Department of Business Oversight and hosted roundtables with Gov. Newsom, Treasurer Ma and the Legislature to build an understanding of the importance of the blockchain industry in&nbsp;CA.</p>

And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

We cover numerous topics, including the development of national standards, the role of the Standards Council of Canada ( https://www.scc.ca/ ), its technical committees, and, the development of CIOSC’s latest national standard on digital identity. 

We also talked about the contribution of the Canadian Public Sector through work done on the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework ( https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/)

What was once mountains of paperwork and hours on the phone is now reduced to as little as a few taps on your insurer’s app. However, as far as the technology has come today, the insurance industry’s — and most industries’ — approach to digital identity simply hasn’t kept pace with the great strides made in other technology domains. In this article, we aim to break down the benefits that SSI can deliver to both insurers and policyholders, and what we at R3 are building to enable SSI on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/digital-identity/">Corda</a>.</p><blockquote>For a refresher on how self-sovereign identity works, check out my article&nbsp;here:</blockquote><p><a href="https://medium.com/@arjgovind/self-sovereign-identity-under-the-hood-b987123c25ba">Self-Sovereign Identity: Under the Hood</a></p> Identity and the Insurance Lifecycle <p>Philosophically, why does insurance need a revamped approach to identity? The simple fact is that verifying information is an extremely labor-intensive, cumbersome and expensive process. By having information that’s presented to you in a verifiable-by-default format, the cost of painstakingly going over paper documents to ensure that one person actually got in a car accident, for instance, is all but eliminated.</p><p>Prospecting and Onboarding: Prospecting is a costly and cumbersome process for a whole host of reasons. The most obvious reason is that insurers need to collect information about their customers to offer quotes. However, insurers can’t simply take the customers at their word — generating quotes means undertaking a costly process of verifying information the customer provided. However, if the customer information was presented as a verifiable credential, then an insurer could instantaneously check that information. Unlike insurance today, this verification process is the instantaneous regardless of whether the credential is a proof of address, an educational qualification, or a traffic accident&nbsp;record.</p><p>If a prospective lead accepts the quote, they must then be onboarded as customers. This involves the three dreaded letters: KYC. For regulatory reasons, insurers need to conduct mandatory background checks to ensure that the prospective customer has no ties to money laundering or other financial crimes. A failure to do so — or an inadequate check — could result in steep fines. We have a forthcoming deep dive on how SSI can specifically help with KYC, but the long and short of it is that in the SSI/VC world, you don’t need to have a compliance associate painfully poring over scanned ID documents and manually verifying them. Instead, if the customer’s information — say their medical history — was presented as a verifiable credential, then it can be verified instantaneously. This does raise the question of how onboarding would work for a customer who doesn’t have such credentials. In this case, they could simply be onboarded the way they are today, and they could be issued a verifiable credential that contains the information the insurer verified. Having this credential would mean that subsequent KYC checks — say for a different division of the insurer — would be able to leverage this credential and avoid duplicative manual verifications. <br> The bottom line: SSI and VCs mean less money spent verifying customer information, quicker KYC, and ultimately lower compliance costs.</p><p>Proof of Insurance: Carrying physical paper-based proofs of insurance is a bad idea for a multitude of reasons. It can be lost or stolen — not to mention the fact that it’s awfully easy to spill coffee on it. By using a credential-based system, people with insurance can use verifiable presentations to offer proof of insurance to healthcare providers or any other party who wants to verify someone’s insurance. The reason a credential-based system is so much better-suited for proof of insurance is because it’s so much easier to verify the proof of insurance in a digital system. Imagine a policeman trying to verify someone’s car insurance at a traffic stop. The officer would have to get the paper credential, read from a years-old paper, punch in a serial number into the database (running the risk of typos) and wait for the information to come back. Contrast that with a credential-based system, where all the officer needs to do is verify the presentation that the driver can generate on their phone. <br> The bottom line: Customers have proof-of-insurance on their phone, readily verifiable with the scan of a QR code through verifiable presentations.</p><p>Making Claims: Filing a claim can be a painfully bureaucratic procedure which usually comes at a time when people need assistance the most, such as following property damage or hospitalization. Self-sovereign identity can make the data collection and verification process easier for both the users and insurers. Consider the case of health insurance. If someone has been admitted to the hospital, the hospital could issue a credential to certify that this individual has indeed been treated for a certain condition. The user could then issue a verifiable presentation to the insurer, who can accordingly process the claim. The advantages are clear — the user doesn’t need to fill out lengthy forms to submit a claim, and more importantly the insurer doesn’t need to struggle to verify the information, as the information came in a verifiable credential which can be verified instantly.<br> The bottom line: Insurers spend less time spent verifying claim data, customers enjoy a quicker and less paper-based claim application process.</p> On GDPR Compliance and Data&nbsp;Breaches Let’s talk law. Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@inakihxz?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Iñaki del Olmo</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/law?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>A somewhat unseen dimension of the identity lifecycle is thinking about how the company stores its customers’ information. As I’ve written about in more detail <a href="https://www.r3.com/blog/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance/">in this article</a>, regulatory changes like GDPR have compelled companies — at the risk of 4% of their annual revenues — to hold personally-identifiable information (PII) in a manner that is secure (so as not to risk a data breach) and easily removable if the company receives a delete request. Current approaches to PII storage tend to be database-driven, and when companies have copies of customer data across offices that potentially span several continents, managing a GDPR deletion request can be a challenging and costly affair. With SSI, companies no longer need to store every last portion of customer information in a database. Sensitive information, say Social Security Numbers or financial information, could be held in a verifiable credential issued to the user instead of somewhere in a database.</p><p>However, to say that SSI would completely eliminate information held in company databases would be flatly incorrect. After all, there may be some information that the insurance companies want to collect and store about their users to help personalize service or for analytics. The value of SSI lies in the fact that the information that a malicious actor may want to get hold of — SSNs, banking information and the like — aren’t held in a single centralized place. In other words, if you were a hacker, you’d be a lot more interested in a database of SSNs than a database of the time each user spent in the app. This means that there’s a substantially mitigated risk of the steep penalties and reputational damage that come with a data breach. Moreover, this data minimization could make it much easier to handle a GDPR data erasure request, cutting compliance-related costs.</p><p>Ultimately, this means that SSI has the potential to let insurance companies decide what data they want to store, avoid costly data breaches and reduce the risk of penalties associated with&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance-15c289ac3c27">Is Self-Sovereign Identity the Answer to GDPR Compliance?</a></p> How Can SSI be Implemented in Insurance?  The “Minimum Viable Ecosystem” <p>Clearly, the value of an SSI solution is maximized when everyone is a part of the same ecosystem. This would mean all of us having credential-based driver’s licenses and passports from the government, credentials for each insurance we have, the police being willing to issue a credential if a car is in an accident, maybe even universities issuing credential-based degrees! In practice we’re a long way away from having every single party in the identity system using self-sovereign identity. So that begs the question — what’s the minimum viable ecosystem we need for self-sovereign identity?</p><p>The answer is that it depends on what services you want SSI to&nbsp;cover.</p><p>Perhaps the starting point — or the “minimum viable ecosystem” — would be an internal SSI solution. Insurers, much like other financial institutions, can be vastly complex organizations with information often siloed between branches and divisions. An internal SSI solution would mean that individuals can hold their information (say their personal details and what insurance they have) in a digital wallet, and if another branch or division wants to use their information to run a compliance check or to process a claim, then they can simply send a notification to the user asking for approval (i.e. a request) to access the verifiable credential information. An extension of this could be “bankassurance”, where insurance products are sold through a bank. The advantage here would be that the bank can share their KYC file with the insurance underwriter with the user’s permission, meaning less money spent on compliance checks for the insurer and fewer delays for the end&nbsp;user.</p> The Corda Advantage <p>We at R3 view identity as an integral layer in any solution in the financial services space. While some past use cases involving identity on <a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/digital-identity/">Corda</a> have been geared towards KYC, we recognize the tremendous opportunity presented by self-sovereign identity. As such, our product focus has been geared towards building out interoperability with large open-source networks for decentralized identity. This is exemplified by <a href="https://www.corda.net/blog/meet-cordentity/">Cordentity</a>, a CorDapp that enables interoperability between the Corda network and Hyperledger Indy. Our push towards interoperability will allow your solution to leverage <a href="http://r3.com/corda-platform">Corda’s core strengths</a> — smart contracts and instantaneous cash movement for instance — while enjoying the great benefits of SSI and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Learn more about what we’re doing in <a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/digital-identity/">digital identity</a> and <a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/insurance/">insurance</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/how-self-sovereign-identity-can-revolutionize-insurance-a71ebf74c00a">How Self-Sovereign Identity Can Revolutionize Insurance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3">R3 Publication</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Since February of 2020, I have been spending time with the <a href="http://www.mm-adt.org/">mm-ADT</a>, or multi-model abstract data type, project. I am not an expert by any means, but <a href="https://markorodriguez.com/">Dr. Marko Rodriguez</a> and <a href="https://www.wisnesky.net/">Dr. Ryan Wisnesky</a> have been gracious to me on the Slack channel. <br><br>Marko has been coding since he was 12 and since has become a pioneer in the graph database movement with his development of the graph traversal language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_(query_language)">Gremlin</a>. He worked on an early implementation in <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache TinkerPop</a> and commercialized Gremlin in Titan through his company Aurelius [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee9TCXU--A">1</a>,<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/p2vo0J8jou8/Lr0r0cIdBwAJ">2</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAYA4Kd8JE">3</a>,<a href="http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/">4</a>].<br><br>Gremlin provides a virtual machine that allows people to express queries functionally on data that can be interpreted as a graph. A variety of programming and query languages can work together to compile to byte code used to execute Gremlin traversals.<br><br>Ryan worked with <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/">Dr. David Spivak</a> to manipulate databases using category theory. It is described extensively in both David and Ryan's talks [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk36__qkhrk">5</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkHce4zWmUk">6</a>] and has been commercialized through <a href="https://conexus.ai/">Conexus</a>. Ryan Holbrook also observed the work and produced and excellent talk [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJrVKZULiLU">7</a>].<br><br>Conexus' product, the <a href="https://www.categoricaldata.net/">Categorical Query Language</a> allows users to apply various database tasks such as"querying, combining, migrating, and evolving" using provably correct algebra.<br><br>Marko and Ryan are among the group congregating in a new mm-ADT community.&nbsp; The goal is to have Languages, Processors, and Databases interconnect. if this is confusing, look at Actors in the distributed computer sense for where this is headed [<a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">8</a>]. However, Actors are inclusive to mm-ADT since it is more general. <br><br>Algebra described in the String Ring Theory paper [<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2565243#.Xs2irBZOlFR">9</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235158">+</a>], combined with category theory, is being implemented in the mm-ADT project. What might have been a variation and for TinkerPop3 has now become generalized algebraic approach that is applicable to more than things resembling graphs. This generalized approach was described by Marko in the GQL Community Update [<a href="https://www.gqlstandards.org/community-updates">10</a>], ApacheCon in 2019 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-multimodel-abstract-data-type">11</a>] , and DataDays in 2020 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-virtual-machinean-economic-machine">12</a>]. <br><br>Joshua Shinavier has also followed the mathematical trend in TinkerPop by working on Algebraic Property Graphs with Ryan Wisnesky [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04881">13</a>] and giving a talk at the Global Graph Summit (co-located with DataDays) [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrFz64aF5sY">14</a>]. <br><br>My involvement with this community came conveniently when a friend urged me to start a project that aimed to track data from at least nationally distributed IoT devices. <br><br>tl;dr: Marko began following me during the mid-summer of 2019. I am blaming my mm-ADT involvement on a tweet and perhaps a prayer:<br><br> <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-f1_BU_KX8Ug/Xs3Nxqliy4I/AAAAAAAAD3A/UDnOxqF2G6w9ojwyGUtq_KNyUBZZ2kHAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/twarkoNewYear.png"></a> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>This piece is the third installment of a series on digital identity called “Please Allow Me to Introduce Myself: The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Identity.” This series aims to explore the evolution of digital identity, the state of self-sovereign identity today, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Check out previous installments here:<br><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/the-past-present-and-future-of-digital-identity-3c590dfe96f3">Part 1: The Evolution of Digital Identity</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/@arjgovind/self-sovereign-identity-under-the-hood-b987123c25ba">Part 2: Self-Sovereign Identity: Under the&nbsp;Hood</a></p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thkelley?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Thomas Kelley</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/law?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Hopefully, following my last piece, the theoretical advantages of a self-sovereign identity solution are clear. From easy verification to managing revoked credentials, advantages abound — at least on paper. However, that in and of itself is likely inadequate to drive wide-scale adoption. The quintessential example of theoretical benefits being insufficient for widespread adoption is PGP — the benefits were there, but the user experience was far from stellar. The user experience was in fact so problematic that <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~tygar/papers/Why_Johnny_Cant_Encrypt/OReilly.pdf">academic papers </a>were written to explain why the average person — or “Johnny” as the paper named him — were simply unable to use&nbsp;it.</p><p>In this installment, I take our first look at what I believe is the most important catalyst of adoption: Big Brother. While industry-specific regulations like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements and the 2nd Payment Services Directive (PSD2) are topics for subsequent posts, I want to focus on personal data and consent management — which is the main goal of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations, or&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>GDPR demands nothing short of a sea change in how organizations store and manage personal data. However, in this article, I want to focus on arguably the most significant clause of GDPR as it relates to identity management: Article 17, or “the right to be forgotten”.</p> What Is The Right To Be Forgotten? <p>The right to be forgotten, also called the (distinctly less dramatic) “right to erasure”, allows users to request that the company “forgets” them, or removes every instance of their data from their system. This right to be forgotten is very much in line with the tenets and premise of self-sovereign identity. Thinking back to Christopher Allen’s <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI </a>I cited in the first installment, the right to be forgotten is a manifestation of the control one should have over the use of their identity.</p><blockquote>If my personal data is truly mine, then I should be able to decide not only who can use it, but also when someone can use&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>The law states that “The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay”, essentially asking the holder of the data to “forget” them. However, if left unqualified, such a policy could have disastrous implications. Consider, for instance, a facial recognition algorithm that was trained using Person A’s face in the training set. If Person A then put in a deletion request, would the entire algorithm have to be re-trained?</p><p>The short answer is&nbsp;no.</p><p>As important as the right to erasure is, it’s not an absolute right. Article 17 lays out a series of conditions, or cases when the right to be forgotten can be exercised.</p><p>The right to be forgotten can only be exercised if one of the following criteria is&nbsp;met:</p>  The personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was originally collected or processed for  The data was originally held for a legitimate state interest, but there is no longer any such legitimate state&nbsp;interest  The personal data had been processed unlawfully  The personal data needs to be deleted to comply with a legal obligation  <p>As such, our example would fail the first test, as that data would be necessary for the purpose it was collected for.</p> What’s The Problem&nbsp;Here? <p>So why is the right to be forgotten is proving to be one of the hardest problems to tackle when it comes to GDPR compliance? The challenge it presents is threefold: discerning a valid deletion request, identifying what constitutes “personal data”, and actually deleting the&nbsp;data.</p><p>The first problem certainly doesn’t lack for irony. Of course, in the SSI world, this would just be a matter of presenting a verifiable presentation, and all would be well. However, coming back to the username-password world, something as simple as a credential stuffing attack (essentially, trying out usernames and passwords stolen from a data breach) could have disastrous implications. To demonstrate, consider the case of a disgruntled employee acting against their employer by sending a deletion request to Google. Imagine the devastation — Gmail, GCal all vanishing without a trace! This is compounded by the fact that this employee may know or obtain the answers to security questions through social engineering.</p><blockquote>Since one of these deletion requests are impossible to undo (that’s the point, right?!), it’s imperative that companies come up with robust approaches to ensuring that all such requests they receive are indeed&nbsp;valid.</blockquote><p>However, even after moving past this problem, companies face the problem of figuring out what information should be removed. For instance, if a social media company gets a deletion request from a user who is tagged in photos posted by their friends, what information if any should be removed? I’m not a lawyer, so I can’t give a definitive answer — what constitutes personal data will likely be guided by precedent that develops over time. Companies will have to invest a lot of time and money in attorney fees in figuring out that definition.</p><p>So say we know that the deletion request is valid and we know what data to delete. We’re all clear right? Just go and hit delete, right? Well, not quite. In fact, this may be the hardest challenge of them all — finding that data. And it’s a little bit more involved than just Ctrl+F. The reality is that information can stored across several databases, perhaps across several divisions, offices and maybe even countries.</p><p>On a technical level, this could happen due to mirroring, a process you may have encountered while downloading software. If I’m based in Philly, it’ll be far quicker for me to access data held in a server in New York or Virginia as compared to one in Shanghai or Mumbai. On the flip side, if I’m in Bangalore, it makes much more sense for me to just use a server somewhere else in India. Redundant as this may seem, it’s very common in practice, especially in applications where the microsecond differences in accessing data&nbsp;matter.</p><p>So there you have it. We first need to figure out if a deletion request is valid. Once we do so, we need to reach out to our lawyers and figure out what data needs to be deleted. And once we do that, we need to trace down every last bit of that data across all of our databases and delete&nbsp;it.</p><p>And that’s just one fraction of GDPR compliance for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Clearly, companies will incur substantial costs in reorganizing data to make it easier to handle these requests, and that’s where I believe an opportunity lies. Instead of risking GDPR’s hefty fines and fees, companies could use this opportunity to invest in an alternative, GDPR-compliant, self-sovereign approach to identity.</p><blockquote>But how does SSI fix&nbsp;this?</blockquote><p>So why does self-sovereign identity solve this problem? One of the main ways it does so is through data minimization. Consider, for instance, an online liquor store that requires patrons to be 21+ to purchase alcohol on their site. Historically, they would have needed to store documentation like a scan of their driver’s license or passport as a means of age verification. However, in the SSI world, a patron of this site can simply give them a verifiable presentation that has no personally identifiable information, or even their date of birth! How? As we’ve discussed in <a href="https://www.r3.com/blog/the-case-for-self-sovereign-identity/">the earlier piece</a>, instead of using a verifiable presentation that gives the site the user’s date of birth, they can simply give a presentation that verifies whether they’re over 21. Beyond data minimization, credentials also come with expiration times, so this allows personal data to have something of a “shelf life”, unlike conventional data, which can sit in some database for eternity.</p><p>As we’ve discussed in this piece, implementing the right to be forgotten can be a nightmare under traditional identity systems. From identifying a valid deletion request to identifying what constitutes “personal data” to actually deleting the data, compliance can be a real challenge. With up to 4% of annual revenues at stake, though, companies really can’t afford to misstep. Self-sovereign identity can make GDPR compliance substantially similar through its credential-based model, allowing minimal data to be shared and&nbsp;held.</p><p>In the next piece, we’ll continue our deepdive into how SSI relates to regulation, looking specifically at Know Your Customer (KYC) laws. Stay&nbsp;tuned!</p><blockquote>Read the next installment here:<br><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/how-self-sovereign-identity-can-revolutionize-insurance-a71ebf74c00a">Part 4: How Self-Sovereign Identity Can Revolutionize Insurance</a></blockquote><p>__</p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/golden-data/what-is-the-right-to-be-forgotten-under-eu-data-protection-law-11ce28518f28">What is the ‘Right to be Forgotten’? — Medium</a></p><p><a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/gdpr-challenges-digital-memory/">GDPR and the Challenges of Digital Memory — Harvard University</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance-15c289ac3c27">Is Self-Sovereign Identity the Answer to GDPR Compliance?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3">R3 Publication</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This piece is the second installment of a series on digital identity called “Please Allow Me to Introduce Myself: The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Identity.” This series aims to explore the evolution of digital identity, the state of self-sovereign identity today, and its <a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/digital-identity/">use&nbsp;cases</a>.</p><p>Check out previous installments here:<br><a href="https://www.r3.com/blog/the-evolution-of-digital-identity/">Part 1: The Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Identity</a></p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@evanheinphoto?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Evan Hein</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/car-engine?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>In <a href="https://www.r3.com/blog/the-evolution-of-digital-identity/">my last piece</a>, I concluded with a somewhat grandiose claim — that self-sovereign identity (SSI) has the potential to be the future of the identity and access management industry. I went on to identify some broad guiding principles that SSI entails. In this piece, the rubber meets the road. I begin by exploring the mechanics of SSI, focusing on the fundamental components of any SSI solution, and the benefits of such a&nbsp;design.</p><p>SSI: The Nuts and&nbsp;Bolts</p><p>The premise of SSI is that it’s an identity you fully own — there is no central entity that manages that relationship. Whenever you want to establish your identity — be it to order a drink at a bar or to check into a flight — you can present “claims” about your identity that can be subsequently verified with cryptographic certainty by the authority that wants to check&nbsp;it.</p><p>There are three component parts to a self-sovereign identity solution, and we’ll be breaking each of these down sequentially.</p>  Decentralized Identifiers  Verifiable Credentials  “Supporting Actors”: Agents and Decentralized Key Management   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) <p>When we think about our identities today, be it the passport or student ID we present at an airport or the Facebook login we use to sign into an online game, they are invariably owned and managed by someone other than us. A decentralized identifier (DID) is an online identity that you can create that is truly owned by&nbsp;you.</p><p>The best analogy I’ve heard for DIDs is that they are a URL to your identity. Just as typing “<a href="https://www.r3.com/">https://www.r3.com/</a>” into your browser takes you to our homepage, similarly your DID can be used to pull up a DID document (a “DIDDoc”) that contains a series of “claims” about your identity. More on those claims in a&nbsp;minute.</p><p>Before we take a closer look at the DIDDoc and the associated claims, it’s important to understand the core structure of the DID. Here’s what a DID on <a href="https://www.r3.com/corda-network/">Corda Network</a> could look&nbsp;like.</p>A sample DID on Corda. Image made by&nbsp;author.<p>Breaking it down into its component parts, the first component — the scheme — denotes that this is a digital identity, much like “http” denotes a website URL. The next term, here “corda” is known as the method, essentially referring to which network it is on — say Corda or Sovrin for instance. The next part — “tcn” in this example — refers to a subsystem or subnetwork (say the testnet versus the main network). Lastly, we have a unique identifier, which is unique to you on that given&nbsp;network.</p><p>Much like most identity solutions nowadays, DIDs are fundamentally underpinned by public-key cryptography (for a refresher, see part 1). A DID is generated and addressed by a public key, while the corresponding private key is held by the DID holder. This allows the DID owner to have complete control over their identity.</p><p>So, all this information about structure is great and all, but how can I use decentralized ID to get myself a beer? Let’s come back to the URL analogy. If the decentralized identifier is like a URL, then the analogy would mean that it takes us to a page that had all of our information on it, right? Well, not quite. And as you’ll see, such an approach would have a range of drawbacks. So what’s actually in the DID document?</p><p>The most fascinating part about this is that the DID Document itself doesn’t have any personally-identifiable information (PII) stored on it. If it did, then it would simply be as good as a centralized solution. Ostensibly, it could actually be far worse than a centralized system if hashed PII was stored on a public blockchain. Blockchains love to advertise their immutability, and in this case that entails PII being publicly available in perpetuity. If the hash were to somehow be broken (I know quantum computing is the buzzword du jour), then all of that PII would be laid bare, and blockchain would have been hoist with its own immutability petard.</p><p>So, how can a blockchain-based ID solution overcome the challenge presented by immutability? The answer lies in verifiable claims. Instead of containing personal information itself, the DIDDoc simply contains a series of credentials that can be verified. Instead of having text that says, “Arjun studies at Wharton”, it would have an external link to Wharton’s registry that would verify that I’m a student&nbsp;there.</p><p>This begs the question of how these credentials work, taking us to our next&nbsp;section.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>As we’ve seen, DIDs themselves don’t contain any personally identifiable information; that would run the risk of the ID system becoming obsolete quickly. As such, information such as my age, continuing the bar analogy, is contained in credentials. The fascinating part about the credential system is it’s just an upgrade on precisely the way we identify ourselves today. Today, if one were to go to a bar, they would hand over a driver’s license, passport or equivalent. These are credentials, just in paper form. The challenge with paper credentials, though, is that any form of verification likely means getting on the phone with the DMV. If the license says that someone is 25 when they look no older than 17, the only way for the bar to verify whether the age on the driver’s license was tampered (or if this person was issued a license at all!) is probably to get on the phone with the DMV. And who wants to get on the phone with the DMV in the middle of happy hour service? Jokes aside, though, it can be extremely challenging to verify information presented in credentials. The advantage of a digital credential — over and above never having to worry about spilling coffee on it — is that someone who wants to verify your age (for instance) can verify details through cryptography. Moreover, it’s something that you fully own, as opposed to something being managed by a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>So what can be proven, and what does the proof process look&nbsp;like?</p><p>Let’s go back to our favorite example: I want to somehow prove my age to the bar to be served a bar with my driver’s license. Let’s introduce some terminology here. The credential I want to use is my driver’s license, which has some claims on my identity, amongst which is my age. I am the holder and subject of this credential, issued by my state government, and the bar wants to verify&nbsp;it.</p><p>To do so, instead of handing over my whole driver’s license, which would disclose personal information like my address, I can simply offer a verifiable presentation. A verifiable presentation presents only parts of the claim, and allows certain elements to be verified cryptographically by the bar. More concretely, there are four key components that can be verified:</p>  Who issued the credential  Who the credential was issued&nbsp;to  Whether the claims were tampered&nbsp;with  Whether the credential has been&nbsp;revoked  <p>These four elements — especially the first and fourth — would be extremely hard to prove in a paper-based system. Say, for instance, that someone applying for a job claims to have studied at Wharton. However, as it happens, this individual was found guilty of plagiarism and had their degree revoked by the school. If this person just showed the paper diploma found at graduation to the school, it would likely take several phone calls and a lot of hassle (or calling a central database of degrees from the school) to see if this otherwise fully legitimate credential had been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Let’s come back to that bar. One possible verifiable presentation would simply be my date of birth, which is a claim on my driver’s license. However, we can take this one level further when we realize that the bar doesn’t need to know my actual date of birth, rather simply whether I am over 21. Whether I am 22 or 29 is irrelevant to them. As such, we can even make a presentation of a derived claim — the binary question of whether I’m over 21 — and the bar can verify the answer to that question cryptographically.</p> Supporting Actors: Agents and Decentralized Key Management <p>Finally, no ecosystem is complete without supporting actors. The most evident one of these is the actual interface that humans will use to interact with identity, referred to as “agents” in the SSI community. I think a good example to conceptualize these agents are like the mobile wallets used today to hold cryptocurrencies. The premise of agents is that it offers an interface to manage DIDs and verifiable credentials and presentations much like a cryptocurrency wallet can hold and manage tokens. To those less familiar with the crypto world, another possible way to think of these agents are — quite broadly — as the next evolution of password management services like Dashlane or Lastpass. The core distinction is that those services may require you to copy your details from the app to their platform and authenticate accordingly. On the other hand, a verifiable presentation allows the verifier to simply cryptographically check a provided credential.</p><p>Another pivotal element is how the public key infrastructure (PKI) is implemented in SSI systems. As we recall from <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/the-past-present-and-future-of-digital-identity-3c590dfe96f3">the previous installment</a>, the public-key infrastructure helps map public keys and other virtual identifiers to real-world identities and ensure that there are systems to generate identifiers and recover compromised ones. Conventionally, this has been done by a third party — or a Certificate Authority — verifying the link between the identifier and real ID and creating a digital certificate to certify this. The implication is that for us to truly trust an identity, we must trust the CA that maps these identifiers to real identities. The problem emerges that if CAs are highly centralized, then any benefits of decentralization of trust stemming from the DID/VC model are largely for naught. This means that implementing a decentralized key management system (or DKMS) is essential for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>The fascinating part is that, if implemented correctly, the ledger itself obviates the need for a CA. Because it’s a decentralized solution with no ‘higher authority’ to turn to, the burdens of real ID linkage and key recovery fall to participants on the network. Trusting that the identifiers are tied to real IDs happens through the verifiable credential system. Because credentials are issued to real people (Arjun Govind — not my DID — is issued a driver’s license or a college degree), the ability to show ownership of a credential links my DID to a real identity. Managing key recovery is a somewhat finer point — some methods that have been implemented here include offline recovery, using some physical token as a recovery tool, and a “trustee” model. The trustee model involves giving some encrypted account recovery information to some trusted friends, and in the event that one loses access to their phone (for instance), they can use this information to authenticate back&nbsp;in.</p> Moving Beyond the Whitepapers <p>In this article, we took a look under the hood at self-sovereign identity, offering a look at the fundamental schema (decentralized identifiers and verifiable claims) that underpins it. However, in order to get self-sovereign identity to move off whitepapers and into the real world, we need to think about some tailwinds. And the greatest tailwind, as drab as it may be, is regulation. In the next two blog posts, we’ll be breaking down two core broad regulations — GDPR and KYC regulations — and understand how that can further the shift to self-sovereign identity.</p><p>Learn more about what we at R3 are doing in <a href="https://www.r3.com/customers/digital-identity/">decentralized identity</a>.</p><blockquote>Read the next installment here:<br><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance-15c289ac3c27">Part 3: Is Self-Sovereign Identity the Answer to GDPR Compliance?</a></blockquote><p>__</p> Sources: <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers — W3</a></p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model — W3</a></p><p><a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/gdpr-challenges-digital-memory/">A Deep Dive: The Right to be Forgotten — Harvard University</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot4-paris/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-decentralized-key-mgmt-system.md">Decentralized Key Management Systems — Rebooting Web of Trust&nbsp;4</a></p>

Or that scramble to see if your personal information was compromised when your usual fitness app or airline gets hacked (looking at you, MyFitnessPal and British Airways). Or the hassle of setting up yet another account on yet another e-commerce site, not knowing if they are secure enough to store your personal email ID. Digital identity underpins our every step on the internet, and yet — despite decades of evolution — problems still&nbsp;abound.</p><p>The notion of identity is arguably our most intrinsic characteristic — it’s our answer to “Who are you?”. However, in the online realm, figuring out who is who is a more complex process. Who assigns names? Who ensures that names are unique? Can we trust the entity in charge of all our IDs? Our answers to these questions have evolved just as the Internet has, and in this essay, I will talk about the long road of identity solutions we’ve walked down, where we are now, and where we could be headed in the&nbsp;future.</p> Identity Models of the&nbsp;Past  The Early Days: ARPANET and&nbsp;DNS <p>The very first days of the “internet” introduced us to the most basic model of storing identities: the humble database. ARPANET, a precursor to the Internet created by the Department of Defense, involved each computer having a numeric address. In order to make more intuitive to navigate and communicate, each computer could create a “hostname”, which essentially could serve as a nickname to make communication easier. However, who kept track of the nicknames for each of these nicknames and which numeric addresses each nickname corresponded to? That responsibility fell to the Stanford Research Institute (the SRI).<a>[1]</a> The SRI maintained one central database simply known as hosts.txt, containing each hostname and corresponding addresses. In order to add a new hostname to this host.txt, users would have to call the SRI (only during business hours, of course!) and manually add the&nbsp;file.</p><p>Clearly, this solution doesn’t scale. This approach may have been okay in the ’70s, when there weren’t that many computers on the network, however the hassle of manually maintaining this meant that people quickly searched for an alternative. Moreover, imagine the chaos if someone from the SRI made a typo while noting the hostname or corresponding address! Quickly, there began a searched for an automated system. From here, DNS was born. DNS comprises a part of the internet protocol suite, sometimes referred to as TCP/IP, two fundamental protocols within the suite. The premise behind it is that navigating the internet through IP addresses is cumbersome and unintuitive; instead, a much better system would be to assign pseudonyms as was done for hostnames earlier! This allows us to simply look up websites by going to <a href="http://www.r3.com">www.r3.com</a> instead of a more convoluted IP address to access R3’s website. Unlike the previous approach that needed to be updated by hand, the DNS system runs on a distributed database. The main authority in charge of domain registration is the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, a non-profit. DNS thus served as the first step towards a more robust digital identity.</p><p>And now, as with most tech discussions nowadays, we must take a detour to talk about public-key cryptography.</p> Digital Signatures and Certifying Authorities <p>When you were first introduced to cryptography, you were probably given a metaphor involving a lock and a key. I have a message, I lock it with my key, and then if you have the same key then you can open the lock. Public-key cryptography is a little more complicated, as there are two linked keys — a public key and a private key. If a message is encrypted with a public key, it can be decrypted with a private key, and vice versa. While the two keys work hand-in-hand, one cannot be deduced from the other, allowing us to freely disseminate a public key. The way this is used for encryption is to encrypt a message using a public key, allowing it to be decrypted by only the person holding the private key. However, another application of this is to do the reverse. On the face of it, it makes little sense to encrypt something with a private key. After all, to encrypt a message with a private key means that anyone with a public key (readily available) can decrypt the message, right? While that is true, “encrypting” a message with a private key serves another purpose — it serves as a digital signature. The idea here is that only the holder of the private key (you) could encrypt a message in such a way that it is decryptable with your public key. Applications of this abound — from signing contracts to financial services.</p><p>However, we can take the concept of digital signatures one level further. Using digital signatures, all we can really identify is the public key associated with the owner of the message. To link a public key to an actual identity, we need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). A common approach to PKI is having a third-party Certificate Authority (CA) that validates and certifies the relationship between a public key and an actual entity or identity. However, the implicit assumption here is that the CA can be trusted; if the CA isn’t trusted by either the owner of the public key or the person seeking to verify the identity, then this model doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p> Bottom-Up Approaches: Webs of Trust and “Pretty Good&nbsp;Privacy” <p>The digital signature and CA system seemed to be a good system, however it resulted in a great amount of centralization because of the CAs. This concentration of trust in the CAs made people start to look for alternative, decentralized solutions. The most notable example here is Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, an attempt to use public-key cryptography to secure emails. The idea behind PGP was to have people verify other people they knew or whose identity they had verified, thus creating a P2P “Web of Trust”, as discussed further in <a href="https://www.r3.com/reports/identity-in-depth/">this paper</a>. In principle, this does accomplish the goal of eliminating a central certificate authority to definitively link public keys to real identities, however it is not without its drawbacks. Ultimately, adoption didn’t take off on a large scale for a number of factors. Most significantly, e-mail is highly centralized by design; emails are definitionally under the control of the institutions offering the service (Google, Yahoo and the like). This, coupled with clunky, hard-to-use software, meant that the only real examples of web-of-trust models come from highly technical and niche domains. — one example of this is the Debian operating system.</p><p>Now that we have reviewed a range of historical approaches to digital identity, let’s turn to some popular options&nbsp;today.</p> Identity Models&nbsp;Today <p>In this section, I shall explore identity models used today, broadly bifurcating them into siloed identity solutions and federated identities.</p> Conventional (Siloed) Identities <p>A sad reality today is that one of the most common approaches to digital identity is the siloed model we saw in ARPANET: massive, clunky databases holding customer identities and information. Consider the time you bought something on a small e-commerce site and it asked you to set up a username and password to sign in. This probably means that your information is stored in one such database. What’s the problem&nbsp;here?</p><p>Unfortunately, the strength of your identity online is only as strong as the weakest link. It only takes one breach to have information like your payment details and address (continuing the e-commerce example) exposed. The more accounts you have, the more likely it is for any one of those accounts to be compromised, ultimately hurting your identity. The reason this seemingly poor method is so commonly adopted is because it is easy to implement and allows firms to gather data on its users. However, more and more firms are realizing that having extensive data on its users could be a liability just as it is an asset. With greater customer data comes a greater risk of being the target of a hack, which could substantially hurt the trust users place in the&nbsp;app.</p><p>Perhaps the most substantial drawback is the fact that users in this model need to keep track of a slew of logins and passwords, massively hurting convenience. An important takeaway from the PGP section — reinforced countless times by academics — is that convenience remains of the utmost priority in consumer security products. A better solution would be to have a single identity solution that can be used in multiple places, bringing us to our next ID solution.</p> Federated Identity and Identity Providers (aka “Log In With&nbsp;Google”) Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@konkarampelas?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Kon Karampelas</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/login?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>If you’ve ever encountered a “Log In With Google” page, then you’ve encountered a federated identity solution before. The main goal of federated identity (FID) is to avoid the duplication of identities that happens in the traditional siloed model, thereby minimizing the possibility of a weak link getting compromised. While this is undeniably convenient, a number of challenges exist. For starters, federated identity involves placing a substantial amount of trust in the identity provider (IDP), such as Google in the example above. A common criticism is that a change in Google’s Terms of Service (for instance, the imposition of geographical restrictions on use) could lock you out of all linked accounts.</p> The Future of Digital Identity: Self-Sovereign Identity <p>While I certainly don’t have a crystal ball, I do believe that the next evolution of digital identity is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). For the uninitiated, SSI is an identity solution that most commonly uses credentials held in a mobile wallet, very much akin to how cryptocurrencies are held in a wallet. These credentials — given by the same organizations we use today like the government — can then be queried by anyone who wants to verify your identity, say a bar that wants to check if you are of legal drinking&nbsp;age.</p><p>While the mechanics of SSI are for another blog post, I thought it would be worthwhile to conclude with a seminal post by Christopher Allen where he lays out the “Ten Principles of Self-Soverign Identity”.<a>[2]</a></p>  Existence. Users must have an independent existence.  Control. Users must control their identities.  Access. Users must have access to their own&nbsp;data.  Transparency. Systems and algorithms must be transparent.  Persistence. Identities must be long-lived.  Portability. Information and services about identity must be transportable.  Interoperability. Identities should be as widely usable as possible.  Consent. Users must agree to the use of their identity.  Minimalization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized.  Protection. The rights of users must be protected.  <p>These core tenets, specifically control, consent and transparency, have been substantially lacking in current identity approaches today. The advent of SSI stands to let users get greater security and control over their identities online, allowing for increased convenience for everything from proving your age at a restaurant to completing Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.</p><p>Digital identity has come a long way from manually updated&nbsp;.txt files, driven by great innovations like DNS and public-key cryptography. However, in the process, identities have either become duplicated ad nauseam or deeply centralized. Earlier on, trust was centralized due to the Certificate Authority; nowadays, that trust has migrated social networks and other similar IDPs. Self-Sovereign Identity has the potential to fundamentally alter the way we view identity, eliminating the need to trust a single entity and returning control back to the&nbsp;user.</p><blockquote>Read the next installment here: <br><a href="https://medium.com/@arjgovind/self-sovereign-identity-under-the-hood-b987123c25ba">Part 2: Self-Sovereign Identity: Under the&nbsp;Hood</a></blockquote><p>—</p><p><a>[1]</a> <a href="https://ns1.com/resources/dns-protocol">https://ns1.com/resources/dns-protocol</a></p><p><a>[2]</a> <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/the-past-present-and-future-of-digital-identity-3c590dfe96f3">The Evolution of Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3">R3 Publication</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

After all, think about how you would settle up with a friend after dinner today versus ten years ago on the one hand, and how you would prove you’re above 21 to the waiter on the other. The prospect of integrating digital identity with payments has the potential to solve a range of issues that have historically dogged the payments space — from fraud to regulatory compliance. This integration has the potential to offer users greater security and a more seamless payment experience overall.</p><p>The Types of Money — and What They Mean for&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Broadly speaking, there exist two kinds of money: token-based money and account-based money. <a>[1]</a> Token-based money refers to holding items of actual value — like cash or Bitcoin. Transferring value in token-based money involves transferring the token from one to another, say giving a $20 bill to your friend. Contrarily, account-based money refers to a claim against some kind of reserve — you don’t hold the item of value yourself. For instance, consider the money your bank account. The money that your banking app says is in your account savings isn’t physically held by you. Rather, it’s a claim against a bank’s reserve, which can be cashed in (withdrawn) at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>The reason this distinction is important is because of its relation to identity. When you receive a payment with token-based money, the only thing you need to check is if the token itself is legitimate. For instance, this means ensuring that the $100 note a merchant received from a customer isn’t counterfeit or verifying that some Bitcoin one received hasn’t been double spent. On the other hand, account-based money is fundamentally dependent on the ability to verify the identities of the payer and payee.<a>[2]</a> This is because you need to verify their identity to check their transaction history to see if they have enough money in the bank to pay you. Contrast this with token-based money, where if someone is paying you in cash, their prior transaction history is irrelevant. With the verification of identity being so important to account-based money, the case for an identity layer within payments is&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Payment Fraud</p><p>As far as the world of payments has progressed in the past decade, some core frictions within the industry have either lingered or worsened, the most notable being payment fraud.<a>[3]</a> The nature of payment fraud has grown far more complex of late with the advent of the EMV standard on credit cards.<a>[4]</a> Named after the companies who came up with it (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa), EMV is the technical standard behind credit cards today — specifically the chip and contactless (NFC) technology.<a>[5]</a> On the face of it, this standard was a great advancement in payments security — it substantially cut down on counterfeit cards, with data from Visa suggesting that it reduced losses from credit card counterfeiting by 87%.<a>[6]</a> However, the EMV standard has opened the door to more sophisticated attacks, predominantly rooted in weaknesses in the identity&nbsp;layer.</p><p>A key threat is the use of “synthetic identities” — identities created by merging other people’s valid identity elements into one persona.<a>[7]</a> This allows malicious actors to obtain valid EMV cards, just under spurious identities. Current authentication systems currently struggle to differentiate between legitimate customers and these synthetic identities, especially because it’s entirely possible for valid customers to have multiple addresses or share accounts within a&nbsp;family.</p><p>Regulatory Compliance</p><p>It’s no secret that the payments industry is subject to a broad set of regulations, spanning customer data storage to identity verification. Specifically speaking, the regulatory environment has seen two major developments over the past two years: GDPR and PSD2. The challenge with GDPR compliance — and the opportunity for a revised approach to digital identity — is that customer data is frequently siloed and fragmented across various parts of the firm, leading to logistical costs in organizing the data in a regulatorily compliant manner.&nbsp;<a>[8]</a></p><p>While GDPR has dominated identity-related regulation headlines, the 2nd Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is far more significant for payment companies. PSD2 was a directive passed by the European Commission; its goal is to increase competition and security in the European payments industry. They aimed to do so by making banks open up their payment services via APIs and — more pertinently here — insisting on so-called “Strong Customer Authentication”, or SCA. <a>[9]</a> SCA requires stricter authentication (like Two-Factor Authentication) on payment services, through either a device the user has access to (like a code on their phone) or using something inherent to the user (like a fingerprint) in addition to a passcode or PIN. <a>[10]</a> The use of digital identity could be used to make this process more seamless, through a digital identity verifiable credential, for instance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>On the whole, the case for the integration of identity with payments is clear. The rise of account-based money is fundamentally predicated on the ability to verify users, and the current approach to identity has a multitude of flaws. Fraud in the payment world has become increasingly complex, with malicious actors migrating away from counterfeiting towards more sophisticated attacks, often rooted in a lack of strong identity solutions. With progressively stringent regulations like GDPR and PSD2, rising compliance costs make the case for a digital identity layer even stronger.</p><p><a>[1]</a> Brunnermeier, Markus, et al. “The Digitalization of Money.” 2019, doi:10.3386/w26300.</p><p><a>[2]</a> Ibid.</p><p><a>[3]</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2019/01/28/5-reasons-why-payments-and-id-need-to-merge/#2132aff860da">https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2019/01/28/5-reasons-why-payments-and-id-need-to-merge/#2132aff860da</a></p><p><a>[4]</a> <a href="https://www.paymentssource.com/list/how-payments-fraud-is-becoming-more-complexand-expensive">https://www.paymentssource.com/list/how-payments-fraud-is-becoming-more-complexand-expensive</a></p><p><a>[5]</a><a href="https://www.emvco.com/document-search/?action=search_documents&amp;publish_date=&amp;emvco_document_version=&amp;emvco_document_book=&amp;px_search=&amp;emvco_document_type%5B%5D=card">https://www.emvco.com/document-search/?action=search_documents&amp;publish_date=&amp;emvco_document_version=&amp;emvco_document_book=&amp;px_search=&amp;emvco_document_type%5B%5D=card</a></p><p><a>[6]</a> <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2019/09/03/visa-emv-chip-1567530138363.html">https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2019/09/03/visa-emv-chip-1567530138363.html</a></p><p><a>[7]</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/08/synthetic-identity-fraud-is-the-fastest-growing-financial-crime-what-can-banks-do-to-fight-it/#75f7a8d87ecb">https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/08/synthetic-identity-fraud-is-the-fastest-growing-financial-crime-what-can-banks-do-to-fight-it/#75f7a8d87ecb</a></p><p><a>[8]</a> <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2019/europe-data-privacy-payment-security-gpdr-psd2/">https://www.pymnts.com/news/regulation/2019/europe-data-privacy-payment-security-gpdr-psd2/</a></p><p><a>[9]</a> <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/everything-need-know-psd2/">https://www.bbva.com/en/everything-need-know-psd2/</a></p><p><a>[10]</a> <a href="https://www.bbva.com/es/opinion/psd2-y-autenticacion-reforzada-nuevas-reglas-sobre-la-verificacion-de-la-identidad-de-los-clientes/">https://www.bbva.com/es/opinion/psd2-y-autenticacion-reforzada-nuevas-reglas-sobre-la-verificacion-de-la-identidad-de-los-clientes/</a></p>

 What should a regulatory framework for crypto cover? Laws nations should write — and how to enforce&nbsp;them. Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pichler_sebastian?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sebastian Pichler</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/law?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>As an asset class, cryptocurrencies raise a whole host of regulatory questions, spanning illegal transactions à la Silk Road to consumer protection. Today, while there have been innovative regulatory approaches, crypto often suffers from austere regulatory environments, most recently with India’s proposed <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-lawmakers-propose-adoption-of-10-year-jail-term-for-crypto-dealings">10-year jail sentences</a> for so much as holding cryptocurrency.</p><p>I believe that approaches like India’s blanket ban fail to capture the incredible promise that this asset class has. In this article, I hope to present a framework to understand <a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/">cryptocurrency</a> regulation that I believe offer a more effective regulatory structure for this burgeoning technology.</p> Trending Cryptocurrency Hub Articles: <blockquote><a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/saving-billions-how-blockchain-is-changing-marketing-advertising-586cf63ff9f3">1. Saving Billions: How Blockchain Is Changing Marketing &amp; Advertising</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/how-blockchain-technology-is-taking-the-gambling-industry-to-a-new-level-c2cfc5cbc64c">2.

A Crypto that will Pay&nbsp;You</a></blockquote><p>Specifically, I lay out three “pillars”: private law, public law and law enforcement, which I hope can serve as a model for cryptocurrency regulation to countries pondering this question.</p> Can We Regulate Cryptocurrencies At&nbsp;All? <p>An emphatic&nbsp;yes.</p><p>Before I delve into concrete policy proposals, I wanted to address the misconception that blockchain and cryptocurrencies, as private decentralized networks, are fundamentally incompatible with the law. This couldn’t be further from the truth. I contend that blockchain, and cryptocurrencies by extension, are inextricably linked to the law. As Wharton professor Kevin Werbach notes in his paper “Verify, but Trust,” blockchain and the law go hand-in-hand because they are both fundamentally systems to develop trust. In reference to the title of the paper, blockchains offer an efficient form of verification, but it is only with the backing of the legal system does it effectively promote&nbsp;trust.</p><p>A common concern raised by lawmakers is the fact that as such a nascent and emerging technology, laws are too rigid to adapt to its new, decentralized style of commerce.</p><p>However, history has clearly proven otherwise.</p><p>In an often-drawn-upon comparison, one can parallel the emergence of the blockchain and cryptocurrency to the Internet; after all, they’re both foundational technologies. The internet in the 1990s was similarly thought of as a lawless and difficult-to-regulate arena, however, laws have quickly caught up. This has been done to the point that any effort to circumvent the legal system — be it copyright infringement or financial crimes — have been invariably met by stringent regulations. The same can be said about blockchain and cryptocurrency. While it may appear to be difficult to adapt to at first, history has shown that it is most certainly possible and will happen with greater blockchain adoption.</p> The Three&nbsp;Pillars <p>As to concrete proposals to regulate cryptocurrencies, I propose a three-pronged approach, each dealing with a specific section of the law. I believe that the matter can be subdivided into questions of public law (consumer protection, securities law and the like), private law (liability and contract law) and law enforcement.</p> Pillar 1: Public&nbsp;Law <p>A common question faced by regulators globally is how to classify a <a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/">cryptocurrency</a>. Even in the United States, a country with a relatively advanced system to regulate cryptocurrencies, different governing bodies classify cryptocurrencies differently. To the IRS, cryptocurrency is property. To the SEC, cryptocurrency is a security. To the CFTC, it’s a commodity. And so forth. As such, I believe the correct approach is to go down to first principles — understanding financial regulation from a practical and functional perspective.</p><p>Turning to fundamental precedents like SEC v. Howey and the 1933 Securities Act, the core function of such regulation is to enable greater disclosures and transparency to investors. These principles can be applied towards Initial Coin Offering (ICO) regulation.</p><p>As Kevin Werbach said in his article Trust but Verify, “Token sales represent a sudden, grand experiment in caveat emptor securities offerings, targeting retail investors all around the world”. Given the fact that the speculative gains from Bitcoin in December 2017 drew a number of relatively financially unfamiliar retail investors towards cryptocurrency, the “buyer beware” nature of cryptocurrency presents a hurdle from a consumer protection standpoint. As such, the first pillar I propose in my recommended regulatory framework is a bill that mandates registration of ICOs with the equivalent body of America’s SEC. Incorporating this over and above existing securities law will ensure that investors are well-informed and protected while investing in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Continuing the idea of public law, issues of criminal applications of cryptocurrency are another reason countries are reluctant to encourage the trade of cryptocurrency transactions. With the emergence of currencies like Monero, which offer far greater extents of privacy and anonymity compared to Bitcoin and Ether, regulators are concerned that the money can be used to nefarious ends. However, as Werbach notes, “The notion that activity on a blockchain cannot be subject to legal enforcement died with the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, if not&nbsp;before.”</p><p>Ross Ulbricht ran the infamous Silk Road, which was a black market that used bitcoin as a means of settlement. Ultimately, law enforcement was able to arrest him and shutter the market. While any technological innovation, be it the internet or blockchain, will find a way to be used nefariously, the Ulbricht example stands to show that systems of accountability eventually catch up. Methods to trace criminal activity will be addressed in the section on law enforcement.</p><p>However, on the note of public law, policing criminal uses of cryptocurrency is a question of classification. For instance, what would classify as an illegal money flow? Does the equivalent of the FBI or the SEC hold jurisdiction? To answer it plainly, as Werbach&nbsp;answers,</p><blockquote>“Services that look like a duck and quack like a duck should be regulated as&nbsp;ducks”</blockquote><p>As such, legislatures should adopt common-sense classification measures to broaden the purview of the equivalents of the SEC and the FBI. This would allow them to effectively police cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes and cryptocurrency terrorist financing activity respectively.</p> Pillar 2: Private&nbsp;Law <p>Turning to the second pillar of my regulatory framework — private law — <a href="https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/">blockchain</a> is uniquely positioned in that it’s feasible to “make the code more law-like.” This means intertwining the legal system with smart contracts, either tacitly or explicitly. A smart contract fundamentally relies on trust in the code, and coders can err. The most (in)famous example of this is the case of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO. The DAO was an organization that functioned purely on smart contracts on Ethereum. As it happened, the code was flawed and allowed an individual to siphon off an estimated $50M of Ether from the system. Of course, this was entirely unintended, however, it was permitted by the code. As the code was immutably placed on the blockchain, ultimately the only way to stop this theft was by a hard fork in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>An interesting solution proposed in Werbach’s “Trust but Verify” is to bake arbitration clauses into the smart contract. These terms can come into effect in dire cases like the DAO hack. Interestingly, some speculate that this can result in the development of the “rule-of-law-as-a-service, a programmable complement” to court systems. From a legislative standpoint, governments can consider mandating the incorporation of these arbitration clauses into contracts to avoid issues like the DAO hack. Furthermore, to stay at the forefront of regulation in this rapidly evolving field, they can consider proposals like that of Antonopolous and Morgan (2016) to create a decentralized arbitration network designed specifically for blockchain disputes. This would allow arbitration disputes themselves to be executed peer-to-peer on the blockchain.</p> Pillar 3: Law Enforcement <p>Turning finally to law enforcement, the new manifestations of electronic crimes require specialized forms of enforcement. I believe the correct steps are a compilation of best practices internationally. Specifically, I want to call attention to a study by the University of Swansea, which discussed how law enforcement successfully shuttered two illegal cryptomarkets — AlphaBay and Hansa Market. Much like Silk Road, these markets involved the trade of illicit goods and services. A cooperative effort between American, Dutch and German law enforcement led to not only the shuttering of the site but also the arrest of administrators.</p><p>On June 20th, 2017, Dutch authorities were able to infiltrate Hansa Market. Instead of shutting it immediately, though, they decided to keep it open without alerting users or disrupting sales, thereby gathering information about customers and suppliers. Parallelly, a few weeks after, American law enforcement infiltrated and shuttered AlphaBay. This resulted in a migration of customers from AlphaBay to the compromised Hansa Market; they saw an eightfold increase in registrations. Ultimately, a whole month after Hansa was initially compromised by the Dutch, the FBI and Europol released a joint statement indicating that Hansa Market and AlphaBay had been successfully infiltrated. On the whole, the operation gave law enforcement data of 200,000 customers, 40,000 vendors, and 350,000 listings.</p><p>I wanted to stress the strategic takeaways from this operation, specifically regarding changing perceptions of trust and managing cross-market migration. This operation had a considerable impact on the level of trust customers and suppliers had in illicit crypto markets. While the initial announcement of shuttering AlphaBay raised suspicions, it was the combination of that and the compromising of Hansa Market that destroyed customers’ trust in illicit crypto markets. This meant that a sizeable share of these customers became ultimately less likely to ever rejoin an illicit market for fear that law enforcement has covertly infiltrated the site and is collecting data. Furthermore, the operation also calls attention to how users migrate between illicit markets. The fact that so many AlphaBay users migrated to Hansa underscores the need for concerted and coordinated law enforcement operations; one-off shuttering of markets will only lead to a number of others mushrooming.</p><p>In terms of deriving recommendations from this, I propose that the cyber-crime division of a country’s law enforcement division should be trained to specifically target blockchain and cryptocurrency crimes. Furthermore, countries should work to join consortia like the one described above to contribute to the international effort to combat financial crime on the blockchain. This proposed branch can work on a best-practices approach from the AlphaBay case and similar intelligence operations.</p><p>On the whole, cryptocurrency technology offers tremendous promise, and fears surrounding an inability to regulate them must not be a barrier to adoption. I believe the framework I’ve proposed, drawing upon ideas from public law, private law and law enforcement, would offer a skeleton upon which nations can develop upon to ensure that this promising technology is disseminated and implemented safely.</p> Bibliography <p>Afilipoaie and Shortis, “Crypto-Market Enforcement, New Strategy and Tactics”, Swansea University, June&nbsp;2018</p><p>CNN, “How FBI Caught Russ Ulricht”, October 5, 2013, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/04/world/americas/silk-road-ross-ulbricht/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/04/world/americas/silk-road-ross-ulbricht/index.html</a></p><p>Coin Telegraph, “Is India About to Reverse Its Coin Trade Ban?” July 18, 2018 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-india-about-to-reverse-its-crypto-trade-ban">https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-india-about-to-reverse-its-crypto-trade-ban</a></p><p>Economic Times, “RBI bans Bitcoins, other virtual currencies, prohibits any dealing with banks”, April 6, 2018. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/india-shuts-down-bitcoins-other-virtual-currencies-prohibits-any-dealing-with-banks/articleshow/63627611.cms">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/india-shuts-down-bitcoins-other-virtual-currencies-prohibits-any-dealing-with-banks/articleshow/63627611.cms</a></p><p>Economic Times, “Your Bank Will Not Allow You to Buy Bitcoins Anymore”, April 6, 2018, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/your-bank-will-not-allow-you-to-buy-bitcoins-anymore/articleshow/63627123.cms">https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/your-bank-will-not-allow-you-to-buy-bitcoins-anymore/articleshow/63627123.cms</a></p><p>Raconteur, “Indian Crypto Caution Could Stifle Innovation”, June 21, 2018, <a href="https://www.raconteur.net/finance/india-cryptocurrency-caution">https://www.raconteur.net/finance/india-cryptocurrency-caution</a></p><p>SEC v.

You may have heard that they’re the largest commercial tenant today in cities like New York and London. You may have heard that their revenues are growing 100% year-on-year.</p><p>However, while WeWork’s office decor certainly looks glamorous, I have concerns with their business model, traction and risks should the economy turn bearish. Here’s why I believe WeWork’s IPO could premature.</p> The WeWork Business Model — and its&nbsp;Pitfalls <p>WeWork at its core makes money by leasing large prime-real estate buildings, sprucing it up its décor with its signature glass walls and coffee rooms, and in turn leasing the space out. The way this model works is the timing mismatch between these leases. WeWork signs relatively cheap long-term leases and in turn leases it out with more expensive, short-term ones. The idea is that individuals and companies don’t want to be “tied down” with long-term leases, so using WeWork’s “space-as-a-service” subscription model affords them greater flexibility to move in and out seamlessly.</p><p>WeWork gets the buildings with leases that last around 15 years, on average. On the flip side though, the lifetime of its average customers is a small fraction of that — 15 months. This reduces a lot of the certainty surrounding WeWork’s revenues. Its 100% YoY top-line growth over the past few years makes sense as the economy was&nbsp;strong.</p><p>However, with instances of slowing global economic growth at every turn, risks abound. Existing corporate tenants may downsize and entrepreneurs may be reluctant to found new ventures in a slow economy. This decreased demand could substantially hurt WeWork’s&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>This hypothesis is supported by WeWork’s latest occupancy rates. As we saw the first signs of the economy slowing in the latter half of 2018, we saw their occupancy dip from 84% to 80% at the end of Q4&nbsp;2018.</p> Soaring Valuation, Mounting&nbsp;Losses <p>WeWork has been in the headlines recently with their plans to go public at an astounding $47 billion valuation. Looking through their S-1 IPO filing, though, their financials paint a somewhat worrisome picture.</p><p>While loss-making companies heading to IPO is hardly uncommon, WeWork’s expenses have been almost double their revenues, leading to a net loss almost equal in magnitude to their revenue! The company has stated that if they cut down on their aggressive growth, they’ll break even. However, their total location OpEx was $1.5 bn last year, relative to their revenues of $1.8 bn. That leaves limited room for SG&amp;A and marketing spend, making it challenging to reach profitability soon.</p><p>More troubling still, As per the WSJ, Neumann liquidated around $700 MM of his stake in the company ahead of the IPO, an uncommon move which doesn’t particularly inspire confidence.</p> So…What Should WeWork&nbsp;Do? <p>This story doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom, however. The avenue I see to inspire more confidence in WeWork is to lock down more long-term enterprise contracts to make them less exposed to cyclical changes in their occupancy rate. They’ve already started doing this, with contracts tied down with Goldman Sachs, Yelp, Lyft and Peloton for instance. In fact, WeWork’s average lease length doubles from 7.5 months in 2017 to the 15 months it is&nbsp;today.</p><p>Furthermore, WeWork is expanding into new business lines with WeGrow, a private school, and WeLive, a housing development. These have the potential to derisk the company further, making it less susceptible to business cycle fluctuations.</p><p>Between these lengthening lease terms and diversified revenue streams, WeWork has the potential to be far less risky, making it far more enticing to investors. I think WeWork should continue growing these ancillary channels, improve their unit economics to become more profitability-geared, and increase the term of their corporate leases, with the aim of going to IPO around late&nbsp;2020.</p> Sources: <p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/we-work-startup-valuation-adam-neumann-interview">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/we-work-startup-valuation-adam-neumann-interview</a></p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-latest-wework-news-2019-6">https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-latest-wework-news-2019-6</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/24/18630126/wework-valuation-ipo-business-model-we-company">https://www.vox.com/2019/5/24/18630126/wework-valuation-ipo-business-model-we-company</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/20/why-you-should-probably-avoid-wework.aspx">https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/08/20/why-you-should-probably-avoid-wework.aspx</a></p><p>“Why WeWork’s Business Model Is Risky | WSJ”.&nbsp;Youtube.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/is-weworks-ipo-premature-4e872a52a68f">Is WeWork’s IPO Premature?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">The Startup</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

One way Russia did so was through “troll factories”, producing incendiary tweets on Twitter to polarize public sentiment here stateside.</p><p>When I saw that<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/"> FiveThirtyEight had written about </a>and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets">compiled a dataset of</a> these fake Russian tweets, I was curious to explore these. As you’ll see in the wordclouds, some features of these tweets seemed reminiscent of Trump’s tweets. As such, I’ve decided to compare the two! For this project, I used<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/vikasg/russian-troll-tweets"> this 200,000 troll Russian tweet dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/better-donald-trump-tweets">this dataset of Trump’s tweets</a> between mid-2015 and Election Day 2016, both from&nbsp;Kaggle.​</p><p>In order to compare Trump’s tweets to the Russian ones, I hope to answer the following questions:​</p>  What are the Trump and Russian tweets about? What words do they use most&nbsp;often?  How does the sentiment of each vary over the election&nbsp;cycle?  Which words are the most “Trumpian”, and which ones are the&nbsp;least?  How reliably can we distinguish a Trump tweet from a fake Russian&nbsp;one?   Cleaning the&nbsp;Data <p>Our first task was cleaning the data to get meaningful text for analysis. For each dataset, I started by selecting the columns that pertained to the analysis, namely the date tweeted, the hashtag, the time tweeted, and the tweet&nbsp;text.</p><p>From there, I noticed two key elements of the tweet text that needed cleaning: the presence of corrupted or non-English characters in the Russian tweets, and the presence of links. I figured that the text in links would not be germane to this analysis, so I removed both “https://..." and “t.co/…”&nbsp;URLs.​</p><p>From here, I began feature extraction — converting the timestamp into meaningful dates, and extracting the sentiment and tweet&nbsp;length.​</p><p>I then used the syuzhet package to get a numeric “score” of the sentiments of each of the tweets, and used stringr to get the length of each tweet. Each of these columns were appended onto the datasets, and then the two datasets were combined to create data frame which we could&nbsp;analyze.</p> What Do These Tweets Talk&nbsp;About? <p>So what do these tweets talk about&nbsp;anyway?</p><p>As you’ll see, on the face of it, the words used in the two can be awfully similar. In fact, can you tell which is&nbsp;which?</p><p>Scroll for the&nbsp;answer!</p><p>A closer look reveals that the first wordcloud is&nbsp;Trump’s.</p><p>However, we see a number of commonalities in what they talk about. Beyond the obvious focus on Trump, we see “Hillary” featuring prominently in both of them, for instance. However, we see that Trump’s focus tends to be more broad, talking about topics like the news (Fox News and CNN), polling, and his signature “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. Conversely, with the Russian wordcloud, we note a large emphasis on Obama than in Trump’s wordcloud. Interestingly, the Russian one also seems to have more emphasis on race, with words like “black” and “white” both featuring in it and not in&nbsp;Trump’s.</p> Tweet Sentiment <p>With the numerical scores we obtained for sentiment, we now plot those over time for the months we have both Trump’s and Russian&nbsp;tweets.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, as alluded to in the wordclouds, the Russian tweets tend to be far more negative than Trump’s. In fact, while almost all of Trump’s months had net positive sentiment scores, only a handful of months saw net positive Russian&nbsp;tweets.</p><p>What I find interesting in this figure is how the spike in Trump’s sentiment around April 2016 broadly aligns with the Russian spike in May 2016, and how they both dip sharply in the months subsequent. While it’s hard to pinpoint a precise reason for these spikes, April 2016 saw Trump take a large lead in the Republican primaries. Perhaps, his success in primaries and ultimate confirmation as the nominee contributed to the spike in sentiment. Similarly, events like Bernie Sanders’ endorsement of Hillary Clinton in July and the Democratic National Convention could have contributed to Trump’s distinctly harsher&nbsp;tone.</p> Do Hashtags Impact Tweet&nbsp;Content? <p>An interesting dimension of this dataset was the use of hashtags. One of the most distinctive parts of Trump’s Twitter feed is the abundant #MakeAmericaGreatAgain hashtag. I was curious to see how Russian tweets used hashtags, and whether the presence of a hashtag impacted the content of a tweet. The graph below shows how the use of hashtags changed with&nbsp;time.</p><p>While Trump’s hashtags were more iconic, it appears that the Russian tweets used far more hashtags in almost every month! Trump’s use of hashtags crashed in May 2016 from 40% of tweets down to just over 20%, while the Russian use of hashtags fluctuated between 40% and 60% of all tweets. So, does the presence of a hashtag affect the substance of the&nbsp;tweet?</p><p>This graph above shows how sentiments vary based on both the tweeter and the presence of a hashtag. Based on the graph, for the most part there isn’t a substantial difference in the month-to-month sentiment of Russian tweets with hashtags. However, strikingly, that isn’t the case with Trump! Trump’s tweets with a hashtag were overwhelmingly positive, with a sentiment score of around 0.5 on average. However, without a hashtag, they were consistently lower, even going below the sentiment of Russian tweets in one&nbsp;month!</p><p>In terms of why this could be, a possible explanation could be that Trump’s #MAGA tweets contain a sense of optimism and hope for the future, leading to a positive sentiment score.</p> How Can We Distinguish a Trump Tweet From a Fake&nbsp;Tweet? <p>Having explored features of the tweets like sentiment, length, and hashtags, we now arrive at the core question, how can we distinguish a Trump tweet from a fake Russian one, and how reliably can we do so using text analytics?​</p><p>In order to do this, we first split our tweets into a test and training&nbsp;dataset.</p>  I created a classifier to mark a tweet as Trump’s or non-Trump’s, and&nbsp;then  I built a Document-Term Matrix, logging the frequency of each word in the&nbsp;tweet.  From here, I used a LASSO model to select the most important terms in predicting whether a tweet is Trump’s or&nbsp;not.  With these variables, I created a logistic regression model to give a probabilistic estimate of whether a tweet is Trump’s or&nbsp;not.  <p>From this model, we can conclude that a highly positive coefficient means a word is very “Trumpian”, or unique to Trump, and a word that is very negative is very “non-Trumpian”, or unique to tweets that aren’t Trump. This is because the presence of a highly positive word will increase the probability of a word being classified as Trump’s.​</p><p>So, which words are most “Trumpian”? Below are wordclouds of the most “Trumpian” and “non-Trumpian” words.</p>These words are the most “Trumpian”…and these words are the best indicator of a fake Russian&nbsp;tweet<p>The figures above show which words are most and least Trumpian, respectively. We see that, unsurprisingly, positive, grand words we commonly associate with Trump’s discourse, like “great” and “big” appear to be the best indicator of whether a tweet is by Trump. He also seemed to focus more on polling, something which was largely omitted by Russian&nbsp;trolls.</p><p>Turning to the non-Trumpian words, we see the term #tcot jump out. A little Google tells us that it’s an abbreviation for “top conservatives on Twitter”, a way that conservative Twitter users identify themselves. More tellingly, the word “black” also stands out. Based on FiveThirtyEight’s article on these tweets, a lot of these tweets were fake Black Lives Matter posts, meant to stir up controversy and promote racial divisions. Thus, it makes sense that this features so prominently.</p> How Well Can This Model Spot Fake&nbsp;Tweets? <p>Quite simply put, really&nbsp;well!</p><p>In order to measure how well this model works, we applied it to our test dataset. We had a misclassification rate of around 15%, indicating that the model classified a tweet correctly 85% of the time. In order to more robustly measure the efficacy of our model, we used a ROC Curve, which gauges the model’s false positive and true negative rate. Our ROC curve using testing data is shown&nbsp;below.</p><p>Our model gives us an Area Under Curve, or AUC, of 0.855, which is far better than the baseline of 0.50. Overall, this tells us that this model is very effective in predicting whether a tweet is Trump’s or&nbsp;not.</p> Conclusions <p>This project has explored a range of topics surrounding troll Russian tweets and how they compare to President Trump’s in the year before the election. Here’s what I&nbsp;found:</p>  Russian tweets eclipse Trump’s manifold in terms of volume, and the number of Russian tweets spiked towards Election Day&nbsp;2016  Trump’s tweets were more positive than the Russian ones, and the sentiments had similar peaks and&nbsp;troughs  Trump’s tweets were longer than the Russian ones, however got shorter as Election Day approached. The Russian tweets got&nbsp;longer.  Hashtags matter with Trump! While Russian tweets’ sentiment didn’t vary very much whether there was a hashtag or not, Trump tweets with a hashtag were substantially more&nbsp;positive  We can reliably distinguish Trump’s tweets from a fake Russian one using LASSO and logistic regression  Some of the most “Trumpian” words are “great”, “big” and “very”, while the least Trumpian word was #tcot, which stands for Top Conservatives on Twitter, a common hashtag used by conservatives.  Our model was able to successfully classify Trump’s tweets with 85% accuracy, and has a 0.855 AUC under the ROC curve with testing&nbsp;data.  <p>Originally published here: <a href="https://arjungovind55.wixsite.com/trolltweetsandtrump">https://arjungovind55.wixsite.com/trolltweetsandtrump</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/detecting-fake-political-tweets-with-machine-learning-d5d95ff6430">Detecting Fake Political Tweets with Machine Learning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya">Analytics Vidhya</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Central Bank Cryptocurrencies, or CBCCs for short, represent in my eyes one of the most promising and exciting applications of cryptocurrencies.</p> What’s Wrong With&nbsp;Fiat? <p>Well, a couple of&nbsp;things.</p><p>Let’s start with the humble dollar bills in your wallet. What’s wrong with them? While they’re universally accepted, they are not electronic. This means you‘re forced to transact with them in person. What’s more, those notes may degrade over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Well, what about money in the bank? While it enjoys the benefit of being electronic, it’s ultimately on the bank’s balance sheet as a liability. That means that if the bank happens to go bust, there’s no real way of getting your money&nbsp;bank.</p><p>The central banks of the world do have electronic money that they lend off their balance sheet, known as reserve money, however, those loans are not available to individuals. This trilemma of sorts is summarized in the Venn diagram&nbsp;below.</p>From Bjerg et al. Working Paper. BIS,&nbsp;2017<p>So what is the solution to this trilemma? You guessed it: a Central Bank Cryptocurrency or&nbsp;CBCCs.</p> The Origins of Central Bank Cryptos:&nbsp;Fedcoin <p>One of the first mentions of central bank cryptocurrencies (CBCCs) is from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). In a 2015 report entitled “Digital Currencies”, they proposed having central banks go beyond acting as mere regulators and at least consider issuing a cryptocurrency.</p><p>The most iconic proposal of a retail CBCC was the Fedcoin. As the name may suggest, the intent behind Fedcoin was to have the Federal Reserve issue a cryptocurrency that functionally paralleled Bitcoin. Obviously, with Bitcoin’s volatile gains and losses, it’d be adventurous at best to make it official government tender.</p><p>Enter Fedcoin. The hypothesis? Having the Fed as a backer and central point of control would offer the advantages of lower transaction costs and greater stability.</p> Retail or Wholesale? <p>Scholarship points to two potential paths for CBCCs: a “retail currency”, used by consumers for daily transactions, and “wholesale”, as a Ripple-esque settlement and remittance network exclusive to banks and other financial institutions.</p><blockquote>But if Bitcoin and other cryptos already exist, why have a&nbsp;CBCC?</blockquote><p>The answer: negative interest&nbsp;rates.</p><p>Currently under the cash system, having negative interest rates creates arbitrage opportunities, as keeping cash under the proverbial mattress earns a 0% nominal interest rate. However, as the BIS points out, a complete replacement of CBCCs in place of cash would mean that depositors cannot avoid negative interest rates (without forgoing all of their central bank holdings, of course). This would give central banks far greater flexibility to stimulate economies, specifically during recessions, when interest rates are close to zero as it&nbsp;is.</p><p>In terms of evaluating whether retail CBCCs should be implemented, a key risk is an impact it would have on the financial services industry. Evidently, the disintermediation of banks may hurt their balance sheet, potentially causing the sector to&nbsp;decline.</p><p>On the other hand, wholesale CBCCs are a payment system designed to clear payments between a central bank and other financial institutions, thus lacking the “universal accessibility” that retail CBCCs have. Wholesale networks tend to be permissioned blockchains, as only select participants like banks should be able to access the network. The most promising example of this is Project Jasper by the Bank of Canada, which offers “real-time gross settlement” systems. The advantages of this are typical of decentralized systems — reduced fraud and transaction costs. A key barrier to this adoption is liquidity risk — while settlement systems like this make settlements more efficient, they also are more demanding in terms of liquidity, a common barrier to the adoption of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Will it Happen? Examples from Venezuela <p>While retail and wholesale CBCCs offer myriad benefits on paper, whether they will actually be implemented relies on a number of other considerations. Today, there is one retail CBCC currently being implemented today — the somewhat infamous Venezuelan Petro.</p>Nicholas Maduro Announcing the Petro. Image Credit: Bitcoin.com<p>Facing hyperinflation and a spiraling debt burden, the Venezuelan government decided to announce the creation of a cryptocurrency called the “Petro”, backed by the country’s oil and gold reserves. The Petro is now accepted legal tender in Venezuela and recently had their ICO. The intent is to offer an alternative currency to the rapidly depreciating fiat and benefiting from low transaction costs and the other benefits of crypto in the process. While this might be seen as an adoption of a retail CBCC, the international community views the Petro largely as a sham for a number of reasons. For starters, with over $140 bn in foreign debt, the value of Venezuela’s reserves are inadequate to cover the supposed market cap of the&nbsp;Petro.</p><p>Additionally, a technologically unsound whitepaper coupled with misleading information from the Venezuelan President Maduro makes it seem like little more than an attempt to circumvent American sanctions. In fact, organizations that evaluate cryptocurrencies call the Petro a&nbsp;scam.</p><p>Alas, it may still be some time until we see a proper implementation of retail&nbsp;CBCCs.</p><p>Nonetheless, CBCCs are a fascinating and as yet relatively unexplored dimension of the dynamic between cryptocurrency and the government. There is a tremendous opportunity on both the retail and wholesale side of CBCCs, each coming with their own upsides. It is true that Venezuela currently operates a form of retail CBCCs, however, a lack of transparency and dubious technical specifications do not make it an exemplar of the promise of the technology more&nbsp;broadly.</p><p>Adapted from my LinkedIn article from January 8,&nbsp;2019</p><p>Bibliography</p><p>1.

Be it fried rice or pizza, good takeout is always a great ending to a long day. However, after being let down by a few places my friends had recommended (thanks guys), I wondered if I could put my Wharton analytics coursework to good use to find the best takeout place in&nbsp;Philly.</p><p>I decided to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, scraping and analyzing Yelp reviews of all Chinese and pizza places in Philly to find the restaurant that offered the best food at the best&nbsp;price.</p><p>I’m sure by now you all have the same question in mind. Why couldn’t I just use the built-in Yelp filters? Three reasons. For one thing, I was still debating between Chinese food and pizza, and wanted to see which had better numbers. Next, a lot of the places I had in mind didn’t have a lot of ratings, and I wanted to see just how reliable those places would be. Lastly, Philly has a lot of options, and among many seemingly good options, I wanted to see if I could find a clear&nbsp;winner.</p><p>Scroll to the bottom for my&nbsp;pick!</p> Trends in Average&nbsp;Rating <p>To start out, I looked at the most basic metric — the ratings. I plotted the average rating for each of the restaurants against how many of these reviews there are, omitting some outliers for clarity.​</p><p>There are a couple of interesting features to this data. The most notable part is the difference in variance between restaurants with a low number of reviews and a high number of reviews. What this tells us is that as the number of reviews increases, restaurants are more consistent in their performance; for less reviewed places, it could be really good or really bad! Ratings also seem to steadily increase as the number of reviews increases. While pizza tends to have slightly better reviews on average for less popular places, that difference slowly decreases. Towards the right of the graph, the expected ratings of a pizza place and a Chinese restaurant are virtually identical.​</p><p>The bottom line here is that if you’re looking for a predictably solid place to go for dinner, both Chinese and pizza won’t disappoint if the place has a good amount of ratings. If you’re adventurous, then try somewhere off the beaten&nbsp;path!</p> Mapping Restaurants by Value for&nbsp;Money Philadelphia Restaurants by Price and Total&nbsp;Reviews<p>This map indicated what my key problem was: most popular restaurants were far away from Wharton’s campus (towards the left of the map) and were in the Center City area. Unsurprisingly, restaurants downtown tended to be more expensive. However, the obvious challenge with this analysis is the fact that price and average rating will be highly correlated. As such, I created a “value-for-money index”, which was a ratio of the average rating to the price&nbsp;index.</p><p>From this graph, the largest circle was Dim Sum Garden, a Chinese restaurant in Center City, which is the big blue lump in the graph above. Seems like the best value-for-money means a trip downtown!</p> Chinese vs.&nbsp;Pizza <p>Now that I had some good places in mind from the value-for-index graph, I had to decide between pizza and Chinese. So back to the data I went! After having put in all this work, I wanted to try some food that would blow my mind. So I wanted to decide which of these would give me the best odds at a 5 star&nbsp;meal.</p><p>Here, I look at the proportion of 1-star and 5-star reviews with the total number of reviews; there are 2 trend lines for Chinese food and pizza. Unsurprisingly, as the number of reviews increases, the proportion of 1 star reviews decreases in both pizza and Chinese places: more popular places tend not to disappoint.</p><p>However, looking at the trend in 5 star reviews tells a different story. As a Chinese restaurant’s total reviews increases, its proportion of 5 star reviews increases, whereas the proportion decreases among pizza places. This perhaps suggests that popular pizza places, while undeniably good, don’t tend to wow people the way popular Chinese restaurants do.</p> The “Takeaways” <p>Pardon the&nbsp;pun.</p><p>I used web scraping to pull data for around 300 pizza parlors and 220 Chinese restaurants, aiming to compare their locations, prices, ratings and value for money. Here is a quick list of some of my findings.​</p>  Philly’s most popular Chinese restaurants and pizzerias are in Center&nbsp;City.  For less reviewed restaurants, there is substantial variance in average rating. This levels out to around a 4 with 1000 ratings. Pizza is slightly higher rated, but the difference becomes negligible as reviews increase. For both pizza and Chinese, more reviews mean higher average&nbsp;ratings.  The proportion of 5/5 ratings increases for Chinese restaurants with more reviews, but decreases for pizza places. The average number of 1/5 ratings decreases for both, though, with ratings. If you want to be impressed, try a popular Chinese place! If you like consistency, go with&nbsp;pizza.

<p>In 2018 I had a chance to compare top tier status on both United and Alaska.Â&nbsp; Most of you are probably running away screaming at spending that much time on airplanes,  but I love it, it is a perk to me not a drawback. Here are my thoughts on United MileagePlus Premier 1K vs Alaska MVP Gold 75k, for all you crazy folks who are air[plane][port][line] geeks like me.Â&nbsp; Yes, this is anecdotal, but at 190k miles last year, spent both on business and personal travel (remember, I’m a Canadian married to an Australian, living in the US), I have *lots* of anecdotes.Â&nbsp; (note: all photos mine, I tweet a lot of them under the hashtag #ViewFromTheWindowSeat on <a href="http://twitter.com/pamelarosiedee">Twitter</a>. The map is from AppintheAir)</p>
 Best Perk: Adjacent Flight Hopping 
<p>Adjacent flight hopping is the allowance that the airline makes for a passenger to move to a confirmed seat on a different flight without paying either a change fee or a paying for an uplift in fare.Â&nbsp; For both United and Alaska, flights can be hopped starting at check-in time right from the mobile application.Â&nbsp; There are so many times when it is valuable for either personal or business reasons to change to a different flight. Having the option to pick an alternative flight gives you freedom – it lets you compensate for mistakes, stop in to see old friends, or add that one critical meeting to your visit.Â&nbsp; Alaska lets you hop flights on the same calendar day as your flight, which gives you a limited number of choices -generally, you can vary your fight by up to 8 hours or so, but only ifÂ&nbsp; there is an earlier or later flight to be had. Â&nbsp; United, on the other hand offers hops in a moving 24 hour window, which gives you the opportunity to confirm a seat on a flight the day before or after.Â&nbsp; You can even walk your flight forward 2 days if you are willing to monkey-bar it, ie grabbing later and later flights as the 24 hour window opens those options up.Â&nbsp; It doesn’t always work and you can get burned if you make assumptions about what will be available to you (especially watch out for codeshares, they are not eligible). Â&nbsp; But I have had excellent luck with this feature, it has made my life so much better so many times. Â&nbsp; It would be very difficult to give up.</p>
 Best Food Service 
<p>The obvious answer is that any business class food service is great when you’ve been upgraded. Anything less is just being churlish :)Â&nbsp; I appreciate the Alaska non-stick trays and the United practice of serving appetizer and entrÃ©e together rather than separately (because it means the amount of time I have to close my laptop is less).Â&nbsp; I like Alaska’s wine selection.Â&nbsp; In the regular cabin, I love the United policy of granting a free beverage &amp; snack to premier 1K folks, it is a really thoughtful acknowledgement. Â&nbsp;</p>
 Best App 
<p>United has the best mobile app, hands down. From a status perspective, I especially appreciate that united has the 1K dedicated phone line listed in the app so I can easily call it, while the Alaska app doesn’t even tell me I get a phone line, let alone what the # is. Â&nbsp; Seat selection is also much easier on United, Alaska does really wacky things like tie your upgrade ability to your seat changes, where picking a seat sometimes results in a threat to remove you from all upgrade lists.</p>
 Best Upgrades 
<p>Â&nbsp;It is *really* hard to earn MVP Gold 75k status on Alaska, when those 75k miles have to be domestic and are judged on actual distance, not spend. You can’t buy your way into it (first class flights earn a multiplier but not a huge multiplier), you just have to fly. We’re talking 15 cross-country flights in 12 months. But once you earn it, you get upgraded a *lot*.Â&nbsp; Compare this to United, where there are a gzillion 1K flyers.Â&nbsp; If you’re on a cross-country flight you can *try* to use a RPU or GPU but generally those are more like a cruel joke than a perk, the chances of it actually putting you high enough on the list to get an upgrade is low.</p>
 Best Next Tier Down 
<p>As much as the top tier is amazing on Alaska, the next tier down is a disaster.Â&nbsp; Being a tier down on United essentially lowers your chances to get an upgrade from improbable to impossible, but – you can still book a confirmed seat in Economy plus.Â&nbsp; The Alaska Gold MVP doesn’t let you book in their premium section, it is part of the upgrade pool.Â&nbsp; So, your only confirmed option at booking time is economy.Â&nbsp; That is a non-starter for me.</p>
 Best Lounge 
<p>United wins this hands-down. United has more lounges with more space to sit, in more airports.Â&nbsp; The dÃ©cor is brighter and there are more windows.Â&nbsp; As someone with multiple home bases and varied airport destinations, flying Alaska is a problem in this regard – and yes, I have a priority pass and can use it for other lounges – but often those passes (and even Alaska’s partner lounges) have “hours”, so if you fly first thing you are often out of luck. Lounge access is a paid-for perk, but I did like that on Alaska, you got a discount for being MVP Gold 75k.</p>
 Best Status Match 
<p>I can only really talk about Alaska’s status matching, since I earned my 1K premier membership the old-fashioned way.Â&nbsp; I’m not sure Alaska’s status match program does what is supposed to do, which is to lower the friction for high value frequent flyers to change to Alaska.Â&nbsp; I status matched over at the end of April, and had 75k status for 8 months – 2/3 of the year. Â&nbsp; In that 8 months, I flew 50k miles (2/3 of 75,000 miles).Â&nbsp; I got a lot of value from the match – and I flew at velocity commensurate with the privileges that were granted to me.Â&nbsp; I fully expected to keep up that velocity, but it turns out that Alaska doesn’t take velocity into account.Â&nbsp; Despite flying as frequently as any 75k member for 8 months straight, I am only a gold MVP today.Â&nbsp; Had I status matched in in the October time-frame, I would have gained status 2018 and 2019, but I made the mistake of coming in at a time when achieving the goal was nigh impossible.Â&nbsp; While I respect that Alaska gets to set their rules any way they see fit, this is a terrible business decision.Â&nbsp; Had top tier status been conferred at the end of 2018,Â&nbsp; I would have worked hard to continue to earn that status.Â&nbsp; But being MVP gold, there is zero incentive for me to put that kind of work in.Â&nbsp; Not when it means that I can only confirm an economy seat in advance.Â&nbsp; A guaranteed Economy Plus seat on the aisle with a free beer and a free sandwich on United trumps an economy seat with some chance of last-minute premium economy upgrade on Alaska always and forever.Â&nbsp; In case you are wondering, I did call Alaska to make the case that it was a win-win for me to stay at MVP Gold 75k and continue to fly at my current high velocity. The proposition was politely declined, because apparently my status match was the only accommodation Alaska was willing to grant me in the next two years.Â&nbsp; I can’t really argue with that, it is their program.Â&nbsp; So, I guess it ends a draw.Â&nbsp; It was very nice of them to let me try MVP Gold 75k.Â&nbsp; I definitely did not abuse the opportunity, I flew more than 6,000 miles a month.Â&nbsp; It was a great relationship while it lasted, and I will probably fly a little bit with them still, when the price or time suits my calendar.Â&nbsp;</p>
 My Advice 
<p>Alaska’s top status is great – they win at business upgrades, but aren’t quite as strong in the areas of the app, the lounges, or the flight hopping options.Â&nbsp; They are a great airline with great staff, and other than that one time they upgraded me, then gave away both my new seat and my old seat, I was consistently happy with how things worked.Â&nbsp; If you decide to status match in to the program in anything other than January or Oct-Dec, just know you are highly unlikely to be forming a permanent top-status relationship, no matter how much of a high value customer you turn out to be.Â&nbsp; In comparison, United gives you a lot of freedom and flexibility to hop flights, lots of lounges, free meals no matter where you sit, the ability to earn miles on international flights. If you travel enough that you can devote domestic travel to Alaska and still make 1K with United using international, it is a pretty great combination.Â&nbsp;</p>

Our panel hosted by Quantstamp<p>On Wednesday November 14th, just after the midterm elections the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition co-hosted a policy panel with Blockchain for Social Justice. We sat down to chat with Fiona Ma- Treasurer Elect for the state of California and Brian Forde- former technology advisor in the Obama White&nbsp;House.</p><p>The audience of Bay Area blockchain and cryptocurrency entrepreneurs were lucky to be joined by SF Board of Supervisor's President Malia Cohen (who was also elected to statewide office last week and will be joining the Board of Equalization in January) and Assemblymember David Chiu. We kicked things off with a discussion of the state of blockchain regulation at a state and federal level. Fiona Ma emphasized how eager she is to learn more about the industry, specifically how blockchain can assist with property titles, tax collection and banking the cannabis industry. A recurring theme the discussion kept touching upon was the incredibly high stakes of using new technology in the public&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Brian Forde highlighted that in addition to institutional resistance to learning new tech, when the government fails to use technology properly the human costs can be staggering. Forde suggested the government and industry look for pilot programs where technology can almost certainly do more good than harm- such as helping overseas service members&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Ensuring service member’s votes are counted is a logistical problem that dates back to the Civil War. In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/11/ensuring-soldiers-a-chance-to-vote-was-a-challenge-in-the-civil-war-it-still-is-today/?utm_term=.a16c72292ab4">2012</a> 250,000 service members were unable to get their votes counted due to the complexity of the system. This is an ideal area for blockchain improvement- and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-campaign-for-mobile-phone-voting-is-getting-a-midterm-test">West Virginia led the charge </a>using the Voatz app to allow Peace Corps volunteers and deployed military members to vote in 2018’s primary and general elections. Denver is on pace to test this out their own system in 2019. All elected officials present expressed a desire to learn more about companies and initiatives that could improve upon inefficient and slow government systems. (If you think you are one, email&nbsp;me.)</p><p>We followed up the panel discussion with breakout groups that discussed the challenges blockchain companies face in the policy, tax, legal and data privacy arenas and how we can overcome those. Among the identified challenges were: lack of federal regulatory clarity and state leadership, simply too many bodies trying to fight for jurisdiction over cryptocurrency, confusion about taxes, the high cost of lawyers to navigate the confusion and lack of standardization across the industry. Our group generated some innovative ideas to work through the challenges- a common theme was not replicating work and consolidating the bureaucracy companies face. We’ll be transcribing all the recommendations and sharing them with the elected officials who joined us, but also making them&nbsp;public.</p><p>We will continue these conversations at the state and federal level to push for better blockchain policy, with your help. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition is currently creating an advisory board that will contain a state and federal policy committee.

<p>2018 was a breakout year for legislation on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Over a <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/financial-services-and-commerce/cryptocurrency-2018-legislation.aspx">dozen states</a> considered pieces of legislation that dealt with blockchain/cryptocurrency. “Blockchain” cracked the top 10 search terms on <a href="https://legiscan.com/trends/search">Legiscan</a> this year. While some state results were varied several federal bills have been introduced that will change the way blockchain policy is discussed in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Three were introduced by Representative Emmer of Minnesota, co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus:</p><p>Resolution Supporting Digital Currencies and Blockchain Technology</p><p>Expresses support for the industry and its development in the United States. Like the internet, the federal government should provide a light touch, consistent, and simple legal environment.</p><p>Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act</p><p>Affirms that certain blockchain related entities that never take control of consumer funds do not need to register as a money transmitter. Examples of these entities include “miners” that validate network integrity and multisignature providers that provide enhanced asset security to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets&nbsp;Act</p><p>Taxpayers can only comply with the law when the law is clear. This bill will provide a safe harbor for taxpayers with “forked” digital assets. Further it will restrict fines against individuals that attempt to report these assets until the IRS provides any type of guidance regarding the appropriate means of reporting them.</p><p>The Resolution does not create specific new policies, simply encourages support for the emerging blockchain industry.</p><p>The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act and Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets act are comparatively meaty pieces of legislation. By affirming that “no blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service shall be treated as a money transmitter” under state licensing laws, this the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act preempts states’ rights to regulate licensing requirements. This exemption is narrowly targeted in the bill- it applies “unless the developer or provider has, in the regular course of business, control over digital currency to which a user is entitled”. This is a step towards federal preemption that could start to establish more consistency in regulation, and could be met by resistance from states looking to maintain their jurisdictional authority.</p><p>The Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets Act threatens to add some teeth to previous congressional requests to the IRS to provide clarity to taxpayers regarding virtual currency. In September Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady sent a letter to IRS Commissioner David Kauter requesting “response outlining where the IRS is in its efforts to issue updated virtual currency guidance, what the IRS intends to cover in tllis guidance, and a timeline for its release”. This letter followed one Brady sent requesting clarification in May of 2017, cosigned by Orrin Hatch (Chair of Senate Finance Committee). This bill was immediately referred to House Ways and Means, where Brady can shepard it through. Rep. Emmer sits on House Financial Services Committee, which ensures that every nearly committee this bill is likely to hit has at least one member who has demanded the IRS provide clarity on virtual currency.</p><p>The industry will be relying heaving on Republican Committee chairs to carry these bills and should be careful to shore up some bipartisan support before they go to the floor for a vote. A fourth bill, introduced by Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA) and Congressman Brett Guthrie (R-KY) takes this approach. Both are members of the Members of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittees on Communications and Technology and Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection.</p>Rep. Matsui (l) and Rep. Guthrie&nbsp;(R)<p>They introduced the “Blockchain Promotion Act of 2018,” which would establish a working group of stakeholders across the federal government and private industry to establish a common definition of blockchain. As states are considering their first pieces of blockchain legislation or establishing working groups, federal guidance on a uniform definition could provide uniformity for the industry.</p><p>State working groups, such as the one established by AB 2658 would be wise to keep an eye on these bills as they progress through Congress.</p><p>Learn more at: <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">https://www.blockadvocacy.org/</a></p><p>Want to get involved?

<p>Today California Governor Jerry Brown signed two landmark pro-blockchain bills into law: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2658">AB 2658</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Calderon">Assemblymember Ian Calderon</a> and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB838">SB 838</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hertzberg">Sen. Robert Hertzberg</a>. AB 2658 defines blockchain technology, updates the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and establishes a working group with industry representation to create the best possible regulatory framework for blockchain within the state of California. SB 838 also defines blockchain technology and enables companies to record stock issuance and transfers using this technology.</p><p>Since 2012, the global number of blockchain businesses has grown steadily while the percentage of the those businesses headquartered in California has fallen from nearly 20% to just over 11%. One major factor driving where blockchain companies decide to headquarter — and as such, which economy benefits — is the existence of well-defined regulations. As noted in a Morgan Stanley report, “Regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect. Low taxes are a benefit.” By creating a more clear regulatory framework for blockchain companies, California is positioning itself to capture and retain more of these innovative businesses going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>“California has always been a place for innovation and opportunity, and SB 838 shows how we can use technology to increase consumer protection and help prevent cases of fraud,” said Senator Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). “That it was signed into law is a great testament to the work being done around the state by folks like the <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</a> to advance this rapidly growing technology.”</p><p>“As a complex, emerging technology, it is important to define “blockchain technology” in statute, as well as identify potential technical, regulatory, and governance hurdles, in order to provide greater certainty regarding the technology’s legal standing,” stated Majority Leader Calderon. “Throughout the legislative process we had tremendous feedback from innovators and companies who are already working with blockchain about how important this measure is to their industry. I’m grateful that Governor Brown recognized the importance of maintaining California’s position as a global leader in technology and innovation by signing AB&nbsp;2658.”</p><p>“Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize many industries in the near future. It is vital that California recognizes and supports this industry as an economic driver in our state,” said Ally Medina, Director of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition. “These are common sense bills that send the message that California supports innovation and the blockchain industry — Governor Brown, Senator Hertzberg and Assemblymember Calderon have all demonstrated the forward-thinking leadership we need in Sacramento.”</p><p>For more information follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blockadco">Facebook</a>, find us at <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">blockadvocacy.org </a>or reach email Ally Medina at ally@blockadvocacy.org</p>

<p>The Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) is a body created by the Political Reform Act- a ballot measure passed by California voters in 1974 as a reaction to national disgust with the Watergate scandal. It is tasked with curtailing corruption in politics by regulating campaign finance, lobbying activity and conflicts of interest.</p><p>What that means for most people is that if you donate to a campaign in California (not for federal level races) that contribution is reported to the&nbsp;FPPC.</p><p>This morning -September 20th, 2018- the Commission convened in Los Angeles and discussed whether to allow campaign contributions to be made using cryptocurrency. The <a href="http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/AgendaDocuments/General%20Items/2018/September/42%20Bitcoin.pdf">staff memo</a> laid out four basic options for the Commission to consider:</p><p>1: Prohibit all contributions in cryptocurrency.</p><p>2: Permit cryptocurrency contributions as cash contributions, limited to contributions of less than $100 from any source, and requiring cryptocurrency contributions to be converted to cash upon receipt and deposited into the campaign bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>3: Permit cryptocurrency contributions as in-kind contributions, but require that the contributions be converted to cash upon receipt and deposited into the campaign bank&nbsp;account.</p><p>4: Permit cryptocurrency contributions as in-kind contributions, without requiring conversion to cash, and allow committees to make contributions to maintain a separate cryptocurrency account and make expenditures from the&nbsp;account.</p><p>The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition submitted a comment letter supporting options 3 or 4, and in opposition to 1 and 2. We argued that the first two options are unnecessarily restrictive and would diminish the industry’s political engagement. The latter two would need some careful attention in rulemaking but could provide new advances in transparency in political contributions.</p><p>The meeting began by staff referencing that advocates (us?) have mentioned the traceability aspects of blockchain but that those aspects are “primarily used to prevent double spending using digital currency”. The misinformation continued from there. It quickly emerged that Commissioner Hatch was strongly in favor of option 1- prohibition.</p><p>He began asking if there was any way to tell if a contribution was from an individual who gave their name and occupation or if that person was really a ‘strawman for overseas influence’ or an ‘oligarch’. Staff responded that they were unsure how they would determine that. The Commission as a whole expressed concern for adding to staff’s caseload and the difficulty of tracing contributions. At no point did either the Commission or staff mention the possibility of finding out whether it is possible to trace contributions or learning about how that technology is used. There was no discussion of public/private blockchains, or the fact that whole voting systems have been built on blockchain and are ready to be piloted in other&nbsp;states.</p><p>Throughout the discussion cryptocurrency, bitcoin and blockchain were all used interchangeably by various staff and Commissioners. The spectre of Russian election meddling was raised again- one Commissioner blurted out “Manafort” as an apparent non sequitur.</p><p>Hatch said he’d like to see cryptocurrency prohibited just like traveler’s checks. When reminded that traveler’s checks are treated as an in kind contribution, as suggested in options 3 and 4 he responded with “Well, I want it treated even worse&nbsp;then”.</p><p>Despite staff’s attempt to outline that the value of the contribution would be recorded at the time of receipt- fears that campaigns would hold on to it and play the markets emerged. Having worked on many campaigns the concept of that level of fiscal sophistication is somewhat absurd. There is literally a calculator campaigns share to figure out how much pizza to order for phonebanks (3 slices per volunteer, 4 if it’s college kids&nbsp;folks!).</p><p>This market volatility question was provided for in the language given to the committee for options 2–4. And that language was undoubtedly taken from how the FPPC handles stock contributions. That’s right, you can give shares of stock or even a Monet to a political campaign in California but the FPPC can’t envision how to possibly handle a contribution that might ‘change in&nbsp;value’.</p><p>Commissioner Hayward made an argument for Option 2- treating crypto like cash and limiting contributions to under $100. She was met with pushback from Hatch. His rationale was that at fundraisers you put cash in what is known as a ‘remit envelope’ and write down your name, so cash must be more traceable than crypto. The Federal Election Commision’s ability to capture name, address, employer and occupation and affirmation that one is not a foreign national when contributing cryptocurrency (much like when you donate online with a credit card) was ignored. If you struggle to envision how that would work, here’s how Gavin Newsom is <a href="https://bitpay.com/813837/donate">accepting bitcoin.</a></p><p>Chair Germond expressed that she thought they might reconsider later, but she ultimately sided with Hatch and Cardenas. The vote was 3:1. In the closing discussion the Commission mentioned that perhaps this will come back in 5 years (!) but that the state legislature could pass a law in the meantime. Its disappointing to see a regulatory body with the mission to increase transparency fail to do their due diligence in regulating technology that could help achieve that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>Let us know in comments by email to ally@blockadvocacy.org or on twitter @blockadco if you’d like to see a law mandating that the FPPC allow California campaigns to accept&nbsp;crypto.</p><p><a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">https://www.blockadvocacy.org/</a></p>

<p>One of the key goals of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition is to better inform policymakers about how regulation impacts the blockchain/cryptocurrency/ distributed ledger industry. For brevity’s sake we’ll us BCDL as a catch-all from here on out. We used Crunchbase to source data about the industry size and trends. Here’s what we found out about the BCDL industry in California:</p> California is losing ground…rapidly <p>Since 2012 the global number of BCDL businesses has grown steadily. As shown on the chart, 2017 was a bit of breakaway year but the number of businesses tracked by Crunchbase using this tech has been consistently on the rise during the last six years. At the same time, the percentage of the those businesses headquartered in California has fallen from nearly 20% to just over&nbsp;11%.</p><p>While this is a strong indicator that CA is losing out on this quickly growing market, we needed to establish what range of market share is typical for the state’s technology industry. We compared the percentage of businesses headquarted in the Golden State across a variety of subsections of the technology industry and confirmed that 11.8% is an alarmingly small market share for the state. The second lowest was for SAAS businesses, and CA is still home to over 18% of&nbsp;them.</p><p>For the rest of the tech sectors we looked at CA was typically home to 18–25% of marketshare while the U.S. enjoyed 40–50%. For BCDL they clock in at only 11.8% and 27%, respectively. This indicates an unwelcoming environment for BCDL businesses and suppresses the ability of other companies to experiment with this technology. For a state that prides itself on innovation and leading the global tech industry- this is a major blind&nbsp;spot.</p><p>Why the U.S. and California are losing the BCDL&nbsp;Market</p><p>A research team led by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges-trading-locations-volumes-2018-4">Sheena Shah of Morgan Stanley</a> concluded that well-defined regulations are a key factor in where cryptocurrency businesses choose to headquarter. Shah notes “regulatory certainty is part of the attractiveness for the companies so they can plan for the future as they know what to expect. Low taxes are a benefit.”</p><p>The U.S. has the oft-cited compliance problem of 4 different definitions of virtually currency by 4 different regulatory agencies: security, commodity, currency, property. California has passed no major regulation regarding the BCDL industry but has twice considered legislation similar to New York’s industry-quashing BitLicense. The states’ lack of leadership coupled with confusion over federal jursidiction creates the atmosphere of ‘uncertainty’ that Morgan Stanley found to drive away businesses.</p><p>Solutions</p><p>California needs to pass regulation that welcomes and strengthens the BCDL economy. In my next post I’ll go over some of the policies that are working globally and how this election cycle impacts what we can achieve next year. In the meantime, if you are interested in getting involved in educating policymakers and supporting positive regulation please email ally@blockcadvocacy.org&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Well, in a twist of fate that I am still bemused by, I am in Microsoft-land now and this fact has led me inevitably to my first Windows install since about 2008.Â&nbsp; It went pretty well, except that I didn’t have the recovery key for the previous installation, so had to do a scratch install.Â&nbsp; You’d think it would be easy, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">since they give you a tool</a> that does all the hard work! All you need is a USB drive of at least 8gb to become the installation media.</p>
<p>But then you put in your larger-than-8gb USB drive and the program says “Your USB must be at least 8gb!!”. Â&nbsp; You reformat, you think “Maybe I need FAT32”, etc.Â&nbsp; No luck.Â&nbsp; All roads lead to the mysterious 8gb error, even when your USB drive is empty and large.</p>
<p>So you look online, and the forums say “you ALSO need 8gb of space on your regular hard drive”, so you go look and you have hundreds of gigs of space on your C: drive.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing.Â&nbsp; You may have hundreds of gigs of space on your hard drive, but you may not have permission to write to the one little spot that the Windows media creation tool needs.Â&nbsp; So, if you are getting the 8gb required error using the Windows media creation tool, it could be because the machine you are using to create your image is hardened in such a way that you can’t write to the C: drive no matter how much space you have.</p>
<p>The workaround?Â&nbsp; Easiest is to findÂ&nbsp;two USB drives that are at least 8gb. Â&nbsp; Mount them both, copy the Windows installation media file to one and run the windows media executable from that drive.Â&nbsp; Specify the other drive inside the tool, and presto change-o, you’ll get a bootable Windows installation drive out of it.</p>

From left: Bear, David Grossblatt, Rishi Sachdev, Olga V.&nbsp;Mack<p>On Wednesday, June 20th 2018 the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition brought twenty entrepreneurs, advocates and founders to Sacramento for a full day of meetings with California’s legislators. What would induce busy blockchain movers and shakers to give up an entire day and drive up to Sacramento at&nbsp;6am?</p><p>Quite simply, to put a human face on the industry that has been typified in the media as fraudulent 20 year olds driving exotic cars and selling Chuck E. Cheese tokens to grandmas. These blockchain advocates gave their time to educate the legislators, staff, and regulators who are tasked with overseeing this industry. This was a critical first step in building up relationships that can help steer the state toward fostering a crypto economy that can compete on a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Who joined us? Representatives from: Founder’s Dojo, Alt Market, Cage Chain, Propy, Quantstamp, Coral Protocol, TalkDoc, Overlock, Noble Profit, ZS Blockchain, Hats Token, BeefChain, Civics.com. The variety of blockchain companies in attendance allowed us to discuss ‘use cases’ for the technology ranging from improving the security of public records, creating more reliable supply chains and using predictive analytics to fight fraud when using cryptocurrency.</p><p>What we&nbsp;learned:</p>  Legislators need examples: Of the 32 legislative offices we met with, 26 had a low-moderate understanding of blockchain. The best way we could help them grasp the range of industries the technology can impact is by having our members explain how their businesses use it. Once we did that, many got excited and recommended various departments we should reach out&nbsp;to.  The biggest misconception is that blockchain=Bitcoin. No surprise&nbsp;there.  Most legislators were supportive of<a href="https://medium.com/@blockadvocacy/blockchain-policy-in-the-golden-state-9ac6221dc539"> AB 2658 and SB 838</a>. Several asked ‘what’s next?’ — a good sign they would support more hard hitting legislation next&nbsp;year.  Our regulators are not our enemies. The California Attorney General’s office indicated a ‘wait and see’ attitude toward blockchain and cryptocurrency. It’s not high on their priority list - we wouldn’t expect any AG-led crypto&nbsp;sweeps.  The Department of Business Oversight is headed by an industry and regulatory veteran, Jan Lynn Owen, who both understands and is excited by the possibilities of this technology. She oversees regulation of banking, credit unions, financial services, money transmitters, broker dealers and&nbsp;more!  <p>This was a phenomenal introduction to Sacramento politics for the blockchain industry. We still have a lot of education and follow up to do, and we need to broaden our coalition to get it all done.

<p>Despite its reputation as a global leader in technology and never having met an industry it didn’t like to regulate (shout out to the carpet tax) California has remained relatively silent on blockchain and cryptocurrency.</p><p>Background-</p><p>In 2015, former Assemblymember Matt Dababneh proposed AB 1326- aka California’s BitLicense. The bill never passed out of the Senate, and failed once again in 2016. California’s blockchain and cryptocurrency business community continued to grow while New York suffered the “Great Bitcoin Exodus” and has struggled to issue 6 licenses in the intervening 3 years since the NY BitLicense first went into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>In 2017 Dababneh once again tried to introduce regulation- this time with the Virtual Currency Act which would have prohibited a person from engaging with virtual currency unless licensed. This bill also died, and it’s author has since resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Thus far the only regulation California HAS passed that mentions blockchain or cryptocurrency is a bill declaring “a raffle ticket shall not be sold in exchange for Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.” Noted.</p><p>2018-</p><p>In a year when Wyoming has become the breakout crypto-regulatory star by passing a set of 5 bills to attract investment, California’s forays are getting a little less press but are still signifcant. Two legislators have emerged with thoughtful pieces of legislation that start the process of the state regulating new technology by simply recognizing it.</p><p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2658">AB 2658</a> by Assemblymember Ian Calderon defines blockchain technology and updates the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act to include it. This bill also creates a working group (with industry representation) to create the best possible regulatory framework for the state of California.</p><p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB838">SB 838</a> by Sen. Robert Hertzberg also defines blockchain technology enables companies to record stock issuance and transfers using this technology.</p><p>The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition has organized entrepreneurs to testify at committee hearings and help shape the technical definitions within the bills. Both bills have passed out of their house of origin and have a reasonable shot of ending up on the Governor’s desk this&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Why does this matter? The state has successfully avoided industry-killing early overregulation. Legislators have demonstrated an interest in working with members of the blockchain community to learn what will work and are making small but smart steps towards a regulatory framework that makes companies more comfortable operating in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>Next Steps-</p><p>The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition is organizing a legislative education day in Sacramento on Wednesday, June 20th. We will be meeting with over 30 legislators to explain how blockchain technology is used by businesses in California and why these two bills are a step in the right direction. We are hosting an info session/training happy hour for those interested in going to Sacramento on Wednesday June 13th at 7pm.

<p>Last weekend, I spent a day with an amazing set of young women.</p>
<p>I was invited to be the judge of the chapter of the <a href="http://technovationchallenge.org/">Technovation Challenge</a>Â&nbsp;in my hometown of Calgary, Canada.Â&nbsp; Twelve teams of teenage girls worked to conceive, pitch and build a mobile application that addressed a problem in their community.Â&nbsp; Team after team of young women hit the stage to share their vision and accomplishments, and to later give demos to the judges and the crowd.Â&nbsp; What a *great* idea this whole enterprise is! While I only had to commit a weekend, there were a ton of people who put hundreds if not thousands of hours into this opportunity.Â&nbsp; For any of you who feel like it is impossible to impact the ‘pipeline problem’, take a look at getting involved! As I understand it, Technovation is global and there might be an opportunity to work with girls in your own area. I wish I could explain the sense of agency I got from these girls, they were out there getting it done.Â&nbsp; Also, I almost fell off my chair when one of the girls answered a live question about privacy of user data by noting that they could use a product like Auth0 to help!Â&nbsp; My jaw hit the floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am so excited to have seen this program in action, to see the tools that were chosen and the approaches that were taken.Â&nbsp; I can’t think of a better way to teach entrepreneurship, technical fearlessness,  presentation skills and teamwork.Â&nbsp; I am in personal awe of Mea Wang, who works as an associate professor in the computer science department.Â&nbsp; To pull this off is a spectacular accomplishment, thank you for paying it forward – you are making a huge difference.</p>
<p>The best lesson for me was a simple one. You might have thought these girls would be wowed by me! A real woman in tech! We get trained by twitter and the media to think we are rare and to be remarked upon.Â&nbsp; But no – in reality I was just a random old person.Â&nbsp; The people who are making impacts in the lives of these girls are not some fancy person with an “accomplishment”.Â&nbsp; It is the men and women they see every day, acting in local roles of knowledge and authority, encouraging and building and expanding these girls’ dreams.Â&nbsp; Kudos to all of you who act in that capacity.</p>

<p>I am officially a Microsoft employee, holy smokes.Â&nbsp; I’m pretty blown away by this initial experience… I’m sure you’ll all view what I say next according to whatever confirmation bias you bring into this — but the initial Microsoft experience is pretty spectacular, and I say this as someone who isn’t pre-conditioned to see everything with rose-colored glasses.Â&nbsp; These people take *care* of their people.Â&nbsp; I love that.Â&nbsp; I also love the charitable giving program.Â&nbsp; I don’t know if I’m allowed to describe it, but I can’t wait to max it out.Â&nbsp; I love the corporate commitment to sustainability.Â&nbsp; If you’re going to be in a bubble, it should be a self-aware bubble, right? This is an incredibly self-aware bubble, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>My two axes of initial judgement are pretty simple — how do you treat your people and how do you ONBOARD them.Â&nbsp; This was a pretty slick onboarding.Â&nbsp; Within a day I had initialized at least 3 factors of authentication, maybe 4 depending on how you count such things. I could access resources that mattered, and it was a pretty seamless experience.</p>
<p>Stay tuned – in future updates we will get to see me tackle new standards, and my failures will hopefully be your learnings. Or at least your entertainings :)Â&nbsp; My scope will expand and I can’t wait to share that. It is a lot less scary when you are backed by the incredible team that Alex Simons has built here.Â&nbsp; Life is full of possibilities!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image.png"></a></p>
<p>I am having a Twitter thread about why the Microsoft Graph- and only the Microsoft Graph- should be the one validating access tokens obtained by a client for calling the Microsoft Graph. However I am failing to explain that effectively in 240 chars quanta, so here I am – breaking a ~7 months blogging hiatus to provide a long form explanation.</p>
<p>A lot of the misunderstandings and challenges arising in this area stem from the fact that many people tend to interpret specific features and implementation choices of the product/service/SDK/scenario/topology they are using as general, universal properties of the protocol. Just like assuming that all swans are white, because you have never seen a black one, that approach will fail pretty often. Another form of that fallacy is the illusory correlation bias- for example, the conviction that OAuth2 tokens are JWTs (not necessarily!) or some form of novelty bias ( you think OpenID Connect tokens are all JWTs? Nope.)</p>
<p>Nowadays I tend to avoid trying to backtrack to first principles when explaining something- there’s a lot of people needing help in the queue, and they usually appreciate getting unblocked without having to become experts in protocol algebra. I tried that route in the twitter thread, pointing out things that could break in code when pursuing the wrong approach, but this time it didn’t work- so I have to bring out the big guns and go back to the fundamentals.</p>
 OAuth2 Access Tokens 
<p>OAuth2 introduces access tokens as artifacts that a client can use to gain access to a resource. You can find the stone tablets definition <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4">here</a>.<br>
Here there are few facts that are obvious for sad people like me spending a lot of time reading specs, but that might challenge the beliefs of pure practitioners.</p>
 OAuth2 access tokens have NO defined format. 
<p>That’s right. OAuth2 access tokens have NO mandated format. Read the definition I linked to earlier. Re-read it. There is NO LAW of any kind determining that an access token should be a JWT. More! There is no law of any kind establishing that an access token must contain issuers, scopes, audiences, claims, or any attribute at all. As long as a token enables a resource server to perform the authorization decisions it needs to make when receiving a call, it can use whatever (verifiable) method it wants.</p>
<p>Let’s drive the point home by sketching a quick scenario (which is semi fictional, I am using “Facebook” just because it’s familiar but I can’t really say how they are implemented in reality- this is more about understanding what’s possible).<br>
Imagine a client app that wants to call the Facebook Graph. The client will hit the Facebook’s authorization server authorization endpoint, which will authenticate the user and present a consent screen; upon successful authentication, Facebook will record (say in a DB) the fact that the user granted consent for delegated access from the client for a set of given scopes (let’s say writing on your wall). For the sake of simplicity let’s assume implicit grant: the authorization server returns an access token directly to the client.<br>
Now the client turns around and invokes the Facebook Graph, presenting the newly obtained access token in the call. The resource server in the API retrieves the access token and uses it for deciding whether it should allow the client to post on the user’s wall.<br>
Here’s the kicker! Given that the Facebook’s authorization server and resource server can be co-located and/or access the same backend, the token could simply be the ID of the row of a DB where the AS originally stored the consent info; as long as the resource server can read the same DB, there’s no need to use any fancy token format.</p>
<p>Now, why in practice so many services and solutions do use a specific format for access tokens? Two common reasons:</p>
 
 Often AS and RS are not co-located. When you protect your own web API with Azure AD, the AS is in Azure AD and the RS is wherever you host your API. In that case, the RS must be given a way to access and verify authorization info- and a format with validation rules does the trick better than providing access to a shared DB 
 Statelessness. Although consent is usually recorded long term, transient info are not good candidates to be stored server side- what auth method was used for a given auth transaction, for how long should a token be considered valid: those are all info that are easier to manage if the token itself remembers them, rather than having to store and retrieve them server side. This is one of the reasons for which even tokens meant for co-located AS and RS might be in a readable format (like JWT) but that is, I cannot stress it enough, happenstance: it’s absolutely NOT an invite to process that token on the cient, for all the reasons above. 
 
 OpendID Connect does NOT redefine OAuth2 access tokens to be JWTs. 
<p>OpenID Connect does lots of amazing things, including introducing id_tokens which ARE meant to be read by clients (that’s the entire point) and ARE defined as JWTs.</p>
<p>But OpenID Connect does NOT say anything about access token format: it introduces new grants and response types so that id_tokens can be requested alongside access tokens, but that doesn’t override the existing flows and properties defined in the original OAuth2 spec (including the shapelessness of access tokens).</p>
 OAuth2 access tokens’ sole purpose is to relay authorization info to the resource server 
<p>That’s why a client requests an access token: to gain access to the corresponding resource. That’s the only contract that needs to be respected when issuing access tokens, and it’s a contract between the AS and the RS- no one else, and in particular NOT the client, which should always treat access tokens as perfectly opaque.<br>
Every other collateral functionality that might be achieved on the client by processing the access token is NOT part of the contract. For example: if you are inspecting the access token on the client for determining what scopes have been granted to your client for that resource, your code is going to break when the token will change format. Often those changes are unrecoverable. Say that the RS starts requiring PII about the user, which cannot be seen by anyone by the RS: the AS might start to encrypt the entire token, so that no one but the RS (an in particular, not the client) can gain access to the token content. Note, this isn’t to say that knowing what scopes have been granted is not a legitimate functionality your client app might need: this is to say that extracting that info from an access token is brittle and very likely to end in tears- in production, no less.</p>
 The resource server is the only entity that can decide whether the token is enough to authorize the call 
<p>This is less of a protocol consideration and more of an architectural one.<br>
A client trying to divine from the access token content whether a call to an AI will succeed is, again, destined to a great deal of pain.</p>
<p>An API that until yesterday was accepting calls from all regions, today might start to restrict to specific countries; an API that was happy with any authentication method might suddenly start to accept only tokens obtained via 2FA; and so on. Same token, different authorization outcome.<br>
Once again: this does not delegitimize the need to give your users a good experience and minimize failures or unnecessary prompts. But a client looking inside an access token trying to guess that cannot succeed in the general case, hence it is not a viable solution for that problem. Even without invoking the risk of the token content disappearing behind an encryption event horizon, as described earlier, the client simply isn’t privy to the semantic the RS will assign to attributes- and the authorization decisions that will come with it.</p>
 So, what about validating tokens for the Microsoft Graph (or any other API) on a client? 
<p>At this point, you know that attempting validation of an access token for the Microsoft Graph or any other API is entirely pointless on the client:</p>
 
 There is no guarantee that the token will be in JWT format (or any format). It might be today, but that can change (or become impossible to ascertain) at any second, without any warning or remediation because the token format isn’t part of the contract with the client 
 No amount of validation or inspection will say anything certain about whether calls to the Graph using that token will succeed. API access policies change without any way for the client to know. And of course, it really bears repeating, having access to the token content from the client is pure happenstance and can stop working any second 
 
<p>The recipient of an access token is responsible for any validation and authorization enforcement; if you are that recipient, as is the case when you expose your own API, you can and should totally process the access token accordingly. But if you are a client of another API, I hope this post convinced you that you should not peek inside access tokens not meant for you.</p>
<p>A client is meant to do two things with an access token</p>
 
 request it 
 use it to call the resource it is meant for 
 renew it 
 
<p>Ok, that was 3 (tho the 3rd is really a special case of the 1st).<br>
Anything else is prone to painful errors when the AS makes any legitimate change- and we know that software changes are far more common than black swans </p>

<p>After eight and a half years at <a href="http://pingidentity.com">Ping Identity</a>, I am amazed to say that I’m moving on. I have had the privilege of working with incredibly talented people, from the CTO team to the product management team, to the entire field sales and technical corps.Â&nbsp; I am so proud of what Ping has made in the last eight years and of the things that we have chosen to hold dear: quality software, long-term deep relationships with customers, and leadership in identity standards through practicing what we preach.Â&nbsp; Also, serious costume partiesÂ&nbsp;</p>
<p></p> <p>Some of my favorite PingIdentians</p> <p></p>
<p>My other incredible windfall has been to meet brilliant and talented customer architects. They have taught me so much about the bigger picture, the reality that all the vision has to fit into, before it can resonate.</p>
<p>Last, I want to say something about the two people who were my direct superiors at Ping, Patrick Harding and Andre Durand.</p>
<p></p> <p>Andre and Patrick (and costume parties)</p> <p></p>
<p>Patrick and Andre took a chance on a relatively unknown Canadian identity geek, brought her onto the team and gave her support, autonomy, and opportunity.Â&nbsp; I would not be the person I am without the mentorship and friendship of these two amazing people.Â&nbsp; Thank you for believing in me.</p>
<p>Sometimes life surprises you – and I was recently surprised by an opportunity to really challenge myself in terms of growth and impact. So – onwards!Â&nbsp; I am excited to say I am joining the Microsoft Identity team, working for Alex Simons as Director of Identity Standards.Â&nbsp;I can’t believe that I somehow get to work in the rarified air of this team, with some of the people I admire the most in Identity.Â&nbsp; It took about 30 seconds of discussion with Alex to realize that this opportunity represented a chance to work with incredibly smart people, participate in complex problems that have to be solved at massive scale, and most importantly, to be able to advocate for standardized solutions to those problems, allowing for the whole industry to adopt secure patterns even if they don’t have the reach or resources of a company like Microsoft.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows that getting to talk identity standards like OAuth &amp; OpenID Connect all day every day is my idea of heaven; I can’t wait to see how the bits fit together for customers at the consumer and multi-tenant enterprise scale of MSFT.Â&nbsp; What will the future hold for identity standards? I have a few strong opinions in this area, but there is a whole new world of perspective awaiting. I hope I can some part in defining that future, wherever we all end up.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, I hope to do a lot more writing here, now that I can really focus on driving industry conversation, and I can’t wait to work with everybody in my new role!</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
<p></p> <p>I will miss you all, stay in touch!</p> <p></p>

<p>Defining identity is a notoriously difficult endeavor. Identity, in the technology industry, is the name of a business vertical that developers and software vendors use to describe a class of products and services they employ for managing users, authentication, and access control. But the average person doesn’t define identity in this way. They’re more likely to describe identity as how a person or thing defines itself and is known to the world around it. I have always thought it ironic that an industry vertical named ‘Identity’ rarely produces solutions that extend beyond a narrow sliver of what identity truly is. In this post, I will present a conceptual model for identity that defines it as an expansive, organic system, and my stretch goal is that it changes how you perceive your interactions in the world (at least a little).</p>
 Identity as a Cosmological Analog 
<p>According to Dark Matter &amp; Energy theory, the atoms, particles, and energy people commonly believe are the sum total of the universe, is known as Baryonic matter. Interestingly, and in contrast with human perception, the theory postulates that this form of matter only makes up ~5% of total matter and energy in the universe. The vast majority of the universe is said to be composed of another form of matter and energy, Dark Matter and Dark Energy. I find it fascinating there can be so much beyond our perception that goes into producing the relatively tiny sliver of what we recognize as our world.</p>
 <p>A visualization of Dark Matter – NASA, ESA, and E. Hallman (University of Colorado, Boulder)</p> 
<p>I posit to you that your perception of the countless interactions and exchanges you participate in on a daily basis is the Baryonic equivalent of their true scope and depth – just 5% of what’s really happening. The 95% you don’t see – the organic, interconnected web that permeates everything you experience – is identity. In this way, identity can be described as the Dark Matter &amp; Energy of our physical and digital lives.</p>
<p></p>
 Identity Transactions All Around Us 
<p>Every object on the planet (alive or inanimate) is a distinct entity, each with its own identity – this includes humans, organizations, devices, bots, VR objects, and countless other nouns. But the rabbitâ€s hole goes much deeper: this swirl of identities is constantly interacting with each other in ways you probably don’t recognize as identity transactions. What these identities generate, exchange, and experience during their interactions are transfers of identity-encoded data that augment their state, definition, and accrued provenance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All identity interactions are generally based on the transfer of self-signed or multi-party proofs; attestations, as many in the industry refer to them. These identity-linked proofs are what form the basis of trust and auditability when interacting with other identities. Here are just a few examples of identity transactions in our world:</p>
 
 Text, vocal, or visual communications – identity-encoded message transmissions 
 Licenses, permits, certificates, etc. – identity-signed declarations of privilege 
 Blogs, reviews, comments, etc. – self-signed attestations about other identities 
 Music, paintings, novels, photos. etc. – identity-encoded asset authorship proofs 
 Sales, ads, bids, asks, etc. – identity-signed signals of offer or intent 
 Supply chains, ownership histories, etc. – a trail of identity-signed proofs 
 
<p>As you can see, almost everything you do in life is an identity-encoded transaction, but much like Dark Matter &amp; Energy, they are currently difficult to capture and record. In the identity technology sphere, we lack a good technical system for processing and storing these exchanges in a way that is precise, self-sovereign, discoverable, and universally interoperable. Most of these interactions are either never recorded or are captured by a sea of apps and services that lock them in silos and walled gardens, often sharing the resulting data with unintended third-parties.</p>
 Enter The Blockchain 
<p>We talk about identity, proofs, and signatures as the fundamental building blocks of every interaction between entities, but what technical options are best suited for this? In my early work at Mozilla, and more serious development now at Microsoft and the <a href="http://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, we found that decentralized blockchains provide a solid foundation for anchoring <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> and DPKI operations. By using decentralized blockchains as a root of trust for anchoring identifiers and their association with cryptographic keys and off-chain personal datastores, you can create a system with just the right mix of attributes and features to support these kinds of identity interactions. Here’s a graphic that shows what the system looks like from a high level:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/full-system.png"></a></p>
<p>With this layered approach, most interactions are able to be done off-chain by simply signing data and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> with keys that are linked to blockchain-anchored identifiers. In many cases, the time-state of these identity interactions can also be important, so the identities involved may want to create a chain-anchored proof that captures the state of what they exchanged, when they exchanged it.</p>
 The Breathtaking Scale of Identity 
<p>Given the scope of identity, it is important to think about its scale. As alluded to above, each person, organization, device, bot, etc., singularly generates hundreds, if not thousands – and in some cases, millions – of transactions per day. Hopefully you are starting to realize the staggering scale required from any system or technology that seeks to support a world of identity transactions.</p>
<p>The canonical scaling goal you often hear about in blockchain land is “Look Ma, I can do 3000 transactions per second, just like Visa!”. While this would be a laudable goal if Visa-type payments accounted for a majority of transactional demand, it’s a drop in the ocean of demand-reality – and a tsunami is coming. All other demand sources aside, identity transactions + streaming micropayments, deployed at world-scale, would reach into the trillions of transactions per day.</p>
 Preview of Part 2 
<p>Blockchains, as decentralized, distributed systems that rely on broadcast transmission and consensus synchronization, are implicitly difficult to scale compared to traditional systems. Some blockchain communities have turned to what is known as on-chain scaling, versus intelligent off-loading of demand to secure, chain-anchored, Layer 2 systems. In the next post, I will break down the quantitative scale of demand blockchains will face if they intend to support decentralized identity, and provide an assessment of the various approaches to meeting that demand.</p>

One type of account locking scenario is Account locking by failed login attempts  Be default configurations related to Account locking based on failed attempts are global to all the users in the Identity Server.(i.e. Global to all the user stores)   Configuration parameters in the&nbsp;&lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repositor

In WSO2IS-5.1.0, there is User Account Locking scenarios as explained in this <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/User+Account+Locking">document</a>.<br><br>One type of account locking scenario is <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/User+Account+Locking#UserAccountLocking-Accountlockingbyfailedloginattempts">Account locking by failed login attempts</a><br><br>Be default configurations related to Account locking based on failed attempts are global to all the users in the Identity Server.(i.e. Global to all the user stores)<br><br> Configuration parameters in the&nbsp;<code>&lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/identity/identity-mgt.properties</code>&nbsp;file.    Configuration    Description   Authentication.Policy.Enable=true  This enables the authentication flow level which checks for the account lock and one time password features. This property must be enabled for the account lock feature to work.  Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure=true  This enables locking the account when authentication fails.  Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure.Max.Attempts=2 This indicates the number of consecutive attempts that a user can try to log in without the account getting locked. In this case, if the login fails twice, the account is locked. Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.Time=5  The time specified here is in minutes. In this case, the account is locked for five minutes and authentication can be attempted once this time has passed.  <br><br>Let's say there is a use case to maintain these configurations per user store.<br><br>Example scenario would be,<br>  There are two user stores configured with WSO@IS-5.1.0 instance.   Primary user store with default name "PRIMARY"  A secondary user store with name "TEST"   For both user stores we need different configuration parameter values   PRIMARY user Store   Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure.Max.Attempts=2  Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.Time=5   TEST user store      Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure.Max.Attempts=5  Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.Time=3     Let's say user store specific configurations can be in the below format and added to &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/identity/identity-mgt.properties.<br>        <code>&lt;UserStore&gt;.Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure.Max.Attempts=2</code>  <code><code>&lt;UserStore&gt;.</code>Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.Time=5</code>        ex:<br>        <code>TEST.Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.On.Failure.Max.Attempts=5</code>  <code>TEST.Authentication.Policy.Account.Lock.Time=3</code>        <br> WSO2 Identity Server doesn't support this custom configuration by default.We need to write a custom User Operations <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/User+Store+Listeners">Event Listener</a> in order to achieve this.  <br>  One approach is to extend <a href="https://github.com/wso2-attic/carbon-identity/blob/v5.0.7/components/identity-mgt/org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/identity/mgt/IdentityMgtEventListener.java">org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.IdentityMgtEventListener</a>| and override it's methods to check particular values based on the UserStore Domain.  <br>  I have written a sample <a href="https://github.com/ayshsandu/sample-user-operation-event-listner">user operation event listener</a> with this approach and overridden only two methods <a href="https://github.com/ayshsandu/sample-user-operation-event-listner/blob/master/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/sample/user/operation/event/listener/CustomIdentityMgtEventListener.java#L57">doPreAuthenticate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ayshsandu/sample-user-operation-event-listner/blob/master/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/sample/user/operation/event/listener/CustomIdentityMgtEventListener.java#L143">doPostAuthenticate</a>.  <br>  I have implemented a <a href="https://github.com/ayshsandu/sample-user-operation-event-listner/blob/master/src/main/java/org/wso2/carbon/sample/user/operation/event/listener/CustomIdentityMgtConfig.java">CustomIdentityMgtConfig</a> to hold configurations and used them accordingly to retrieve user store specific configuration values.(Go through the code to get a better understanding)  <br>  Once the custom user operation event listener(org.wso2.carbon.sample.user.operation.event.listener.CustomIdentityMgtEventListener) is implemented you can enable it in the place of org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.IdentityMgtEventListener in $IS_HOME/repository/conf/identity/identity.xml.  <br>  Copy the built org.wso2.carbon.sample.user.operation.event.listener-1.0.0.jar to $IS_HOME/repository/components/dropins and restart the server. <br> <br>  To achieve full functionality we may need to override other methods as well. <br> <br>  <br>

<p>In less than one week I have to check in for my flight to Orlando, where a huge amount of professionals is going to gather under one roof for one week to learn, network, have HR-approved fun- and none of my demos work yet! </p>
 Sessions 
<p>On Wednesday morning (10:25am) I am going to present a new session: <a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/55110">Office Development: Authentication demystified</a>. Office isn’t a track I normally speak for, but I liked the proposal so I readily accepted. I am trying to put together something pretty original, to try keeping you alive for 75 minutes without losing track of the pedagogical goals of the session… we’ll see, I guess: but I have to admit I am pretty excited!1</p>
<p>On Thursday morning (again, 10:25am) I am going to present an updated version of the session I gave at Build: <a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/55067">The keys to the cloud: Use Microsoft identities to sign in and access API from your mobile+web apps</a>. Same super long title, less cramped content- 75 minutes really should make it easier to do all the demos. There will be updates here and there, but the structure of the talk is the same: so if you already came to the Build instance, or there are conflicts with other sessions you want to catch in the same slot, you know what to do </p>
 Let’s connect 
<p>I am going to be there from Sunday to Thursday, all day, everyday. If you want to chat, we should connect! You can get a hold on me in <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/contact/">multiple ways</a>, but the most Ignite-y way would be to <a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/mobileapp">download the app</a> and find me among the attendees. Send me a message and we can go from there.</p>
<p>I will also hang out at the Azure AD/Identity booth at the expo whenever I’ll have a chance. Also, I am told that on Tuesday afternoon there will be an event where they might be giving away free copies of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">this guy</a>… you didn’t hear it from me! </p>

<p>Last week I saw a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45628746/how-to-get-permissions-in-azure-active-directory-application">StackOverflow question</a> where a user was wrestling with an app requesting admin consent. The user wanted to contact an administrator, to ask for the app to be consented, and didn’t know how to do that.</p>
<p>That’s actually an excellent question. I asked around, and it would appear that there’s no efficient way find out who’s a tenant admin (the exact role denomination is “company administrator”) in our current portals. Eran Dvir, a good friend on the directory team, suggested that one could simply use the Graph to find out who’s a member of that particular role… so yesterday night I wrote a quick&amp;dirty app that does just that. I called it Who’s your admin, and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/vibronet/WhosYourAdmin">here</a>.</p>
<p>The code is really super simple. First, I get a token for the graph; any directory user will do, given that I am giving the app permission to sign in as the current user and this kind of query can be done by anyone in the org (as long as you do it in a native app).</p>
 
 
    1: AuthenticationContext ac = new AuthenticationContext("https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"); 
<p></p>
    2: AuthenticationResult ar = ac.AcquireTokenAsync("https://graph.windows.net", 
<p></p>
    3:     "f357e8fa-87dd-44f2-84f4-40c2a53e3daf", 
<p></p>
    4:     new Uri("http://whatevs"), 
<p></p>
    5:     new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto)).Result; 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Then, I find out what is the objectID of the company administrator role in this particular tenant. I do that by getting all the roles and filtering for the one with display name “company administrator”. As usual, I prefer to do raw REST calls rather than using an SDK. Just personal preference </p>
 
 
    1: HttpClient client = new HttpClient(); 
<p></p>
    2: client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", ar.AccessToken); 
<p></p>
    3: HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync("https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/directoryRoles?api-version=1.6").Result; 
<p></p>
    4: string rez = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result; 
<p></p>
    5: JObject jo = JObject.Parse(rez); 
<p></p>
    6: JObject companyAdminRole = jo["value"].Values&lt;JObject&gt;().Where(m =&gt; m["displayName"].Value&lt;string&gt;() == "Company Administrator").FirstOrDefault(); 
<p></p>
    7: string roleObjID = companyAdminRole["objectId"].ToString(); 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Once I have that, I can use it to retrieve all the members in that role. Given that I already set up all the HttpClient machinery, the code required is really tiny.</p>
 
 
    1: response = client.GetAsync(string.Format("https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/directoryRoles/{0}/members?api-version=1.6", roleObjID)).Result; 
<p></p>
    2: 
<p></p>
    3: rez = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result; 
<p></p>
    4: jo = JObject.Parse(rez); 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Finally, I just print out some contact info from the results.</p>
 
 
    1: foreach (var adm in jo["value"]) 
<p></p>
    2: { 
<p></p>
    3:     // we only want people you can email, not bots 
<p></p>
    4:     if (adm["objectType"].ToString() == "User") 
<p></p>
    5:     { 
<p></p>
    6:         Console.WriteLine("Admin found: {0} ", adm["displayName"]); 
<p></p>
    7:         // note: UPN!= email. Also, guess users will have an odd ID here 
<p></p>
    8:         Console.WriteLine("UPN: {0} ", adm["userPrincipalName"]); 
<p></p>
    9:         // note: mail is not always populated (for example in case of guest users). 
<p></p>
   10:         // Try getting otherMails too, for example.  
<p></p>
   11:         Console.WriteLine("Email: {0}",adm["mail"]); 
<p></p>
   12:         Console.WriteLine("=========================="); 
<p></p>
   13:     } 
<p></p>
   14: } 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Here there’s the output for my usual test tenant. You can see some oddities due to the guest status of one of the users: please refer to the comments in code for some explanation and suggested actions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/image.png"></a></p>
<p>Here there’s the thing. This approach can help you if you find yourself precisely in the situation described by the StackOverflow poster, an app needs admin consent and you want to contact an administrator to grant that consent. But it will NOT help if the admin has turned off user consent for the tenant. Why? Well, the console app itself needs to receive your user consent at first run- but if the admin tuned that off, that can’t happen to begin with. Other than sifting through the users in the directory in the portal to find who’s an admin, I wouldn’t know what to do in that case as of today- apart from doing the Italian thing and simply ask my contacts .</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Dang. Here you have it.<br>
Note, it is perfectly possible that there’s already a way to find this info without having to run some code (or equivalent powershell if you’re an admin, I guess ) – and if I find it, I’ll break my habit of never updating posts and add the new relevant info here. Until then, have fun!</p>

  There can be use cases that some organizations only needs to make artifacts visible in the store, only when they reach a particular state of its lifecycle. This requirement can be catered via the extension[1] model of WSO2GREG.  As an example let’s take soapservice, and assume that we need to make soapservices visible in store, only when they reach "Published" state in their lifecycle. Follow below

Now in the store only soapservices in "published" state will be visible.<br><br>If you need to have same behavior for other asset types as well, then follow the same steps in each assets extension type, by editing [Home]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/store/extensions/assets/[ASSET-TYPE]/asset.js file. <br><br>[2] https://github.com/wso2/product-greg/blob/v5.3.0/modules/es-extensions/store/asset/soapservice/asset.js#L119<br>[3] https://github.com/wso2/product-greg/blob/v5.3.0/modules/es-extensions/store/asset/soapservice/asset.js#L147

<p>Configuring the ASP.NET OWIN middleware (MW from now on) in your web app makes it super easy to sent your users to authenticate with Azure AD, as the MW takes care of manufacturing the right message for the Authorization endpoint from the options you provided at startup.</p>
<p>However, there are many situations in which you want to send your user to Azure AD, but instead of the regular sign in settings you specified in the MW option, you want something slightly different to happen. <br>For example, say that you changed the delegated permissions that your app is requesting for accessing other APIs. The user consent already recorded doesn’t reflect the new permissions you app needs, so (assuming you are using Azure AD v1) you need to ensure that the user has an opportunity to be prompted again for consent and approve the new permissions. <br>The way you let Azure AD you want to ignore any previously recorded consent and prompt the user anew is to sent prompt=consent in your request to the authorization endpoint. You can add a new action in your controller to trigger the new consent flow, but if you simply call the usual<br>HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge <br>you’ll end up with whatever message results from the options you initialized you MW with; and you certainly don’t want every sign in request to re-prompt every user for consent, all the time. What now?</p>
<p>The solution is very simple:</p>
 
 Right before calling Challenge, Place something in the OWIN context that signals your intention to ask for a brand new consent prompt 
 Implement the RedirectToIdentityProvider notification. Use it to look for whatever you might have placed in the context in step 1 – and if you find it, modify the outgoing message to include prompt=consent 
 
<p>Got it? now let’s actually make it happen. Say that you have an ASP.NET app already hooked up via OIDC MW to Azure AD. If you app is based on the old Katana, you could write your renew consent action as in the following</p>
 
 
    1: public void RenewConsent() 
<p></p>
    2: { 
<p></p>
    3:     HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Set("RenewConsent", "RenewConsent"); 
<p></p>
    4:     HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" }, 
<p></p>
    5:                     OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType); 
<p></p>
    6: } 
<p></p> 
 
<p>I am using strings because they are nullable, and I am lazy.</p>
<p>Your startup.auth.cs might init the MW as in the following:</p>
 
 
    1: app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication( 
<p></p>
    2:     new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions 
<p></p>
    3:     { 
<p></p>
    4:         ClientId = clientId, 
<p></p>
    5:         Authority = authority, 
<p></p>
    6:         PostLogoutRedirectUri = postLogoutRedirectUri, 
<p></p>
    7:         Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications 
<p></p>
    8:         { 
<p></p>
    9:             RedirectToIdentityProvider = OnRedirectToIdentityProvider, 
<p></p>
   10:&nbsp;  
<p></p>
   11:         }, 
<p></p>
   12:     }); 
<p></p> 
 
<p>and your implementation of RedirectToIdentityProvider might look like the following:</p>
 
 
    1: private Task OnRedirectToIdentityProvider(RedirectToIdentityProviderNotification&lt;OpenIdConnectMessage, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions&gt; notification) 
<p></p>
    2: { 
<p></p>
    3:     var consent = notification.OwinContext.Get&lt;string&gt;("RenewConsent"); 
<p></p>
    4:     if (consent=="RenewConsent") 
<p></p>
    5:     { 
<p></p>
    6:         notification.ProtocolMessage.Prompt = "consent";                 
<p></p>
    7:     } 
<p></p>
    8:     return Task.FromResult(0); 
<p></p>
    9: } 
<p></p> 
 
<p>Go ahead, try to run your app and trigger the redirect to Azure AD via RenewConsent() – with the Set line active or commented out; you’ll see that Azure AD obediently prompts the user for consent, or not, following your directives.</p>
<p>Using Core in your app? Things are even simpler. Place your signal in the HttpContext (as in HttpContext.Items[“RenewConsent”] = “RenewConsent”) and fetch it in RedirectToIdentityProvider event from the RedirectContext, as in context.HttpContext.Items[“RenewConsent”].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy, right? I’ve been wanting to write this post for a long time, as this technique comes in handy in many occasions – the consent renewal is just one example, but there are plenty of other things you might want to tell Azure AD that are situation dependent and can’t be baked in the initialization options (for example, think of <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2014/11/17/skipping-the-home-realm-discovery-page-in-azure-ad/">this guy</a>). However I never found the time/forgot until it came in handy again for some colleagues last week, so I finally got to it. Yay! Try it out, and hit me <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/contact/">here</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/vibronet">twitter</a> if there’s anything unclear  enjoy!</p>

<p>It’s about 9:30pm on Saturday. Â&nbsp;I’m in a bar, on Hackney road in London, that I simply stumbled upon while wandering around. Â&nbsp;It is an incredible place. Â&nbsp;It is called “The Natural Philosopher” and I heartily approve. Â&nbsp;It is an odd and slightly twisted cross between an old fashioned victorian study, and a curio shop. Â&nbsp;I would take a picture – but this isn’t the kind of place you take a picture in. Â&nbsp;It’s meant not for Facebook check-boxing, but for people to sit and be in the moment. Â&nbsp;And here I am, in the corner, working away at the laptop. Â&nbsp;Better than trying to snap pictures though.</p>
<p>I haven’t written here for a long time. Â&nbsp;But I dream about it. Â&nbsp;I live a kind of guilt-driven life in some ways – how can I write here, when there are so many other greater priorities, outstanding commitments, all the things people are waiting for me to deliver?</p>
<p>But,Â&nbsp;sometimes the time is right. Â&nbsp;My world is a lovely place, I have an amazingly balanced life, whereby I have good measures of intellectual stimulation, external validation, loving support, and independent exploration. Â&nbsp;There are frustrations too, but there always are.</p>
<p>I think I will write here again soon. Â&nbsp;There is so much to talk about, amazing changes and improvements in the identity world, pushed by sometimes surprising forces. Â&nbsp;And I’ve started playing with the Arduino, so there is wonder there that I would enjoy sharing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I shall enjoy this strange, unexpected, odd bar in a place I have always wanted to explore. Â&nbsp;Even if I am the strange one in the corner with a laptop, the screen probably gives me an even more surreal look than the decor…</p>

<p>About one year ago, I was all excited to finally hold in my hands the thing that swallowed most of the weekends and vacation days of 2015: a paper copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">my latest book, “Modern Authentication with Azure Active Directory for web Applications”</a>. And I just realized I never wrote an “announcement” post, so here it is!</p>
 What is the book about, and why I wrote it 
<p>The TL;DR is that I wanted to fill a gap in the Azure AD content. Most of our docs were either aimed at helping you to quickly accomplish a task, without worrying too much about the general concepts behind it, or bite-size topic focusing on a individual topics. We had nothing meant to help a motivated developer to become an expert in the use of Azure AD, regardless of how much or how little he or she knew about identity already. So I wrote a book about it </p>
<p>Things worked out pretty well; lots of people claim that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a> helped them, which is really the best reward an author can hope for. Icing on the cake, my bosses liked it – to the point that they got a paper copy for each and everyone in our team (that’s several hundreds people), and it is now part of the new hire package (BTW, did you know we are hiring? hit me if you are interested!).</p>
<p>Want more details? Here there’s the introduction, pasted verbatim from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book’s</a> manuscript.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>It’s never a good idea to use the word “modern” in the title of a book.<br>
Growing up, one of the centerpieces of my family’s bookshelf was a 15-tomes-strong encyclopedia titled Nuovissima Enciclopedia (Very new encyclopedia), and I always had a hard time reconciling the title with the fact that it was 10 years older than me.<br>
I guarantee that the content in this book will get old faster than those old volumes—cloud and development technologies evolve at a crazy pace—and yet I could not resist referring to the main subject of the book as “modern authentication.”<br>
The practices and technologies used to take care of authentication in business solutions have changed radically nearly overnight, by a perfect storm of companies moving their assets to the cloud, software vendors starting to sell their products via subscriptions, the explosive growth of social networks with the nascent awareness of consumers of their own digital identity, ubiquitous APIs offering programmatic access to everything, and the astonishing adoption rate of Internet-connected smartphones.<br>
“Modern authentication” is a catch-all term meant to capture how today’s practices address challenges differently from their recent ancestors: JSON instead of XML, REST instead of SOAP, user consent and individual freedom alongside traditional admin-only processes, an emphasis on APIs and delegated access, explicit representation of clients, and so on. And if it is true that those practices will eventually stop appearing to be new—they are already mainstream at this point—the break with traditional approaches is so significant that I feel it’s important to signal it with a strong title, even if your kids make fun of it a few years from now.<br>
As the landscape evolves, Active Directory evolves with it. When Microsoft itself introduced one of the most important SaaS products on the planet, Office 365, it felt firsthand how cloud-based workloads call for new ways of managing user access and application portfolios. To confront that challenge Microsoft developed Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a reimagined Active Directory that takes advantage of all the new protocols, artifacts, and practices that I’ve grouped under the modern authentication umbrella. Once it was clear that Azure AD was a Good Thing, it went on to become the main authentication service for all of Microsoft’s cloud services, including Intune, Power BI, and Azure itself. But the real raison d’etre of this book is that Microsoft opened Azure AD to every developer and organization so that it could be used for obtaining tokens to invoke Microsoft APIs and to handle authentication for your own web applications and web APIs.</p>
<p>Modern Authentication with Azure Active Directory for Web Applications is an in-depth exploration of modern authentication protocols and techniques used to implement sign-on for web applications and to protect web API calls. Although the protocols and pattern descriptions are applicable to any platform, my focus is on how Azure AD, the latest version of Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), and the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 components in ASP.NET implement those approaches to handle authentication in real applications.<br>
The text is meant to help you achieve expert-level understanding of the protocols and technologies involved in implementing modern authentication for a web app. Substantial space is reserved for architectural pattern descriptions, protocol considerations, and other abstract concerns that are necessary for correctly contextualizing the more hands-on advice that follows.<br>
Most of the practical content in this book is about cloud and hybrid scenarios addressed via Azure AD. At the time of writing, the version of ADFS supporting modern authentication for web apps is still in technical preview; however, on-premises-only scenarios are covered whenever the relevant features are already available in the preview.</p>
 Who should read this book 
<p>I wrote this book to fill a void of expert-level content for modern authentication, Azure AD, and ADFS. Microsoft offers great online quick starts, samples, and reference documentation—check out <a href="http://aka.ms/aaddev—that">http://aka.ms/aaddev—that</a> are perfect for helping you fulfil the most common tasks as easily as possible. That content covers many scenarios and addresses the needs of the vast majority of developers, who can be extremely successful with their apps without ever knowing what actually goes on the wire, or why. I like to think of that level of operation as the automatic mode for handheld and smartphone cameras—their defaults work great for nearly everybody, nearly all the time. But what happens if you want to take a picture of a lunar eclipse or any other challenging subject? That’s when the point-and-click facade is no longer sufficient and knowing about aperture and exposure times becomes important. You can think of this book as a handbook for when you want to switch from automatic to manual settings. Doing so is useful for developers who work on solutions for which authentication requirements depart from the norm and for the devops who run such solutions.<br>
Developers who worked with Windows Identity Foundation will find the text useful for transferring their skills to the new platform, and they’ll pick up some new tricks along the way. The coverage of how the OWIN middleware works is deeper than anything I’ve found on the Internet at this time: if you are interested in an in-depth case study of ASP.NET’s Katana libraries, you’ll find one here.<br>
This book also comes in handy for security experts coming from a classic background and looking to understand modern protocols and approaches to authentication—the principles and protocols I describe can be applied well beyond Active Directory and ASP.NET. Security architects considering Azure AD for their solutions can use this book to understand how Azure AD operates. Protocol experts who want to understand how Azure AD and ADFS use OpenID Connect and OAuth2 will find plenty to mull over as well.</p>
 Assumptions 
<p>This book is for senior professionals well versed in development, distributed architectures, and web-based solutions. You need to be familiar with HTTP trappings and have at least a basic understanding of networking concepts. All sample code is presented in C#, and all walk-throughs are based on Visual Studio. Azure AD and ADFS can be made use of from any programming stack and operating system; however, if you don’t understand C# syntax and basic constructs (LINQ, etc.), it will be difficult for you to apply the coding advice in this book to your platform of choice. For good background, I’d recommend John Sharp’s Microsoft Visual C# Step by Step, Eighth Edition (Microsoft Press, 2015).<br>
Above all, this book assumes that you are strongly motivated to become an expert in modern authentication techniques and Azure AD development. The text does not take any shortcuts: you should not expect a light read; most chapters require significant focus and time investment.</p>
 This book might not be for you if… 
<p>This book might not be for you if you just want to learn how to use Azure AD or ADFS for common development tasks. You don’t have to buy a book for that: the documentation and the samples available at <a href="http://aka.ms/aaddev">http://aka.ms/aaddev</a> will get you up and running in no time, thanks to crisp step-by-step instructions. If there are tasks you’d like to see covered by the Azure AD docs, please use the feedback tools provided at that address: the Azure AD team is always looking for feedback for improving its documentation.<br>
This book is also not especially good as a lookup reference. The text covers a lot of ground, including information that isn’t included in the documentation at this time, but the information is unveiled progressively, building on the reader’s growing understanding of the topic. The book is optimized as a long lesson, not for looking things up.<br>
Finally, this book won’t be of much help if you are developing mobile, native, and rich-client applications. I originally intended to cover those types of applications, too, but the size of the book would have nearly doubled, so I had to cut them from this edition.</p>
 Organization of this book 
<p>This book is meant to be read cover to cover. That’s not what most people like to do, I know: bite-size and independent modules is the way to go today. I believe there are media more conducive to that approach, like video courses or the online documentation at <a href="http://aka.ms/aaddev">http://aka.ms/aaddev</a>. I chose to write a book because to achieve my goal—helping you understand modern authentication principles and how to take advantage of them with Azure AD—I cannot feed you only factlets and recipes. I have to present you with a significant amount of information, highlight relationships and implications for you, and then often ask you to tuck that knowledge away for a chapter or two before you actually end up using it. That’s where I believe a book can still deliver value: by giving me the chance to hold your attention for a significant amount of time, I can afford a depth and breadth that I cannot achieve in a blog post. (By the way, did I mention that I do blog a lot as well? See www.cloudidentity.com and www.twitter.com/vibronet.)<br>
If this book has a natural fault line in its organization, it lies between the first four chapters and the last six. The first group provides context, and the later chapters dive deeply into the protocols, code, libraries, and features of Active Directory. Here’s a quick description of each chapter’s focus:<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 1, “Your first Active Directory app,” is a soft introduction to the topic, giving you a brief glimpse of what you can achieve with Azure AD. It mostly provides instructions on how to use Visual Studio tools to create a web app that’s integrated with Azure AD. Instant gratification.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 2, “Identity protocols and application types,” is a detailed history of identity protocols. It introduces terminology, topologies, and relationships between standards and helps you understand how modern authentication<br>
came to be and why identity is managed the way it is today.</p>
<p>Chapter 3, “Introducing Azure Active Directory and Active Directory Federation Services,” presents basic concepts, terminology, and a list of developer-relevant features for Azure AD and ADFS. The hands-on chapters (Chapters 6-10) provide detailed descriptions of the features of both services that come into play in the scenarios of interest for the book.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 4, “Introducing the identity developer libraries,” covers basic concepts, terminology, and the features of the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) and ASP.NET OWIN middleware.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 5, “Getting started with web sign-on and Active Directory,” provides a walk-through of how to create from scratch a web app that can sign in with Azure AD. Starting with the vanilla MVC templates, you learn about the NuGets packages you need to add, what app provisioning steps you need to follow in the Azure portal, and what code you need to write to perform key authentication tasks.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 6, “OpenID Connect and Azure AD web sign-on,” provides a very detailed description of OpenID Connect and related standards, grounded on network traces of the actual traffic generated by the sample app. This is a very practical way of understanding the underlying protocol and why it operates the way it does. The descriptions of the constellation of ancillary specifications for OpenID Connect and OAuth2 will help you to navigate this rather crowded space, even if you are not planning to use Azure AD at the moment.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 7, “The OWIN OpenID Connect middleware,” is a detailed analysis of how the authentication pipeline in ASP.NET works—with an emphasis on the OpenID Connect middleware, its extensibility points, and what scenarios these are meant to address.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 8, “Azure Active Directory application model,” is a deep dive into the Azure AD application model: how Azure AD represents apps and handles consent, and how it deals with app provisioning, multitenancy, app roles, groups, app permissions, and the like.<br>
■■<br>
Chapter 9, “Consuming and exposing a web API protected by Azure Active Directory,” does for web APIs what Chapters 6 and 7 do for web apps—it explains the protocol flows used by web apps for gaining access to a protected API and describes how to use ADAL and the OAuth2 middleware for securely invoking and protecting a web API. This chapter also briefly introduces the Directory Graph API and discusses advanced scenarios such as exposing and securing both the user experience and an API from the same web project</p>
<p>.■■</p>
<p>Chapter 10, “Active Directory Federation Services in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 3,” discusses the new modern authentication features in ADFS, showing how to adapt web sign-on, web API invocation, and code protection covered in the earlier chapters to on-premises-only scenarios.<br>
■■<br>
The appendix, “Further reading,” provides you with pointers to online content describing ancillary topics and offerings that are still too new to be fully fleshed out in the book but are interesting and relevant to the subject of modern authentication.</p>
 Free chapters 
<p>As it is tradition for Microsoft Press titles, we put out two sample chapters that can be <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/content/images/9780735696945/samplepages/9780735696945.pdf">freely downloaded</a> or read online.</p>
<p>I chose the chapter on the <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473127">Azure AD app model</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473126">deep dive on the OpenId Connect middleware</a> – I thought those were the topics that could benefit the most from a deep, comprehensive coverage and that also happened to be mostly absent from our reference docs at the time.</p>

<p>There’s an excellent Japanese version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a>, available <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E8%84%B1%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%AC%E3%83%9F%E3%82%B9-%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A6%E3%83%89%E6%99%82%E4%BB%A3%E3%81%AE%E8%AA%8D%E8%A8%BC%E5%9F%BA%E7%9B%A4-Active-Directory-%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88%E9%96%A2%E9%80%A3%E6%9B%B8-ebook/dp/B01IB6Q79W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483944950&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=vittorio+bertocci">here</a> – courtesy of the excellent translation efforts of mr. <a href="https://twitter.com/junichia">@junichia</a> and mr. <a href="https://twitter.com/phr_eidentity">@phr_eidentity</a>. I can’t tell you how happy I was to get my hands on it, and how honored I am that they decided the text was worth their work – such a proud moment </p>
 What changed in a year 
<p>Despite my <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/how-to-make-my-bookshelf-sublimate-abe8599369fb#.3m7fs588h">boundless love for paper books</a>, I have to acknowledge that they have shortcomings: for example, it’s pretty hard to update them as their content slides in obsolescence  so, what changed since the book came out of the printers?</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2016/09/16/azure-ad-development-lands-on-portal-azure-com/">Azure AD showed up in the new portal</a>. I knew that it was coming, hence I avoided placing portal screenshots in the text. I do have some textual instructions, but unless you are a screenscraping script you should be able to map the instructions to the new portal UX. If enough people will have a hard time, I will blog an “errata” to update things accordingly 
 ADFS shipped! The text was referring to TP3 – there are some differences in the RTM version, but again, the instructions should still largely work if applied with a&nbsp; grain of salt 
 
 Thanks 
<p>I did have some fun writing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a>, and I believe it surfaces in its pages; however it was also SO MUCH work, and a pretty crazy time commitment. I was lucky to have the help of amazing people, which are mostly listed in the acknowledgement section of the book.<br>
I am very happy about how the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a> is doing – it appears to be achieving the goals I had in mind when I wrote it, which is fantastic.<br>
If you are among the people who already read it – thanks! Please know that I treasure any thought you might have about it, and I am glad to provide any clarification you need.<br>
If you didn’t read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a> and you are interested in developing on Azure AD: before spending any money on it, check out <a href="https://aka.ms/aaddev">https://aka.ms/aaddev</a> – almost certainly, you’ll find what you need readily available there. And if you do end up picking up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">book</a>, please let me now what think about it! </p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Few years ago I wrote <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2014/11/18/from-domain-to-tenantid/">a post</a> about how you can obtain the ID of a tenant from one of its domains. Something so simple, and yet I am told that it ended up to be of use for lots of people. Yay!</p>
<p>(BTW, at the time the root domain for Azure AD was login.windows.net, but now it is login.microsoftonline.com)</p>
<p>I do often get asked how to do the inverse operation: given the tenantID, how do I determine the domain associated to it?</p>
<p>Before we answer that question, we need to clarify things a bit. Whereas there’s only one immutable, non-reassignable, gloriously opaque tenantID per tenant, every tenant can register a crazy number of domains. That said, only one of those is designated to be the default domain for the tenant. So, a better formulation would be: given the tenantID, how do I determine the default domain associated to it?</p>
<p>As it turns out, I don’t know of a way to do that without doing an authenticated call to the Microsoft Graph API. Luckily, it’s all super straightforward. Here’s what we need to do:</p>
 
 get a token for the Microsoft Graph API in the target tenant 
 retrieve the organization entity, by doing a GET against <a title="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/" href="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/{tenantID}/organization/">https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/{tenantID}/organization/</a>. Reference in <a title="https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/organization" href="https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/organization">https://graph.microsoft.io/en-us/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/organization</a> 
 once you have organization , scan its verifiedDomains collection to find the entry with default value set to true. Example below. The name property contains the value you seek. 
 
 
 
    1: { 
<p></p>
    2:  "capabilities": "Email, OfficeCommunicationsOnline", 
<p></p>
    3:  "isDefault": true, 
<p></p>
    4:  "isInitial": true, 
<p></p>
    5:  "name": "developertenant.onmicrosoft.com", 
<p></p>
    6:  "type": "Managed" 
<p></p>
    7: } 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Clear as mud? here there’s a magical ADAL snippet that will do the job for you.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
    6:     string orgQuery = string.Format("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/{0}/organization/", tenantID) 
<p></p>
    7:     string graphResource = "https://graph.microsoft.com";

<p></p>
   14:         new Uri("http://li"), 
<p></p>
   15:         new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Always)).Result; 
<p></p>
   16: 
<p></p>

<p></p>
   18:     HttpClient client = new HttpClient(); 
<p></p>
   19:     HttpRequestMessage request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, orgQuery); 
<p></p>
   20:     request.Headers.Authorization = 
<p></p>
   21:         new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("bearer", ar.AccessToken); 
<p></p>
   22:     HttpResponseMessage response = client.SendAsync(request).Result; 
<p></p>
   23:     string responseString = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result; 
<p></p>
   24: 
<p></p>
   25:     //retrieve the default domain for the tenant 
<p></p>
   26:     JObject jo = JObject.Parse(responseString); 
<p></p>
   27:     JArray domains = jo["value"][0]["verifiedDomains"] as JArray; 
<p></p>
   28:     string defaultDomain = string.Empty; 
<p></p>
   29:     foreach(JObject domain in domains) 
<p></p>
   30:     { 
<p></p>
   31:         if ((bool)domain["isDefault"]) 
<p></p>
   32:         { 
<p></p>
   33:             defaultDomain = domain["name"].ToString(); 
<p></p>
   34:         } 
<p></p>
   35:     } 
<p></p>
   36: 
<p></p>
   37:     Console.WriteLine("The default domain for tenant {0} is {1}", tenantID, defaultDomain); 
<p></p>
   38:     Console.ReadLine(); 
<p></p>
   39: } 
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Now, I am sure that some of the Microsoft Graph experts will hasten to point out that instead of specifying the tenantID, I could use common and get <a title="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/" href="https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization">https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization</a>, thus making the code more generic. Unfortunately, that’s not a viable approach:</p>
 
 If I already know a user UPN in the default domain, I already know the default domain – and the entire brouhaha becomes unnecessary. The approach might work and might be useful if I have access to a user whose UPN belongs to a NON-default domain verified for the tenantID, however it still falls short for the next point. 
 If the user account I have access to for the tenantID happens to be a guest from a different tenant, the approach with common and no tenantID in the resource URI would yield the default domain of the ORIGIN tenant for the user, rather than the domain for the tenantID we are looking for. 
 
<p>Well, there you have it. I asked to my peeps in the directory service if there’s any simpler way to go about retrieving the default verified domain for a given tenantID, but I didn’t hear back. The above isn’t really that hard, it’s just a GET and a big of JSON scavenging – but who knows, maybe there’s some unauthenticated feed somewhere with the domain info. If I’ll hear something in that sense, I’ll update the post accordingly. Enjoy!</p>

<p>TL;DR: as of today, Azure AD apps created on portal.azure.com won’t be provisioned in your development tenant. This post offers a simple JS form that helps you to do just that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might recall that a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2016/09/16/azure-ad-development-lands-on-portal-azure-com/">Azure AD finally landed on portal.azure.com</a>.<br>
One of the key differences you’ll encounter when creating Azure AD apps in portal.azure.com lies in the fact that the portal only creates the Application object, but does not actually provision a ServicePrincipal for the app in your development tenant.<br>
That means that a number of features, like users and groups assignments, are not available out of the box.</p>
<p>If you do want to provision the app in your tenant, all you need to do is to “touch” it, as suggested by the app essentials blade:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image.png"></a></p>
<p>Essentially, all you need to do is to attempt logging in the application with a user from your development tenant: your user will be prompted for consent, and if you grant it, the app will be provisioned.<br>
You’ll know that the operation succeeded because the essentials blade, once refreshed, will change as in the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-1.png"></a></p>
<p>At this point, all you need to do to manage the app is to click on the link below “managed application in local directory”, and you get back all the familiar management features that depend on the presence of a ServicePrincipal for the application.</p>
<p>Of course the above assumes that you already have your application code already up and running, or at the very least that you have the logic generating an authentication request already configured and in place; and I guess that might not always be the case, or at least that’s not always the case when I develop.</p>
<p>Here there’s a thought, tho: if you just want to create a ServicePrincipal for your app, you don’t have to implement an entire sign in operation end to end: as long as you get past the consent prompt, your ServicePrincipal gets created – what happens afterwards doesn’t influence that.<br>
To that end, I created a super simple JavaScript snippet that takes in input a tenant, a clientId and a redirect URI – the ones form the app just created – creates an authorization code grant request URL from it, and redirects the browser towards it. Here you can sign in with your development tenant user, give consent and.. voila’! The browser will end up giving an error, given that your redirectURL doesn’t have any code listening on it yet – but your SP will be provisioned.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to give it a try, I embedded the form in this very post – you can find it below.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a great moment to remind you that this is my personal blog and what you find here is NOT official guidance. I think there’s not much danger here, I am using a code flow for a confidential client because the code is useless without the confidential client credentials anyway, hence the trick I am using here should be fine – however none of this has been reviewed by our security gurus hence there might be some horrible issue lurking that I am totally missing.</p></blockquote>
<p>All you need to do is to create an app on portal.azure.com as described here, then copy the relevant settings (tenant, Application ID –&gt; clientID, Reply URL (or Home Page for Essentials) –&gt;redirect URI) and hit the GO! button.<br>
Remember, once the consent is done, the browser WILL error out… that’s expected.</p>
 
<p>tenant:  </p>
<p>redirect URI:  </p>
<p>clientID:  </p>
<p>Admin consent?  </p>
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did it work? Head back to portal.azure.com, get to your app and see if the Essentials page changed as described earlier. Ta dah!</p>
<p>For the more advanced Azure AD developers among you:&nbsp; I can use this little form for experimenting with consent in general – for example, for provisioning multitenant apps on an arbitrary tenant, or for manually provisioning resources I need to consent to from clients defined in different tenants, making it impossible to use the knownClientApplications property.<br>
Does that sound like Klingon to you? If you want to learn more about the Azure AD app model, you can take a look at <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473127">Chapter 8</a> of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">the Azure AD book</a>, freely available online <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473127">here</a>.

<p>For the longest time, I watched with envy as my Azure colleagues drove their conference demos from the shiny portal.azure.com, while I had to stick with the good ol’ manage.windowsazure.com.</p>
<p>Well, guess what! Yesterday we announced that the Azure AD management features are finally appearing in preview in portal.azure.com. Jeff wrote an <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/09/12/the-azuread-admin-experience-in-the-new-azure-portal-is-now-in-public-preview/">excellent post</a> about it, however, as it is in his nature, he focused on the administrative angle and relegated the development features to a paragraph tantamount to a footnote. That gave me enough motivation to break the blog torpor in which I’ve slid into since finishing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentication-Directory-Applications-Developer-Reference/dp/0735696942/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=wwwcloudident-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=PPVHCRCDWQ4K4EJO&amp;creativeASIN=0735696942">the book</a>, and pen for you this totally unofficial guide to the new awesome development features in portal.azure.com. Enjoy!</p>
 Basics 
<p>Let’s take a look at this new fabulous portal, shall we. Pop out your favorite browser and navigate to <a title="https://portal.azure.com" href="https://portal.azure.com">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll land on a page like the below.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image.png"></a></p>
<p>Where is Azure AD? Click on “More services” on the left menu, and you’ll find it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-1.png"></a></p>
<p>Click on it, and the next blade will open to something to this effect:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-2.png"></a></p>
<p>As Jeff’s post <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2016/09/12/the-azuread-admin-experience-in-the-new-azure-portal-is-now-in-public-preview/">explains</a>, the landing page offers lots of interesting insights on your Azure AD tenant, and various hooks for management actions.</p>
<p>Just for kicks, let’s take a look at the Azure AD landing page in the old portal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-3.png"></a></p>
<p>The first thing that jumps to the eye: the old portal shows both VibroDirectory, the Azure AD tenant tied to my Azure subscription, and OsakaMVPDirectory, a test tenant I created when I visited Japan a couple of years ago (I need an excuse to get back there…awesome place, awesome people). That’s because the user I am signed in with, <a href="mailto:vibro@cloudidentity.net">vibro@cloudidentity.net</a>, is a user (more: an admin) in both tenants.<br>
I can easily choose what tenant I want to manage by clicking the corresponding entry.</p>
<p>How do I achieve the same effect in portal.azure.com? Simple. See that user badge on the top right corner, informing you about what user and tenant are you currently signed in with? Click on it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-4.png"></a></p>
<p>Together with the usual account operations you expect to find there, you’ll also notice that all the tenants accessible by your user will be available for you to choose. Let’s see what happens if I select OsakaMVPDirectory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-5.png"></a></p>
<p>Voila’! The portal changed to reflect the new tenant. As you can see, the landing page is far more barren… I’ve used that tenant just for playing a bit with Azure AD, nothing more.</p>
<p>In fact, this is far more barren than you would probably expect from something displayed in an Azure portal… and here there’s the kicker: that’s because this tenant has no Azure subscription associated to it! Don’t believe me? Click on all subscriptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-6.png"></a></p>
<p>That’s right. This is huge, so let me rephrase to make sure you appreciate the implications:</p>
<p>You now have a portal you can use to manage Azure AD tenants that are NOT associated to an Azure subscription.</p>
<p>The office developers among you are probably jumping up and down right now  go ahead, try it! Navigate to portal.azure.com and sign in with your office dev account for your Office tenant, I’l wait. See? that’s awesome!</p>
<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Having Azure AD capabilities alongside all the other Azure services you are using in your solution is a huge advantage in itself and I am in no way trying to minimize that. I am just excited that the Azure AD development portal capabilities are no longer strictly subordinated to that.</p>
<p>Enough of this – let’s take a look at the meat of the developer features: application creation and editing.</p>
 App creation and editing 
<p>Let’s go back to the Azure AD landing page on portal.azure.com. Where are the developer features? If you thought “Enterprise applications” – sorry, no bonus. The developer features are all available behind the sibylline moniker “App registrations”. Click on it, and you’ll find yourself on the following blade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-7.png"></a></p>
<p>Those are all the apps created in this tenant – that is applications for which the Application entity resides on this very tenant.<br>
Let’s compare with the same view on the old portal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-8.png"></a></p>
<p>Some important differences jump to the eye:</p>
 
 The default view in the old portal lists apps I created in that tenant (“KatanaWAAD_W8ClientSample” – prehistory!!!) and also preintegrated apps (such as Google Apps, American Airlines) and multitenant apps acquired from my other test tenants. The new portal, as mentioned, only lists apps developed in this tenant. 
 The new portal lists the application IDs, which are in fact the clientID you would find in your code for identifying the app; that should make it easier to find an entry for an app for which you have nothing but the code. 
 The search field in the new portal is live – the list of apps adjusts in real time as you type the search string. I love it. 
 
<p>Let’s pick one app and see how it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-9.png"></a></p>
<p>The first blade, Essentials, presents a quick summary of the main properties of the app. The settings blade, which opens automatically as soon as you select the app, corrals all the app properties in a neat set of categories. There’s even a nice search field that will show you in which bucket you’ll find the property you need.<br>
Nearly all the old properties are there: the rather large image below shows the mapping between old and new. I recommend you click on the pic to display the full image.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PortalMapping.png"></a></p>
<p>Most notably, the dev features in the new portal do not offer any of the operations that would affect the ServicePrincipal of your app – that is to say, the instance of the app in your own tenant. In the old portal, creating an app meant both creating an Application object (the blueprint of your app) and provisioning that app right away in your own tenant. In the new portal, creating an app means just creating the blueprint, the Application. The user assignment, app role assignments etc are available in the admin portion of the portal – but you’ll be able to use those against your app only if you do provision it in your own tenant after creation.<br>
If you want to provision your app in your own tenant: you need to run it, attempt signing in with one user from your tenant with the right privileges, and granting consent when prompted. That will lead to the provisioning of the app, that is to say the creation of the ServicePrincipal in your tenant and the assignment of the permissions you consented to (VERY detailed description of the process in this <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473127">free chapter</a>).</p>
<p>There are lots of neat features tucked in those options, especially in the ones that have been historically difficult to deal with in the old portal. Let’s take a look at my two favorites: permission management and manifest editing.</p>
<p>If you go to the Required permissions blade (finally a good name) and click on Add, you’ll find yourself at the beginning of a nice guided experience:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-10.png"></a></p>
<p>Clicking on Select an API, I get to a clean list of what’s available – even including a search box.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-11.png"></a></p>
<p>Let’s click on the Microsoft Graph and hit Select.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-12.png"></a></p>
<p>Now, isn’t that super neat! You get a nice list of permissions, subdivided by application and delegated… and you even get indications on what permissions can only be consented by administrators vs all users! Personally, the colors give me cognitive dissonance: as a developer who isn’t often an admin, the permissions requiring admin consent are the problematic ones. But! The information is there, and that wasn’t the case before.</p>
<p>The other feature I really like, and I am sure it will be your favorite too, is the inline editing of the manifest.<br>
Azure AD applications have lots of settings that can’t be accessed via portal – and sometimes, it’s just better to be able cut &amp; paste settings directly. For that purpose, the old portal offered the ability to download the app manifest (a JSON dump of the Application object, really), edit it locally, and re-upload it to apply changes.<br>
In the new portal, however, you can edit the manifest in place – no need to go through the download-edit-upload cycle! You can access the feature by going back to the Essentials blade and clicking on Edit manifest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/image-13.png"></a></p>
<p>There’s even some rudimentary auto completion support, which is great for people like myself with non-existing memory for keywords.</p>
 Try it out! 
<p>As diligently reported by the header of each and every blade, this stuff is still in preview. Your input is always super valuable – the right place to provide it in this case is in the ‘Admin Portal’ section of our <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/category/162510-admin-portal">feedback forum</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll enjoy this feature as much as I plan to enjoy shedding my old portal complex and finally use portal.azure.com at the next conference… which by the way it’s just 10 days away! <a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/3087">See you in Atlanta</a> </p>

<p>The following is an attempt to stomp out the seemingly endless FUD that circulates about Web Components, most of which is purely manufactured by attacking tangential, opinionated choices of frameworks that happen to use Web Components in a way that differs from the opinions of other frameworks.</p>
 Level Setting 
<p>Don’t let me catch you claiming a Web Component is anything but the following, or I’ll send Kam Chancellor to lay you out:</p>
<blockquote><p>Web Components are an amalgam of APIs from two W3C specs (Custom Elements and Shadow DOM) that enable the creation of encapsulated, declarative, custom elements, which serve as standard, reusable, interoperable vehicles of discrete, stateless functionality.</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
 Myth 1: “Web Components are at odds with Framework X” 
<p>This is probably the most fallacious statement about Web Components.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As long as a framework writes to the DOM (which all major ones do), there is no reason it can’t include Web Components or update a Custom Element with data and state changes (as opposed to an amorphous tree of rando divs).</p>
<p>Let’s say I have a single page React app that’s a clock, where you select a timezone and the clock UI reflects the right time – here’s what I would do:</p>
<p>Write the actual clock element as a Web Component. All this <code>&lt;x-clock&gt;</code> element needs to do is understand one attribute, for example <code>data-zone</code>, that specifies which timezone to display, and print out a clock UI showing the correct time. It shouldn’t be aware of anything else about the app – this shit just tells time, yo. From here you can Reactify the living hell out of everything else (your route handling, how you save the state of the selected timezone, etc.) without ever having to hard-bind the <code>&lt;x-clock&gt;</code> element’s definition code to a framework.</p>
<p>When you follow this pattern, you end up with elements of discrete functionality that can survive a change in framework, data/change management library, storage adapter, etc., and still develop your app with the framework or library of your choosing. Oh, and you also get to feel like a good Web Citizen, because that <code>&lt;x-clock&gt;</code> component you made is now available for use across the entire web, without requiring someone to have advanced programming experience or worship at the Church of Framework X.</p>
 Myth 2: “If I want to use Web Components, I have to use HTML Imports” 
<p>I’m not going to spend much time on this because it’s so blatantly false.</p>
<p>HTML Imports is a proposed standard for importing an HTML document and its includes into a parent context. If you want to bundle your JS and CSS files into an HTML Import, go ahead, but Web Components are just JS and CSS files that have no dependency on how you include them in an app.</p>
 Myth 3: “Web Components require me to change my packaging system” 
<p>As previously stated: Web Components simply provide you two JS APIs (Custom Elements and Shadow DOM) with which you can define new elements and register them for use in your app. This means all a Web Component requires is a JS and CSS file; for multiple components you can concatenate them together, like you would any other includes (note: if you choose write your CSS in JS, you obviously wouldn’t need a CSS file)</p>
<p>Because this is just regular ol’ JS and CSS, don’t go chasing new packaging waterfalls on account of Web Components, you can stick to the packaging rivers and lakes that you’re used to.</p>
 Myth 4: “Web Components aren’t declarative” 
<p>This is perhaps the most mythstifying of all, given Web Components literally enable the end user to write declarative HTML markup extended with Custom Element tags. Frameworks like React (w/ JSX) are great if you prefer them, but in terms of categorization, something like JSX is a non-native, pseudo-declarative DSL with embedded logic hooks, vs the native, purely declarative markup of Custom Element tags written in regular ol’ HTML.</p>
 Myth 5: “Web Components aren’t compatible with JSX, they only accept string values!” 
<p>If you’re using a DSL markup layer like JSX, there’s no technical reason why a system like that can’t interoperate with Web Components. A conversation on Twitter with various folks in the ecosystem prompted me to address this myth. During the conversation someone noted the basic flow of JSX to React imperative code and asked how it would look with a Web Component. Here’s the pure JSX/React we started with:</p>
 // This JSX Markup:


// Turns into this imperative React code:
React.createElement(Foo, { bar: 1 }),
 
<p>The question was how the above code would look if JSX was to support and interoperate with Web Components. The key requirement is any object type must be able to be passed to a Web Component. This isn’t an issue, as Web Components (and HTML elements in general) natively support methods and getters/setters, in addition to attributes. This means that you could route any type of an object to a Web Component from a JSX context as follows:</p>
 // This JSX Markup:


// Turns into this imperative code:
var foo = document.createElement('x-foo');
foo.bar = 1;
 
<p>Whether or not JSX is already written to detect and reflect data to Web Components via setters/methods is immaterial – the point is: it should be trivial to detect a Custom Element token in the JSX parser and pass data to its corresponding instance. I have inquired about where in the React/JSX lib code this data relay takes place, and I am willing to help modify the code so Web Components can be seamlessly included.</p>
 Myth Status: BUSTED 
<p>So now that we’ve got all that straight, I encourage you to never utter these myths again.</p>

 WSO2 G-Reg 5.3.0 is the latest release version of Governance Registry product.  <br>  In a&nbsp;vanilla pack all the thumbnails are rendered to be&nbsp;default&nbsp;to an unique color and the first letter of the asset name.  <br>  But if someone wants to customize this thumbnail here are the steps.  <br>  In this post I will explain how to change the thumbnail of a particular asset type, namely I will take 'reserservice' type as an example.  <br>  Let's say we want to change all the&nbsp;occurrences&nbsp;of thumbnails of 'restservice' type to a custom image icon shown below.   <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CJa1qzxd-UU/V7Fa_E86QYI/AAAAAAAAEIM/cLtM1r8yliQcJdHT_dOQbs3eX9yDEav4wCK4B/s1600/api-thumbnail.png"></a>  api-thumbnail.png  <br>   <br> <br>  Let's start with copying desired thumbnail icon to following location where&nbsp;&lt;asset-type&gt; refers to the interested type.<br><br> [HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/&lt;asset-type&gt;/themes/default/imgs/ <br> Ex: I have added api_thumbnail.png into<br>[HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/default/imgs/<br> <br>   Consider Details page of an asset. By default it looks like below image.    <br>   <br>To change the thumbnail of this page to the custom image refer the newly added image from<br><br>  [HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/default/partials/view-asset-top-common-container.hbs file.&nbsp;<br>If you already don't have&nbsp;view-asset-top-common-container.hbs&nbsp;in location take a copy of&nbsp;<br>[HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/app/greg-publisher-defaults/themes/default/partials/view-asset-top-common-container.hbs<br>into<br>[HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/default/partials/view-asset-top-common-container.hbs&nbsp;<br> <br>  It is default to below<br><blockquote>&lt;div class="ast-name-icon"&gt;{{this.nameToChar}}&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>  Change it to<br><blockquote> &lt;div class="ast-name-icon"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;img alt="thumbnail" class="square-element img-thumbnail" src='{{url ""}}/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/default/imgs/api_thumbnail.png'&gt;<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br></blockquote> And change the style configurations to align the custom image nicely. I have removed &nbsp;style="background: {{this.uniqueColor}}" from parent div as well.<br><br>Now<br>[HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/default/partials/view-asset-top-common-container.hbs looks like below.<br><br><br><blockquote> {{#with assets}}  &nbsp;

 In some Governance use cases where we want to selectively attach a lifecycle for an artifact based on some custom logic.  Currently we attach a lifecycle for an artifact using below methods.    Configuring in RXT.    Configuring in asset.js using the properties(ex: meta.lifecycle.name) explained in <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/ES200/asset.configure+Property+Definitions">here</a>     This is inherited from ES     Manually attach lifecycles from Management console    <br>  As of now we only have option 3. to cater this requirement of selectively attaching a lifecycle.  But we need to automate that.  We can do this in two ways.    Incorporate a custom handler to intercept artifact put method.    Override asset.js ‘attachLifecycle’ method via publisher's asset extension.    <br>  In this blogpost I will explain how to achive this using above method 2.Override asset.js ‘attachLifecycle’ method via publisher's asset extension  <br>  As a sample let’s consider ‘soapservice’ artifact type in Governance Center.  <br>    Remove Lifecycle reference from the soapservice rxt.    i.e: remove &lt;lifecycle&gt;ServiceLifeCycle&lt;/lifecycle&gt; from <a href="https://github.com/wso2/carbon-governance/blob/ee2b5c497c6d11da9308602873e5ccdcaa64f0dd/features/extensions/org.wso2.carbon.registry.extensions.server.feature/resources/rxts/soapservice.rxt#L22">soapservice.rxt</a>     Override ‘attachLifecycle’ method in [GREG_HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/publisher/extensions/assets/soapservice/asset.js asset.manager section.    Ex: add new method ‘attachLifecycle’ <a href="https://github.com/wso2/product-greg/blob/release-5.1.0-rc1/modules/es-extensions/publisher/asset/soapservice/asset.js#L353">there</a> to override the default behaviour implemented in <a href="https://github.com/wso2/carbon-store/blob/8a4461882718cd069b2d55d200b099c62e884959/jaggery-modules/rxt/module/scripts/asset/asset.js#L1434">here</a> <br><br><blockquote><br><br>  asset.manager = function(ctx) {  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postCreate:function(){   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attachLifecycle:function(asset, lifecycle){   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var lifecycle = “”;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* write your custom logic to populate lifecycle   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** asset object that comes into this method has all the content of the artifact instance   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** there for you can implement a custom logic based on values of artifact metadata as well */ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (lifecycle == '') {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return success;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.am.attachLifecycle(lifecycle, asset);   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; success = true;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } catch (e) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //handle exception   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return success;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}   &nbsp;&nbsp;}  };  . . . . .  . . . . .  </blockquote>

 Blockchain Scalability 
<p>Developers of apps and services, blockchain-based or not, must always consider efficiency and scalability in determining how to best serve the needs of their users. This is especially true when you add new or emerging technologies to the equation. In the realm of blockchain-based apps and services, scalability considerations are magnified by the distributed nature of the underlying system.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the unique guarantees of a blockchain, transactions must be processed with a mechanism that ensures consensus,&nbsp;then&nbsp;propagated across the network. These constraints introduce three major scalability challenges:</p>
 
 Propagation over a distributed system 
 Consensus processing of transactions 
 Data duplication size and cost 
 
<p></p>
 Transaction Rate 
<p>Currently there are two main blockchains: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Neither of these large-scale blockchain implementations publicly exceed double digits in per-second transaction rates. While various members of the blockchain community are experimenting with Proof of Stake and Sharding, which could theoretically push transaction rates “into the millions per second”, these additions introduce new constraints and network characteristics that could impact how developers write apps and services.</p>
<p>But let’s assume blockchains could&nbsp;process millions of transactions per second – is that enough? The real question is:&nbsp;“How many transactions per second would we need for an on-chain world of people, apps, services, and devices?”</p>
<p>To answer that, imagine a world where organic and inorganic entities are generating frequent, on-chain transactions – here are a few examples of transaction sources:</p>
 
 Billions of people each generating transactions throughout the day 
 Hundreds of millions of IoT devices triggering transactions 
 Millions of apps, services, and bots performing background transactions 
 
<p>When you consider the breathtaking enormity of the scale, it’s hard to precisely quantify a lower bound, but BILLIONS of transactions per second may be conservative.</p>
<p></p>
 Transaction-related&nbsp;Computation 
<p>Another scalability consideration is the fact that transactions on some blockchains trigger consensus-based computation of programmatic ‘contracts’. While this is a neat feature, it also incurs a significant&nbsp;cost that must be borne by nodes on the network.</p>
<p>Ethereum devs themselves are open about the fundamental performance limitations of these contract computations:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Clearly Ethereum is not about optimizing efficiency of computation. Its parallel processing is redundantly parallel. This is to offer an efficient way to reach consensus on the system state without needing trusted third parties, oracles or violence monopolies. But importantly they are not there for optimal computation. The fact that contract executions are redundantly replicated across nodes, naturally makes them expensive, which generally creates an incentive not to use the blockchain for computation that can be done off-chain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>(I want you to remember the word <code>off-chain</code>, it’s going to come up a lot)</p>
 Data Storage 
<p>Blockchains do not allow much data to be embedded&nbsp;within their transactions, and rightly so, because duplicating &nbsp;data across a significant number of nodes is a non-starter when you’re talking about billions of transactions per second. In fact, at those transactional rates – even with strict&nbsp;transactional data limits, pruning, &nbsp;and aggressive transaction aggregation – the network would still generate hundreds of&nbsp;petabytes&nbsp;of data annually. This would likely reduce the number of full nodes in the network, and the widespread replication of blockchain transactional data that goes with it.</p>
 Consider the Following 
<p>The most common way of developing decentralized apps and services with blockchain tech is to create a digital record of source&nbsp;data, link it to an on-chain blockchain transaction via a hash of the data +&nbsp;timestamp, then store the source data off-chain somewhere. Let’s call this method the Blockchain Transactional Model.</p>
<p>But what does this model really provide?</p>
 
 The on-chain transaction provides a rough timestamp based on when it is added to the chain. 
 The hash embedded in the transaction records the state of off-chain data, but does not provide storage of that data. 
 Both 1 and 2 are synced to the global ledger, and off-chain data can be validated against the embedded hash. 
 
<p>What if I told you blockchain-anchored identity could provide a more efficient means to achieve the majority of off-chain use-cases? I submit the following for your consideration:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most non-monetary blockchain use-cases can be accomplished off-chain using a combination of blockchain-anchored identity, cryptographic signatures, and traditional storage systems – all while retaining the features developers desire and avoiding the scalability issues of on-chain transactions.</p></blockquote>
 Identity – The Red Pill 
<p>There are known choke points in the transmission, computation, and storage of on-chain transactions that make the Blockchain Transactional Model prohibitive at high&nbsp;levels of transactional load. But what does that mean for the promise of decentralized apps and services – is blockchain still the solution?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but you’ll need to free your mind.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently working on an open source system that will enable cross-blockchain registrations of identifiers for self-sovereign identities. Think of it like a transparent, open source, blockchain-based naming and identity layer for the world. Users will own their identities and can prove ownership based on control of a private key linked to a known identifier.</p>
 <p></p>
 
<p>A&nbsp;blockchain-based identity can be used to represent any type of entity, including: people, apps, services, companies, government agencies, etc.</p>
 
 
<p>Regardless of the non-monetary decentralized app or service use-case – rental agreement,&nbsp;supply chain system, car title transfer, or any other attestation – it all boils down to three key features:</p>
 
 Capturing the state of data 
 Logging time of occurrence 
 Verifying the participation of all parties involved 
 
<p>It turns out we can accomplish all three of these by having various parties to an action sign a payload comprised of source data, the state of that data, the time of occurrence (if relevant), and proof of participation using their globally verifiable, blockchain-based identity.</p>
 Use-Case: Renting an Apartment 
<p>Let’s&nbsp;compare how non-monetary, blockchain-based use-cases are handled under the Blockchain Transactional Model, vs handling them entirely off-chain via the Blockchain Identity Model. Imagine Jane wants to&nbsp;rent an apartment from Bill – here’s how that plays out under each model:</p>
 Blockchain Transactional Model (On-Chain) 
<p></p>
 Result: 
 
 A blockchain is used to record a hash of a rental agreement document and meta data – a scale bottleneck at higher transaction rates. 
 You must be online to commit a transaction to a blockchain – a blocker for many use-cases that demand quick resolution. 
 Bill and Jane have forced a huge, distributed consensus system to store a hash of the rental agreement only they are interested in – introduces scale problems&nbsp;without providing a clear benefit. 
 Bill and Jane still must save and maintain the original rental agreement document if it is ever needed for verification or inspection, because a hash alone is just a proof of state – it doesn’t escape off-chain data maintenance. 
 Bill and Jane are still required to prove that they each signed the rental document, which either requires traditional means of verification or a system of verifiable, digital identity – identity is an ever-present issue. 
 
 Blockchain Identity Model (Off-Chain): 
 <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/identity-rental-agreement-flow.svg"></a><p></p>
  Result: 
 
 Use of a blockchain is only required once for each participant to register their identity, which can happen prior to this entire use-case taking place,  yay, it scales! 
 Bill and Jane don’t have to worry about the cost, hassle, and delay in broadcasting a transaction to a huge, distributed consensus system, while retaining all the features they wanted from the on-chain model –&nbsp;less blockchain is more in many cases. 
 Bill and Jane still save their agreement payload off-chain, just as with the Blockchain Transactional Model, but instead the payload contains everything they need: the source document, data state hash, and identity signatures for verification&nbsp;— fewer moving parts and no added burden. 
 Bill and Jane can now complete this entire use-case with standard, scalable systems, even while offline, then sync the payload to the secure storage services of their choice – more flexibility with less complexity. 
 
 Implications 
<p>Blockchain-based identity should cause you to question&nbsp;core assumptions around modeling and implementation of decentralized app and service use-cases. As a result, you should ask whether or not your use-case truly requires on-chain transactions. Here are a few important points to take away from this post:</p>
 
 The scalability issues with blockchains are an irrelevant mirage for the majority of decentralized&nbsp;app and service use-cases. 
 Hashes or Merkle Roots stored on the blockchain may be valuable&nbsp;in certain unique situations where no combination of identity signatures can be trusted and there is no viable third-party witness, like a Notary Public or a government agency. 
 We can build scalable, decentralized apps and services today by enabling entities to sign off-chain payloads with blockchain-based identities. 
 
 Determining On-Chain vs Off-Chain 
<p>Here is a little pseudo-code test to help you determine whether to use the off-chain Blockchain Identity Model or the on-chain Blockchain Transactional Model:</p>
 <code>
if (selfAsserted || groupSigsAreTrusted || canBeAttestedByNeutralParty) {
  useOffChainIdentitySignatures();
}
else {
  anchorItOnChain();
}
</code> 
 Feature Comparison 
<p>Last but not least, here’s a feature breakdown of the two models:</p>



Features
Traditional<br>(On-Chain)
Identity<br>(Off-Chain)




~Unlimited&nbsp;scalability




Eliminates&nbsp;the need for off-chain storage&nbsp;




Transactions are verifiable without middlemen&nbsp;




Solves identity verification&nbsp;




Reuses existing systems and tools&nbsp;




Doesn't require learning new languages




Not tied to any one blockchain&nbsp;

<p>There were many areas of standardization discussed that touched on blockchain-based identity systems, but perhaps the most specific, actionable area of standardization the group identified was extension of the existing <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webauthn-20160531/">Web Auth spec</a> to include the APIs, features, and flows necessary to enable blockchain-based identity authentication in browsers. This is something I will begin to explore with other implementers and interested organizations from the W3C workshop who committed to do so with us.</p>
<p>The workshop was a great opportunity to start an important discussion about systems that could move the Web far beyond what it is today. I look forward to reporting back on the progress of our explorations as we move forward!</p>

The SOLiD Server [1] is a later generation of the personal data store rww.io described in Dr. Andrei Sambra's Dissertation [2] and implemented as part of CIMBA or Client-Integrated MicroBlogging Application [3].<br><br>CIMBA decoupled the front end of the web application from the back end data such that the data can exist on any server and the front end application can exist on another server. Sandro Hawke posted several videos beginning with the title "Building Social Applications with Linked Data Platform (LDP) -- Crosscloud"<br>Part 2 of this video series [4] shows a demonstration of CIMBA by Dr. Andrei Sambra.<br><br>Although CIMBA was targeted towards microblogging, the personal data store can be targeted at any front end application. For microblogging, and other applications, a special standard pattern is developed that utilizes the linked data platform [5],[6].<br><br>SOLiD, a platform&nbsp; that gained a lot of energy in mid-2015 with the Crosscloud project [7], is described on GitHub [8] and serves as a foundation in the initiative. It follows the Linked Data Platform standard that is used to build the LDP server Apache Marmotta [9] and in Fedora 4 in Islandora [10] for organizing library collections, amongst other things. One thing that is unique about SOLiD is its use of the WebID URI in the authentication and authorization process.<br><br>Athough many implementations of SOLiD exist [11], the one with present significant effort is for Node.js. This is available through the link at [1].<br><br>In a previous post [15], the use of databox.me to create a WebID, client certificate, and private key was presented. This is useful for authenticating as a user to a SOLiD based server and authorizing the user to access resources through the access control language [12].<br><br>In order to launch our own SOLiD server, we need a server side certificate to support HTTPS in order to verify the servers integrity to the client [13]. We could run it without TLS/SSL, that is over HTTP, but this is risky. For proof of this, the author has run a SOLiD server (previously called ldnode) with a Linked Data File Manager called WARP [14]; and achieved an environment on localhost (i.e. on the local machine) that looked very similar to rww.io when it was operational.<br><br>Fortunately, the README for node-solid-server [1] goes into how to set this up. We already created a client side certificate and private key with databox.me and stored it in our browser. The public personal profile document&nbsp; created upon databox.me signup and used for FOAF+SSL authentication is available at http://bshambaugh.databox.me/profile/card .<br><br> <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GnfqDhhOFxE/V2k1tpX_bgI/AAAAAAAABEI/zeNV3oHTwfAoaDopIi2q-fWOQFW_C0izwCLcB/s1600/bshambaughdataboxmeprofile.png"></a> We could have a similar setup elsewhere as the requirement for FOAF+SSL is that we have RDF somewhere that points a WebID to a public key (in this case, modulus and exponent) along with the following in the browser:&nbsp; a client certificate in the form of the previous databox.me post along with the corresponding private key. <br><br>To create the server side certificate (as opposed to the client side certificate to authenticate an entity with a WebID)&nbsp; to allow the SOLiD server to serve itself over HTTPS we have multiple options. We could purchase one online signed by a root certificate authority [16], obtain a free one through a service like letsencrypt [17], or create our own self-signed certificate with openssl (or the like).<br><br>Since we are testing SOLiD locally, lets try using a server side certificate. The README [1] suggests the following commands:<br><br> <code>openssl genrsa 2048 &gt; ../localhost.key</code>  <code>&nbsp;</code>  <code>openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 3650 -key ../localhost.key -subj '/CN=*.localhost' &gt; ../localhost.cert</code> <br>This creates a private key called localhost.key and a certificate called localhost.cert in the directory above the local one. I went ahead and added the extension .pem to both of them since they are already in the PEM [18] format.<br><br>cp localhost.key localhost.key.pem<br>cp localhost.cert localhost.cert.pem<br><br>Now that we have our server certificates, we need to have node-solid-server running. In order to do this, we need Node.js v6.&nbsp; I chose to also have the latest version of Ubuntu, 16.04 to run Node. N.B: I was running with Ubuntu 12.04 before but I discovered that this required a special configuration as the version of g++ included with the distribution did not support some of the recent additions in v8 requiring me to configure for another C compiler [19].<br><br>I found the instructions at Digital Ocean useful [20], specifically the section titled "How To Install Using NVM" .<br><br>Once I have Node.js Installed I can install node solid server. I do this by following the instructions in the README [1]. Specifically:<br><br> npm install -g solid-server  &nbsp;   Now that I have solid server installed with the -g flag (which means I can access it globally) I can tell it about my server side certificates. There are two ways to do this.<br>I can either use the solid-server installation to create a json file to point to them, or I can tell solid about then at each startup.<br><br>To create the json [21] file I use the following command:<br><br> solid init  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br><br><br><br>I then follow by pressing enter for each input request except for those that prompt with a y/N option or a path the SSL private key or SSL certificate.<br><br>For the y/N options I select y (at least for "Enable WebID authentication"). For the path to the SSL certificate and SSL key I point to the relative path to them. Since the ones I created were in the present directory where initiated solid with "solid init" then they are simply localhost.key (or localhost.key.pem) and localhost.cert (or localhost.cert.pem or localhost.crt.pem, or localhost.crt) .<br><br> <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CH3iPce673Y/V2levgnU07I/AAAAAAAABEg/pCaS7I7DJNQEESy-G0CSWkdexWK47oh0ACLcB/s1600/solidinitpt1.png"></a><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ubaGxbHTpvc/V2le0FoEszI/AAAAAAAABEo/d0iF6sdQkRwW4d7lHC4nVL4EH29N-I5ZgCLcB/s1600/solidinitpt2.png"></a> <br>Going through this process creates a file called config.json . After this I can go ahead and start the solid server from the same directory using the command:<br><br><br> solid start <br><br><br>Alternatively, I may want to avoid&nbsp; using the config.json file and pass everything in as an input parameter in the shell at startup. I found it effective to delete the config.json file (if it exists) before trying this.<br><br>solid start ---port 8443 --ssl-key localhost.key.pem --ssl-cert localhost.cert.pem \<br>--webid -v<br><br>I am specifying port 8443, localhost.key.pem as private key for my server certificate, localhost.cert.pem as the server certificate, use of webid based authentication with --webid, and verbose output in the shell with -v . <br><br><br>[1] https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server<br>[2] https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00917965/document<br>[3] http://crosscloud.org/2014/iswc-sambra-pdf.pdf<br>[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtnB7aM1mTM<br>[5] https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/<br>[6] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yth7O6yeZRE&amp;t=1h34m50s<br>[7] http://crosscloud.org/<br>[8] https://github.com/solid/solid<br>[9] http://marmotta.apache.org/ <br>[10] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wTFAwvBRbY <br>[11] http://crosscloud.org/2016/www-mansour-pdf.pdf<br>[12] https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl<br>[13] http://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/ <br>[14] https://github.com/linkeddata/warp<br>[15] http://adistributedeconomy.blogspot.com/2016/06/creating-client-side-certificate.html <br>[16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate<br>[17] https://letsencrypt.org/<br>[18] http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/<br>[19] https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/OLDER_DISTROS.md <br>[20] https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04<br>[21] http://json.org/

These all have to do with the cert vocabulary ( http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert# ) . Upon review of cryptography [3] [4], I note that this means I have the modulus and exponent of an RSA Public Key expressed in terms of the cert vocabulary.&nbsp;  <br>  The modulus and exponent give me the public key, and vice versa.

<p>Since I first left public service last year and then returned, I have been regularly asked about my perspective on the state of the U.S. Government’s public facing shared service infrastructure for identity services. For a long time, I have lacked the words given my past investments of time, energy and emotion in those efforts.</p>

 “The Hammer’s Coming Down” 
<p>In my work with open source blockchains, distributed hash tables, and peer-to-peer systems in the area of identity, I have run across people making this statement from time to time, often in an effort to minimize open source, decentralized, distributed systems vs their centralized or proprietary counterparts:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The data on these decentralized, distributed systems will only be persistently available if people continue to run them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>These folks often add:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is a serious concern because the people running these systems must have an economic incentive to keep them running.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve never spent more than an eye-roll of my time on people who make these statements because they’re pure fallacy, but a random assault committed on my eardrums (Britney Spears – Oops I Did it Again) in the admission line at Google I/O 2016 inspired me to finally drop the hammer on this FUD. I’m sure you’re wondering how Britney Spears, Nickelback, and fallacious statements about decentralized, distributed systems are all related: slow your roll, I’ll get there.</p>
<p></p>
 “Believe It, or Not” 
<p>Let me channel my inner-<a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/626879919989985280">@pmarca</a> for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am hearing disturbing rumors that a system’s data won’t be unavailable if no one is running it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow, what a profound thought! While that is technically true, it’s also the <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/117/Least_Plausible_Hypothesis">Least Plausible Hypothesis</a> for why data on a decentralized, distributed system with any traction, scale, or utility would suddenly become irrecoverable.</p>
 “Remind Me” 
<p>The craziest part about these statements is how absolutely backwards they are when used to target decentralized, distributed systems vs others. Perhaps the folks who emit this brand of truthiness need a reminder about the reality of their claim: A centralized or proprietary system is just as likely to go dark for any number of reasons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Disturbingly (not really), you can no longer access these systems (though some have been archived by various sites):</p>
 
 GeoCities 
 AltaVista 
 Yahoo Auctions 
 Friendster 
 Google Wave 
 etc. etc. ad infinitum 
 
<p>For whatever reason, a person might be inclined to gravitate toward centralized or proprietary systems because they believe them to be more trustworthy, secure, or permanent, but that is far from a reliable truth. In fact, centralized or proprietary systems can be worse for many reason, including:</p>
 
 Shutdown can happen more abruptly, sometimes without notice 
 Proprietary system shutdown is often permanent 
 Centralized and proprietary systems usually have a single arbiter that decides their fate 
 Almost without exception they are driven by revenue, sometimes at the expense of users 
 
<p>In contrast, decentralized, distributed systems with significant traction, scale, or utility:</p>
 
 Are very difficult to shut down abruptly – most if not all nodes need to go dark 
 Can be restarted by anyone in the community with copies of the data 
 Are not subject to the shutdown whims of a single arbiter 
 May persist because parties have a principled or personal desire to ensure they do 
 
 The Nickelback Persistence Conjecture 
<p></p>
<p>Now we get to the fun part. How does one articulate to someone deeply skeptical of open source, decentralized, distributed systems, such as a blockchain, that their data will not vanish suddenly? How does one rebut the statement that these systems must rely on unsustainable economic interests for anyone to run them?</p>
<p>After hearing that Britney Spears song at Google I/O, I wondered: “Is this noise pollution still available on decentralized systems (torrents, etc.) after this long?” When I got home I decided to up the ante in my search for long-lasting, distributed trash, so I chose to base my conjecture on the poster child of musical eye-rolling: Nickelback. Not many people like Nickelback, and that’s great, because those who are circulating its songs on a peer network are probably doing so out of some unnatural affection for them or specific self-interest. As it turns out, I took a look and found that Nickelback’s songs are still available on peer networks 20 years after they first appeared. Herein lies the conjecture I present to you, without further delay:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mean duration that data will remain persistently available on an open source, decentralized, distributed system that reaches at least the size, popularity, or acolyte following of Nickelback, is roughly equal to the time period from which Nickelback’s songs first became available to the day no peer nodes remain that circulate their ‘music’.</p></blockquote>
 “It’s Over” 
<p>“Never Again” let one of these purveyors of persistence FUD keep you up “Into the Night” thinking about if “Today Was Your Last Day” to access the data you have stored on an open source, decentralized, distributed system.</p>

 SPA woes 
<p>For some time now I have wanted the ability to route paths for a <code>gh-pages</code> site to its <code>index.html</code> for handling as a single-page app. This ability is table stakes for single-page apps because you need all requests to be routed to one HTML file, unless you want to copy the same file across all your routes every time you make a change to your project. Currently GitHub Pages doesn’t offer a route handling solution; the Pages system is intended to be a flat, simple mechanism for serving basic project content.</p>
<p>If you weren’t aware, GitHub does provide one morsel of customization for your project site: the ability to add a <code>404.html</code> file and have it served as your custom error page. I took a first stab at doing an SPA hack by simply copying my <code>index.html</code> file and renaming the copy to <code>404.html</code>. Turns out many folks have experienced the same issue with GitHub Pages and liked the general idea: <a href="https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/730558238458937344">https://twitter.com/csuwildcat/status/730558238458937344</a>. The issue that some folks on Twitter correctly raised was that the <code>404.html</code> page is still served with a status code of 404, which is no bueno for crawlers. The gauntlet had been thrown down, but I decided to answer, and answer with vigor!</p>
 One more time, with feeling 
<p>After sleeping on it, I thought to myself: “Self, we’re deep in fuck-it territory, so why don’t I make this hack even dirtier?!”  To that end, I developed an even better hack that provides the same functionality and simplicity, while also preserving your site’s crawler juice – and you don’t even need to waste time copying your <code>index.html</code> file to a <code>404.html</code> file anymore! The following solution should work in all modern desktop and mobile browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari), and Internet Explorer 10+.</p>
<p>Template &amp; Demo: If you want to skip the explanation and get the goods, here’s a <a href="https://github.com/csuwildcat/sghpa">template repo</a> (<a href="https://github.com/csuwildcat/sghpa">https://github.com/csuwildcat/sghpa</a>), and a test URL to see it in action: <a href="https://csuwildcat.github.io/sghpa/foo/bar">https://csuwildcat.github.io/sghpa/foo/bar</a></p>
<p></p>
 That’s so META 
<p>The first thing I did was investigate other options for getting the browser to redirect to the <code>index.html</code> page. That part was pretty straight forward, you basically have three options: server config, JavaScript <code>location</code> manipulation, or a meta refresh tag. The first one is obviously a no-go for GitHub pages, and JavaScript is basically the same as a refresh, but arguably worse for crawler indexing, so that leaves us with the meta tag. Setting a meta tag with a refresh of 0 <a href="http://sebastians-pamphlets.com/google-and-yahoo-treat-undelayed-meta-refresh-as-301-redirect/">appears to be treated as a 301 redirect</a> by search engines, which works out well for this use-case.</p>
<p>You’ll need to start by adding a <code>404.html</code> file to your <code>gh-pages</code> repo that contains an empty HTML document inside it – but your document must total more than 512 bytes (explained below). Next put the following markup in your <code>404.html</code> page’s <code>head</code> element:</p>
 <code>
&lt;script&gt;
  sessionStorage.redirect = location.href;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='/REPO_NAME_HERE'"&gt;&lt;/meta&gt;
</code> 
<p>This code sets the attempted entrance URL to a variable on the standard <code>sessionStorage</code> object and immediately redirects to your project’s <code>index.html</code> page using a meta refresh tag. If you’re doing a Github Organization site, don’t put a repo name in the <code>content</code> attribute replacer text, just do this: <code>content="0;URL='/'"</code></p>
 Customizing your route handling 
<p>If you want more elaborate route handling, just include some additional JavaScript logic in the script tag shown above to tweak things like: the composition of the <code>href</code> you pass to the <code>index.html</code> page, which pages should remain on the 404 page (via dynamic removal of the meta tag), and any other logic you want to put in place to dictate what content is shown based on the inbound route.</p>
 512 magical bytes: 
<p>This is hands down one of the strangest quirks I have ever encountered in web development: You must ensure the total size of your <code>404.html</code> page is greater than 512 bytes, because if it isn’t IE will disregard it and show a generic browser 404 page instead. When I finally figured this out, I had to crack a beer to help cope with the amount of time it took.</p>
 Let’s make history 
<p>In order to capture and restore the URL the user initially navigated to, you’ll need to add the following script tag to the <code>head</code> of your <code>index.html</code> page before any other JavaScript acts on the page’s current state:</p>
 
 
<p>This bit of JavaScript retrieves the URL we cached in <code>sessionStorage</code> over on the <code>404.html</code> page and replaces the current <code>history</code> entry with it. However you choose to handle things from there is up to you, but I’d use <code>popstate</code> and <code>hashchange</code> if you can.</p>
 
<p>Well folks, that’s it – now go hug it out and celebrate by writing some single-page apps on GitHub Pages!</p>

 Imagine 
<p>Jane wakes up to the sound of her alarm clock,  it’s 6:13 AM. “Oh great, what am I in for today,” she thinks. Jane’s alarm clock is normally set for 6:30 AM, but her identity agent detected a traffic accident that is projected to add 17 minutes to her commute. Jane’s identity agent, acting on her behalf, changed her alarm while she was sleeping. All three,  Jane’s identity, the identity of her alarm clock, and the identity of her agent,  are connected via a self-sovereign, decentralized, blockchain-anchored identity system.</p>
<p>Jane gets ready and grabs a yogurt from the fridge as she heads out the door. The yogurt was delivered yesterday, after her fridge detected she was out. Her fridge’s identity has been granted limited access to initiate purchases for her. In this case, Jane has opted to be notified for confirmation of any purchases her fridge initiates; yesterday Jane swiped “Confirm” when the identity management app on her phone asked if the fridge could execute a purchase of some groceries. The fridge executed a payment over the blockchain using Jane’s identity-linked blockchain wallet and the wallet linked to the grocery store’s identity. That’s right, the grocery store has a blockchain-anchored identity as well. Starting to get the picture?</p>
<p>Jane needs to get to a downtown office building where she is scheduled to meet a contact on the 12th floor. Jane doesn’t have a car, so she asks her identity agent to fetch her one by leveraging the many identity crawlers dedicated to indexing sharing economy identity data. These crawlers are always hard at work, real-time indexing the (user allowed) blockchain identity data changes of every person, place, device, and intangible entity on Earth. In this case, there are&nbsp;hundreds of drivers in&nbsp;Jane’s general vicinity who&nbsp;have granted popular ride sharing identity agents access to read and update their identity’s&nbsp;ride sharing fields. Jane uses her preferred crawler’s app to send signed, encrypted requests directly&nbsp;to providers of sharing economy services. The crawler identifies a driver whose identity shows a ride sharing status of “Available,” with a geolocation value that indicates he is close to Jane. Jane taps “Request a Ride” on the app and it immediately sends a message to the communication endpoint listed on the driver’s blockchain identity. The driver’s blockchain sharing economy app alerts him that a new ride request was received and asks whether he wants to accept. The driver accepts and is sent Jane’s current geolocation.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at her destination, Jane authorizes a payment of her driver’s identity-linked blockchain wallet. She enters the office building and heads directly for the elevators, bypassing a lengthy check-in procedure in the ground floor lobby. Jane taps her phone against an NFC pad, which instantly identifies her via a challenge/response verification of her identity assertion. The elevator system’s blockchain-anchored identity has been given access to the appointment schedules of the various software systems used by the companies that reside in the building. It uses Jane’s identity datastore to locate the appointment entry, which was created by her contact. Within this entry is a signed directive to allow Jane’s identity to access the elevator and take it to the 12th floor. Jane enters the elevator and the button for the 12th floor is already lit up. Just for fun, Jane tries hitting other buttons. But alas, she was not granted access to other floors, so the buttons don’t light up and she isn’t able to access them.</p>
<p>Jane walks up to the front desk and alerts the attendant that she has arrived for her meeting. The attendant directs her to verify her identity once more, via the guest terminal. Jane is greeted by her contact and smiles at the thought of how efficient and&nbsp;interoperable the&nbsp;world has become, thanks to the universal blockchain-based identity system.</p>
<p></p>
 Understand 
<p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed&nbsp;ledger that accounts for and stores cryptographically verifiable token ownership proofs,&nbsp;synced to computers around the globe. Blockchains represent an unprecedented opportunity to create standard, decentralized systems that handle complex activities in a more efficient, automated, programmable way than ever before. One of the most interesting applications of blockchain tech is in the area of identity. Identity has never,  never,  had a good solution. Humanity has built countless centralized systems, federation schemes, and every hybrid of the two you can imagine. With a worldwide, decentralized blockchain of identity, that all ends.</p>
<p>Each transaction on a blockchain allows for a small amount of data to be stored with it. For the purpose of identity, this data can be encoded with two things:</p>
 
 A registration for an ID (a friendly or unfriendly name), that is verifiable and indexable 
 A pointer to off-blockchain data that describes the identity attached to the ID 
 
<p>Whoever possesses the private key for one of these blockchain ID transactions controls the identity data attached to it. This allows us to do interesting things, like:</p>
 
 Lookup IDs on a cacheable index of the global ledger 
 CRUD identity data connected to an ID at real-time speed 
 Prove ownership of an ID, or verify data has been signed/sent by an ID’s owner, using standard cryptographic methods 
 
 Build 
<p>With a global blockchain of identity, we can dramatically transform almost every product or service that relies on interactions between living, non-living, and intangible things. Here are a few examples of what it will do:</p>
 
 Allows users to directly expose products or services to real-time crawlers and indexes, which can disintermediate centralized products/services in every vertical. 
 Provides a means to lookup and contact anyone on the planet via the exposure of public or private (access limited) communication endpoints 
 Simplifies service access and accounting schemes, like registering for API keys, leaky URL params, etc. 
 Provides better mechanisms for verifying access/ownership of digital goods 
 Solves the fundamental issues with provisioning, security, and access control for the IoT ecosystem 
 
<p>Here are a few developer-enabling&nbsp;features, APIs, and tools we can build into existing platforms to more rapidly realize this&nbsp;blockchain-based future:</p>
 
 Create a new protocol (chain:, bid: ?)&nbsp;that allows for CRUD and search of blockchain transactions/identities 
 Build cloud services that make blockchain identity agents, and their bots, as easy to develop as all the social/messaging bot frameworks of today 
 Develop&nbsp;new Web standards and browser features that integrate a&nbsp;more secure, more powerful blockchain-anchored system of authentication and identity into common flows, like login and request signing 
 
 
 We may want to reuse/augment some existing mechanism, like the FIDO flow, etc. 
 
<p>^ This is the future we deserve,  a standard, generative, user-sovereign world of identity that will fundamentally change the way we interface with every person and object around us.</p>

 As of the default behavior in we only show selected set of metadata of a given asset instance in the Store. But there are requirements of showing all the metadata/fields of an asset instance in the Store. In this post I am going to explain how to achieve this with GREG-5.2.0 extensions. <br> For this example scenario, I am going to explain how to extend restservice asset type to show its all the artifact fields. <br>  <br> As shown in above image we have only two tabs Description and User Reviews. <br>  <br> But, when we consider Publisher there are several tables which contains metadata information related to an asset instance.  <br> In this example, I will use tabs in Store details page to map tables in the rxt of the restservice. <br>  <br> After adding extensions Store Rest service details page will look like above. Each of the tab will correspond to a table in rxt and will contain the details of that particular table when selected. <br>  <br> Follow, below steps in-order to implement this extension. <br>   Add below pageDecorator to [GREG_HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/store/extensions/assets/restservice/asset.js     <blockquote>assetCombinedWithRXT: function(page){<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (page.assets &amp;&amp; page.assets.type) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var user = server.current(ctx.session);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(user){<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var rxt = require('rxt');<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var am = rxt.asset.createUserAssetManager(ctx.session,page.assets.type);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; page.assetWithRxt = am.combineWithRxt(page.assets);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</blockquote>   Now your final asset.js file should something similar to this[1]     Copy below content to a file asset.hbs in to [GREG_HOME]/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/store/extensions/assets/restservice/themes/store/partials/<br><br>   <blockquote>&lt;script&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This has resulted in many R&amp;D organizations establishing outposts in cities with thriving startup cultures to tap into that energy. What are some of the connection points that exist between the world of R&amp;D and the world of Startups?</p>

<p>In deciding what research areas to focus on and invest in, it is critical to combat confirmation bias which leads us to collect skewed, self-serving information. Consulting domain experts is often the most employed practice in combating this bias. That, however, comes with its own challenges and is an incomplete approach at best.</p>

<p>Kristin Neff, Ph.D. is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, and her pioneering post-doctoral research on Self-Compassion is the basis for her book,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Compassion-Proven-Power-Being-Yourself/dp/0061733520/">Self Compassion: The proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself</a>, and <a href="http://www.centerformsc.org/Training">The Center for Mindful Self-Compassion</a>, which she started with&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Christopher Germer of Harvard Medical School. These ideas are also well aligned with our Square Peg Foundation work and my consulting in technology and business.</p>
<p>This interview with Kristin is a great introduction to her research and the core ideas behind mindfulness and self-compassion. Enjoy!</p>

<p>If you are in the digital service delivery business and don’t have a program component focused on “looking around corners for what is coming”, you will be blind-sided (it is simply a question of when). So, how can digital service delivery programs avoid this?</p>

<p>Do you know that the U.S. Federal Government has a seed funding program that can provide up to $850,000, over 3 years, to conduct federally-funded research and development? And that it is specifically meant for small, innovative organizations that are majority U.S. owned?</p>

<p>Conversations on depression have been flowing around the tech community for the last few months. It’s important, and many people have written about their experiences. There is some wonderful, helpful, and deeply personal insights out there.&nbsp; <a href="http://tadcialispills.us/">cialis tablets</a></p>
<p>This morning I found one that really hit me. Mike Monteiro is a Designer and runs <a href="http://muledesign.com">Mule Design Studio</a>&nbsp;in San Francisco. He’s one of those insightful voices that I always enjoy reading or hearing, whether on his blog or in conference talks. His books <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design is a Job</a> and <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client">You’re My Favorite Client</a> are must-reads for anyone involved in creating a product. We’ve never met, but by all accounts he’s a great guy.&nbsp; <a href="http://generictadalafil20mg.us/">cialis generico milano</a></p>
<p>He has also struggled with depression.&nbsp; <a href="http://costviagrarx.us/">generic cialis is it safe</a></p>
<p>His essay is by his own admission not a comprehensive view of depression. But he says one of the most important things that people need to know:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>
I am still me. Better yet, I think I am finally me. I’m not living with some shit demon in my head all the time.<br>
…<br>
You don’t have to be your depression. Go be you.<br>
From &lt;https://medium.com/@monteiro/this-is-about-the-time-i-chose-not-to-die-3c2cc97cf769&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can’t read much about depression and mental health without hearing the message that people have a hard time, for lots of reasons, taking the step to get help. Mike’s personal story steps beyond the cliché to touch that deep fear of loss — that fear that your depression somehow makes you who you are.&nbsp; <a href="http://costcialis20.us/">cost of cialis</a><br>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In the mid-80’s I took my second tech job, at a company called Silicon Graphics, Inc.</p>
<p>SGI, before it officially contracted its name to “SGI”, was a fantastic place to grow and learn. It was intense and focused, and my modest technical know-how in Unix, TCP/IP Networking, and Computer Hardware matched well as the company grew its Unix workstation business and more customers connected computers to Internet Protocol networks. I was soon a main contact point for the most intractable problems from customers, and the Customer Support representative to new product introductions.</p>
<p>The focus and intensity made for arguments, some that probably would seem to outsiders as knock-down, drag-out fights. &nbsp;But a friend from those days put it well when he said, “We fight with each other, but we fight to make a great product.”</p>
<p>If I came to engineering with a problem and hadn’t done my homework, didn’t have a good handle on what was happening and why, and hadn’t collected useful information from the customer, the criticism was withering. One networking engineer, who I consider an important early mentor, was especially tough. But once I learned to do my research and bring him useful information on real problems, he was very responsive and engaged, helping me pull in other engineers on really complex cases.</p>
<p>My team worked with real customers every day. We had an understanding of how real customers used these computers, and the real environments they were in&nbsp;— the networks, the labs, and the variety of configurations, and why a problem that some might consider a minor annoyance was actually a major disruption for another customer. But often it was difficult to produce clear data supporting our insights. By the time the data was clear, the problem was too big, or at least much more expensive to fix.</p>
<p>This was especially the case in new product introductions. Even down to the question, “Is this ready to ship?”, we were there, contributing to the decision and wielding a rarely used veto.&nbsp;These arguments were often heated, but the Product Managers and Marketing and Sales Execs came to know that our concerns should be considered, even on apparently light evidence. And we knew that a big part of our job in new product intro’s was to ensure that we never needed to use that veto.</p>
<p>It was an environment where you were expected to know your stuff, whether on technical topics or in business. And even if you had a reputation for knowing your stuff, you would get challenged, and you had to fight it out.</p>
<p>As Silicon Graphics grew, it became known as the place the best people all wanted to work. Not because of that original espresso machine that Jim Clark bought for the engineering team, but because of our reputation for excellence in every part of the company.</p>
<p>But as the growth started to accelerate in the early 90’s, things changed. Instead of arguments about making our products and services better, about serving customers, fixing problems and getting things done, the fights became political. Which VP was supporting that position? Who are you? Whose budget is this going to come out of? In-fighting between divisions and groups and backstabbing and office politics grew. SGI had become a “big company.”</p>
<p>Many great people left, but many stuck around. Even if you were unhappy, the growth made it easy to find something new and interesting to do.</p>
<p>But the necrosis had set in.</p>
<p>We were no longer focused on building great products and changing the world. We were fighting the wrong fights.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Building a great product (or service) is never easy. Tough decisions must be made, and among smart, motivated people, coming from differing experience and perspectives, that’s going to cause arguments. And even in the best teams, sometimes the argument will go too far, or stray into personal attacks, or involve some back-channel politicking. And learning to develop an idea and gather support for it is critical to getting anything done in a large organization.</p>
<p>You have to keep bringing everyone back to the point: To make a great product.</p>

<p>(IIW)[http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com] uses the (Open Space Technology)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology] process for self-organizing the conference. The importance of all of this is often unclear to the newcomer, but people come around, as they come to understand that there rules generate a conference that works much like the hallways and bars in traditional conferences. The whole thing becomes a &nbsp;great swirling stew of fascinating interlocking conversations, and real work comes out of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This starts with four principles:</p>
<p>1. Whoever comes are the right people.&nbsp;These people came to this session because they &nbsp;wanted to be here. The mix of opinions, ideas, and questions that result are exactly what we are hoping for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.&nbsp;These sessions are generative. What happens is not always what you thought might happen, but that’s ok! Let go of your expectations and enjoy the flow of ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Whenever it starts is the right time.&nbsp;Start on time, even if you are expecting more people. Someone may join mid-way through, and that’s ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Whenever it’s over it’s over. We give over the space to the next sessions on time. If you are still in the middle of a great conversation, move somewhere, or schedule a follow-up. If the conversation is over, or the part that interests you is done, then you may leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, the important Law of Two Feet:</p>
<p>You have both Mobility and Responsibility! Move around if you like. if a conversation isn’t interesting, just move. It’s common that there is several interesting sessions at the same time slot&nbsp;— move around, sample and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Book of Proceedings:</p>
<p>Every IIW generates a Book of Proceedings, containing the notes from every session. it’s important that someone at each session takes notes. There is a simple, standard format for the notes, to include the sessions number, location, convener, title and note-taker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Internet Identity Workshop is my favorite conference. The topics covered, which span across Identity, Privacy, Community, and Security and more, continue to be relevant even after more than a decade. The “Open Spaces” format generates lively discussions across a range of topics, all created on the spot by the participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also a conference full of friends who I’ve come to know over the years. I’ve already had a couple quick “catch-up” conversations and looking forward to more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle ground of app-to-app interaction history is littered with abandoned ideas, half-solutions, and unimplemented APIs. The current, consumer/provider interaction paradigm for apps and services is a mess of one-off, provider-defined systems that each use their own transaction mechanisms and custom data structures. This makes it hard to do simple things across N providers, like save something to a user’s preferred storage service without jumping through provider-specific code and UX hoops.</p>
<p>I’d like to restart the conversation about bringing legit, app-to-app interaction APIs to the Web. There have been past spec attempts, namely Web Activities and Web Intents, but I’ll argue that while they get a lot right, they all fail to deliver an A+ solution.</p>
<p></p>
 Wait, what is an “App-to-App Interaction API”? 
<p>Have you ever wanted to open a programmatic connection within your app to the user’s preferred provider of a service or activity? Maybe you’ve wanted to check a user’s identity, store data to a user’s storage provider, or post to the user’s preferred social network, etc. If you’re saying to yourself, “Self, this is already solved, there are endless provider-specific social, identity, and storage includes to do just that” &lt;-- I would submit to you, that right there, sucks. There must be some way to provide a common API layer for consumption of these services that doesn't require developers to know of, integrate, and manage specific bits of UI and code for every provider. Not having legit APIs to do this is a real problem, with significant consequences:



</p> 
 Pages are cluttered with code and UI includes for countless providers, many of which are left on pages to rot after a company discontinues support. 
 Developers must know of, include, maintain, and write code to juggle how and what providers respond with; which usually doesn’t share a semantic, even across the same type of service. 
 The performance cost is huge – social, login, and other provider-specific includes account for a staggering amount of memory and dramatically increase page load times. 
 Because developers are required to specifically include each provider, they often display only two or three options for a given service. This prevents users from leveraging different services that aren’t among those a developer has committed cycles to integrating. 
 
<p>So we know this is a serious issue that impacts countless uses-cases, degrades performance, and limits service mashability, but what does a serious solution look like?</p>
 Must-haves of an A+ solution: 
 
 Ability for providers to be registered dynamically, or via manifest declaration, but not tied to any installable app model – the whole Web deserves this API. 
 The user’s selection and preferences for servicing activities should be managed by the User Agent (browser, OS, etc.), within its trusted, chrome UI. 
 The user should have the ability to pick a service/app to handle an activity per-use, as a default per-domain, or as a global default. 
 The developer should be able to request handling of an activity via context switch to the provider app OR by establishing a silent, programmatic connection (connecting to another app/service in the background) 
 The spec should provide both declarative and imperative entry points for UI hand-offs and programmatic connections – for instance: links for declarative hand-offs, and imperative interfaces for background connections. 
 Imperative API connections to providers should be transactional – meaning a response sent back from a provider should be tied to a specific request instance (hopefully with a Promise). 
 
 How does current tech stack up? 
<p>Here’s a rundown of how the three existing mechanisms we have for app-to-app interaction fare when assessed against the base features and capabilities an A+ solution should include:</p>

<p>Though Custom Protocols come closest – and could be enhanced to fill the gaps – none of these options meet the criteria of an A+ solution. To add insult to injury, no current option is supported by default mobile browsers (Android, iOS, or Windows Phone), which makes general use a non-starter for most developers. The inability of these APIs to cover significant developer use-cases is one reason implementation of the above APIs is so spotty. Neither IE nor Edge currently support these APIs, and I don’t blame them – before you commit significant time to implementing an API, you need to be sure it adequately solves the problems you face. That’s part of the reason I am starting this discussion; we want to create an open dialog to better understand your needs.</p>
 Experimenting with Protocol Handlers 
<p>I needed an app-to-app interaction API for something I’m working on at Microsoft, called Web Profile. The requirement was that any consuming app would be able to open a programmatic connection to a user’s preferred service provider and perform transactions without the consuming app having to know where to look, or include any provider specific code.</p>
<p>To build a working prototype, I needed an existing mechanism that worked across multiple browsers, so I took another look at something I had used in the past: Custom Protocol Handlers (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/registerProtocolHandler">MDN: navigator.registerProtocolHandler</a>). Though they may not realize it, users and developers are already familiar with custom protocol handlers; the best example is probably <code>mailto:</code>. URLs prefixed with a custom protocol direct the browser to open the app or site the user selects to handle the request. This usually takes the form of a contextual switch: opening a new window or browser tab. For what I was looking to do, I needed a way to stay within my app while interacting over a programmatic connection with whatever provider the user selects. Custom protocol handlers can currently be registered in the desktop versions of these browsers:</p>
 
 Firefox 3+ 
 Chrome 13+ 
 Opera 11.6+ 
 
 Meet <code>ProtocolWorker</code> 
<p>It turns out you can use custom protocols to create a programmatic, background connection for app-to-app interactions. How? By pairing them with an old friend: the <code>iframe</code>. I found that loading a custom protocol (any handler registered with the <code>web+</code> prefix) in an iframe will redirect to the handler’s target page. With a bit of postMessage() magic handled by a prollyfill included on both sides (consumer and provider), you can create an active, two-way connection between your app and the user’s preferred service provider. Think of it as a cross between a Web Worker and Background Page (as they’re known in browser extension land). Here’s my Github repo with the JS file you’ll need to make it all work: <a href="https://github.com/csuwildcat/ProtocolWorker">https://github.com/csuwildcat/ProtocolWorker</a></p>
 Talk codey to me: 
<p>To show how this works I put together a simple demo built on the totally-100%-made-up <code>web+whisper</code> protocol. The hypothetical Web Whisper case I highlight in the code below lets a user store a text string (a whisper) with their provider, or retrieve the last text string the provider stored on their behalf. Any consuming app that desires to store or retrieve the user's whisper must first be permitted to do so via the browser's protocol selection UI. The whole demo uses <code>localStorage</code> to save the user's text string on the provider's domain, so don't expect persistence beyond that of your local machine.</p>
<p>Note: though this is a super simple demo, the system would be just as good for sending/retrieving things like: social posts, user profile info, or files from places like OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, etc.</p>
 Providers register a protocol handler 
<p>The first thing a site offering a Web Whisper service needs to do is register itself as a handler for the <code>web+whisper</code> protocol. Here's how you do that:</p>
 <code>navigator.registerProtocolHandler('web+whisper', HANDLER_URL + '?%s', 'Whisper Demo Provider');</code> 
 Protocol handlers point to a ProtocolWorker page 
<p>At the other end of that <code>HANDLER_URL</code> should be an HTML page that is not intended for display - we'll be treating it as more of a DOM-enhanced, Web Worker environment. In this page you will include event listeners and whatever code you need to deal with the requests you'll receive from consuming apps. Here's what the handler page looks like for our Web Whisper provider:</p>
 <code>&lt;script src="js/ProtocolWorker.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

  window.addEventListener('protocolrequest', function(event){
    if (event.detail['@type'] == 'Comment') {
      localStorage.whisper = event.detail.comment;
      event.detail.resolve();
    }
    if (event.detail['@type'] == 'Search') {
      event.detail.resolve(localStorage.whisper);
    }
  });

&lt;/script&gt;</code> 
 Consuming apps connect to providers via <code>ProtocolWorker</code> 
<p>After the user adds our Web Whisper provider as a handler for <code>web+whisper</code> requests, consuming apps can ask to open a connection to it. Below is a demo page of what it would look like for a consuming app to interact with the user's Web Whisper provider. Notice the consuming app creates a <code>ProtocolWorker</code> instance and sets up events in which it will attempt to send and retrieve data from the user's Web Whisper provider.</p>
 <code>&lt;input placeholder="Whisper something" /&gt;&lt;button id="send"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button id="retrieve"&gt;Retrieve&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script src="js/ProtocolWorker.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;

var retrieveButton = document.querySelector('#retrieve');
var sendButton = document.querySelector('#send');
var input = document.querySelector('input');

var whisperWorker = new ProtocolWorker('web+whisper');

sendButton.addEventListener('click', function(){

  var value = input.value.trim();
  if (value) {
    whisperWorker.request({
      '@context': 'http://schema.org',
      '@type': 'Comment',
      comment: value
    }).then(function(){
      alert('Your message has been whispered to your provider!')
    }).catch(function(){
      alert('You either declined to whisper something to me or don\'t have a web+whisper provider :/')
    });
  }
  else alert('You didn\'t whisper anything.');

});

retrieveButton.addEventListener('click', function(){

  whisperWorker.request({
    '@context': 'http://schema.org',
    '@type': 'Search'
  }).then(function(data){
    alert('You last whispered: ' + data);
  }).catch(function(){
    alert('You either decided not to let this app see your last whisper, or don\'t have a web+whisper provider :/')
  });

});

&lt;/script&gt;</code> 
 Transactions should follow shared semantics 
<p>As you may have noticed above, each <code>ProtocolWorker</code> request above is formatted in accordance with a matching data description from <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. Schema.org is a great resource for semantic data descriptors, which I believe are a solid Lingua-franca upon which to transact custom protocol requests. Who knows, maybe browsers could validate and enforce these semantic data structures some day?</p>
 Just show me the demo, clown. 
<p>I have the demo code above running on a couple Github domains so you can test the interplay between providing and consuming apps – note: you need to be using a desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, or Opera. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
 
 Add the demo provider as your Web Whisper handler by clicking the “Add Provider” button, and accepting the handler via the browser’s permission UI: <a href="http://web-protocols.github.io/provider-demo/">http://web-protocols.github.io/provider-demo/</a> 
 Visit the consuming app demo page and whisper something to your provider by entering a message in the input and clicking the send button. It will prompt you to select a provider, make sure you pick the “Whisper Demo Provider” you just added: <a href="http://csuwildcat.github.io/ProtocolWorker/">http://csuwildcat.github.io/ProtocolWorker/</a> 
 OPTIONAL: You’ll notice an option to make your provider choice the default when the browser selection UI is raised in the consuming app demo. If you select a provider as your default, all subsequent <code>ProtocolWorker</code> calls will happen instantly in the background, without bugging you to choose a handler. 
 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8">Christian Heilmann</a> was kind enough to shoot a quick screen cast of the steps above:</p>
<p></p>
 Where do we go from here? 
<p>As we’ve discussed, there are new and existing APIs and specs that could be modified to enable these use-cases – ServiceWorker could be a candidate, but regardless of what form the solution takes, let’s come together as a community of developers and platform implementers to move the web forward. I encourage you to submit your own requirements, technical feedback, and implementation ideas directly to this Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/csuwildcat/ProtocolWorker/issues/1">https://github.com/csuwildcat/ProtocolWorker/issues/1</a></p>

<p>How many data points does it take to call something a trend? Â&nbsp;With the <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/hacking_team_is.html">hack and subsequent data dump of the internal files of Hacking Team</a>, a company most of us never even knew existed until this week,Â&nbsp;the world is getting to seeÂ&nbsp;a very public examination of the naked inner workings of an organization. This is the second time I can think of this kind of hack occurring. Â&nbsp;The first was, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_hack">Sony Pictures</a>.</p>
<p>Some number of hackers have turned two different organizations inside out from a digital perspective, exposing even the mundane stuffÂ&nbsp;for public ridicule. Â&nbsp;And some of the most harshly ridiculed practices of all in both cases involved passwords and credentials.</p>
<p>In the case of Sony Pictures, the effect was acutely embarrassing. Â&nbsp;Scores of Excel spreadsheets, detailing personal, business, and IT system passwords, with filenames like “website passwords” and “usernames &amp; passwords”. Â&nbsp; When Gawker writes an article detailing what morons you are, Â&nbsp;you know it’s bad: Â&nbsp;<a href="http://gawker.com/sonys-top-secret-password-lists-have-names-like-master_-1666775151">http://gawker.com/sonys-top-secret-password-lists-have-names-like-master_-1666775151</a></p>
<p><a href="http://eternallyoptimistic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sonypicturespasswordfiles.png"></a></p>
<p>In the case of Hacking Team, enough data was dumped for both the obvious stupidity to come to light, but also for hashed passwords to be brute forced, to be gleefully revealed in horrific detail on twitter. Â&nbsp;The examples below are (a) a dump of the admin’s Firefox password manager, and (b) an excel spreadsheet containing VPS credentials.</p>

<p>So, let’s assume that thisÂ&nbsp;‘dump and roast’ trend is really a trend, and will continue. Â&nbsp;Perhaps it puts a little more personal skin in the game. Â&nbsp;WeÂ&nbsp;all get lazy. We all take shortcuts. Â&nbsp;But perhaps now that there is a risk that all those shortcuts get dissected at a later date, with a very sharp scalpel.</p>
<p>Trying to look competent during examination byÂ&nbsp;your Future Hacker Overlords. Â&nbsp;It’s an odd thing to imagine as a security influence. Â&nbsp;But right now, it feels like it might become a thing….</p>

<p>A key principle when thinking about a product is to understand, deeply, the needs of the user of the product. What job are they hiring it to do? Why – What are they trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>But this is difficult – and not just because it takes long hours and many cycles of iterative improvement. It’s not just that the things people tell us about what they want are wrong, or at best incomplete. It’s not just that it’s difficult to simultaneously have deep belief in your insight and also question every assumption.</p>
<p>It’s difficult because we get in our own way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have difficulty sorting out our own motivations, dealing with our own emotional responses, and knowing our own mind. So how can we really understand someone else? At the same time, we also tend to attribute motivations and meaning to the actions of other people&nbsp;—as if we know what they are thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at your personal life. Have you ever been accused of some transgression that all turned out to be a misunderstanding? Now, be honest, have you ever made that sort of assumption about someone else, later to find out that you were wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These emotional examples just highlight a more pervasive problem. Our minds tend to make a leap of meaning, a shortcut of sorts, to help us understand the world around us. &nbsp;We tell ourselves stories about things that happen around us that build our concept of how things work.&nbsp;This skill is useful.&nbsp;But we also tend to stick to stories that reinforce our ideas about the world. We resist, and explain away, anything new or different&nbsp;—especially if it challenges our core ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies behind it: the contrarian truth.”</p>
<p>– Peter Thiel, Zero to One</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can never perfectly understand the motivations, aspirations, emotions and thoughts of other people. We can probably never perfectly understand our own. But by working at it, we can grow and become better at it. We can see our own thoughts as just thoughts. We can turn them over, examine them, think about alternatives, and decide what to think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the beginning. It’s not about having a formula for success, but rather a skill of being present and self-aware so that we can make better use of any idea, method, formula, or framework. It’s not about being perfect. Just notice that you are making assumptions or assigning motivation, and come back to self-awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be Present. Be Self-Aware. Innovate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the next few months, our work at Square Peg Ranch is featured on America’s Best Racing and Fox Sports. The first short video in the series was shown today during the horse racing coverage of the United Nations Stakes at Monmouth Park, NJ. Joell and I watched at a local pizza place with some of our families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can watch an <a href="http://www.americasbestracing.net/en/the-latest/news-stories/2015/7/5/connecting-through-the-square-peg-foundation/">extended version of this first video</a> on the America’s Best Racing Website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video you’ll see several of our kids featured, plus Davis Finch,&nbsp;our Grantwriter who also keeps our horse and lesson records —&nbsp;tracking everything that goes on with the horses, including all training, exercise, injuries, medications and&nbsp;preventive care. (For more information about Square Peg Foundation and our work at Square Peg Ranch, check out our website, <a href="https://www.squarepegfoundation.org/we-turn-i-wish-into-i-can/why-square-peg/">SquarePegFoundation.org</a> or reach out directly to me.)</p>
<p>The team at Fox Sports and America’s Best Racing have done a really beautiful job on this video. They were a joy to work with and we’re eagerly looking forward to seeing the rest of the series!</p>

 Why cruel and unusual mobile security policies compromise security… <blockquote>“Thank you for your purchase of Mojo! Your credit card has been billed&nbsp;$19.95.”</blockquote><p>As I leaned back and reviewed my morning email on my iPad, I was surprised to see a receipt for a purchase of something called Mojo. However, it quickly dawned on me exactly what it was and how this had happened.</p><p>You see, for a few weeks my son had been playing a free-to-play game on his iPad. In this game, there was a virtual currency called Mojo. He had been asking for me to spend real money to buy some of this virtual currency and I had spent an equal amount of time denying this request. So when the receipt landed in my inbox, I knew exactly what it was and who did it. What I didn’t know was how he had managed to make the purchase.</p><p>My iTunes password had lower and upper characters, a special character, no dictionary words, and a number. I wasn’t using it on any other site and hadn’t even given it to my&nbsp;wife.</p><blockquote>What I had done was type it on my iPad that morning before I left for work, allowing each character of the password to echo on the screen as I typed&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Apparently, a properly motivated 9-year-old (at the time) can easily watch these characters echo over your shoulder and enter them later on their own&nbsp;device.</p> What if this was an Enterprise Password? <p>Many companies still use login/password to access corporate VPNs and business applications.</p><p>Imagine that you work for one of these companies and visit a conference or trade show and that you have decided to check a file share, CRM application, or wiki using your mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>You pull out your device, unlock it, and launch the application. Usually you’ve entered at least two layers of passwords by this point (perhaps using your fingerprint or swiping rather than entering a PIN to unlock your&nbsp;device).</p><p>While the device unlock is important, it requires that someone actually have your device to make it useful. The second sequence, where you connect to your corporate network (or cloud provider) is much more interesting. This is where you go from giving someone access to 32GB of data on your phone to countless terabytes stored in your enterprise.</p><p>If your organization hasn’t put into place one-time tokens or two-factor authentication, you’ve potentially given a motivated attacker an easy way to get access to your network. It’s much easier to watch your screen echo your password than it ever was to watch you touch-type your password.</p><p>Where some organizations get things exceptionally wrong is by enforcing even more frequent policies on authentication when coming from a mobile device. The idea is that because devices can more easily lost or stolen, it’s ideal to request users re-authenticate frequently to prove that they are still in control of the&nbsp;device.</p><blockquote>This particularly cruel and unusual policy not only degrades user experience and encourages people to choose easier-to-type passwords, but also subjects these passwords to more frequent exposure.</blockquote><p>Fortunately there are better security policies and better software to make those policies work&nbsp;well.</p> What Actually&nbsp;Works? <p>The easiest solution to this problem is to use the device itself as an authentication factor. This means that a hacker needs both my password and the device in order to login. This can be as simple as device fingerprinting and as complicated as leveraging digital certificates.</p><p>An even better solution is to move away from using any passwords in the first place, leveraging PKI and other established technology to handle the authentication between the device and the service, while using emerging technology like containerization to ensure that only appropriate applications on the device can leverage that&nbsp;session.</p><p>With employees bringing their own devices to work in BYOD programs, it’s very important to take an approach that focuses on applications, rather than devices. Over-hardening security at the device-level (e.g. even just to play Angry Birds), rather than just stepping up authentication when it is really needed (e.g. to view customer data), over-exposes credentials and gives users incentives to work around the inconvenience of security.</p> What about the Young&nbsp;Hacker? <p>With no shortage of hidden pride (and considering his promising future black hat career working with the LizardSquad and CryptoWall teams), I let my son know that he wasn’t allowed to do this sort of thing&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>Within a few days he proceeded to get my next few passwords, but “only used them to get free apps”. At this point I gave up.&nbsp;☺</p> About the&nbsp;Author <p>Clayton Donley is the Vice President of Product Management for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/identity">Oracle’s Identity Management and Mobile Security products</a>.

 What an Identity Management guy learned from managing a world populated by tweens and&nbsp;teens… <blockquote>“Lava and TNT is covering the entire spawn, dad! Can you fix&nbsp;it?”</blockquote><p>I help my 12-year-old son run a Minecraft server for his friends, as well as random strangers (500+ at last count). Players point their Minecraft game at his server and work collaboratively (or so we hope) with others to build things, chat, and otherwise have&nbsp;fun.</p><p>In the span of two years, there’s been a lot of learning when it comes to managing a system where the bulk of the users have pre-teen or early teen levels of maturity.</p> What Could Possibly Go&nbsp;Wrong? <p>Apparently on a server loaded with pre-teen users, there’s actually a LOT that go wrong…frequently.</p><p>In addition to my Saturday mornings of cleaning up lava and TNT (<a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/coreprotect/">CoreProtect</a> is your friend), I’ve needed to unban dozens of legitimate users, revoke privileges from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer">griefers</a> who have decided to destroy parts of the world, and kill off entire populations of zombies, creepers, and other creatures that were placed with the intent to DDoS the server with&nbsp;lag.</p><p>While on the surface these all seem to be different problems, they all ultimately come down to the wrong people having too much access and a lack of visibility into who has access to do&nbsp;what.</p> Who can you&nbsp;Trust? <p>To be clear, this access generally started with one person (my son), but as a server grew, this power got distributed to other helpers. These helpers get roles like Admin, Mod, Builder, etc… that give them a range of&nbsp;powers.</p><p>Minecraft servers support a notion of privilege systems. These systems allow you to very granularly define what each of these groups have access to do. For example, the Builder role might have access to make broad changes to the world by placing blocks in bulk using the WorldEdit, while users in the Mod role may have access to kick a player off the server or ban them. Figuring out which role grants access to what privileges involves manually sifting through pages of roles and permissions in a text file. Users can also have permissions that override the ones defined in their roles or have their roles and permissions restricted to only certain worlds or regions within the&nbsp;server.</p><p>If you’ve ever visited a multi-player Minecraft server, you’ll notice that the chat logs are inundated with kids asking others for all kinds of elevated access. If you’ll only make them a Mod, they’ll be your friend for life, bring all their friends to your server, build great things, and help you keep everything running smoothly. They’re friends with so-and-so, who runs the biggest Minecraft server you can imagine, and she will get so-and-so to send people to your server as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>This is all bulls***. You’re much better off giving your password to the guy on the phone claiming to be from IT or clicking a phishing&nbsp;link.</blockquote><p>Apparently, when kids hear this kind of thing, they start giving everyone crazy levels of access without considering the consequences. At one point when things were particularly out of control on the server, I audited user permissions and found that approximately half the active users had some level of privileged access. There was actually a network effect of kids giving it to other&nbsp;kids.</p><p>To make things worse, plugins all have their own permissions. Some of these permissions are quite powerful and allow players to change large parts of the world. It’s not always obvious when such privileges have been granted until they are granted to the wrong people — who then take advantage of&nbsp;it.</p> Who is this&nbsp;Really? <p>The Minecraft game itself costs money (~$27). Many families buy a single copy that gets shared by everyone in the family. Some kids even share their software with other friends that may not have bought a copy. All of this is done by sharing a single Minecraft login/password.</p><p>This means that even if you’ve got a great contributor who is building great things and interacting with a level of maturity well beyond their years…five minutes later a completely different kid could be accessing your server with the exact same account…and this kid could be a disaster!</p><p>Not only that, but nearly everyone who does something bad to your sever will claim that it was not really them that did it at all…but their terrible brother/sister/friend/etc… Hackers are frequently invoked. Those of you with multiple kids (or dysfunctional teams) know exactly what I’m talking&nbsp;about.</p><blockquote>It’s like asking who left up the toilet seat or ate the last cookie — maybe a&nbsp;ghost?</blockquote><p>Regardless of who did it, the damage is done and you’re left cleaning up the&nbsp;mess.</p> Enterprise Software is Different, Right? <p>Your typical enterprise is running hundreds or thousands of applications. Each of these systems also has roles and permissions that determine who gets access to which data or functions. Ideally, the security on these systems is being managed in a way that is different from the way my son runs his Minecraft server.</p><p>IT and the business need to understand some fundamental things about the users of mission critical&nbsp;systems:</p>  Who has access to which systems, functionality, and&nbsp;data?  How is this access requested and approved?  Who is certifying that this access continues to be appropriate?  What users have toxic permission combinations (e.g. create/pay their own&nbsp;POs)?  Who has highly privileged access (e.g. super-user) and what are they doing with&nbsp;it?  <p>This is where Identity Governance comes into&nbsp;play.</p><blockquote>Identity Governance solutions connect to various systems in the enterprise to manage accounts, roles, and entitlements for&nbsp;users.</blockquote><p>When an employee joins the company, they get a standard set of privileges for their role in the enterprise. This might be things like sending email or submitting expense reports. Additional privileges can be easily requested and approved as appropriate by the business and IT. Finally, when an employee leaves the company, their accounts and privileges are centrally revoked across all of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Lack of proper controls open enterprise applications to various insider threats. Additionally, over-privileged accounts are a goldmine for hackers that have already gained basic access via common attacks like phishing and&nbsp;malware.</p> Avoiding Lava and&nbsp;TNT <p>Hooking up an Identity Governance solution to a Minecraft server is a bit overkill — though don’t think I didn’t consider&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, I simply went user-by-user, role-by-role to limit everyone’s access to the bare minimum. We then selected a few users that would be given the ability to do more privileged things, but didn’t allow these users to further delegate their privileges. Additional plugins were added that allow for tracking and rollback if these permissions were abused (similar to privileged session recording).</p><blockquote>Cleaning things up with 500 users in a half-dozen roles on a single, relatively simple system took several&nbsp;hours.</blockquote><p>Scaling this manual process up to tens of thousands of users, thousands of roles, and hundreds of systems without the benefit of automation would have been completely impossible without cutting corners and reducing overall security.</p><p>That said, in the case of the Minecraft server, this significantly improved the stability of the server and eliminated some of the large-scale griefing that was taking&nbsp;place.</p> About the&nbsp;Author <p>Clayton Donley is the Vice President of Product Management for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/identity">Oracle’s Identity Management and Mobile Security products</a>.

<p>Implementing the “Resetting Forgotten Passwords” functionality as described in the <a title="OpenAM Developer's Guide" href="http://docs.forgerock.org/en/openam/11.0.0/dev-guide/#rest-api-password-reset">OpenAM Developer’s Guide</a>&nbsp;requires some additional custom code.</p>
<p>It’s pretty straight forward to implement this functionality and can be done in 4 steps (per the Developer’s Guide):</p>
 
 Configure the Email Service 
 Perform an HTTP Post with the user’s id 
 OpenAM looks up email address (based on user id) and sends an email with a link to reset the password 
 Intercept the HTTP GET request to this URL when the user clicks the link. 
 
<p>All of this functionality is available out of the box with the exception of #4. &nbsp;I wrote some really simple javascript that can be deployed to the OpenAM server that will handle this. &nbsp;This code was written as a proof-of-concept and doesn’t include any data-validation or error handling but that could be added fairly easily. &nbsp;This script can be deployed to the root directory of your OpenAM deployment. &nbsp;Just be sure to update the&nbsp;Forgot Password Confirmation Email URL&nbsp;in the OpenAM Console under Configuration &gt; Global &gt; REST Security.</p>
<p>I have made the code available on my <a title="GitHub Repo" href="https://github.com/bradtumy/OpenAM_PasswordReset">GitHub</a>&nbsp;page and you are welcome to use it or modify it.</p>
<p>As described on the README:</p>
 
 These files are a proof of concept to extend OpenAM’s REST-based password reset functionalit 
 Add these two files to your OpenAM deployment root (e.g. /tomcat7/webapps/openam 
 Modify the server urls to the appropriate servers in your environmet 
 Change the REST Security settings in the OpenAM console (e.g. <a href="http://%5BAM">http://%5BAM</a> server and port]/openam/forgotPassword.jsp) 
 
<p>The file resetPassword.jsp is an optional file that will display a field for the user to provide their id and will then POST to&nbsp;/json/users?_action=forgotPassword (Step #2 from the Developer’s Guide).</p>

<p>Thanks to @Aldaris and @ScottHeger for providing advice while I was working on this.</p>

<p>I’m sitting here, in the dark, when I should be sleeping.Â&nbsp;<a title="Apple Statement" href="http://recode.net/2014/09/02/apple-says-it-was-hacked-in-targeted-attack-on-celebrity-accounts/">Thinking about how 100 different iCloud accounts were manipulated to give up their secrets.</a>Â&nbsp; We should all be taking a hard look at what constitutes account recovery in this day and age of the internet. Disclaimer – I haven’t had a coffee yet this morning. Â&nbsp;If I sound like a raving lunatic, this may be why.</p>
<p>As the dust settles,Â&nbsp;it appears that the attackers walked in the front door. Â&nbsp;Well, the side door actually. Â&nbsp;Data is sketchy, but it looks like account recovery processes at Apple were manipulated to give access to attackers. Â&nbsp;Why can this even happen?</p>
 1. Â&nbsp;We design only for the Lowest Common Denominator 
<p>WhenÂ&nbsp;an account recovery loop is assembled by a service, it is the same loopÂ&nbsp;regardless of who you are. Or how savvy you are. Â&nbsp;Or how likely you are to be targeted for a given threat. Â&nbsp;Why is this? Â&nbsp; Why not keep the base recovery experience as the one where you get if you can barely spell computer and these password things are scary. Â&nbsp;But why not let people with stronger needs self-identify? Â&nbsp;Allow people to ask to jump through more hoops, to supply more, and better, information in order to receive more, and better protection from targeted attacks?</p>
<p>I know exactly why this kind of “better security” doesn’t happen. Â&nbsp;Because for every JLaw attack, where the security could have helped, there are 10,000 regular people who would turn on a feature like this and then get locked out of their account. Â&nbsp;There, I said it. The lowest common denominator is: that the public expects is that even ifÂ&nbsp;they do everything wrong, even if they cannot in any reasonable or provable way identify themselves as the actualÂ&nbsp;owner of the account, theyÂ&nbsp;should still get their data back. Â&nbsp; And the cost of dealing with those 10,000 upset locked-out people, both in PR and support terms is very real. Â&nbsp;More real and more common than cost associated with the relatively few that get hacked.</p>
 2. We have purposely created a Stateless Machine 
<p>When you choose to try to recover an account today, you generally do so in a vacuum. Â&nbsp; You are asked to identify yourself, and the information you give is often considered in isolation. Â&nbsp;Do these two strings representing your dog’s name and your first school match the hashed strings stored in our database? Â&nbsp;Yes? Â&nbsp;Great! Â&nbsp;Keys to the kingdom! Â&nbsp; Doesn’t matter that somebody has been trying and failing to do the same thing three times a day for the last week. Â&nbsp;No sense of suspicion is placed on this successÂ&nbsp;as a possible culmination to all those failures. Â&nbsp;This is part of why an attacker can keep calling help desks over and over until they succeed, and why they can keep using online forms over and over until they succeed. Â&nbsp;Also — see #1, whereby it isn’t that unusual for people to really fail at knowing their recovery information and to still expect success.</p>
<p>The whole reason these systems were built to be stateless is because they were built to scale. Â&nbsp;But those requirements need to be examined. Â&nbsp; It should also be a requirement to at least try to recognize whenÂ&nbsp;an attackerÂ&nbsp;could be systematically probing recovery systems, ranging from digital forms to help desks, maybe evenÂ&nbsp;in-person resources, or direct emails to IT staff.</p>
 3. We keep the User in the dark 
<p>If somebody is systematically probing at a given user’s account, don’t you think it would be valuable to tell them, so that they can try toÂ&nbsp;form their own understanding of their safety? Â&nbsp;If you’ve locked yourself out of your account, I’m sure you won’t mind the notifications. Â&nbsp;And if you haven’t locked yourself out of your account, those notifications may be very important. For example,Â&nbsp;receiving a notification from every one of your email accounts and your bank in a 24 hour period is something that may not be so significant to each system, but should ring seriousÂ&nbsp;bells for the individual. Â&nbsp;There are programs like <a title="Shared Signals" href="http://oixuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-Shared-Signals-Model-1.pdf">Shared Signals</a> that are evolving to help with cascading identity attacks, but for now, the only person who might see the pattern is the user. Â&nbsp; And they are not involved in the process.</p>
 4. Users don’t care until it’s too late 
<p>It’s true. Â&nbsp;There are lots of optional things people could do to be safe that they never bother with. Â&nbsp; ButÂ&nbsp;perhaps, if there was a way to make users aware of recovery question guessing attempts against their account, users might get scared a little sooner, and carefully contemplate their options.</p>
 The WORST THING about this breach 
<p>I understandÂ&nbsp;the prosaic duh moment going on where people noteÂ&nbsp;that the best way to not have naked pictures stolen is to not have naked pictures taken. Â&nbsp;But this should in no way mask the failure that has taken place from an implementation standpoint. Â&nbsp;We need to safely store and share sensitive things. As a society. We need to trust that accounts we createÂ&nbsp;and populate with our most treasured data are not just swiss cheese for anyoneÂ&nbsp;willing to stalk a specific target. Â&nbsp;The old canard of “Doctor it hurts when I do this”/ “then don’t do that” doesn’t help if the underlying problem is disease rather than a boo boo. Â&nbsp;This issue is not a boo boo, and turning the iphone camera offÂ&nbsp;will not prevent the spread of the disease, it just prevents one symptom from showing.</p>
 Recommendations 
<p>If the identity fairy came to visit and granted me three wishes, here is what I would wish for. Â&nbsp;These aren’t qualified recommendations in any sense — justÂ&nbsp;a place to start.</p>
 
 Provide options for users to customize their own recovery ritual.
 
 Include things like
 
 Turning onÂ&nbsp;notifications for events like calls to the help desk or for use of the password reset form 
 Adding additional or alternate recovery steps
 
 Additional identity proofing stepsÂ&nbsp;before help desk support will engage Â&nbsp;– like requiring a 2FA authentication before the call continues 
 Requiring that KBA answers be retired (or at least flagged for review) after a certain number of incorrect guesses

 Architect for recognition of accounts that self-identify (or are verified) as likely targets
 
 Help Desks should be able to recognize high-fraud-risk accounts 
 Audit and accountability should be elevated 
 Work towards a point where theÂ&nbsp;system figures out who the high-risk accounts are in real time 
 
 
 Track the use of recovery mechanisms, and make the history available to the user.
 
 How many times has a recovery question been used 
 How many times has the form been submitted with the user’s user name 
 How many times and when has the help desk been notified

 Everybody’s looking for Element Queries 
<p>What are Element Queries? At a high level, I’d describe them as pure, unfiltered, rocket fuel for hyper-responsive layouts and components. More technically, they are Media Queries scoped to individual elements. Element Queries would allow you to attach Media Query break-points based on the dimensions and characteristics of an element itself, instead of the page’s viewport.</p>
<p>Developers have wanted Element Queries for a long time. Here’s a list of articles that convey the need, along with a few attempts to make them real:</p>
 
 Ian Taylor – <a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/media-queries-are-a-hack/" title="Media Queries are a Hack">Media Queries are a Hack</a> 
 Tab Atkins – <a href="http://www.xanthir.com/b4PR0" title="Element Queries">Element Queries</a> (a discussion of the problems) 
 The Filament Group – <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/element_query_workarounds/" title="Working Around a Lack of Element Queries">Working Around a Lack of Element Queries</a> 
 Smashing Magazine – <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/25/media-queries-are-not-the-answer-element-query-polyfill/" title="Media Queries Are Not the Answer: Element Query Polyfill">Media Queries Are Not The Answer: Element Query Polyfill</a> 
 
<p></p>
 Visualizing the Problem 
<p>I’ve included a couple sketches from the <a href="http://filamentgroup.com/">Filament Group</a> (with permission) that highlight the common layout issues we face in a world without Element Queries:</p>
<p>When the following schedule component is in its primary, full-width state, Media Queries work well for addressing different screen sizes/orientations<br>
</p>
<p>Problems quickly arise when the same schedule component enters a secondary, partial-width state. Top-level viewport break-points are no longer relevant, and styling the component becomes extremely difficult.<br>
</p>
<p>“So you’ve convinced me. Element Queries would be awesome, and developers want them – so why don’t browser vendors just give ’em the goods?” Well, there are a few tough problems to solve, chief among them is circularity. As Tab Atkins points out in his post, there is a problematic condition created if you apply the existing paradigm to Element Queries:</p>
 .container {
  float: left;
}
.child {
  width: 500px;
}
.container:min-width(450px) &gt; .child {
  width: 400px;
}
 
<p>See the issue? I’ll let Tab clarify the problem for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In this simple example, the container’s size is determined by the size of its contents, because it’s floating. By default, its only child is 500px wide. However, whenever the container is greater than 450px wide, the child is 400px wide.</p>
<p>In other words, if the child is 500px wide (thus making the container also 500px wide), then the child becomes 400px wide. But if the child is 400px wide (thus making the container also 400px wide), the child becomes 500px wide. Circular dependency!
</p></blockquote>
 Some Element Query hacks want to abuse you 
<p>Each of the posts I’ve linked to above adds to the chorus of developer need, and all are to be commended for highlighting the issues developers face. While there have been many attempts at creating something that resembles Element Queries, most rely on polling, observers, hacky resize listeners, hand-rolled measurement routines, and an assortment of odds and ends that simply fail to produce the same level of API fidelity and reliability that native Media Queries do. So what does this mean? Is all hope lost?</p>
 I’ve traveled the DOM and the HTML seas 
<p>After doing a ton of research and experimentation, I believe I have a better solution to Element Queries – in fact, it may be the best solution possible while we wait for some sort of native implementation of the feature. The mechanism I’ve derived not only avoids the issues highlighted above, it also provides the full Media Query API, scoped to individual elements. There are many factors to consider, but with a bit of out-side-the-box (literally) thinking, we’re giving Element Queries to everyone!</p>
<p></p>
 Sweet Element Queries are made of this 
<p>Let’s talk about all the pieces we’ll need. I’ll start with the most basic ingredient: finding a way to associate a separate, scoped <code>viewport</code> with each of the elements we want to imbue with Element Query powers.</p>
 Picking a Viewport Surrogate 
<p>What are the options? There are basically two routes: you can either try arcane event juggling with resize listeners or DOM polling, or utilize something that creates its own browsing context. Tab Atkins highlights one classic element that does this: the <code>iframe</code>. Sure, I guess we could toss content into an <code>iframe</code>, but they are heavy elements (in terms of performance), and placing all your content into a separate browsing context brings with it its own lame set of hassles, like style/script boundaries, lack of auto-height content flexibility, and a host of others. But hey, let’s not give up yet, there are other candidates for the staring role in this Element Query thriller: <code>embed</code> and <code>object</code>.</p>
 The <code>EMBED</code> Element 
<p>The <code>embed</code> element can be used to, er, embed content within your pages. It was recently standardized in the HTML spec, and in my exploration of the spec, seems to be the ‘lightest’ (in terms of performance) of all the elements that create new browsing contexts. The flaw with <code>embed</code> elements, is the difficulty in accessing the content they contain from the parent document. For this reason, it’s a poor choice for this use-case. (here’s the embed element spec if you’re curious: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-embed-element">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-embed-element</a>)</p>
 The <code>OBJECT</code> Element 
<p>Our other option, is the <code>object</code> tag. It can also be used to fetch and include content (or code) within your page, and still has a far ‘lighter’ create, load, and memory footprint than the <code>iframe</code> (closest to that of the <code>img</code> tag). This tag is interesting for a few reasons. Object tags create new browsing contexts, and most importantly, allow ownerDocument script access to their <code>about:blank</code> content. These suckers have been around for ages, here’s the spec: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-object-element">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#the-object-element</a></p>
<p>The Conclusion: We’re going with option 2, the <code>object</code> element, for compatibility and (relative) ease in scripting its contents.</p>
 The Skinny on Performance 
<p>It’s widely recognized that the <code>iframe</code> element is a beast that consumes memory and ravages performance – this is true, they’re terrible. So how are object and embed elements different? Can’t you load things into them like an <code>iframe</code>? Sure, but their fundamental attributes and performance characteristics greatly differ from that of an <code>iframe</code>. To assure you that, in moderation, use of object elements is safe and will not get you burned at the stake for performance heresy, I’ve thrown together a perf test – you may find the results surprising: <a href="http://jsperf.com/element-create-load-footprint" title="JS Perf - element performance test">http://jsperf.com/element-create-load-footprint</a> (Warning: some have stated the <code>audio</code> tag test – which has nothing to do with Element Queries – crashes Safari. This is inexplicable, as I am doing very basic create/load testing)</p>
<p>Basically, I wouldn’t use 1000 <code>object</code> elements in your app – but as the test above shows, I wouldn’t go putting a 1000 <code>img</code> elements into the DOM either. Use this Element Query code in a smart and deliberate way. Instead of putting an element query on 1000 <code>li</code> elements, put one on the <code>ul</code> – this is my official appeal to common sense, folks.</p>
 Bringing It All Together 
<p>Now you may be thinking “So put content in an object element? Wow, great advice Dan, that’s really original. Yawn.”, but here’s the trick: we’re not putting any content inside the <code>object</code> element! A few posts back I did a walk-through of how you can create a resize event sensor out of a few divs and well-placed scroll events – this is along those lines. I’ve created two distribution flavors for this mechanism: 1) a vanilla module that enables use without reliance on any additional dependencies, and 2) an easy-to-use <a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/318907648" title="Web Components - A Tectonic Shift for Web Development">Web Component</a> created with the awesome <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/" title="X-Tag - Web Components Library">X-Tag</a> library.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I was contacted on Twitter by a <a href="https://twitter.com/georgeocrawford">fellow</a> who suggested I use the <code>addListener</code> method of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673551%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><code>MediaQueryList</code></a> objects to detect query matches on the <code>object</code> element sensors. I explored this route, but there are a few things that led me back to using dummy <code>transitionend</code> pings. I am happy to code up a version that uses MQL listeners, but here are a few things to consider:</p>
 
 It reduces browser support: you lose all of Android below version 4 
 MQL listeners are still shaky: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75903 – http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16694591/media-query-doesnt-change-css-when-maximizing-browser-and-switching-tabs/16844712#16844712 
 Hold on a bit longer!: They’ll be reliable soon, I’d estimate another 6-12 months 
 
<p>Both versions of the Element Query code work in any browser that <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions">supports CSS Transitions</a>. This is a generous compatibility range that covers all “app-ready” browsers. Let me know if you encounter any issues using the GitHub issue areas under each of the repositories listed at the end of the article.</p>
 The Vanilla Module 
<p>The plain ol’ code module comes with the following features:</p>
 
 Two methods for manually attaching and detaching the Element Query object sensor – <code>attachQuerySensor()</code> and <code>detachQuerySensor()</code> 
 Automatic DOM ready attachment of all non-style/link elements that have a <code>media=""</code> attribute 
 Automatic bootstrapping of dynamically create elements when you add a <code>media=""</code> attribute 
 
 The HTML 
<p>Let’s imagine I have a <code>section</code> element that contains a <code>ul</code>. I want to style the list differently when the container becomes smaller than <code>300px</code>. The HTML structure below is what this scenario would look like if the elements had already been parsed by the Element Query module (triggered by the presence of the <code>media=""</code> attribute):</p>
  

   
     One 
     Two 
     Three 
   

  
    
    
      
        
      
      
         
      
    
  

 
 
<p>So what’s that <code>object</code> element doing in there? How’s that going to help with anything? The <code>media=""</code> attribute on the section element is how you declare your Element Query rules. There are two arguments for the media attribute’s <code>query()</code> function syntax. The first is an identifying query name that will be added to the <code>matched-media=""</code> attribute when its corresponding <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSMediaRule" title="MDN - CSSMediaRule docs">CSSMediaRule</a> is matched within the <code>object</code> sensor. As the user, all you need to worry about is adding queries to the <code>media</code> attribute, and styling based on the <code>matched-media</code> attribute, all the rest happens automatically.</p>
 The CSS 
<p>Once a query is matched, the name you gave the query will be added to the <code>matched-media</code> attribute. It’s a space separated list, so if multiple are matched, you would use it in CSS just like other attributes of this sort, <code>class=""</code> for instance. Here’s a post by Chris Coyier on all the ways you can style elements based on their attribute values: <a href="http://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/" title="Chris Coyier - CSS Attribute Selectors">http://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/</a>. Here’s an example of what writing CSS against an Element Query match looks like, based on the HTML example content above:</p>
 section[matched-media~="small-width"] {
  font-size: 50%; /* small text for a wee lil element! */
}

/*** Example for styling multiple matches: ***/

section[matched-media~="small-width medium-height"] {
  ...
}
 
<p>A few caveats with this version:</p>
 
 If you set the innerHTML of an element, and that HTML contains an element that has the <code>media=""</code> attribute, it will not be element-quererized. This is something that is automatic when you use the Web Component version below. To augment the element with the query sensor, you’ll need to call the <code>window</code> method <code>attachQuerySensor(ELEMENT_REF)</code>, passing the element as the first argument. 
 You must take care not to inadvertently remove the object element from the element-quererized parent. If you do this, it will no longer be able to sense changes and determine query matches. The most common ways this can occur are using <code>innerHTML</code> to blow-out content, or a DOM library method to empty an element. One strategy to avoid this, is always using a single child element inside the target element and using that for content CRUDing. 
 
 The Element Query Web Component 
<p>To make things even easier, I’ve created a Web Component <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/" title="Web Components - Custom Element spec">Custom Element</a> called <code>x-querybox</code> using <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/" title="X-Tag - Web Components Library">X-Tag</a>. This component utilizes the same mechanism described above, but also provides enhanced ergonomics, matched media listeners, and automatic retention of the object sensor when doing DOM manipulation – and since we’re using X-Tag, it’s actually smaller in size than the vanilla version! Let’s explore how it’s used:</p>
 The HTML (same as above, besides the custom element) 
 

   
     One 
     Two 
     Three 
   


 
 The CSS (also the same) 
 x-querybox[matched-media~="small-width"] {
  font-size: 50%; /* small text for a wee lil querybox! */
}
 
 Moar goodies! The <code>mediachange</code> custom event 
 document.querySelector('x-querybox').addEventListener('mediachange', function(e){
  // the event detail property is an array of the active element queries
  if (e.detail.indexOf('small-width') &gt; -1) {
    // the 'small-width' query is active, do some smally-widthy stuff!
  }
});
 
 Element Queries want to be used by you 
<p>Checkout the demo, and go grab the code. Feel free to contribute to either of the repositories using their respective GitHub Issues area. Happy queryin’ folks!  </p>
 Demo 
<p>The demo is based on the Web Component version of the code to show both the basic and extended features. It’s only meant to give you a general idea of what is possible. The shapes are style with percentage units, so you can resize the window to expand them, or grow them with a tap (via <code>:hover</code> CSS styles). As the shapes progress through their size changes, you’ll notice the text and background colors change to indicate they have hit a new break-point – this is all based on their individual, element-scoped queries. If you open the console, you will notice I am logging all the `mediachange` events that occur. The demo is more impressive on a larger screen, where you can test all the query changes: <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/x-querybox/demo/" title="Element Queries Demo"><code>Element Queries Demo</code></a></p>

<p>UPDATE: This post has seen a significant change from the first version of the code. It now relies on a much simpler method: a hidden <code>object</code> element that relays its resize event to your listeners.</p>
 DOM Elements! Y U No Resize Event? 
<p>During your coding adventures, you may have run into occasions where you wanted to know when an element in your document changed dimensions – basically the window resize event, but on regular elements. Element size changes can occur for many reasons: modifications to CSS width, height, padding, as a response to changes to a parent element’s size, and many more. Before today, you probably thought this was mere unicorn lore, an impossible feat – well buckle up folks, we’re about to throw down the gauntlet.</p>
<p></p>
 Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frog 
<p>The following is the script provides two methods that take care of everything. To enable our resize listening magic, we inject an object element into the target element, set a list of special styles to hide it from view, and monitor it for resize – it acts as a trigger for alerting us when the target element parent is resized. The first method the script provides is <code>addResizeListener</code>, it manages all your listeners and monitors the element for resize using the injected <code>object</code> element. The other method is <code>removeResizeListener</code>, and it ensures that your listeners are properly detached when you want them removed.</p>

        obj.setAttribute('style', 'display: block; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden; pointer-events: none; z-index: -1;');
        obj.__resizeElement__ = element;
        obj.onload = objectLoad;
        obj.type = 'text/html';
        if (isIE) element.appendChild(obj);
        obj.data = 'about:blank';
        if (!isIE) element.appendChild(obj);
      }
    }
    element.__resizeListeners__.push(fn);
  };
  
  window.removeResizeListener = function(element, fn){
    element.__resizeListeners__.splice(element.__resizeListeners__.indexOf(fn), 1);
    if (!element.__resizeListeners__.length) {
      if (attachEvent) element.detachEvent('onresize', resizeListener);
      else {
        element.__resizeTrigger__.contentDocument.defaultView.removeEventListener('resize', resizeListener);
        element.__resizeTrigger__ = !element.removeChild(element.__resizeTrigger__);
      }
    }
  }
})();</code> 
 Demo-licious! 
<p>Here’s a pseudo code usage of the method.</p>
 <code>var myElement = document.getElementById('my_element'),
    myResizeFn = function(){
        /* do something on resize */
    };
addResizeListener(myElement, myResizeFn);
removeResizeListener(myElement, myResizeFn);</code> 
<p>Cut to the chase, let’s see this resize thang in action: <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/resize-demo.html">Demo of resize listeners</a></p>
 Resize ALL The Things! 
<p>Now that we’re equipped with a nifty, cross-browser element resize event, what would it be good for? Here’s a few possible uses:</p>
 
 Resize-proof Web Component UI development 
 Per-element responsive design 
 Size-based loading of content 
 Anything you can imagine!

<p>I am wrapping a crazy busy week. &nbsp;Probably one of my most technically in-depth week in a really long time. &nbsp;So what kept me busy? &nbsp;Deep-diving into OpenAM’s Entitlement’s engine, learning about it’s REST interfaces and how to extend OpenAM to leverage custom service types. &nbsp;I’ll explain later since I know your thinking, “Tumy … dude, what the heck is a service type?”.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s jump into it …</p>
<p>Entitlements are policies or rules that state what you (or any user) can and can’t do.&nbsp; Sounds simple right?&nbsp; In Information Security entitlements usually define what resources a user can access, how they can access it, when they can access it and so on and so on. &nbsp; A resource can be a web url, a banking transaction, a database record, or frankly anything you might want to protect.&nbsp; Typically entitlements are expressed through XACML <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML</a>.&nbsp; Entitlements are used in access control settings and used to define fine-grained authorization rules.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is starting to become too much of a Entitlements 101 class so let me just jump into the hand’s on stuff.</p>
<p>Ok, Forgerock … in their OpenAM product they have an Entitlements engine which is essentially a Policy Management Point and a Policy Decision Point (Google is your friend if you don’t know what those things are).&nbsp; Out of the box OpenAM supports a few different “service types” which are essentially a set of resources and their associated actions.&nbsp; For example a web url would potentially have the actions of “GET” and “POST”.&nbsp; There are a couple of other service types too (a banking example and a few others).&nbsp; But what happens when our resource is not a web URL and we want to have actions besides “GET” or “POST”.&nbsp; What we if we wanted to have a resources defined as database table names and we wanted to have actions such as “READ”, “UPDATE”, “DELETE”. &nbsp;(Update: &nbsp;Starting in OpenAM Version 11.2 some of these additional actions are available out of the box) We want to be able to create rules that we can either allow a user to read information from a specific table or deny their ability to read from a certain table.&nbsp; Ok, hopefully you get the idea … if you don’t email me and we can talk about it.&nbsp; OpenAM has a great set of command line tools that you can use to interface with the product, these tools have also been “web” enabled on a jsp page which is accessible through the admin console (it’s disabled by default though).</p>
<p>To create this new service type there are a few steps we need to take:</p>
 
 Create a custom Application Type 
 Create a custom Service Type 
 Create a custom Application 
 Create the policy, using the custom service type 
 
<p>4 easy steps.</p>
<p>The Custom Application Type is a few lines that get imported.&nbsp; Let’s assume that you have enabled the web ssoadmin.jsp and have accessed it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://am.host:port/openam/ssoadm.jsp">https://am.host:port/openam/ssoadm.jsp</a></p>
<p>You would see a page like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do a quick search for “create-appl-type” and you then click on it.</p>
<p>Fill in the form that is displayed with this information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Application Type Name: BTPoliyService<br>
actions=READ=true<br>
actions=UPDATE=true<br>
actions=DELETE=true<br>
actions=ADD-ACCESS=true<br>
resourceComparator=com.sun.identity.entitlement.URLResourceName<br>
saveIndexImpl=com.sun.identity.entitlement.util.ResourceNameIndexGenerator<br>
searchIndexImpl=com.sun.identity.entitlement.util.ResourceNameSplitter</p></blockquote>
<p>This creates the set of actions that will be available for your resources of this type.&nbsp; Save that and then you need to create the Custom Service Type.&nbsp; This is created by modifying an XML file and then importing that file into a form that is similar to the one we just saw.<br>
The service type provides a little more detail on the actions and sets the True/False values that will be displayed in the policy manager.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;?xml version=”1.0″ encoding=”UTF-8″?&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE ServicesConfiguration SYSTEM “jar://com/sun/identity/sm/sms.dtd”&gt;&lt;ServicesConfiguration&gt;&lt;Service name=”BTPolicyService” version=”1.0″&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Schema serviceHierarchy=”/DSAMEConfig/BTPolicyService” i18nFileName=”BTPolicyService” i18nKey=”BTPolicyService”&gt;<br>
&lt;Global&gt;<br>
&lt;AttributeSchema name=”serviceObjectClasses” type=”list” syntax=”string” i18nKey=”BTPolicyService”/&gt;<br>
&lt;/Global&gt;<br>
&lt;Policy&gt;<br>
&lt;AttributeSchema i18nKey=”READ” name=”READ” syntax=”boolean” type=”single” uitype=”radio” &gt;<br>
&lt;IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;&lt;/IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanTrueValue&gt;true&lt;/BooleanTrueValue&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanFalseValue&gt;false&lt;/BooleanFalseValue&gt;<br>
&lt;/BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;/AttributeSchema&gt;<br>
&lt;AttributeSchema i18nKey=”DELETE” name=”DELETE” syntax=”boolean” type=”single” uitype=”radio” &gt;<br>
&lt;IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;&lt;/IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanTrueValue&gt;true&lt;/BooleanTrueValue&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanFalseValue&gt;false&lt;/BooleanFalseValue&gt;<br>
&lt;/BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;/AttributeSchema&gt;<br>
&lt;AttributeSchema i18nKey=”UPDATE” name=”UPDATE” syntax=”boolean” type=”single” uitype=”radio” &gt;<br>
&lt;IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;&lt;/IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanTrueValue&gt;true&lt;/BooleanTrueValue&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanFalseValue&gt;false&lt;/BooleanFalseValue&gt;<br>
&lt;/BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;/AttributeSchema&gt;<br>
&lt;AttributeSchema i18nKey=”ADD-ACCESS” name=”ADD-ACCESS” syntax=”boolean” type=”single” uitype=”radio” &gt;<br>
&lt;IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;&lt;/IsResourceNameAllowed&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanTrueValue&gt;true&lt;/BooleanTrueValue&gt;<br>
&lt;BooleanFalseValue&gt;false&lt;/BooleanFalseValue&gt;<br>
&lt;/BooleanValues&gt;<br>
&lt;/AttributeSchema&gt;<br>
&lt;/Policy&gt;<br>
&lt;/Schema&gt;<br>
&lt;/Service&gt;<br>
&lt;/ServicesConfiguration&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the above XML file, you should notice there are several spots where I have provided the name of the service “DatabaseTablePolicyService” and then the actions and their True/False values. In the ssoadm.jsp search for “create-svc” and then copy and paste this file into that form.</p>
<p>Next step and last step of the “extending” part of the process. So, in the ssoadm.jsp web page, search for “create-appl”. Click on this link and it will open a form very similar to the “create-appl-type” form. Enter the following information:</p>
<blockquote><p>actions=READ=true<br>
actions=UPDATE=true<br>
actions=DELETE=true<br>
actions=ADD-ACCESS=true<br>
applicationType=BTPolicyService<br>
resources= table://*<br>
entitlementCombiner=com.sun.identity.entitlement.DenyOverride<br>
resourceComparator=com.sun.identity.entitlement.URLResourceName<br>
conditions=com.sun.identity.admin.model.DnsNameViewCondition<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.IdRepoGroupViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.IdRepoRoleViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.IdRepoUserViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.VirtualViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.AttributeViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.OrViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.AndViewSubject<br>
subjects=com.sun.identity.admin.model.NotViewSubject<br>
conditions=dateRange<br>
conditions=daysOfWeek<br>
conditions=dnsName<br>
conditions=ipRange<br>
conditions=timeRange<br>
conditions=timezone<br>
conditions=or<br>
conditions=and<br>
conditions=not</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice in the above file, that I add the application name and it matches the name we have used in the other configurations. I added the actions again and finally I actually define a resource. I personally like to describe the resource type in a URL style … I can use “table://” as my resource in the policy and that will help remind me later what type of resource that is. You don’t have to prefix your resources in your policy with that … it seems to be optional.</p>
<p>At this point you can jump back over to the OpenAM Admin console and create a policy based on this resource, as you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.tumy-tech.com/2012/12/15/785/screen-shot-2012-12-15-at-11-27-07-pm/"></a></p>
<p>So, that’s pretty cool stuff … The entitlements engine is pretty robust, it’s fast and … it has a RESTful interface. I am going to do a deep-dive blog post on the RESTful services at some point but for now let’s just take a look at how you can evaluate an entitlement.</p>
<p>Evaluating a Privilege:</p>
<p>* ssoToken = Authenticated User’s Token<br>
* iPlanetDirectoryPro = session cookie … admin users session token<br>
* action = action user is attempting (GET, POST, READ, DELETE, etc)<br>
* application = application type of policy (defaults to iPlanetAMWebAgentService)<br>
* Subject (user attempting action … encoded session token)</p>
<blockquote><p>curl -v -H “X-Query-Parameters: ssotoken:AQIC5wM2LY4SfczpL5a3M02ju3uyOd6iMj4zZvPZXB3BNQ4.*AAJTSQACMDE.*” -b “iPlanetDirectoryPro=\”AQIC5wM2LY4SfcxcPg_yUwYu-iQPHH663tv9AnoEEr6j_2k.*AAJTSQACMDE.*\”” “<a href="http://am.host:port/openam/ws/1/entitlement/entitlement?action=READ&amp;amp;resource=table://my_table_name&amp;amp;application=BTPolicyService&amp;amp;subject=4l18suAL/hXNCfzykwIlbV0WbtM%3D&amp;#8221">http://am.host:port/openam/ws/1/entitlement/entitlement?action=READ&amp;amp;resource=table://my_table_name&amp;amp;application=BTPolicyService&amp;amp;subject=4l18suAL/hXNCfzykwIlbV0WbtM%3D&amp;#8221</a>;</p></blockquote>
<p>This will return a JSON formatted object:</p>
<blockquote><p>{<br>
“statusCode”:200,<br>
“body”:{<br>
“actionsValues”:{READ:”true”, UPDATE:”false”, DELETE:”true”, ADD-ACCESS:”false”},<br>
“resourceName”:”table://my_table_name”},<br>
“statusMessage”:”OK”<br>
}</p></blockquote>
<p>You can create a policy that would return attributes, from the user’s identity record, along with this JSON object. There are also RESTful services that will just return an allow or deny, which is great if you don’t need as much information back.</p>
<p>So, that was real high level and really basic but I hope that I gave you some ideas for the potential of this engine. Let me know if you have any questions or want to chat about. Also, I am available on a consulting basis to help design or implement this in your environment.</p>
