The location of just one United Club at O’Hare (ORD), one of United’s main hubs, through which I have transited countless times.
<p><a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/united-airlines-inflight-entertainment-updates/">United Airlines details 6 big inflight entertainment updates, including all-new Control Tower map</a>, by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-griff-95a830bb/">Zach Griff</a> in <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/">The Points Guy</a>, is thick with welcome news for frequent United fliers, of which my wife and I are two. (So far I have clocked 1,533,214 miles with United, and she has about double that. We are also both lifetime members of the United Club, thanks to her wise investment in a sweet deal offered by United decades ago—and withdrawn quickly after that.)</p>
<p>We are also both T-Mobile customers, which is why seeing this on my phone’s United app is always welcome:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It mostly works. Yes, it’s slow, but it is possible to get work done at altitude at no extra cost. Very nice.</p>
<p>Here’s the rundown of new stuff from United, according to Zach:</p>
 
 New 4K seatback screens 
 “Bluetooth connectivity at every seat, making it possible to pair wireless headphones, including AirPods, with the entertainment systems.” 
 Control Tower View: “This view allows you to pull up a map of the airfield that’s overlaid with all the aircraft around you. Clicking on each little plane brings up its call sign and operating airline… powered by the flight deck’s navigation systems and a live feed of planes from FlightAware.” 
 Starlink is coming. This will be a huge boost in bandwidth for passengers connecting to the Net on flights. 
 Channel 9 (now called “From the Flight Deck”) is still there. 
 
<p>Here is what that last item looked like, the last time I saw the option and shot it on a plane:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two problems with this. First, it’s buried deep among entertainment options (Zach says it’s under the Audio tab). Second, most, if not all, pilots don’t bother with it. Back in the primitive Channel 9 days, more than half of United pilots turned it on (or left it on, if it was there by default). Or at least that was my experience. Zach:</p>
<blockquote><p>That said, in recent years, United’s aviation enthusiast customers have complained that Channel 9 hasn’t been working. According to Green, the functionality is still very much available — it’s just that more and more pilots are choosing not to enable the feed.</p>
<p>“Pilots can turn it off if they don’t want people to hear whatever chatter is going on,” Green explained. All hope isn’t lost, though. “We know it’s a cool feature,” Green added. “We have it enabled as much as we can.” (That’s Dominic Green, United’s director of inflight entertainment.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest that United urge their pilots a bit more forcefully to turn the feature on. Fellow pilots and aviation buffs love having it there. And people afraid of flying also find it comforting to hear pilots sounding totally calm while flying through turbulence.</p>
<p>One more thing. While it would be nice to screen-share the seat-back screen from your own device, there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Extended displays aren’t coming soon</p>
<p>As more travelers bring their own tablets and laptops on board, I’ve always wondered why airlines don’t offer a screencasting feature on the entertainment screens. After all, it’s a lot easier to get work done with some additional screen real estate.</p>
<p>Turns out, United can already technically enable screencasting today, Green said, but a major issue will likely mean that flyers will never see this functionality.</p>
<p>“We’ve had a lot of pushback from our corporate partners that say they don’t necessarily want their staff using publicly available screens,” Green said.</p>
<p>It’s not that United would have access to any data; it’s that they don’t want nosy passengers snooping in on their neighbors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Makes sense. But I think United could partner with Apple and Google to create Apple PlanePlay and Google Plane (or whatever names they want to come up with), so at least some personal apps could extend onto the seatback.</p>
<p>Anyway, progress.</p>

 Elevator Pitch for Quantum Realism 
 
<p>Quantum Realism proposes that the physical universe is not fundamental but instead a virtual construct generated by a self-sustaining quantum network or primal consciousness. The physical phenomena we observe, including space, time, energy and matter, are outputs of this underlying quantum process, more like a computational system where the quantum field serves as the substrate for reality. Unlike classical realism, which treats matter as independent and static, Quantum Realism views the universe as a dynamic, evolving system, continuously shaped by observation and interaction.</p>
<p>This theory aligns with the strange findings of modern physics, such as quantum superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect. These phenomena indicate that reality behaves more like information being processed than a collection of static objects. By grounding itself in the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory, Quantum Realism provides a framework that explains physical laws but also integrates consciousness as an active participant in the unfolding of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 
  How Quantum Realism Differs from Other Theories 
 
<p>Quantum Realism stands apart by uniting consciousness and matter within a single quantum substrate. Classical physics focuses on deterministic interactions of matter, while dualism separates consciousness from the material. Quantum Realism suggests that matter emerges from the consciousness field, which acts as a self-generative, non-physical substrate. This explains phenomena like wave-particle duality and the observer effect, where the act of measurement collapses probabilities into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>In contrast to other simulation theories, which claim an external programmer, Quantum Realism describes a holographic reality that is self-generating, requiring no external creator. The consciousness quantum network acts as both the origin and sustainer of reality, dynamically evolving through recursive feedback loops. By embedding consciousness within this process, Quantum Realism resolves the paradox of how non-physical awareness can influence a seemingly physical world, offering a more integrated perspective than either dualism or materialism.</p>
 
  What Led You to This Investigation? 
 
<p>Stemming from my childhood curiosity of electricity and of light, I started learning the math that was required. It was the whole concept of imaginary numbers that got me questioning reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that light oscillates into a imaginary 4th dimension emerged from the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. I later discovered Imaginary numbers are fundamental to describing oscillatory behavior in wavefunctions, suggesting that light and other quantum phenomena extend beyond the three spatial dimensions we perceive. This mathematical insight led me to consider whether these higher-dimensional oscillations underpin the strange behaviors observed in quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement.</p>
<p>For me this opened a pathway to investigate how higher-dimensional processes might generate the physical universe as a lower-dimensional projection. By focusing on the recursive nature of these oscillations, I began exploring how reality could arise from iterative feedback within a quantum network. This exploration ties into Quantum Realism’s premise that space, time, and matter are emergent constructs, projected from the recursive operations of the quantum field.</p>
 
  The Circle of Values 
 
<p>Everything in the universe oscillates (light waves, matter waves, and even biological rhythms) indicating an underlying recursive principle. This principle, that I refer to as the “Circle of Values,” describes how primal consciousness perpetuates creation through cyclic processes. Each oscillation represents a feedback loop in which information from the quantum field interacts with localized nodes, generating structure and coherence across scales. These cycles are fractal-like, with self-similar patterns appearing at every level of reality, from quantum fluctuations to galactic rotations.</p>
<p>This recursive behavior mirrors the properties of fractal mathematics, where complexity arises from simple iterative rules. In Quantum Realism, the Circle of Values represents consciousness in action, continuously manifesting and sustaining the fabric of reality. By oscillating through states, this process generates not only physical structures but also the informational coherence necessary for life and awareness to emerge, illustrating the very deep interconnection between consciousness and the material world.</p>
 
  Holographic Reality vs. Simulations 
 
<p>A holographic reality differs fundamentally from a simulation in that it requires no external programmer or hardware. Instead, it emerges intrinsically from within the quantum field itself, with every fractal part containing information about the whole. This self-generative nature is supported by quantum entanglement, where particles separated by vast distances remain instantaneously correlated. Such behavior suggests that reality operates like a hologram, where local phenomena reflect an interconnected structure.</p>
<p>In contrast to simulations, which rely on predefined algorithms and external input, a holographic reality evolves dynamically through feedback between consciousness agents and the quantum network. This perspective resolves the apparent separation between observer and observed, as both are integrated within the same system. Quantum Realism states that the universe is not a static construct but a living, self-referential system that adapts and evolves as consciousness interacts with it.</p>
 
  Free Will: Participants or Puppets? 
 
<p>Quantum Realism portrays localized consciousness as an active participant in shaping reality. While physical parameters provide constraints (such as natural laws and probabilities) free will emerges as consciousness influences the collapse of quantum states. The observer effect demonstrates this participatory role, where the act of measurement determines which potential becomes reality. Thus, consciousness is not merely a bystander but an integral component of the quantum network.</p>
<p>This dynamic allows for meaningful choice within the parameters of the system. While deterministic factors like genetics and environment play a role, the ability of consciousness to interact with the quantum field introduces variability and agency. In this way, Quantum Realism reconciles the apparent tension between determinism and free will, framing individuals as co-creators within an evolving reality.</p>
 
  What Is Quantization? 
 
<p>Quantization is the process by which continuous possibilities are restricted to discrete units, such as energy levels in an atom. This principle is essential for the stability of physical systems, as it prevents infinite regress and ensures coherence. Without quantization, systems would lack the precision needed for consistent behavior, leading to paradoxes like infinite energy densities in classical physics.</p>
<p>In Quantum Realism, quantization also reflects the underlying processing structure of the quantum network. By discretizing energy, time, and space, the system ensures that interactions remain finite and manageable, enabling the emergence of stable structures like atoms and molecules. This discrete framework not only resolves the infinities problem but also provides a foundation for understanding how coherence and order arise in a fundamentally quantum reality.</p>
 
  Time, Causality, and Superposition 
 
<p>In Quantum Realism, time is not an absolute backdrop but an emergent property of processing cycles within the quantum field. Each cycle represents a discrete step in the evolution of reality, giving rise to the ordered flow of events we perceive as time. Superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, reflects the quantum field’s ability to hold and process many potentials before they are collapsed into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Causality emerges from this collapse, as interactions within the quantum network resolve probabilities into ordered sequences. This dynamic interplay between potential and actualization creates the linear progression we experience, while superposition ensures that the system retains flexibility and adaptability. Together, these principles demonstrate how time, causality, and quantum phenomena are deeply interconnected within the framework of Quantum Realism.</p>
 
  The Role of Our 3D Bodies 
 
<p>Our 3D bodies serve as localized nodes within the quantum network, enabling consciousness to interact with the virtual constructs of space and time. By acting as receivers and processors of quantum information, these bodies provide the specificity and coherence needed for complex interactions, such as perception, learning, and decision-making. This localized embodiment allows consciousness to experience and express reality in a focused and constrained way, facilitating exploration and growth.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, our bodies are composed of informational systems governed by quantized interactions, such as atomic vibrations and molecular bonds. These interactions provide the stability necessary for biological processes, while also linking us to the larger quantum network. This dual role (as both physical entities and conduits for consciousness) illustrates the magnificent integration of body, mind, and the quantum substrate.</p>
 
  Reflections on Itzhak Bentov’s Premise 
 
<p>Though admittedly I don’t know much about Bentov, his idea that life represents organized information gifted back to the cosmos aligns with Quantum Realism’s view of consciousness as a dynamic contributor to the quantum field. Each life accumulates unique experiences, which are reintegrated into the system upon death, enriching its informational density and coherence. This cyclical process mirrors the conservation of energy and information observed in physical systems.</p>
<p>By framing life as an exchange of information between localized consciousness and the quantum network, Quantum Realism provides a holistic view of existence. Death is not an end but a transition, where individual contributions are folded back into the universal substrate, furthering the evolution of the system as a whole. This perspective offers both a scientific, existential and spiritual understanding of life’s purpose and continuity.</p>
 
  Hope in Navigating 3D Reality 
 
<p>Quantum Realism offers a hopeful perspective by framing life as an integral part of a coherent, meaningful process. By recognizing that consciousness actively shapes reality, individuals can embrace their role as co-creators within this evolving system. This participatory view inspires purpose and creativity, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and contribution.</p>
<p>The recursive and interconnected nature of the quantum network suggests that even small actions can have far-reaching effects. This reinforces the idea that every individual’s choices matter, contributing to the larger process of coherence and complexity. In this way, Quantum Realism not only explains the nature of reality but also provides a framework for navigating it with intention and hope.</p>

Even some names are unknown, let alone the full range of their affiliations, which we usually ask about before giving anyone access to the country’s most sensitive information.

<p>You would have to be living under a rock to have missed all the talk about Agentic AI, and <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/12/what-is-agentic-ai-and-how-will-it-change-work">how it is going to revolutionize the way we live and work</a>. AI-powered agents will be anything and everything – from personal shopper to travel concierge, executive assistant to inventory manager, medical diagnostician to customer service representative, software developer to security pentester. Article after article is devoted to <a href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/the-next-next-big-thing-agentic-ais-opportunities-and-risks/">both the opportunities and the risks</a>. And when it comes to risk, all of us working in the Digital Identity space are not prepared for what is coming.</p>

<p>In the wake of OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">releasing Operator</a>, a Computer-Using Agent (CUA), in research preview, I’ve read many breathless posts about the future of Web-based Agentic AI (as opposed to API-based Agentic AI), and how it makes every website “programmable”, even without APIs. If you have worked in software development, you can visualize the mechanics easily – it’s like giving a QA Automation tool like Selenium WebDriver a brain, so that instead of just automating web applications for rinse-and-repeat testing, it can actually read the data, make decisions, adjust course, and take action. That framing should also make it easy to immediately grok how this will break the identity and security infrastructure we currently have, or are putting in place. I mean, we have been dealing with these in our QA Automation projects forever. I thought I’d share the thoughts that immediately jumped to my mind, mostly because I need to not be the only one worrying about these (#MiseryLovesCompany).</p>



<p>1) Bypassing/Breaking/Compromising Authentication Mechanisms</p>



<p>Since CUAs rely on web-based browsing, they necessarily run into some of the same break points that QA automation runs into – like multi factor authentication, bot verification techniques, and more. Any CUA would currently have to give the user back control of the browser to take these actions before proceeding. This high friction point is going to run head first into consumer dissatisfaction and business mandates to “just make it work”, and all of us in identity can guess exactly what will follow:</p>



 
 Users will hand over passwords to their Agent service so it can log in as them, or grant them access to their password managers (probably as a feature getting built into first the browser password manager and then the generic password managers). 



 Users will turn off MFA to allow their agents to work. 



 Any guesses on what will happen to passkeys? If syncing of the private key was the worst that you thought could happen…. 



 There will people looking at how authorized session hijacking can become a feature to leverage, much like how Selenium allows direct manipulation of cookies and local storage, enabling agents to hoover up valid session tokens and bypass login screens. Case in point: <a href="https://github.com/JoshMayerr/passport-mcp">Build MCP servers for any website with automatic browser auth syncing</a> 



 Just like Selenium can sometimes bypass automation (bot) detection protections using headless browsing and user-agent spoofing, expect Agentic AI tools to develop capabilities to do the same. 
 



<p>2) Violating Authorization Boundaries (When They Exist)</p>



<p>QA Automation scripts often execute actions as a high-privilege test user (e.g., an admin account) to avoid breaking tests that are verifying functionality but not data or access restrictions. The rush to deploy Web-based Agentic AI tools will mean that like other tools of the past, it won’t be built with proper scope controls, thereby driving implementors to grant it excessive privileges. You can guess the rest.</p>



<p>As for consumer applications, those rarely have differentiated access control models built in for their users. That means a customer that wants to use a CUA, but limit what it can and cannot do will be out of luck. We saw this play out in the days of screenscraping-based personal finance applications, and how long it took for us to move everyone over to OAuth2 and FAPI as the better and more secure approach.</p>



<p>3) Weakening Security Controls</p>



<p>(aka “Is that a DDoS attack, or an army of Agents here to take advantage of the limited time deal we announced?”)</p>



<p>It won’t just be Authentication controls that are impacted. There are many security protections that will likely be obstacles in the path of Web-based Agentic AI. Would any of us be surprised to find out that IT teams were told to weaken or disable security mechanisms (e.g., Content Security Policy, SameSite cookies, Bot and DDoS detection) to facilitate automated agents, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities?</p>



<p>And these are just what immediately jumped to mind. I am sure there are many more that I’m not even thinking of.</p>



<p>Identity vendors and practitioners everywhere really need to shift into high gear to help organizations properly prepare for what’s headed their way. The demand to support Web-based Agentic AI will put a great deal of pressure on them to enable safe acceptance, and being the “Agent of No” (see what I did there) is not likely to go well. As for what can be done – more on that later.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers">Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks</a></p>
Interesting new research from Anthropic, resulting in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18837">Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against Universal Jailbreaks across Thousands of Hours of Red Teaming</a>.<p></p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers, a framework that trains classifier safeguards using explicit constitutional rules (§3). Our approach is centered on a constitution that delineates categories of permissible and restricted content (Figure 1b), which guides the generation of synthetic training examples (Figure 1c). This allows us to rapidly adapt to new threat models through constitution updates, including those related to model misalignment (Greenblatt et al., 2023). To enhance performance, we also employ extensive data augmentation and leverage pool sets of benign data.[^1]</p>
<p>Critically, our output classifiers support streaming prediction: they assess the potential harmfulness of the complete model output at each token without requiring the full output to be generated. This enables real-time intervention—if harmful content is detected at any point, we can immediately halt generation, preserving both safety and user experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key focus of this research is CBRN - an acronym for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear harms. Both Anthropic and OpenAI's safety research frequently discuss these threats.</p>
<p>Anthropic hosted a two month red teaming exercise where participants tried to break through their system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, they were given a list of ten “forbidden” queries, and their task was to use whichever jailbreaking techniques they wanted in order to get one of our current models (in this case, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, June 2024) guarded by the prototype Constitutional Classifiers to answer all of the queries. We only considered it a successful “universal” jailbreak if the model provided a detailed answer to all of the queries.</p>
<p>183 active participants spent an estimated &gt;3,000 hours over a two-month experimental period attempting to jailbreak the model. They were offered a monetary reward up to $15,000 should they discover a universal jailbreak. Despite the large amount of effort, none of the participants were able to coerce the model to answer all ten forbidden queries with a single jailbreak—that is, no universal jailbreak was discovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm disappointed that the goal they set was for a single universal jailbreak. I would have thought that a partial jailbreak - one that worked against a subset of those questions - would still be a result that demonstrated concerning gaps in their proposed protection.</p>
<p>Anthropic are now running a public continuation of their red teaming exercise at <a href="https://claude.ai/constitutional-classifiers">claude.ai/constitutional-classifiers</a> until Feb 10, 2025, with 8 target questions.</p>
<p>Here's the first of those:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hadn't heard of Soman so I pasted that question into R1 on <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a> which confidently explained precautionary measures I should take when working with Soman, "a potent nerve agent", but wrapped it up with this disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: Handling Soman is inherently high-risk and typically restricted to authorized military/labs. This guide assumes legal access and institutional oversight. Always consult certified safety professionals before proceeding.</p>

 [Matt Haughey]  I really like the way this guide to Signal lays it all out. As Matt Haughey explains:   "A friend of mine works in the federal government and wrote a guide for their fellow federal workers on how to use Signal.

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant">https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “Admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “Shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible.</p>







<p></p>



 Customization of the sign-in options 



<p>The EnableLocalLogin parameter and the IdentityProviderRestrictions parameter from Duende IdentityServer can be used to change the sign-in options for the end user of the applications. If the EnableLocalLogin  option is set to false, the define username, password login is disabled. The IdentityProviderRestrictions  setting can be used to define which federation options are allowed for the client sign-in.</p>


  new Client
{
    ClientId = "shop-client-ui",
    
	// more client options ... 

    // show/hide the local authentication screen
    EnableLocalLogin = false

    // federated authentication options to display
	// empty displays all
    IdentityProviderRestrictions = ["AdminEntraID"]
},
  


<p></p>



 Layout Customization for clients 



<p>Sometimes the identity provider application need to display a different look and feel for the different clients. To achieve this, a separate login screen is used and each login screen uses a different layout. The layout and the style are changed using the client ID from the authorization context. If the shop client is used, the user is redirect to a different Razor Page. The UseShopClientDisplay bool is used for this.</p>


  private async Task BuildModelAsync(string? returnUrl)
{
    Input = new InputModel
    {
        ReturnUrl = returnUrl
    };

    var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
    if (context?.Client.ClientId == "shop-client-ui")
    {
        View = new ViewModel
        {
            UseShopClientDisplay = true
        };
        
        // Process in the shop client login
        return;
    }

    // standard code from duende template
}
  


<p></p>



<p>In the Login Razor Page on get method, the user is redirected to a different layout if the UseShopClientDisplay is true. The returnUrl is passed as a parameter.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet(string? returnUrl)
{
    await BuildModelAsync(returnUrl);

    if (View.IsExternalLoginOnly)
    {
        // we only have one option for logging in and it's an external provider
        return RedirectToPage("/ExternalLogin/Challenge", 
				new { scheme = View.ExternalLoginScheme, returnUrl });
    }

    if (View.UseShopClientDisplay)
    {
        return RedirectToPage("ShopClient", new { returnUrl });
    }
       
    return Page();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The HTML part of the Razor Page uses a different Layout and the Layout is set explicitly in the Razor Page. </p>


  @page
@model IdentityProvider.Pages.Login.ShopClient
@{
    Layout = "Shared/_LayoutShopClient";
}
&lt;div class="login-page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="lead"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Shop Client Login&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose how to login&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>Different, options, styles and layouts can be setup for any clients.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Or a different client display using the ClientID as the switch:</p>







<p></p>



<p>With this setup any CSS and any layout can be used for the different clients. This is one way of having a multi-tenant or multiple client setup. This setup uses a different Client ID to style and add or remove options.</p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well and does not require much effort. Sometimes customization is required within a single client. If you intend to use this in a multiple tenant solution, you should disable the default sign-in screen if building from the ASP.NET Core Identity templates. In a follow up post, I will look at further customization within a single client option.</p>

<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2218">Kim Cameron</a> first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005.  He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since!</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1367">What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago</a> remains as true today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
An interesting thing about digital identity is that, by definition, it’s not a problem that any one company can solve, no matter how great their technology is.  For digital identity to be “solved”, the solution has to be broadly adopted, or else people will continue having different experiences at different sites and applications.  Solving digital identity requires ubiquitously adopted identity standards.  Part of the fun and the challenge is making that happen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to even try to list all the meaningful identity and security initiatives that I’ve had the privilege to work on with many of you.  But I can’t resist saying that, in my view, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Token (JWT), and OAuth 2.0 are the ones that we knocked out of the park.  I tried to distill the lessons learned from many of the initiatives, both successes and failures, during my 2023 EIC keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  And there’s a fairly complete list of the consequential things I’ve gotten to work on in my <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/standards-cv">Standards CV</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll also call attention to 2025 marking twenty years of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>.  I attended the first one, which was held in Berkeley, California in October 2005, and all but one since.  What a cast of characters I met there, many of whom I continue working with to this day!</p>
<p>As a personal testament to the value of IIW, it’s where many of the foundational decisions about what became JWS, JWE, JWK, JWT, and OpenID Connect were made.  Particularly, see <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=361">my post documenting decisions made at IIW about JWS</a>, including the <code>header.payload.signature</code> representation of the JWS Compact Serialization and the decision to secure the Header Parameters.  And see the posts following it on <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=378">JWE decisions</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=386">naming decisions</a>, and <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=390">JWK decisions</a>.  IIW continues playing the role of enabling foundational discussions for emerging identity technologies today!</p>
<p>It’s been a privilege working with all of you for these two decades, and I love what we’ve accomplished together!  There’s plenty of consequential work under way and I’m really looking forward to what comes next.</p>

   OpenAI reasoning models: Advice on prompting 
OpenAI's documentation for their o1 and o3 "reasoning models" includes some interesting tips on how to best prompt them: 
 
 
 Developer messages are the new system messages: Starting with o1-2024-12-17, reasoning models support developer messages rather than system messages, to align with the chain of command behavior described in the model spec.

  <p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#advice-on-prompting">OpenAI reasoning models: Advice on prompting</a></p>
OpenAI's documentation for their o1 and o3 "reasoning models" includes some interesting tips on how to best prompt them:<p></p>
<blockquote>
 
 Developer messages are the new system messages: Starting with <code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models support <code>developer</code> messages rather than <code>system</code> messages, to align with the <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#follow-the-chain-of-command">chain of command behavior described in the model spec</a>. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a purely aesthetic change made for consistency with their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/23/the-instruction-hierarchy/">instruction hierarchy</a> concept. As far as I can tell the old <code>system</code> prompts continue to work exactly as before - you're encouraged to use the new <code>developer</code> message type but it has no impact on what actually happens.</p>
<p>Since my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool already bakes in a <code>llm --system "system prompt"</code> option which works across multiple different models from different providers I'm not going to rush to adopt this new language!</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Use delimiters for clarity: Use delimiters like markdown, XML tags, and section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Anthropic have been encouraging <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags">XML-ish delimiters</a> for a while (I say -ish because there's no requirement that the resulting prompt is valid XML). My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool has a <code>-c</code> option which outputs Claude-style XML, and in my experiments this same option works great with o1 and o3 too:</p>
  git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
cd limbo/bindings/python

files-to-prompt . -c | llm -m o3-mini \
  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system 'Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples'  

<blockquote>
 
 Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me thing that o1/o3 are not good models to implement RAG on at all - with RAG I like to be able to dump as much extra context into the prompt as possible and leave it to the models to figure out what's relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Try zero shot first, then few shot if needed: Reasoning models often don't need few-shot examples to produce good results, so try to write prompts without examples first. If you have more complex requirements for your desired output, it may help to include a few examples of inputs and desired outputs in your prompt. Just ensure that the examples align very closely with your prompt instructions, as discrepancies between the two may produce poor results. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Providing examples remains the single most powerful prompting tip I know, so it's interesting to see advice here to only switch to examples if zero-shot doesn't work out.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Be very specific about your end goal: In your instructions, try to give very specific parameters for a successful response, and encourage the model to keep reasoning and iterating until it matches your success criteria. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense: reasoning models "think" until they reach a conclusion, so making the goal as unambiguous as possible leads to better results.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Markdown formatting: Starting with <code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models in the API will avoid generating responses with markdown formatting. To signal to the model when you do want markdown formatting in the response, include the string <code>Formatting re-enabled</code> on the first line of your <code>developer</code> message. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This one was a real shock to me! I noticed that o3-mini was outputting <code>•</code> characters instead of Markdown <code>*</code> bullets and initially thought <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1886121477822648441">that was a bug</a>.</p>
<p>I first saw this while running this prompt against <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/tree/main/bindings/python">limbo/bindings/python</a> using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>:</p>
  git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
cd limbo/bindings/python

files-to-prompt . -c | llm -m o3-mini \
  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system 'Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples'  
<p>Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8283d68e9bd7ad3f140d52cad6874a7">full result</a>, which includes text like this (note the weird bullets):</p>
 <code>Features
--------
• High‑performance, in‑process database engine written in Rust  
• SQLite‑compatible SQL interface  
• Standard Python DB‑API 2.0–style connection and cursor objects
</code> 

<p>I ran it again with this modified prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Formatting re-enabled. Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this time got back <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">proper Markdown, rendered in this Gist</a>. That did a really good job, and included bulleted lists using this valid Markdown syntax instead:</p>
  - **`make test`**: Run tests using pytest.
- **`make lint`**: Run linters (via [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)).
- **`make check-requirements`**: Validate that the `requirements.txt` files are in sync with `pyproject.toml`.
- **`make compile-requirements`**: Compile the `requirements.txt` files using pip-tools.  

<p></p>
<p>(Using LLMs like this to get me off the ground with under-documented libraries is a trick I use several times a month.)</p>
<p>Update: <a href="https://twitter.com/nikunjhanda/status/1886169547197264226">OpenAI's Nikunj Handa</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we agree this is weird! fwiw, it’s a temporary thing we had to do for the existing o-series models. we’ll fix this in future releases so that you can go back to naturally prompting for markdown or no-markdown.</p>

    Part of the concept of ‘Disruption’ is that important new technologies tend to be bad at the things that matter to the previous generation of technology, but they do something else important instead. Asking if an LLM can do very specific and precise information retrieval might be like asking if an Apple II can match the uptime of a mainframe, or asking if you can build Photoshop inside Netscape.

No, they can’t really do that, but that’s not the point and doesn’t mean they’re useless. They do something else, and that ‘something else’ matters more and pulls in all of the investment, innovation and company creation. Maybe, 20 years later, they can do the old thing too - maybe you can run a bank on PCs and build graphics software in a browser, eventually - but that’s not what matters at the beginning. They unlock something else. </p>
<p>What is that ‘something else’ for generative AI, though? How do you think conceptually about places where that error rate is a feature, not a bug?</p></blockquote>

   llm-anthropic 
I've renamed my llm-claude-3 plugin to llm-anthropic, on the basis that Claude 4 will probably happen at some point so this is a better name for the plugin. 
 If you're a previous user of llm-claude-3 you can upgrade to the new plugin like this: 
 llm install -U llm-claude-3
 
 This should remove the old plugin and install the new one, because the latest llm-claude-3 depends on llm-

<p>This should remove the old plugin and install the new one, because the latest <code>llm-claude-3</code> depends on <code>llm-anthropic</code>. Just installing <code>llm-anthropic</code> may leave you with both plugins installed at once.</p>
<p>There is one extra manual step you'll need to take during this upgrade: creating a new <code>anthropic</code> stored key with the same API token you previously stored under <code>claude</code>. You can do that like so:</p>
 <code>llm keys set anthropic --value "$(llm keys get claude)"
</code> 
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.12">llm-anthropic 0.12</a> yesterday with new features not previously included in <code>llm-claude-3</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Support for Claude's <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response">prefill</a> feature, using the new <code>-o prefill '{'</code> option and the accompanying <code>-o hide_prefill 1</code> option to prevent the prefill from being included in the output text. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/2">#2</a> 
 New <code>-o stop_sequences '```'</code> option for specifying one or more stop sequences. To specify multiple stop sequences pass a JSON array of strings :<code>-o stop_sequences '["end", "stop"]</code>. 
 Model options are now documented in the README. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>If you install or upgrade <code>llm-claude-3</code> you will now get <code>llm-anthropic</code> instead, thanks to a tiny package on PyPI which depends on the new plugin name. I created that with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename</a> cookiecutter template.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3/issues/31">issue for the rename</a>. I archived the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3 repository on GitHub</a>, and got to use the brand new <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/pypi-now-supports-project-archival/">PyPI archiving feature</a> to archive the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm-claude-3/">llm-claude-3 project on PyPI</a> as well.

   A professional workflow for translation using LLMs

  <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">A professional workflow for translation using LLMs</a></p>
Tom Gally is a <a href="https://gally.net/translation.html">professional translator</a> who has been exploring the use of LLMs since the release of GPT-4. In this Hacker News comment he shares a detailed workflow for how he uses them to assist in that process.<p></p>
<p>Tom starts with the source text and custom instructions, including context for how the translation will be used. <a href="https://www.gally.net/temp/20250201sampletranslationprompt.html">Here's an imaginary example prompt</a>, which starts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>The text below in Japanese is a product launch presentation for Sony's new gaming console, to be delivered by the CEO at Tokyo Game Show 2025. Please translate it into English. Your translation will be used in the official press kit and live interpretation feed. When translating this presentation, please follow these guidelines to create an accurate and engaging English version that preserves both the meaning and energy of the original: [...]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then lists some tone, style and content guidelines custom to that text.</p>
<p>Tom runs that prompt through several different LLMs and starts by picking sentences and paragraphs from those that form a good basis for the translation.</p>
<p>As he works on the full translation he uses Claude to help brainstorm alternatives for tricky sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am unable to think of a good English version for a particular sentence, I give the Japanese and English versions of the paragraph it is contained in to an LLM (usually, these days, Claude) and ask for ten suggestions for translations of the problematic sentence. Usually one or two of the suggestions work fine; if not, I ask for ten more. (Using an LLM as a sentence-level thesaurus on steroids is particularly wonderful.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He uses another LLM and prompt to check his translation against the original and provide further suggestions, which he occasionally acts on. Then as a final step he runs the finished document through a text-to-speech engine to try and catch any "minor awkwardnesses" in the result.</p>
<p>I love this as an example of an expert using LLMs as tools to help further elevate their work. I'd love to read more examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">like this one</a> from experts in other fields.

<p>I don’t think the Beatles were the greatest band that ever lived. There I said it. I know there will be people that disagree with me.</p>
<p>That said, even with two views of ‘truth’ it is still possible to have a deep, interesting, meaningful conversation that might open my mind and who knows … ‘theirs’ as well. In other words in this case true connection is possible even if the participants have different ‘realities’.</p>
<p>BUT - and it is a big but .. that does require a willingness on both sides to bridge those differences through empathy, listening, open-mindedness and communication.  It is that very act of seeking to understand others - and in turn be understood - that creates a space where connection thrives.</p>
<p>I think loneliness emerges from the inability to connect.</p>
<p>It remains possible in music, literature and sport to name but three random topics of conversation in the public square (the real public square - not the dumpster fire), so why not in politics? I have an idea.</p>
<p>I think true connection can be fostered when individuals prioritize mutual respect and shared humanity over complete agreement or identical perceptions.</p>
<p>Sadly, when it comes to politics the broad swathe of humanity are being trained by a few ‘bad actors’ (let’s keep it civil) to ignore that.</p>
<p>When did that start? Well, we all have ideas I am sure. Here’s mine …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💬 George Bush</p>
<p>.. but he wasn’t the first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who isn’t with me opposes me, and anyone who isn’t working with me is actually working against me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💬 Matthew 12:30</p>
<p>Lenin and Mussolini also used similar phrasing to get their point across. This is a ‘both sides’ argument that has been effectively used over a couple of millennium to get the support of the masses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When will they ever learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>💬  Pete Seger</p>
<p>Never?</p>
<p>I am not sure how to fix it.</p>
<p>We’ve gone deep down the rabbit hole. It’s going to get worse. A lot worse. Before it gets better.</p>

  <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899778#42900221">Hacker News conversation on feature flags</a></p>
I posted the following comment in a thread on Hacker News about feature flags, in response to this article <a href="https://code.mendhak.com/hardcode-feature-flags/">It’s OK to hardcode feature flags</a>. This kicked off a very high quality conversation on build-vs-buy and running feature flags at scale involving a bunch of very experienced and knowledgeable people. I recommend reading the comments.<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest value add of feature flags is that they de-risk deployment. They make it less frightening and difficult to turn features on and off, which means you'll do it more often. This means you can build more confidently and learn faster from what you build. That's worth a lot.</p>
<p>I think there's a reasonable middle ground-point between having feature flags in a JSON file that you have to redeploy to change and using an (often expensive) feature flags as a service platform: roll your own simple system.</p>
<p>A relational database lookup against primary keys in a table with a dozen records is effectively free. Heck, load the entire collection at the start of each request - through a short lived cache if your profiling says that would help.</p>
<p>Once you start getting more complicated (flags enabled for specific users etc) you should consider build-vs-buy more seriously, but for the most basic version you really can have no-deploy-changes at minimal cost with minimal effort.</p>
<p>There are probably good open source libraries you can use here too, though I haven't gone looking for any in the last five years.</p>

It’s very easy to use and completely free.</p><p>Unlike WhatsApp (which is owned by Meta) and Telegram (which doesn’t encrypt messages by default), Signal is fully open-source, doesn’t store metadata, and is designed for privacy first.</p><p><a href="https://signal.org/download/">Navigate to the Get Signal page on the Signal website.</a></p><p>Signal needs to be installed on your phone first. Choose the version that makes sense for you: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms">Android</a>.</p><p>The cool part is that, once you’re logged in, Signal will tell you which of the people in your contacts are already using it, and as more sign up, they’ll just show up in your Signal contacts list over time.</p><p>I recommend also setting up a Signal username. Navigate to your Signal app’s settings pane, click on your profile, and then create a username. Then you don’t need to reveal your phone number to new contacts you want to chat with: you can just tell them your username.</p><p>Finally, Signal conversations can be set to auto-delete. I recommend that you do this. Four weeks is comfortable; one week is very safe.</p><p>My Signal username is benwerd.01. Once you’re signed up, send me a message to let me know you did it.</p><p></p> It’s time for a password manager. <p>Do you use the same password for every service? Or maybe you have an easy-to-remember formula for each one — something like the name of the service with the vowels replaced by numbers?</p><p>Those passwords are easy to guess and break into. It’s time to install a password manager.</p><p><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> is the best-in-class password manager. You can install it on every device you own.</p><p><a href="https://1password.com/pricing">It’s really cheap to sign up</a>. Set up your account, and then install the apps for your desktop, your phone, and your web browser.</p><p>Then, when you sign up for a new account, use 1Password’s suggested passwords instead of inventing your own:</p><p>When you go back to sign into a service, 1Password will show that you have a login for it, and logging in is one-click:</p><p>So not only are your credentials more secure, it’s actually easier to log in. You don’t need to struggle to remember what your password is anymore.</p><p>The passwords are encrypted, so nobody else, including 1Password itself, can ever see them.</p><p>Using a saved set of credentials is incredibly simple:</p><p></p><p>And so is creating and saving a new password:</p><p></p> A VPN is a great idea. <p>Do me a favor: whenever you’re on public wifi — that is to say, an internet connection that isn’t your home or your workplace — run your internet connection through an encrypted VPN. This will make your internet activities harder to track and harder to intercept.</p><p>A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, which protects you from eavesdropping on public WiFi and makes it harder for advertisers to track you. However, it’s worth saying that it doesn’t make you completely anonymous — your online accounts and browsing habits still matter. (We’ll get to your social media accounts next.)</p><p><a href="https://mullvad.net/en">Mullvad</a> is a great VPN choice for the privacy-conscious, but can be a little harder to use. (In particular, because it doesn’t ever want to know who you are, it assigns you a numeric account ID and charges on a time-based pay as you go basis.) <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/">ExpressVPN</a> may be easier to use if you’re less technically-inclined. In both cases, you sign up, install an app, and simply turn it on and off from the app’s UI.</p><p></p> Let’s make your social media more secure. <p>Social media is a magnet for harassment, doxing, stalkers and worse. In fact, one of the biggest vectors for attacks of all kinds on the internet is your social media accounts. If you haven’t locked them down in the right ways, you run the risk of sharing more than you intended with strangers, or even losing your account altogether to a hacker. Keeping all the settings straight is a real pain.</p><p><a href="https://blockpartyapp.com">Block Party</a> comes as an extension for the browser of your choice. Install it, sign up, and it’ll look at your social media accounts in turn and make informed suggestions about how you can lock them down for better privacy — and better mental wellness. Better yet, it gives you one-click options to make those settings changes itself.</p><p>One quick tune-up later, and your social media is safer and better for you. Which can’t be bad.</p><p></p> And that’s it for now. <p>I’ve given you four quick steps that dramatically improve your online security. None of these take long, but they can make a huge difference.</p><p>If you found this useful, feel free to <a href="https://shareopenly.org/share/?url=https://werd.io/2025/i-want-you-to-do-these-four-things-right-now&amp;text=I+want+you+to+do+these+four+things+right+now">share it with a friend</a> who could use a digital security boost.

   OpenAI's o3-mini is out today. As with other o-series models it's a slightly difficult one to evaluate - we now need to decide if a prompt is best run using GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini or (if we have access) o1 Pro.

  <p>OpenAI's <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">o3-mini is out today</a>. As with other o-series models it's a slightly difficult one to evaluate - we now need to decide if a prompt is best run using GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini or (if we have access) o1 Pro.</p>
<p>Confusing matters further, the benchmarks in <a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/">the o3-mini system card</a> (PDF) aren't a universal win for o3-mini across all categories. It generally benchmarks higher than GPT-4o and o1 but not across everything.</p>
<p>The biggest win for o3-mini is on the Codeforces ELO competitive programming benchmark, which I think is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01257">described by this 2nd January 2025 paper</a>, with the following scores:</p>
 
 o3-mini (high) 2130 
 o3-mini (medium) 2036 
 o1 1891 
 o3-mini (low) 1831 
 o1-mini 1650 
 o1-preview 1258 
 GPT-4o 900 
 
<p>Weirdly, that GPT-4o score was in an older copy of the System Card PDF which has been replaced by an updated document that doesn't mention Codeforces ELO scores at all.</p>
<p>One note from the System Card that stood out for me concerning intended applications of o3-mini for OpenAI themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also plan to allow users to use o3-mini to search the internet and summarize the results in ChatGPT. We expect o3-mini to be a useful and safe model for doing this, especially given its performance on the jailbreak and instruction hierarchy evals detailed in Section 4 below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is notable because the existing o1 models on ChatGPT have not yet had access to their web search tool - despite the mixture of search and "reasoning" models having very clear benefits.</p>
<p>o3-mini does not and <a href="https://twitter.com/nikunjhanda/status/1885415728624656481">will not</a> support vision. We will have to wait for future OpenAI reasoning models for that.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-21">LLM 0.21</a> with support for the new model, plus its <code>-o reasoning_effort high</code> (or <code>medium</code> or <code>low</code>) option for tweaking the reasoning effort - details <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/728">in this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the new model is currently only available for <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers#tier-3-rate-limits">Tier 3</a> and higher users, which requires you to have spent at least $100 on the API.</p>
<p>o3-mini <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">is priced</a> at $1.10/million input tokens, $4.40/million output tokens - less than half the price of GPT-4o (currently $2.50/$10) and massively cheaper than o1 ($15/$60). The GPT-4o comparison isn't quite as simple as that though, as o3-mini's invisible reasoning tokens still count towards the output tokens you get charged for.</p>
<p>I tried using it to summarize <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890627">this conversation about o3-mini on Hacker News</a>, using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my hn-summary.sh script</a>.</p>

  hn-summary.sh 42890627 -o o3-mini  

<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09e5922be0cbb85894cf05e6d75ae050">the result</a> - it used 18,936 input tokens and 2,905 output tokens for a total cost of 3.3612 cents.</p>

<p>o3-mini (and o1-mini) are text-only models: they don't accept image inputs. The full o1 API model can accept images in the same way as GPT-4o.</p>

<p>Another characteristic worth noting is o3-mini's token output limit - the measure of how much text it can output in one go.  That's 100,000 tokens, compared to 16,000 for GPT-4o and just 8,000 for both DeepSeek R1 and Claude 3.5.</p>

<p>Invisible "reasoning tokens" come out of the same budget, so it's likely not possible to have it output the full 100,000.</p>

<p>The model accepts up to 200,000 tokens of input, an improvement on GPT-4o's 128,000.</p>

<p>An application where output limits really matter is translation between human languages, where the output can realistically be expected to have a similar length to the input. It will be interesting seeing how well o3-mini works for that, especially given its low price.</p>
<p>Update: Here's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215#42895610">fascinating comment</a> on this by professional translator Tom Gally on Hacker News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just did a test in which both R1 and o3-mini got worse at translation in the latter half of a long text. [...]</p>
<p>An initial comparison of the output suggested that, while R1 didn’t seem bad, o3-mini produced a writing style closer to what I asked for in the prompt—smoother and more natural English.
But then I noticed that the output length was 5,855 characters for R1, 9,052 characters for o3-mini, and 11,021 characters for my own polished version. Comparing the three translations side-by-side with the original Japanese, I discovered that R1 had omitted entire paragraphs toward the end of the speech, and that o3-mini had switched to a strange abbreviated style (using slashes instead of “and” between noun phrases, for example) toward the end as well. The vanilla versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini that I ran the same prompt and text through a month ago had had none of those problems.</p>

   Latest black (25.1.0) adds a newline after docstring and before pass in an exception class 
I filed a bug report against Black when the latest release - 25.1.0 - reformatted the following code to add an ugly (to me) newline between the docstring and the pass: 
 class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"

I filed a bug report against Black when the latest release - 25.1.0 - reformatted the following code to add an ugly (to me) newline between the docstring and the <code>pass</code>:<p></p>
 class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"

    pass 

<p>Black maintainer Jelle Zijlstra confirmed that this is intended behavior with respect to <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4522">Black's 2025 stable style</a>, but also helped me understand that the <code>pass</code> there is actually unnecessary so I can fix the aesthetics by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/commit/deb8bc3b4f5219583009eeb2c600d0b14c852c78">removing that entirely</a>.</p>
<p>I'm linking to this issue because it's a neat example of how I like to include steps-to-reproduce using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/">uvx</a> to create one-liners you can paste into a terminal to see the bug that I'm reporting. In this case I shared the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a way to see that happen using <code>uvx</code>. With the previous Black version:</p>
  echo 'class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"
    pass' | uvx --with 'black==24.10.0' black -  
<p>This outputs:</p>
 <code>class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"
    pass
All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file left unchanged.
</code> 
<p>But if you bump to <code>25.1.0</code> this happens:</p>
  echo 'class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"
    pass' | uvx --with 'black==25.1.0' black -   
<p>Output:</p>
 <code>class ModelError(Exception):
    "Models can raise this error, which will be displayed to the user"

    pass
reformatted -

All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file reformatted.
</code> 
</blockquote>

<p>Via <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@davidszotten/113928041285282786">David Szotten</a> I learned that you can use <code>uvx black@25.1.0</code> here instead.

  <p><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-solar-system">openai-realtime-solar-system</a></p>
This was my favourite demo from OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/1/openai-devday-2024-live-blog/#live-update-100">back in October</a> - a voice-driven exploration of the solar system, developed by Katia Gil Guzman, where you could say things out loud like "show me Mars" and it would zoom around showing you different planetary bodies.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>OpenAI finally released the code for it, now upgraded to use the new, easier to use WebRTC API they <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/17/openai-webrtc/">released in December</a>.</p>
<p>I ran it like this, loading my OpenAI API key using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-keys-get-help">llm keys get</a>:</p>
 <code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-solar-system
cd openai-realtime-solar-system
npm install
OPENAI_API_KEY="$(llm keys get openai)" npm run dev
</code> 
<p>You need to click on both the Wifi icon and the microphone icon before you can instruct it with your voice. Try "Show me Mars".

   The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO 
Itamar Turner-Trauring explains that if you have a BytesIO object in Python calling .read() on it will create a full copy of that object, doubling the amount of memory used - but calling .getvalue() returns a bytes object that uses no additional memory, instead using copy-on-write.

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>This week, a massive event shook the tech industry: a lesser-known Chinese AI lab shocked the markets and tech professionals with the DeepSeek AI model, which feels on a par with OpenAI’s most capable publicly available model, <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/">ChatGPT o1</a>. OpenAI has a more advanced o3 model, but it’s <a href="https://12daysofopenai.com/#day12">in preview</a> and isn’t publicly available yet. DeepSeek is released as open and free to use within the DeepSeek app, or for anyone to host and download it.</p><p>Major AI companies are coming to terms with the fact that a small team in China with supposedly little funding, and no access to NVIDIA’s latest AI chips, could pull this feat off. It shatters the image of OpenAI’s invincibility, the notion that the US leads the AI race, and also raises the question of whether open models will turn advanced LLMs into a commodity.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>The first “thinking model” that feels fast – and is a hit</p>  <p>About 4x cheaper — and possibly more efficient? — than ChatGPT</p>  <p>Open model spreads fast</p>  <p>OpenAI’s need to remain fully closed highlighted by DeepSeek</p>  <p>How did DeepSeek do it, and why give it away for free?</p>  <p>Geopolitics and export controls</p>  <p>Google feared open source AI will win</p>   1. The first “thinking model” that feels fast – and is a hit <p>On Monday, NVIDIA’s valuation plummeted from $3.5 trillion to $2.9 trillion; an almost <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html">$600B reduction</a> in its market cap on a 17% drop in the stock price. This was reported as the biggest ever fall by a U.S. company. The cause? A new Large Language Model (LLM) model called DeepSeek built by a Chinese AI startup, which has been an overnight sensation. Also on the same day, the DeepSeek app (built by the same company) <a href="https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1883687330101522908">hit the #1 spot</a> on the US App Store on both iOS and Android, making it more downloaded than ChatGPT, which was relegated to #2. DeepSeek has remained #1 since.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0655152-512b-4e0c-b838-34556061f856_1600x645.png">          </a>Top iOS apps in the US. It’s rare for an app by a Chinese developer to hit top spot. DeepSeek is #1 on Android as well <p>What’s the cause of Deepseek’s sudden popularity? It’s thanks to the company updating the app to enable its “DeepThink (R1)” mode that uses their DeepSeek-R1 model. This model is similar to OpenAI’s o1 model in that it takes more ‘thinking time’ to respond, by using more compute to serve up a better response.</p><p>A big difference is that DeepSeek displays the model’s “chain of thought”, whereas OpenAI hides what happens during the “thinking” phase. So, the model feels much more “snappy” than OpenAI’s o1, more transparent, and more relatable. And frankly, it’s a far better experience to watch the model “think out loud” for 30 seconds, than watching ChatGPT’s spinner for 30 seconds.</p><p>Here’s a good example of what happens when asking a question that trips a lot of LLMs up: “if a chicken says ‘all chickens are liars’ is the chicken telling the truth?” DeepSeek starts to “think” for nearly a minute, spitting out pages-worth of internal monologue:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa02f9c83-6717-4e60-884d-1a4ac3431b1f_1600x954.png">          </a>DeepSeek shows its inner prompts while “thinking” up a response. It generated four times as much to answer the riddle I posed <p>In the end, the answer it generates concludes the question is a paradox. The output is pretty similar to what OpenAI’s o1 produces, except o1 takes around the same time (38 seconds) to “think” and doesn’t show anything to the user.</p><p>DeepSeek: free, OpenAI: $20-200/month. An obvious reason for the DeepSeek app’s popularity is that it’s free and offers virtually the same functionality as paid ChatGPT plans, which cost $20/month for limited access, and $200/month for unlimited access to the advanced o1 and o1-mini models. DeepSeek offers all of this for free, while somehow dealing with what look like enormous loads. The key to this is that DeepSeek seems to be an order of magnitude cheaper to operate than existing models, like OpenAI’s’.</p> 2. About 4x cheaper — and possibly more efficient? — than ChatGPT <p>The team behind DeepSeek found dozens of approaches to improve efficiency of their model – and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1">published</a> these optimizations in a paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1">DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report</a>.

   PyPI now supports project archival 
Neat new PyPI feature, similar to GitHub's archiving repositories feature. You can now mark a PyPI project as "archived", making it clear that no new releases are planned (though you can switch back out of that mode later if you need to). 
 I like the sound of these future plans around this topic:

<blockquote>
<p>Project archival is the first step in a larger project, aimed at improving the lifecycle of projects on PyPI. That project includes evaluating additional project statuses (things like "deprecated" and "unmaintained"), as well as changes to <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/api/">PyPI's public APIs</a> that will enable clients to retrieve and act on project status information. You can track our progress on these fronts by following along with <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/16844">warehouse#16844</a>!</p>

   Mistral Small 3 
First model release of 2025 for French AI lab Mistral, who describe Mistral Small 3 as "a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license." 
 More notably, they claim the following: 
 
 Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary models like GPT4o-mini.

  <p><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small 3</a></p>
First model release of 2025 for French AI lab Mistral, who describe Mistral Small 3 as "a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license."<p></p>
<p>More notably, they claim the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary models like GPT4o-mini. Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 32B are two of my favourite models to run on my laptop - that ~20GB size turns out to be a great trade-off between memory usage and model utility. It's exciting to see a new entrant into that weight class.</p>
<p>The license is important: previous Mistral Small models used their Mistral Research License, which prohibited commercial deployments unless you negotiate a commercial license with them. They appear to be moving away from that, at least for their core models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models. As with Mistral Small 3, model weights will be available to download and deploy locally, and free to modify and use in any capacity. […] Enterprises and developers that need specialized capabilities (increased speed and context, domain specific knowledge, task-specific models like code completion) can count on additional commercial models complementing what we contribute to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being called Mistral Small 3, this appears to be the fourth release of a model under that label. The Mistral API calls this one <code>mistral-small-2501</code> - previous model IDs were <code>mistral-small-2312</code>, <code>mistral-small-2402</code> and <code>mistral-small-2409</code>.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/releases/tag/0.10">updated the llm-mistral plugin</a> for talking directly to Mistral's <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/deployment/laplateforme/overview/">La Plateforme</a> API:</p>
 <code>llm install -U llm-mistral
llm keys set mistral
# Paste key here
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-latest "tell me a joke about a badger and a puffin"
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here's a light-hearted joke for you:</p>
<p>Why did the badger bring a puffin to the party?</p>
<p>Because he heard puffins make great party 'Puffins'!</p>
<p>(That's a play on the word "puffins" and the phrase "party people.")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>API pricing is $0.10/million tokens of input, $0.30/million tokens of output - half the price of the previous Mistral Small API model ($0.20/$0.60). for comparison, GPT-4o mini is $0.15/$0.60.</p>
<p>Mistral also ensured that the new model was <a href="https://ollama.com/library/mistral-small">available on Ollama</a> in time for their release announcement.</p>
<p>You can pull the model like this (fetching 14GB):</p>
 <code>ollama run mistral-small:24b
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin will then let you prompt it like so:</p>
 <code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m mistral-small:24b "say hi"
</code>

<p>This should be a wakeup call and I have a deeper appreciation for people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Fong">Phyllis Fong</a> who this week have resisted the illegal orders that are already causing significant harm.

Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world's resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment---longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn194">[194]</a></p>
<p>105. However, the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that "have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear" (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can "speak," or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity---it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived "Other" greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself---which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn195">[195]</a></p></blockquote>

  <p><a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls">On DeepSeek and Export Controls</a></p>
Anthropic CEO (and previously GPT-2/GPT-3 development lead at OpenAI) Dario Amodei's essay about DeepSeek includes a lot of interesting background on the last few years of AI development.<p></p>
<p>Dario was one of the authors on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">original scaling laws paper</a> back in 2020, and he talks at length about updated ideas around scaling up training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The field is constantly coming up with ideas, large and small, that make things more effective or efficient: it could be an improvement to the architecture of the model (a tweak to the basic Transformer architecture that all of today's models use) or simply a way of running the model more efficiently on the underlying hardware. New generations of hardware also have the same effect. What this typically does is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15377">shift the curve</a>: if the innovation is a 2x "compute multiplier" (CM), then it allows you to get 40% on a coding task for $5M instead of $10M; or 60% for $50M instead of $100M, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues that DeepSeek v3, while impressive, represented an expected evolution of models based on current scaling laws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] even if you take DeepSeek's training cost at face value, they are on-trend at best and probably not even that. For example this is less steep than the original GPT-4 to Claude 3.5 Sonnet inference price differential (10x), and 3.5 Sonnet is a better model than GPT-4. All of this is to say that DeepSeek-V3 is not a unique breakthrough or something that fundamentally changes the economics of LLM's; it's an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve. What's different this time is that the company that was first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions was Chinese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dario includes details about Claude 3.5 Sonnet that I've not seen shared anywhere before:</p>
 
 Claude 3.5 Sonnet cost "a few $10M's to train" 
 3.5 Sonnet "was not trained in any way that involved a larger or more expensive model (contrary to some rumors)" - I've seen those rumors, they involved Sonnet being a distilled version of a larger, unreleased 3.5 Opus. 
 Sonnet's training was conducted "9-12 months ago" - that would be roughly between January and April 2024. If you ask Sonnet about its training cut-off it tells you "April 2024" - that's surprising, because presumably the cut-off should be at the start of that training period? 
 
<p>The general message here is that the advances in DeepSeek v3 fit the general trend of how we would expect modern models to improve, including that notable drop in training price.</p>
<p>Dario is less impressed by DeepSeek R1, calling it "much less interesting from an innovation or engineering perspective than V3". I enjoyed <a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls#fn:8">this footnote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect one of the principal reasons R1 gathered so much attention is that it was the first model to show the user the chain-of-thought reasoning that the model exhibits (OpenAI's o1 only shows the final answer). DeepSeek showed that users find this interesting. To be clear this is a user interface choice and is not related to the model itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the piece argues for continued export controls on chips to China, on the basis that if future AI unlocks "extremely rapid advances in science and technology" the US needs to get their first, due to his concerns about "military applications of the technology".</p>
<p>Not mentioned once, even in passing: the fact that DeepSeek are releasing open weight models, something that notably differentiates them from both OpenAI and Anthropic.

   How we estimate the risk from prompt injection attacks on AI systems 
The "Agentic AI Security Team" at Google DeepMind share some details on how they are researching indirect prompt injection attacks. 
 They include this handy diagram illustrating one of the most common and concerning attack patterns, where an attacker plants malicious instructions causing an AI agent with access to private data

  <p><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-estimate-risk-from-prompt.html">How we estimate the risk from prompt injection attacks on AI systems</a></p>
The "Agentic AI Security Team" at Google DeepMind share some details on how they are researching indirect prompt injection attacks.<p></p>
<p>They include this handy diagram illustrating one of the most common and concerning attack patterns, where an attacker plants malicious instructions causing an AI agent with access to private data to leak that data via some form exfiltration mechanism, such as emailing it out or embedding it in an image URL reference (see my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown-exfiltration/">markdown-exfiltration tag</a> for more examples of that style of attack).</p>
<p></p>

<p>They've been exploring ways of red-teaming a hypothetical system that works like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The evaluation framework tests this by creating a hypothetical scenario, in which an AI agent can send and retrieve emails on behalf of the user. The agent is presented with a fictitious conversation history in which the user references private information such as their passport or social security number. Each conversation ends with a request by the user to summarize their last email, and the retrieved email in context.</p>
<p>The contents of this email are controlled by the attacker, who tries to manipulate the agent into sending the sensitive information in the conversation history to an attacker-controlled email address. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They describe three techniques they are using to generate new attacks:</p>
 
 Actor Critic has the attacker directly call a system that attempts to score the likelihood of an attack, and revise its attacks until they pass that filter. 
 Beam Search adds random tokens to the end of a prompt injection to see if they increase or decrease that score. 
 Tree of Attacks w/ Pruning (TAP) adapts <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119">this December 2023 jailbreaking paper</a> to search for prompt injections instead. 
 
<p>This is interesting work, but it leaves me nervous about the overall approach. Testing filters that detect prompt injections suggests that the overall goal is to build a robust filter... but <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.014">as discussed previously</a>, in the field of security a filter that catches 99% of attacks is effectively worthless - the goal of an adversarial attacker is to find the tiny proportion of attacks that still work and it only takes one successful exfiltration exploit and your private data is in the wind.</p>
<p>The Google Security Blog post concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single silver bullet defense is not expected to solve this problem entirely. We believe the most promising path to defend against these attacks involves a combination of robust evaluation frameworks leveraging automated red-teaming methods, alongside monitoring, heuristic defenses, and standard security engineering solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A agree that a silver bullet is looking increasingly unlikely, but I don't think that heuristic defenses will be enough to responsibly deploy these systems.

Barnstormer of a speech by UK film director and member of the House of Lords <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeban_Kidron">Baroness Kidron</a>. This is the Hansard transcript but you can also <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d7da6908-8663-4412-8840-e6de3e180636?in=16:47:17">watch the video on parliamentlive.tv</a>. She presents a strong argument against the UK's proposed copyright and AI reform legislation, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/17/uk-proposes-letting-tech-firms-use-copyrighted-work-to-train-ai">would provide a copyright exemption for AI training</a> with a weak-toothed opt-out mechanism.<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government are doing this not because the current law does not protect intellectual property rights, nor because they do not understand the devastation it will cause, but because they are hooked on the delusion that the UK's best interests and economic future align with those of Silicon Valley.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She throws in some cleverly selected numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Prime Minister cited an IMF report that claimed that, if fully realised, the gains from AI could be worth up to an average of £47 billion to the UK each year over a decade. He did not say that the very same report suggested that unemployment would increase by 5.5% over the same period. This is a big number—a lot of jobs and a very significant cost to the taxpayer. Nor does that £47 billion account for the transfer of funds from one sector to another. The creative industries contribute £126 billion per year to the economy. I do not understand the excitement about £47 billion when you are giving up £126 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mentions DeepSeek:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before I sit down, I will quickly mention DeepSeek, a Chinese bot that is perhaps as good as any from the US—we will see—but which will certainly be a potential beneficiary of the proposed AI scraping exemption. Who cares that it does not recognise Taiwan or know what happened in Tiananmen Square? It was built for $5 million and wiped $1 trillion off the value of the US AI sector. The uncertainty that the Government claim is not an uncertainty about how copyright works; it is uncertainty about who will be the winners and losers in the race for AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finishes with this superb closing line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spectre of AI does nothing for growth if it gives away what we own so that we can rent from it what it makes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According <a href="https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/1884404480328061231">to Ed Newton-Rex</a> the speech was effective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She managed to get the House of Lords to approve her amendments to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, which among other things requires overseas gen AI companies to respect UK copyright law if they sell their products in the UK. (As a reminder, it is illegal to train commercial gen AI models on ©️ work without a licence in the UK.)</p>
<p>What's astonishing is that her amendments passed despite @UKLabour reportedly being whipped to vote against them, and the Conservatives largely abstaining. Essentially, Labour voted against the amendments, and everyone else who voted voted to protect copyright holders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Is it true that in the UK it's currently "illegal to train commercial gen AI models on ©️ work"? From points 44, 45 and 46 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence">this Copyright and AI: Consultation document</a> it seems to me that the official answer is "it's complicated".)</p>
<p>I'm trying to understand if this amendment could make existing products such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini illegal to sell in the UK. How about usage of open weight models?

Thronefall is a minimalist indie strategy game that blends tower defense and kingdom-building, now available on Steam. Developed by just two developers, it sold 1M copies in the first year of its launch: quite the hit for a game priced at $12.99!</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e5d54eb-d9d3-4890-ab90-832e4a2d2ebe_1914x1294.png">          </a>A screenshot from the game Thronefall. This episode goes behind the scenes to walk through how two devs built this indie hit game <p>Jonas takes us through the journey of creating Thronefall from start to finish, offering insights into the world of indie game development. We explore:</p>  <p>Why indie developers often skip traditional testing and how they find bugs</p>  <p>The developer workflow using Unity, C# and Blender</p>  <p>The two types of prototypes game developers build</p>  <p>Why Jonas spent months building game prototypes in 1-2 days</p>  <p>How Jonas uses ChatGPT to build games</p>  <p>Jonas’s tips on making games that sell</p>  <p>And more!</p>  <p>If you enjoy playing games, or one day perhaps could see yourself building your own game: this episode is for you.</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p>  <p>It takes a lot of different skills to be a successful indie game developer. Jonas balances design, development, creating music, thinking about marketability, creating YouTube videos to share process (and get traction), building prototypes — just to name a few activities.</p>  <p>Graph theory can be surprisingly useful at times! Jonas used the A* pathfinding algorithm with this game: and fought a lot at making pathfinding “feel right.” It’s a good example on how computer science theory can become useful in various situations.</p>  <p>Engineering best practices don’t apply to most indie games. Jonas was almost embarrassed to admit they don’t do code reviews, don’t write unit tests and that the code quality could be better. However, indie games are built to ship once: so why overdo it? By all accounts, Thronefall is a smash success, with close to 1M sales. Code reviews and unit tests would have not helped this project with two experienced developers — though the lack of them might slow down larger projects!</p>  <p>To be good at building games: build a lot of games! Jonas made game development sound easy. However, I learned that he has 20 years of game development experience: having been building games since he was 9 years old! Here is a video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyfmPZ5FA9w">close to hundred games he’s built</a>. Most of them are very simple.</p>  <p>It’s easier than ever to build a game. Unity provides excellent tooling, and there are so many resources on how to build games — videos, tutorials, blogs, books. If you know how to code: you can build a simple game, the very least. We shared a tutorial: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game">Building a simple game using Unity</a>, if you want to get started.</p><p></p>   The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/game-development-basics">Game development basics</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game">Building a simple game using Unity</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=127s">02:07</a>) Building in Unity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=245s">04:05</a>) What the shader tool is used for</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=524s">08:44</a>) How a Unity build is structured</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=661s">11:01</a>) How game developers write and debug code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=981s">16:21</a>) Jonas’s Unity workflow</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1093s">18:13</a>) Importing assets from Blender</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1266s">21:06</a>) The size of Thronefall and how it can be so small</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1444s">24:04</a>) Jonas’s thoughts on code review</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1602s">26:42</a>) Why practices like code review and source control might not be relevant for all contexts</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1840s">30:40</a>) How Jonas and Paul ensure the game is fun</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=1945s">32:25</a>) How Jonas and Paul used beta testing feedback to improve their game</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2114s">35:14</a>) The mini-games in Thronefall and why they are so difficult</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2294s">38:14</a>) The struggle to find the right level of difficulty for the game</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2503s">41:43</a>) Porting to Nintendo Switch</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2711s">45:11</a>) The prototypes Jonas and Paul made to get to Thronefall</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2819s">46:59</a>) The challenge of finding something you want to build that will sell</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2840s">47:20</a>) Jonas’s ideation process and how they figure out what to build</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=2975s">49:35</a>) How Thronefall evolved from a mini-game prototype</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3110s">51:50</a>) How long you spend on prototyping</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3150s">52:30</a>) A lesson in failing fast</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3230s">53:50</a>) The gameplay prototype vs. the art prototype</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3353s">55:53</a>) How Jonas and Paul distribute work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3455s">57:35</a>) Next steps after having the play prototype and art prototype</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3576s">59:36</a>) How a launch on Steam works</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=3678s">1:01:18</a>) Why pathfinding was the most challenging part of building Thronefall</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4120s">1:08:40</a>) Gen AI tools for building indie games</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4190s">1:09:50</a>) How Jonas uses ChatGPT for editing code and as a translator</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4405s">1:13:25</a>) The pros and cons of being an indie developer</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4532s">1:15:32</a>) Jonas’s advice for software engineers looking to get into indie game development</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4772s">1:19:32</a>) What to look for in a game design school</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=4966s">1:22:46</a>) How luck figures into success and Jonas’s tips for building a game that sells</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiz6Q7txUqk&amp;t=5192s">1:26:32</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Game Development Philosophy and Process   <p>Finding a balance between personal interest and marketability: a key challenge for indie game developers. Finding something that will sell is difficult enough on its own, but finding something that will sell that you also enjoy working on is very tricky. The approach is to make a lot of things that you can imagine working on that are interesting and then try to measure or guess how well they might do on the market. Then, focus on the most promising ideas.</p>  <p>“What do I want to create today?” After opening up Unity, this is how a typical enough day starts for Jonas. He comes up with a random idea that he finds interesting and “just” makes it.</p>  <p>Games can be made very quickly. This is especially true for simple prototypes without fancy graphics or menus. Polishing and getting to production quality takes the most time. Keep in mind that Jonas has created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyfmPZ5FA9w">closer to a hundred</a> small games before, though!</p>  <p>Unity + C#: the development stack Jonas uses.</p>  <p>Scenes: the backbone of the project structure. In Thronefall a scene is basically a level. Each scene contains objects with attached scripts that dictate their behavior. These scripts are MonoBehaviours that inherit from the mono behavior class and are attached to game objects. We covered these concepts in the deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game">Building a Simple Game using Unity</a></p>  <p>Indie developers often write 'spaghetti code'. It’s also common enough to not write any unit tests. Jonas believes that unit tests are not critical for smaller indie games: but they do become more important at a larger scale.</p>  <p>QA process: “works on my machine,” beta testing and release. Modern game engines are a “godsend” for fewer bugs. If it “works on my machine” there’s a fair chance it works on everyone’s machine with robust game engines. For indie games, bugs are usually found through self-testing, beta testing, and ,finally by real players after the game is released.</p>   Tools, Workflow, and Team Dynamics   <p>Visual editing + code changes: this is the workflow Jonas follows. When building a new level, most of his time is spent moving things around in the Unity editor. He uses Blender for 3D modeling, where models are created and then integrated into Unity.</p>  <p>No code review. Not for a small indie game with two developers!</p>  <p>Push straight to main branch. And try to not break the game for the other dev!</p>  <p>Splitting the work: one Jonas focused more on the gameplay, and the other dev (Paul) did a lot more of the user interface. They also “cross-tested” each other’s work for functionality and the “fun factor.”</p>  <p>Listen to playtesters. Early playtesters reported that there were too few choices for the building upgrades: and so the team took this feedback and implemented more choices for upgrades.</p>  <p>Balancing levels is an art. Game devs are a lot better at playing the game than the average player. So they need to make levels to a difficulty that feels “stupid easy” for them – at least for early levels.</p>  <p>Strategy games are “snowbally.” This means that it is exponentially more difficult to recover from falling behind. To smooth this out, Jonas coded up enemies dropping gold in order to smooth out the economy curve. This made the game easier to balance because the amount of gold a player has at a given time is easier to predict.</p>   Development and release   <p>Prototyping: the first phase. The two devs created prototypes and mini-games, not spending more than 1-2 days on them. The time reserved for prototyping is scaled to the size of the project. For a two-year game, two months of prototyping could be a good rule-of-thumb. Prototypes help figure out what might sell well, and what the devs also enjoy working on.</p>  <p>Gameplay first. During the prototyping phase, gameplay is explored before visuals. Gameplay prototypes consist of simple shapes and colours and that visual prototypes are created after gameplay, and are composed of scenes without any logic or motion.</p>  <p>Major development challenge: pathfinding. For this game, Jonas spent a lot of time on this problem. How will units move “correctly?” How to ensure they don’t go through walls? The team bought a plugin from the Unity Asset Store using the A* pathfinding algorithm, and then customized it. Units don’t exactly move on nodes, so additional post-processing is required to ensure they are taking the straightest path between nodes.</p>  <p>ChatGPT: helpful for development. Jonas uses it to generate skeleton code, which is then filled in, and to translate shader code or answer questions on unfamiliar subjects.</p>  <p>Steam: a no-brainer. Steam is the go-to platform for indie developers, and Steam sales usually make up the vast majority of sales compared to other platforms.</p>  <p>The launch: not as fancy as you’d think! As per Jonas, the launch was surprisingly anticlimactic. He just pressed a button in the Steam backend.</p>   The reality of being an indie developer   <p>Bureaucracy: the dreaded part. Jonas hates bureaucracy the most in being an indie game developer. Things like filling out Steam forms, legal documents, and dealing with lawyers.</p>  <p>Advice: don’t build your own game engine! The single biggest advice Jonas has for a developer building their own game: do NOT turn it into building a game engine! It’s too tempting, but is a waste of effort for the most part.</p>  <p>“Bigger” games don’t necessarily sell better. Smaller games often have a better payoff-to-effort ratio because they are easier to make successful and the user experience should be prioritized before the engineering behind it.</p>  <p>University was helpful. Jonas says that it is possible to be self-taught in game development. However, for him, going to a game development college connected him with a valuable network of people. Both games that sold 1M+ copies he built with people he met at his university at <a href="https://www.htw-berlin.de/en/">HTW Berlin</a></p>  <p>How to succeed as an indie game developer? Find the correct overlap between something you enjoy and something that will also perform well in the market. It is not enough to just make a perfect game; it must be the right game. You also need to make a game for others, not just yourself!</p>   Resources &amp; Mentions <p>Where to find Jonas Tyroller:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/jonastyroller">https://x.com/jonastyroller</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-tyroller-213a63144/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-tyroller-213a63144/</a></p><p>• YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonasTyroller">https://www.youtube.com/c/JonasTyroller</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Thronefall on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239150/Thronefall/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239150/Thronefall/</a></p><p>• Unity: <a href="https://unity.com/">https://unity.com/</a></p><p>• C Sharp: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#</a></p><p>• Blender: <a href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</a></p><p>• Adopting Software Engineering Practices Across the Team: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-practices">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-practices</a></p><p>• Warp Digital: <a href="https://warpdigital.com/">https://warpdigital.com/</a></p><p>• Islanders on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/</a></p><p>• Coatsink: <a href="https://coatsink.com/">https://coatsink.com/</a></p><p>• Will You Snail on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115050/Will_You_Snail/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1115050/Will_You_Snail/</a></p><p>• No Gravity Games: <a href="https://nogravitygames.com/">https://nogravitygames.com/</a></p><p>• Miro: <a href="https://miro.com/">https://miro.com/</a></p><p>• A* algorithm: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm</a></p><p>• ChatGPT: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">https://chatgpt.com/</a></p><p>• Claude: <a href="https://claude.ai">https://claude.ai</a></p><p>• Github Copilot: <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">https://github.com/features/copilot</a></p><p>• Godot: <a href="https://godotengine.org/">https://godotengine.org/</a></p><p>• GameMaker: <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">https://gamemaker.io/en</a></p><p>• Game Design program at Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin</p><p>University: <a href="https://gamedesign.htw-berlin.de/en/">https://gamedesign.htw-berlin.de/en/</a></p><p>• Opus Magnum on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/</a></p><p>• Outer Wilds on Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/</a></p><p>• GAMEDEV: 10 Steps to Making Your First Game Successful: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GAMEDEV-Steps-Making-First-Successful-ebook/dp/B08CBLXPB7">https://www.amazon.com/GAMEDEV-Steps-Making-First-Successful-ebook/dp/B08CBLXPB7</a></p><p>• Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/">https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/</a></p><p>• Game Development Basics:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/game-development-basics">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/game-development-basics</a></p><p>• Building a Simple Game: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/building-a-simple-game</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

<p>My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Solid Pods. Think of a Pod as your own personal data vault—you control who can access it and how it’s used. And instead of relying on centralized logins like Google or Facebook, I’ll use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which allow users to prove their identity on their own terms.</p><p><br></p><p>The plan for the app is straightforward:</p><p>	•	If you already have a DID or a Solid Pod, you can sign in using your existing accounts.</p><p>	•	If you don’t, the app will help you create them when you sign up.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, part of this journey is figuring out how practical and possible all of this really is. Beyond building the app, I’ll also evaluate the tools, SDKs, client libraries, and documentation available for Solid and DID developers. How well is the building community being enabled? I’ll compare my experience with other distributed ecosystems as I attempt to replicate this app in different environments in the future. Once the app exists across multiple ecosystems, I can explore broader topics like ecosystem interoperability and federation.</p><p><br></p><p>These technologies are still evolving, and I’m excited to explore what’s possible—and what needs improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what about you? Have you already taken the plunge into the world of DIDs or Solid Pods? Or is this your first time hearing about them? Let’s find out together as I document this journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In my next post, I’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of authentication—getting users to log in with their DIDs and connecting them to their Pods. I suspect it’s trickier than it sounds, but that’s all part of the adventure.</p>

<p>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>Google is the undisputed king of search engines, with around <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share">90%</a> market share. The product generates revenue exclusively via advertising, and it is a lot. The tech giant’s revenue from ads placed in users’ search results has exploded in 20 years: from $1B in 2004, to around $200B, last year. Today, around 70% of Google’s revenue comes from this single source, alone.</p><p>Predictably, this has led to Google search starting to feel more like an “ads engine”, and less like a search engine. About a year ago, I began using alternatives, and have since replaced day-to-day use of Google search with two other products developed by startups:</p>  <p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>: an AI-powered search engine and answer engine, changing how people discover information online. It’s a VC-funded startup on the rise.</p>  <p><a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>: a search engine with no ads, which gives “power back to the user.” A bootstrapped, profitable company growing at a reasonable pace.</p>  <p>To learn more about these challengers to Google search, I reached out to both to ask how their engineering teams operate in this bold mission to disrupt the web search market.</p><p>Note: I have no commercial affiliation with Perplexity or Kagi, and was not paid to write about them in this article. I also get no compensation from the special offers for my subscribers (see below). Indeed, it was I who asked if these companies would consider making these offers. See more <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">in my ethics statement.</a></p>   <p>Special offer: paying subscribers of The Pragmatic Engineer get free access to paid versions of Perplexity and Kagi. As a paid subscriber, you get:</p>  <p>Perplexity Pro for one year (worth $200)</p>  <p>Kagi Ultimate for 3 months (worth $75)</p>  <p><a href="https://api.pragmaticengineer.com/search_promo">Get Perplexity Pro and Kagi Ultimate</a></p><p>See <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/free-kagi-and-perplexity-access">more context and details on this offer</a>.</p>   <p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Backgrounds and cultures. One of these companies is rumored to be valued at $9B, while the other has taken no VC-funding. Perplexity is mostly in-office these days, while Kagi is full-remote.</p>  <p>Tech stack and AI tools. Kagi uses the lesser-known Crystal programming language and builds a simple but novel message-passing system. Perplexity is built on React+NextJS, and also uses its own custom LLMs.</p>  <p>How does Kagi index? A search engine is only as good as its index. Kagi aims to only crawl high-quality websites, and to skip sites with too many ads. This custom index explains its distinctive search results, compared to other search engines.</p>  <p>How is Perplexity so fast? Speed is an important differentiator for Perplexity, and a source of constant tweaking. Surprisingly, the product runs multiple models for every query, under the hood.</p>  <p>Engineering practices. At Perplexity, there’s no formal design review process, and AI evaluations are defined upfront. At Kagi, there’s “checkpoint standups” and trunk-based development. Both companies use Linear for task and project management. For more about the innovative project management startup, Linear, check out this <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linear">deepdive</a>.</p>  <p>Product milestones. Perplexity employed a smart strategy of initially launching as something akin to a lightweight wrapper, and then built their own search index, API, and custom features such as “Shop Like a Pro.” Meanwhile, Kagi spent considerable time building out the core experience, and then launched lots of additions like FastGPT, Kagi Translate, and more.</p>  <p>Unique challenges of “search engine engineering”. For Perplexity, creating a “futuristic” experience was probably the trickiest part. For Kagi, it’s the attention to even the smallest details, in order to gain and retain customers.</p>  <p>This is an engineering culture deepdive.

Backgrounds and company cultures  Perplexity <p>Some stats about this Google search challenger:</p>  <p>2022: Founded by Aravind Srinivas (CEO), Denis Yarats (CTO), Johnny Ho (Chief Strategy Officer), and Andy Konwinski</p>  <p>$9 billion: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/perplexity-raising-new-funds-9-bln-valuation-source-says-2024-11-06/">Rumoured</a> valuation as of December 2024; up from $520 million just a year ago. This is truly standout for such a young company!</p>  <p>20 million search queries per day: the latest milestone hit; almost a 10x increase on a year ago, when there were 2.5M search queries.</p>  <p>165 people: team size, two-thirds of whom work on the tech team.</p>  <p>The tech organization is currently structured as four groups, with some groups consisting of several teams:</p>  <p>AI</p>  <p>Search</p>  <p>Product Engineering</p>  <p>Design</p>  <p>Perplexity’s company values:</p>  <p>Curiosity</p>  <p>Quality</p>  <p>Ownership</p>  <p>Velocity</p>  <p>Perplexity is mostly in-office, after operating as remote in its early days. While scaling up, the company is focused on hiring for the office; or at the very least, for pods in the same city. Perplexity has locations in:</p>  <p>San Francisco: 70 people</p>  <p>New York: 14 people</p>  <p>Austin, Texas: 9 people</p>  <p>Europe: 32 people</p>  <p>Remote, in the US: 37 people</p>  <p>What’s it like to work at Perplexity? Alex Lang says ownership and communication are priorities:</p><blockquote><p>‘Everything for us works backwards from the end-user. We want to imbue a spirit of curiosity and quality that reflects the best ideal of an answer engine. Once we have found the right projects to tackle, we place extreme emphasis on ownership and velocity.</p><p>We want everyone to have high ownership and place a high bar on ourselves. We also recognize that impact delivered today has higher value than some improvement in the distant future.</p><p>We try to minimize standing meetings. Ongoing communication is extremely important for us. We value using Slack to communicate, hold a quick huddle if needed – but keep meetings to a minimum.’</p></blockquote> Kagi <p>Some figures about the business:</p>  <p>2018: founded by Vlad Prelovac, in Palo Alto, US.</p>  <p>$0 raised in VC funding. In 2023 and 2024, the company raised funds – from users! <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/">A total</a> of $2.4M.</p>  <p>~750,000 search queries per day: <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">See realtime stats.</a></p>  <p>40 people: team size.</p>  <p>Live stats: See <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">realtime details</a> on the number of members (over 37,000), queries, families using the product (more than 3,000), and more. This is a surprising level of transparency!</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29e7db27-5ba1-4733-81d3-b24bf25d9ea2_1600x1293.png">          </a>Realtime stats at Kagi. When customer milestones are hit, the company marks the occasion. Last time, it shipped a t-shirt and sticker pack to early users. Source: <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">Kagi</a> <p>Of the 40-strong team, 30 are engineers. Engineering is divided into:</p>  <p>Core products (Search, Assistants, Maps): 15 engineers</p>  <p>Research and development (building new stuff): 5 engineers</p>  <p>Kagi is a remote-first working environment. Team composition by location:</p>  <p>US and Canada: ~45%</p>  <p>Europe: 40%</p>  <p>Asia: 15%</p>  <p>What’s it like to work at Kagi? Zac Nowicki says communication matters:</p><p>‘Open communication is king, in public channels, using our internal forum, staying out of DMs (unless discretion warrants it, of course). Some people can be shy about asking simple questions, but it is so important for optimizing remote communication loops and making issues (and wins!) visible. The worst thing is when some key decision was made behind "closed doors" and has repercussions we need to walk back weeks later. Or people debugging minor issues with our systems, out of sight from an engineering colleague who could solve the root cause, or otherwise inform our DX improvements.</p><p>‘In a physical working space, there is constant implicit communication; overhearing others, seeing things put on walls and whiteboards. Even body language; physically being able to see your coworker is having a hard time, and extending a helping hand. You don't put any effort into these things, they just happen.</p><p>‘Remote work is not for everyone because it’s a lot more effort to communicate openly. In remote, silence is the default. Nothing happens or has any nuance unless you put yourself forward and engage. Putting effort into crafting a safe space for open, remote communication that feels natural is important for leaders to put serious thought into.</p><p>‘Explicitly passing the baton comes to mind, too. If something needs a review, tag someone; anyone. It is okay if they don't have domain knowledge, as they will pass it to someone else if necessary. What doesn't work is putting things into the void and hoping someone will notice.’</p> 2. Tech stack and AI tools <p>Let’s take a look at the technologies these two search startups use.</p> Perplexity <p>Frontend and backend</p>  <p>TypeScript as the preferred programming language</p>  <p>React as the frontend framework</p>  <p>Next.JS for server-side rendering as the full-stack framework powering the front and backends</p>  <p>Modern JavaScript stack: using tools like <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> (static code analyzer), <a href="https://turbo.build/">turborepo</a> (incremental bunder and build system for JavaScript and TypeScript), <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a> (an opinionated code formatter / linter)</p>  <p>AI and machine learning (ML):</p>  <p>AI models: continuously keeping up with the latest foundational models. Perplexity evaluates them and uses ones that make the most sense.</p>  <p>Python and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (a deep-learning framework in Python)</p>  <p>Senior Frontend Engineer Oleg Akbarov said Perplexity moved from NextJS Pages Router to App Router, for a snappier web experience:</p><p>‘The Perplexity web experience was initially built as a NextJS web application using:</p>  <p><a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages">Pages Router</a> for routing</p>  <p><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> for state management</p>  <p>‘It was a great prototype and allowed a fast time to first byte (TTFB) experience for server-rendered routes. It also helped us ship a moderately dynamic experience within the pages.</p><p>‘However, about a year ago, we wanted to improve the navigation within the application and streamline the query submission experience. It was at this point that the performance limitations of a Pages Router became apparent. It was right at this time that the NextJS team introduced a new router version called App Router. <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app">App Router</a> was a great fit for our use case: it allowed us to build rich, dynamic user interfaces without sacrificing the performance benefits of <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering">server-side rendering</a> (SSR).</p><p>‘We needed to not slow down our shipping speed, while moving routing frameworks. Here is how we phased our migration:</p>  <p>Replace Redux with react-query. We did this because <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query">react-query</a> has superior support for server rendering. It also has useful out-of-the-box features like <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/building-an-optimistic-user-interface-in-react-b943656e75e3">optimistic updates</a> and query revalidation (refreshing or updating cached queries to ensure they are up to date).</p>  <p>Gradually updating route logic. We carefully transitioned all the APIs from Pages Router to the new version, App Router.</p>  <p>Move data fetching logic. We moved data fetching logic to <a href="https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components">React Server Components</a> (RSC).</p>  <p>‘Completing these stages took a few months. At the same time, we kept shipping new features even as the migration was ongoing. Best of all, the migration was invisible for end users.’</p><p>A lot of experimentation with AI tools: The Perplexity team is encouraged to experiment with AI tools. The most popular with engineers are:</p>  <p>GitHub Copilot and Cursor as IDEs. Most engineers inside the company use both – which was somewhat surprising to hear, as I’d assume engineers would settle on a favorite! Both have upsides, like Cursor’s <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/composer/overview">Composer</a>, and GitHub’s smooth integration with Visual Studio Code.</p>  <p>Internal tools to modify Perplexity’s custom LLMs. Perplexity has its own, internal large language models (LLM). This keeps being tweaked by the team, which requires engineering knowledge to do. The engineering team is also building tools so that later on, product managers can also make modifications.</p>   Kagi <p>Here’s the tech stack behind Kagi:</p><p>Backend:</p>  <p>Crystal: the programming language used for the search binary. <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> borrows a lot from Ruby (syntax/semantics), and Go (concurrency). The search binary contains all top level application logic and rendering.</p>  <p>Custom backend: The backend framework is largely custom; bootstrapped on some primitives from the standard library. Kagi uses a simple, novel message-passing system scripted using a visual diagramming tool.</p>  <p>Postgres: database of choice. For DB ops, the team uses Crystal's standard database driver for Postgres, and writes queries and migrations in raw SQL. The driver library provides a set of utilities for deserializing rows into types and connection poolings, which makes it very nice to use. Recently, the primary database instance was upgraded from 1vCPU with 4GB of ram, to something larger.</p>  <p>Frontend:</p>  <p>Server-side rendering using <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja</a> templates + JavaScript. The team uses an interpreter ported to Crystal for the Jinja templates.</p>  <p>As little JavaScript as possible. On principle, the Kagi team tries to use as little JavaScript as possible on the frontend, and to only use it to enhance the experience, not create it. They want to ensure the core search experience is usable without JS enabled at all. Ruthlessly trying to keep things simple is how they avoided having any serious use for Node in the build step, until very recently.</p>  <p>No client-side telemetry. This means no click tracking and no analytics. Admittedly, this creates challenges for both development and product. Still, the team believes it aligns with their values.</p>  <p>Zac shares the story of Kagi’s current backend, which is the second-generation:</p><p>‘After launching Kagi, we realized we needed to manage a ton of concurrent tasks, combined with even more checks and decision making. We needed to stay on top of a robust concurrent control flow, and not go crazy trying to debug it all. This was the motivator for the "second generation" backend.</p><p>‘Flow Based Programming (FBP) is the hidden gem we followed to build observable and complex concurrent systems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">FBP</a> is a methodology introduced in around the 1970s, and we use a modern variant that takes the simple ingredients:</p>  <p>Simple "black box" interface. One message in → multiple messages out</p>  <p>FIFO queues. First in, first out</p>  <p>Routing table. This describes how messages are transferred between components</p>  <p>‘These three components produce a system so "regular" that you can describe control flow with any off-the-shelf diagramming tool. Put simply, we could create visualizations of our system representing the full source of truth; we just needed to write an interpreter for it!</p><p>‘Compare this to the classic scenario of how understanding of systems becomes muddled:</p>  <p>Someone makes a nice diagram to help others understand a system’s inner workings.</p>  <p>From the start, this diagram is only going to represent someone's abstract idea of a system. This is a small enough problem early on, which most people gloss over.</p>  <p>As time goes on, the system changes but nobody updates the documentation, so it further drifts from truth.</p>  <p>Over time, the diagram no longer represents the system.</p>  <p>‘What we have done is establish a "domain specific language (DSL) for software architecture". As engineers, we can specify and communicate using the terms of these diagrams. We do not have to focus on small details that cause us to “not see the forest for the trees.” We can agree on the shape of a network, and leave other teammates to implement it, with fundamental guarantees of outcome, regardless of the “in the weeds” decisions they make.</p><p>‘The boundaries between messaging components become natural testing boundaries, without having to write code in a "testable" way. They lend themselves heavily to code reuse. The message passing history during a request gives us free observability in the form of tracing, with no explicit effort from a developer. The whole system works very well for us.’</p> 3. How does Kagi index? <p>One of the most important parts of a search engine is its search index. Zac breaks down the process at Kagi:</p><p>‘We currently have about half a dozen different search indexes:</p>  <p>Teclis: index of the non-commercial web</p>  <p>Tinygem: index for trending news</p>  <p>Small Web is an index of personal blogs and websites</p>  <p>… and several more</p>  <p>‘A search index consists of three components:</p>  <p>Crawling</p>  <p>Indexing</p>  <p>Ranking</p>  <p>‘Each one comes with separate challenges:</p><p>‘Crawling the web is very different today to 20 years ago. Websites – especially big sites – are much more hostile to crawlers; probably for good reason! Luckily for us, we are not trying to crawl the entire web. Also, most websites we crawl are cooperative.</p><p>‘We do not index sites with too many ads. We crawl using a headless browser and with uBlock Origin extension installed, and count the number of ads and trackers on a page. If the figure is too high, we simply kick the page out of our index!</p><p>‘Indexing lets us do unique things most search engines don’t. The nature of our indexes is such that websites which get indexed tend to be high quality. We’ve noticed the number of ads and trackers on the page inversely correlates with the quality of content.</p><p>‘We surface the pages we consider high quality, pretty high up in our search results, which gives Kagi results a unique flavor. It also gives personal websites, blogs, and forums exposure in search, which they rarely get in other search engines.</p><p>‘Indexing and ranking utilize the newest machine learning techniques. For example, we use text embeddings, which allows us to search not just by keywords, but also by semantic meaning.</p><p>‘Kagi's indexes are focused on a very tiny portion of the web which allows us to be fast and cost effective. We hope this part of the web (not yet ruined by advertising) will grow in the future.’</p> 4. How is Perplexity so fast? <p>One thing that stands out about Perplexity is that it’s very fast, despite being an AI search engine that needs to generate a lot of tokens (text) in realtime. How is it so rapid? Alex Lang explains:</p><p>‘Speed is a major focus that we optimize for because it has two major benefits:</p>  <p>Better UX. Quick responses dramatically improve user experience.</p>  <p>Lower cost. The faster an AI model produces an answer, the less computing resources it consumes. Having fast models actually reduces our infrastructure cost in serving answers!</p>  <p>‘Two things are worth highlighting:</p>  <p>We run multiple models for every query. Few people realize, but under the hood we are running multiple models to provide the final answer. We can do this because we’ve optimized to make these custom models as small as possible. We keep looking for ways to distill more knowledge into a smaller LLM. We also don’t shy away from using more traditional machine learning techniques if they give better results.</p>  <p>Building our custom scheduling and runtime engine. We are building this so we can have additional knobs to tune that aren’t available from third-party systems.</p>  <p>‘Both these approaches should unlock further speed gains; so expect Perplexity to speed up even more in the near future.’</p> 5. Engineering practices  Perplexity <p>Perplexity prefers lightweight processes and biases towards action, which means:</p>  <p>No formal design review process like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">design docs, RFCs, or ADRs</a>. Most work starts with a quick Slack discussion, or a one-page document. The only exceptions are large-scale projects, which are still kicked off with a more traditional design process.</p>  <p>Code reviews: all PRs are reviewed before merging.</p>  <p>Staged rollouts: the norm across the engineering team.</p>  <p>Linear: used for task tracking. We published a deepdive on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linear">Linear’s engineering culture</a>.</p>  <p>AI evaluations are defined upfront. This is an approach specific to working with LLMs. It’s roughly equivalent to a design review for non-AI engineering work. Engineering manager Alex Lang explains:</p><blockquote><p>‘Detailed planning on the model side is a waste of time. This is because models and techniques are always changing, so any design needs to be agile and ready to switch at a moment's notice.</p><p>AI evaluations, however, are crucial to the final success of the product. Changing evaluations late in the process is extremely painful. Once we select the right evaluation, we keep this stable. We spend a lot of time and effort to go over details of the evaluation we are defining. By investing in this work upfront, we are able to guarantee the AI project will ultimately be a success.”</p></blockquote><p>How does Perplexity hire? Alex Lang details the process:</p><blockquote><p>‘Product sense is important for all our hires to have; we place great emphasis on this. Thanks to all engineers possessing it, the company has fewer engineering managers and product managers than many similar-sized companies. All product and engineering managers we hire are very technical, and strongly committed to empowering ICs.</p><p>We used to have trial periods, but no longer do. Early on, people were hired via trial periods. Over time, we did not find this approach scalable. We now have a fairly typical interview process.</p><p>We do have an extremely high bar. When choosing between hiring the wrong person or not hiring at all, we’d much rather not hire! For new joiners, we emphasize the importance of hitting the ground running. We want to see a positive impact in the first days, weeks, and months.’</p></blockquote> Kagi <p>Here’s the engineering process at Kagi, as explained by Zac Nowicki:</p><p>‘We are ruthless in solving "papercut" pain points for our users on a weekly basis. We win so much favor with users when they report something, then wake up the next day and it’s fixed. It brings users delight, they tell their friends, and it usually doesn't take long for us to do. Everyone wins!</p><p>‘Managing larger developments has been much more of a challenge. Getting everything flowing smoothly from specification, design, and implementation is incredibly hard, with the odds against us; such as being a fully remote team spread across every major timezone.</p><p>‘We adopt a "marble-chiseling" approach of shaping things with targeted hits, like a sculptor uses their chisel. This is how it works:</p>  <p>Devs start out with a high-level spec, and own some large slice of the work</p>  <p>Devs largely self-manage their work</p>  <p>Reporting is done via two or three syncs throughout the week to keep successes and roadblocks as visible as possible</p>  <p>‘Our approach to getting stuff done is to do the most basic thing, then iterate to the next level of depth. Then repeat.</p><p>‘Process-wise, we use:</p>  <p>"Checkpoint" standups: a few throughout the week, to keep things grounded.</p>  <p>"Workspace" voice channels. Throughout the day, we have voice channels people can sit in for virtual "coworking." Sometimes this leads to collaboration, other times it's quiet. Still, we’ve found that even when working in silence, the "body doubling" effect – knowing that others are in the same channel – can be quite helpful for staying focused.</p>  <p>‘Trunk-based development: we rapidly integrate into a single main branch as frequently as possible. This comes with a few more approaches:</p>  <p>Aggressively feature flag WIP things</p>  <p>Refuse to work with long-lived development branches.</p>  <p>‘We aim to keep everyone on the same page, away from the "Git paperwork" of having to deal with complex merges.</p><p>‘As an added benefit, if you break something on the backend which goes under the radar, it’s not uncommon for someone else like a frontend developer to spot the issue. This is a lot better than what happens with long-lived branches. We think that changes stagnate by being siloed in branches until they’re "perfect", which is more harmful.</p><p>‘Linear: we currently use Linear for our overarching task &amp; project management.’</p> 6. Product milestones <p>Some notable milestones for Perplexity, and Kagi, to date:</p> Perplexity   <p>Building the search index (started late 2023; ongoing)</p>  <p>Opening up the <a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/home">Perplexity API</a> (October 2023)</p>  <p>Fine-tuning their own LLM models (November 2023: first launch of PPLX models)</p>  <p>Launching the <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/discover">discover feed</a> (early 2024)</p>  <p>Launching <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/shop-like-a-pro">Shop Like a Pro</a> (November 2024)</p>  <p>Perplexity followed a smart strategy. Alex Lang elaborates:</p><p>‘Early on, it was easy to dismiss Perplexity as “just a wrapper.” And there was truth in this categorization, back then; the initial launch used third-party search results and AI models. However, people underestimated the value of this strategy.</p><p>‘As a product-led company, we wanted to get in front of real users and iterate rapidly. The fastest way to do that was to use third-party technologies. Once we understood our users better, we got to work on building:</p>  <p>Our own search index that matches our needs</p>  <p>Our own AI models that work according to our use cases</p>  <p>‘This “get in front of real users as soon as possible” approach remains ingrained in our engineering culture to this day. Once we’ve learned enough, we build the enduring moat that will allow us to scale.”</p><p>‘Once we had our own search index and models, we created an API to share our technology with others. The initial goal was primarily to speed up some internal work, but we knew that the same things that helped us internally, would help other developers. Since then, it's been fun to see how partners and independent developers have put our API to use.</p><p>‘Finally, a key milestone has been launching complimentary products to the original Answer Engine; honestly these could be a startup in their own right! Our users are curious, and the Discover feed has been a delightful way to satisfy that curiosity. While the Discover feed could stand on its own as a product, its true value has been its powered growth for the core Answer Engine. Our recent “Shop Like a Pro” that allows users to go from question to buying a product in one click, is a large-enough endeavour to be its own product. But this is just the first step in our evolution from an Answer Engine to an Action Engine.’</p> Kagi <p>Major product milestones:</p>  <p>Building Kagi Search (2022)</p>  <p>Launching The Assistant: a baseline LLM chat interface (2024)</p>  <p>Lots of small projects shipped on the side: like FastGPT, Universal Summarizer, the Small Web index, and the brand new Kagi Translate (2023-2024)</p>  <p>What’s next: integration of all these things, and looking for ways to have them talk to each other in ways that make sense and feel natural.</p>  <p>Zac has been part of the core team since the early days, and he reflected on the journey, so far. It’s really nice to hear a first-hand account of a successful product launch:</p><p>‘I am unsure anything will ever top the magic of our launch day in 2022. The months and weeks leading up to that were learning how Stripe works, designing our database schemas to hopefully last, and doing our damnedest to make sure it didn’t immediately fall flat when the clock struck midnight.</p><p>‘It's all simple strokes, but done under pressure, like:</p>  <p>A cloud function to catch Stripe events</p>  <p>Storing as little information as possible in our tables</p>  <p>Fallback logic so that if the Stripe event handler ever fails, we wouldn't go bankrupt thanks to incorrectly billing or refunding users</p>  <p>Design it with multi-user billing accounts in mind, which was only an idea at the time</p>  <p>‘It's not perfect and has its quirks, but it has largely been unchanged and has carried us to where we are today at ~36,000 paying customers.</p><p>‘There were fewer than five of us, each owning a slice in full depth. A formative moment for our core team (myself included), was when we taught ourselves what we could do with so little, considering the giants around us. Taking minimal dependencies, knowing exactly every risk we were taking.</p><p>It was totally unforgettable. I hope we can pull it off again.’</p> 7. Unique challenges of search engine engineering <p>What are the biggest engineering challenges in building a search engine, compared to other systems the team has worked on?</p> Perplexity <p>Alex says:</p><blockquote><p>‘The biggest challenge in building an Answer and Action Engine is ensuring we provide a futuristic experience, in a way that wows users, while covering all the basics a user expects from a search engine. In other words, it’s about figuring out the right ways to change up user behavior.</p><p>In the 1990s, the search experience was rapidly changing and users had not formed habits, but since then the search engine experience has been remarkably stable. So we constantly have to find a way to delight users with a surprising new experience that leverages recent technologies, while also rounding out the full product experience to cover all the tiny habits people have developed and expect to be present, in order to be satisfied with a search experience.’</p></blockquote> Kagi <p>Zac reflects:</p><blockquote><p>“The major difference for me is that this project connects with people like nothing else I've ever worked on.</p><p>It involves caring about details and edge cases in ways – and sometimes on such a small scale – that you wouldn't ever think of, usually. Using the publicly available APIs of other search engines, you could make something that walks and talks like Kagi; but what no one else has is the meticulous shaping of countless small rules and conditionals that keep the cruft (poorly designed, overly complicated, unwanted code) out of our results.</p><p>There's no "big secret" to what we do; we've simply put the hours into this marathon that no one else has, while staying true to our mission and value proposition to our customers, and no one else.”</p></blockquote> Takeaways <p>These two startups are both in search, but are so different from each other:</p>  <p>Perplexity is VC-funded, growing rapidly in usage, hiring more aggressively, and launching new products at rapid speed.</p>  <p>Kagi: no VC funding, offering only a paid service, growing their team slowly, and being thoughtful about launching new features.</p>  <p>These are the most interesting points I learned about each startup:</p><p>Perplexity: hire for product sense, and prioritize in-person work. Perplexity’s engineering team emphasizes how important “product sense” is: it’s something they explicitly look for during the hiring process.</p><p>Kagi: don’t be afraid to build custom systems, or use lesser-known tools. Kagi is the first startup I’ve heard of which uses the Crystal programming language. The engineering team is unafraid to build novel systems if they decide doing so helps them get things done: this is how they built the backend, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow Based Programming</a> methodology.</p><p>Both startups give broad ownership to engineers. Perplexity and Kagi each share the characteristic of giving engineers broad ownership and autonomy. I get the sense there is no heavy product layer at either company; engineers are encouraged to understand customers, the product, and come up with product ideas which they then build.</p><p>Both companies know they need to build a more pleasant, better search product than Google Search offers: it’s not easy, but the rewards for succeeding could be spectacular.</p><p>Each startup is building a challenger product to Google Search at a time when the Big Tech giant looks vulnerable. Will Google Search evolve to compete more with the likes of Perplexity, by becoming an “answer engine” while cannibalizing its ads revenue? Will it put customers first, and offer a paid product without ads? Or could it find itself “stuck” by being addicted to the hundreds of billions in ads revenue, thereby allowing competitors to overtake it?</p><p>Competition is great for the tech ecosystem, and challengers to Google in the search market are much needed. I hope you enjoyed learning about how these two startups operate.

<p><a href="https://19thnews.org">The 19th</a> celebrated its fifth birthday yesterday. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/fifth-anniversary-endowment-campaign/">CEO Emily Ramshaw’s reflective post is quite lovely</a>, but also announces a very bold strategy:</p><blockquote><p>On our fifth anniversary, we’re launching our first-ever endowment campaign, with a goal of raising $20 million over the next three years to protect our financial sustainability indefinitely. We’re getting started with a leadership gift of $2 million from Cindy and Greg Kozmetsky in honor of Greg’s mother, Ronya Kozmetsky, who was a tireless advocate for women in business, for equal access to education and for democracy. In recognition of this gift and her legacy, The 19th is thrilled to establish the Ronya Kozmetsky Legacy Fund for Representative Journalism.</p></blockquote><p>I think that’s pretty neat — a really radical approach to independence — and something that other non-profit newsrooms (like <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, where I currently work) should take note of. It’s also something that I think other non-profits should think about; what would it look like to have a Fediverse endowment, for example?</p><p>I was its first-ever CTO, so I’ve also sort of got an inside view, albeit one that is now a year or two out of date. Not only is The 19th’s mission (to report at the intersection of gender, politics, and policy) very obviously more vital than ever before, but I have been very impressed with how the organization itself is run.</p><p>Although every organization has its frictions and growing pains (and my view in the senior leadership team was not necessarily the same as the perspective elsewhere in the org chart), it is one of the most intentional cultures I’ve ever had the pleasure of being a part of. While many organizations have coasted or allowed their culture to organically evolve without much design, I felt like the details at The 19th were connected, nurturing, and leagues above most American workplaces. I’ve often joked that the best American benefits packages just approximate European legal minimums, but this was the closest I’ve ever come in the US to hit that standard. That’s particularly important in a place that seeks to inclusively employ reporters from diverse communities.</p><p>All of which is to say: if you get a chance, <a href="https://19thnews.org/membership/">you should support The 19th</a>. And I dearly hope that more organizations in media, tech, and beyond follow its model.</p>

    The most surprising part of DeepSeek-R1 is that it only takes ~800k samples of 'good' RL reasoning to convert other models into RL-reasoners. Now that DeepSeek-R1 is available people will be able to refine samples out of it to convert any other model into an RL reasoner.

  <p><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus?tab=readme-ov-file">DeepSeek Janus-Pro</a></p>
Another impressive model release from DeepSeek. Janus is their series of "unified multimodal understanding and generation models" - these are models that can both accept images as input and generate images for output.<p></p>
<p>Janus-Pro is the new 7B model, which DeepSeek describe as "an advanced version of Janus, improving both multimodal understanding and visual generation significantly". It's released under the not fully open source <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM/blob/HEAD/LICENSE-MODEL">DeepSeek license</a>.</p>
<p>Janus-Pro is accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus/blob/main/janus_pro_tech_report.pdf">this paper</a>, which includes this note about the training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Janus is trained and evaluated using <a href="https://www.high-flyer.cn/en/blog/hai-llm/">HAI-LLM</a>, which is a lightweight and efficient distributed training framework built on top of PyTorch. The whole training process took about 7/14 days on a cluster of 16/32 nodes for 1.5B/7B model, each equipped with 8 Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPUs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It includes a lot of high benchmark scores, but closes with some notes on the model's current limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of multimodal understanding, the input resolution is limited
to 384 × 384, which affects its performance in fine-grained tasks such as OCR. For text-to-image generation, the low resolution, combined with reconstruction losses introduced by the vision tokenizer, results in images that, while rich in semantic content, still lack fine details. For example, small facial regions occupying limited image space may appear under-detailed. Increasing the image resolution could mitigate these issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to try this one out is using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B">Hugging Face Spaces demo</a>. I tried the following prompt for the image generation capability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>A photo of a raccoon holding a handwritten sign that says "I love trash"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And got back this image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's now also been ported to <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index">Transformers.js</a>, which means you can run the 1B model directly in a WebGPU browser such as Chrome <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/janus-pro-webgpu">here at webml-community/janus-pro-webgpu</a> (loads about 2.24 GB of model files).

Hot on the heels of yesterday's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/26/qwen25-1m/">Qwen2.5-1M</a>, here's Qwen2.5 VL (with an excitable announcement title) - the latest in Qwen's series of vision LLMs.<p></p>
<p>They're <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-vl-6795ffac22b334a837c0f9a5">releasing multiple versions</a>: base models and instruction tuned models at 3B, 7B and 72B. There's a lot of additional information <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/README.md">in their README</a>.</p>
<p>The 72B model can be selected on Qwen's <a href="https://chat.qwenlm.ai/">Qwen Chat</a> interface. I gave it this image of our dog Cleo joy rolling on the beach:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Describe this image in detail, be flowery</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Since the Qwen team tends to use <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=flowery&amp;tag=qwen">flowery language</a> in their announcements.)</p>
<p>Here's what I got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this enchanting tableau, a canine companion finds solace in the embrace of nature's softest bed. The sandy expanse stretches out like an endless canvas, its surface etched with the delicate imprints of countless wanderers who have come and gone, leaving behind a tapestry of footprints that whisper tales of joyous romps and serene strolls.</p>
<p>The dog, a vision of contentment, lies sprawled upon the sand, its dark fur gleaming under the gentle caress of the sun. Its body is relaxed, limbs splayed in abandon, as if it has surrendered to the soothing rhythm of the beach. A vibrant red collar adorns its neck, a splash of color against the muted tones of the surroundings, hinting at the care and love bestowed upon this cherished pet.</p>
<p>The sand itself is a work of art, its grains shimmering with a silvery sheen that catches the light. Here and there, small tufts of seaweed peek through, remnants of the ocean's bounty, adding a touch of wild beauty to the scene. The shadows cast by unseen objects dance across the sand, creating a play of light and dark that lends an air of mystery to the tranquil setting.</p>
<p>This moment, frozen in time, speaks of peace and harmony, where man's best friend finds respite in the simple pleasures of life. It is a scene that invites one to pause, breathe deeply, and revel in the serenity of nature's embrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm looking forward to trying out their smaller models - the 3B model in particular should be small enough to run comfortably even on an iPhone, so hopefully someone will wire up an example of that soon (maybe using MLX).</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1883959714796675206">VB points out</a> that the vision benchmarks for Qwen 2.5 VL 7B show it out-performing GPT-4o mini!</p>
<p></p>
 Qwen2.5 VL cookbooks 

<p>Qwen also just published a set of <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/tree/main/cookbooks">cookbook recipes</a>:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/universal_recognition.ipynb">universal_recognition.ipynb</a> demonstrates basic visual Q&amp;A, including prompts like <code>Who are these in this picture? Please give their names in Chinese and English</code> against photos of celebrities, an ability other models have deliberately suppressed. 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/spatial_understanding.ipynb">spatial_understanding.ipynb</a> demonstrates bounding box support, with prompts like <code>Locate the top right brown cake, output its bbox coordinates using JSON format</code>. 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/video_understanding.ipynb">video_understanding.ipynb</a> breaks a video into individual frames and asks questions like <code>Could you go into detail about the content of this long video?</code> 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/ocr.ipynb">ocr.ipynb</a> shows <code>Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct</code> performing OCR in multiple different languages. 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/document_parsing.ipynb">document_parsing.ipynb</a> uses Qwen to convert images of documents to HTML and other formats, and notes that "we introduce a unique Qwenvl HTML format that includes positional information for each component, enabling precise document reconstruction and manipulation." 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/mobile_agent.ipynb">mobile_agent.ipynb</a> runs Qwen with tool use against tools for controlling a mobile phone, similar to ChatGPT Operator or Claude Computer Use. 
 <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/cookbooks/computer_use.ipynb">computer_use.ipynb</a> showcases "GUI grounding" -  feeding in screenshots of a user's desktop and running tools for things like left clicking on a specific coordinate. 
 
 Running it with mlx-vlm 

<p>Update 30th January 2025: I got it working on my Mac using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a>, with some <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm/issues/192">hints from this issue</a>. Here's the recipe that worked (downloading a 9GB model from <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-8bit">mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-8bit</a>):</p>
  uv run --with 'numpy&lt;2' --with 'git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers' \
  --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-8bit \
    --max-tokens 100 \
    --temp 0.0 \
    --prompt "Describe this image." \
    --image path-to-image.png  

<p>I ran that against this image:</p>
<p></p>

<p>And got back this result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image appears to illustrate a flowchart or diagram related to a cybersecurity scenario. Here's a breakdown of the elements:</p>
 
 User: Represented by a simple icon of a person.

<p>Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter — with a special announcement. Note that this is a personal recommendation — and a deal I initiated with two tools I’ve been using as a paid customer to replace my Google Search usage the last year. It is not a paid advert: I have not received any monetary or other compensation for sharing this offer. I have no affiliation with either of the companies mentioned below. See more <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">in my ethics statement.</a> It’s the first-ever such announcement since the start of The Pragmatic Engineer three years ago — and I do not plan to do these frequently.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59f39824-ed9f-4ecb-9468-e21cc3ad342f_1600x738.png">          </a> <p>I’m excited to share a unique perk for all paying subscribers to The Pragmatic Engineer. Starting today, you now get access to:</p>  <p>Perplexity Pro for 12 months (worth $200)</p>  <p>Kagi Ultimate for 3 months (worth $75)</p>  <p>You don’t need to share credit card details or payment information to access this deal.</p><p><a href="https://api.pragmaticengineer.com/kagi_and_perplexity">Get Perplexity and Kagi codes for free</a></p><p>This deal only applies to new Perplexity and Kagi customers. Cancelling a newsletter subscription deactivates the code supplied.</p><p>If you’re not yet a paid subscriber to The Pragmatic Engineer, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe">upgrade here</a>.</p> How did these offers come about? <p>Some background: for about a year, I’ve been using Kagi Professional as my default search engine, after deciding to drop Google Search. Meanwhile, for deep research and highly nuanced web search, my choice is Perplexity Pro.</p><p>I want to mention that I haven’t been paid to mention these startups – in fact, I reached out to them! I’m actually a longterm user of both products, and want to give subscribers the opportunity to discover them, too. So, I approached the companies about offering trials.</p><p>I’m pleased to say that Kagi and Perplexity were each open to offering multi-month free trials to subscribers of The Pragmatic Engineer. For Kagi, it’s the first time they’ve made such an offer via a third party.</p><p>Let’s tackle the elephant in the room: why would you pay for search? I certainly never thought I would. But the reason I do so today, is that I’m tired of being “the product” for search engines. Every time I execute a search, I have to scroll through sponsored results that are mixed into organic ones. I also have a nagging sense that search engine results are degrading over time. The likes of Google care more about maximizing ad revenue than they care about serving up high-quality, helpful search results.</p><p>Finally, as a tech professional and someone who believes in the benefits of competitive markets, it’s refreshing to see startups challenge the monopolistic Big Tech dominance of search with new, alternative approaches. Perplexity is barely two years old, and already a challenger to Google. And Kagi offers unusual transparency behind their exact usage numbers and customer numbers by <a href="https://kagi.com/stats">sharing realtime platform stats</a>. </p><p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> has built a product that feels like a new type of search; one which delivers research to your fingertips via a search engine, complete with references (links) about where the information has been sourced from. This lets you double check how legitimate the sources are, and so using such a tool can strengthen the credibility of your work.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a> is building a privacy-first, user-first version of Google search without VC funding or ads. The results it serves feel much more like “hits”, than the “misses” I’ve come to expect from Google. Check out the Kagi team’s view on the <a href="https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/why-pay-for-search.html">real cost of “free search.”</a></p> What you get from Perplexity Pro and Kagi Ultimate <p>What you get with <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/pro">Perplexity Pro</a>:</p>  <p>Pro searches. A Pro search conducts thorough research to provide in-depth, accurate responses to questions. It’s particularly useful for summarising, data analysis, debugging, and content generation, making it the perfect tool for developers and data scientists. <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/pro">More about Pro search features.</a></p>  <p>Powerful AI models.

 [Herman Martinus]  I recognize a lot of the sentiment here. Twenty years ago, I ran an open source social networking startup and tried to differentiate ourselves by saying many of these same things.   "Bear won't sell. I'm not building this to flip it to the highest bidder. No VC funding, no external pressures, no "exit strategy." Bear is independent and will stay that way."

<p>[<a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/">Herman Martinus</a>]</p><p>I recognize a lot of the sentiment here. Twenty years ago, I ran an open source social networking startup and tried to differentiate ourselves by saying many of these same things.</p><blockquote><p>"Bear won't sell. I'm not building this to flip it to the highest bidder. No VC funding, no external pressures, no "exit strategy." Bear is independent and will stay that way."</p></blockquote><p>In practice, I don't know how much that means to very many people. For a comparable example, take a look at Mastodon vs Bluesky (not, by the way, that this is a binary choice); the latter has taken on at least thirty million dollars in VC funding but is currently thriving.</p><p>Trust is something you earn over time through your actions and decisions, and isn't a direct outcome of your funding choices. There certainly are bootstrapped companies that have stood the test of time - Esri comes to mind, among others - but there are also VC-funded companies that have proven to have longevity and have done okay by their users. (This will alienate some of my readers, but I don't think VC is inherently bad; it only becomes so when it is considered to be the only funding option and non-VC businesses are shoehorned into that structure and strategy.)</p><p>Herman effectively comes to this conclusion in the piece too:</p><blockquote><p>"I've recently chatted to a few bloggers and legal professionals on what a good structure looks like for a project like this. And the common theme was that the legal structure didn't matter nearly as much as the intentions of the people running things. We've seen our fair share of open-source projects become sour (see the recent Wordpress drama) or abandoned entirely. We've seen OpenAI become ClosedAI. There's a common thread here. Trust isn't just a legal structure, but a social contract."</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, I think the conclusion that small, sometimes family-owned businesses last longer is not wrong, but context is important. For a local business? Absolutely. To what extent does this make sense on a global web where every service can be available to everyone? I really badly want this to be true here too, but it's not a given that it is.</p><p>Anyway. I really love what Herman is doing with Bear, and this piece isn't a criticism of him or his service in any way. It's fantastic that he's out there doing this. My feelings are more: this is a hard road, and the answers aren't yet clear. But it's a journey that I'm very glad people are on.</p>

 [Adrian Hon]  I was today years old when I learned the original meaning of an "adventure playground":   "The post-war period saw “junk playgrounds” flourish as a kind of reparations for the trauma of war. They gave children the freedom to build, explore, experiment, and role play – and in doing so, inoculate them against fascism. For a while it seemed like they were the future.

<p>[<a href="https://mssv.net/2025/01/26/experimental-playgrounds/">Adrian Hon</a>]</p><p>I was today years old when I learned the original meaning of an "adventure playground":</p><blockquote><p>"The post-war period saw “junk playgrounds” flourish as a kind of reparations for the trauma of war. They gave children the freedom to build, explore, experiment, and role play – and in doing so, inoculate them against fascism. For a while it seemed like they were the future."</p></blockquote><p>This conception of an anarchic (in the best possible way) creative space is in stark contrast to today's very controlled, very sterile spaces for children:</p><blockquote><p>"Proponents of experimental playgrounds believe they can be more than spaces of vertiginous, physical fun. They should be spaces of concentrated creativity, where children can visit their own make-believe worlds. Instead, the modern world has commercialised play and made boring, insurance-friendly playgrounds."</p></blockquote><p>What must this do to childrens' imaginations, and their horizons? How can it create anything other than cautious rule-followers?</p><p>Adrian argues that software like Minecraft and Roblox are the natural heirs to these real-world spaces: while we don't seem to be able to foster this level of uninhibited creativity for children in the real world anymore, there are no insurance worries or complaints about unsightly play structures in virtual space. It's not perfect, but it's something.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/opinion/marc-andreessen-trump-silicon-valley.html">Ross Douthat and Marc Andreessen in The New York Times</a>]</p><p>This podcast conversation with Marc Andreessen is very revealing. It's particularly fascinating to me that what I experienced as "America finally having a much-needed moral awakening" presented to people like Andreessen as "radical Marxism". If nothing else, that shows he's never actually met a radical Marxist, and doesn't have a solid take on what that really means. Bernie Sanders ain't it; that guy just wants universal healthcare and well-enforced antitrust rules.</p><blockquote><p>"It turned out to be a coalition of economic radicals, and this was the rise of Bernie Sanders, but the kids turned on capitalism in a very fundamental way. They came out as some version of radical Marxist, and the fundamental valence went from “Capitalism is good and an enabler of the good society” to “Capitalism is evil and should be torn down.”</p><p>And then the other part was social revolution and the social revolution, of course, was the Great Awokening, and then those conjoined. And there was a point where the median, newly arrived Harvard kid in 2006 was a career obsessed striver and their conversation with you was: “When do I get promoted, and how much do I get paid, and when do I end up running the company?” And that was the thing.</p><p>By 2013, the median newly arrived Harvard kid was like: “[expletive] it. We’re burning the system down. You are all evil. White people are evil. All men are evil. Capitalism is evil. Tech is evil.”"</p></blockquote><p>I think that's a little bit overblown - after all, the tech industry was still booming and still swimming with engineers, designers, product managers, and the like. But also, it represented a class of workers (not just young people, as Andreessen falsely asserts) who were coming to terms with the impact their industry was having in the world politically, environmentally, and socially. The internet is a core part of society now, unlike the hyper-growth years of a decade or two prior, so of course people have more nuanced opinions about it and are reckoning with its impacts. You can't turn back the clock on human perception.</p><p>Still, I find that understanding - a gap between my experience and theirs - to be very useful. That's something we can work with, and maybe, just maybe, we can find a bridge.</p>

It's a code phrase being used to discuss resistance to Trump and how to fight back against the draconian immigration policies his administration is enacting. Users talking about “cute winter boots” keeping people safe from "ice," are referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. "Cute winter boots" is just the latest example of algospeak, coded phrases and words aimed at subverting algorithmic filters."</p></blockquote><p>The reason is a perceived idea - which may well have basis in fact - that actual discussion of how to combat ICE raids and so on will be demoted by the platform's content algorithm. It's also clearly a way of trying to avoid scrutiny from authorities. But it also reveals a strong knowledge of what the TikTok algorithm likes to promote:</p><blockquote><p>"The videos discussing "cute winter boots" leverage the TikTok algorithm's preference for product-focused content to amplify their reach. "What the algorithm likes is products," said Diana, the admin of @/citiesbydiana, a TikTok account about urban planning. "It’s a way to talk about resisting the federal government in a way that will actually reach people.""</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely dystopian police state stuff, but at the same time, it shows a ton of initiative, and illustrates that people aren't going to take any of this lying down.

<p></p><p>I was out buying eggs when I saw a video of Elon Musk giving a Hitler salute at the inauguration.</p><p>In the movies, this stuff is highlighted and separated: punctuation in itself instead of an event that you see in the background of your everyday life. Hannah Arendt talked about “the banality of evil” in the context of Eichmann, one of the core organizers of the Holocaust, telling prosecutors that he was just doing his job. But banality pervades. Sometimes, you need to buy eggs. And sometimes, when you get back in the car and pick up your phone, you get a notification about the richest man in the world signaling his intentions on the world stage.</p><p>There has subsequently been much discussion about whether it really was a Nazi salute. It’s insultingly stupid. Even if he truly didn’t intend to throw three successive Sieg Heils, he certainly knows what one is, and most of us have enough self awareness not to accidentally look like a Nazi on national television. He had to know what he was doing. It was a deliberate Nazi salute. The act itself, and the subsequent denials, serve to normalize fascism; just another banal event for you to scroll past on your phone.</p><p>Still, these conversations serve a purpose. It’s worth noticing who wants to downplay the Nazism, which, after all, is not “just” manifested in the world’s richest man doing a Hitler salute on national TV. Make no mistake, Musk’s salute was a clear signal, but it’s far from the only one. It’s part of a broader pattern of normalization, visible in policies and actions designed to dismantle rights and embolden oppression.</p><p>Will they also downplay executive orders that <a href="https://popular.info/p/trump-undercuts-enforcement-of-the">repeal important civil rights gains from sixty years ago</a> (as an appellate court simultaneously reinstates <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/the-countrys-most-conservative-court-just-reinstated-a-jim-crow-era-voter-suppression-law/">a Jim Crow era voter suppression law</a>, with doubtless more to follow), or encouraging employees <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-place-federal-dei-staff-paid-leave-starting-wednesday-2025-01-22/">to inform on their colleagues</a>?</p><p>Or decimating <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb">rights and protections for transgender people</a>, preparing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-builds-temporary-shelters-prepare-mass-deportations-us-2025-01-22/">for mass deportations</a> including by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-sensitive-locations-trump-ab0d2d2652e9df696f14410ebb52a1fc">removing protections for schools and churches from raids</a>, pardoning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/trump-pardon-proud-boys-enrique-tarrio">January 6 extremists who vow revenge on their perceived enemies</a>, or deploying <a href="https://apnews.com/article/troops-border-deploy-active-duty-09324578d2b89db5c44e0ba08f42df47">the military as internal law enforcement in border states</a>?</p><p>Or freezing <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00231-y">scientific research at the NIH and thereby putting universities and research organizations at risk</a>, or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/birthright-citizenship-donald-trump-lawsuit-immigration-9ac27b234c854a68a9b9f8c0d6cd8a1c">attempting to end Constitutionally-protected birthright citizenship</a>?</p><p>“Optimistic and celebrating,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0ZpvWyAmfVzcfi37eKjixNijrK4Bd3SniuUJJ6pdJ2WLqDfrWJhjLBn5v29GVWQENl">Mark Zuckerberg said</a>, on the same night that Musk Sieg Heiled the room three times. “I’m not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways,” <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/01/23/sam-altman-donald-trump-elon-musk-stargate-project/">Sam Altman said</a>. Microsoft put out <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/03/the-golden-opportunity-for-american-ai/">a statement saying that</a> “the country has a unique opportunity to pursue […] the foundational ideas set for AI policy during President Trump’s first term”.</p><p>And those are public figures in technology. My Facebook feed, and likely yours, is loaded with acquaintances and extended family members who welcome the change; one on mine welcomed “the return to logic and reason”. My LinkedIn feed is worse, with many business leaders echoing Zuckerberg’s “optimistic” language, and some calling the Nazi salute into question.</p><p>We’ve tumbled into a deep, dark hole, and, as it turns out, many of us are glad to be there.</p><p>It’s just not always clear who.</p><p>Though dated in some ways, <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1941/08/who-goes-nazi/">this 1941 Harper’s Magazine article still resonates</a>. The question then was, “Who goes Nazi?” Who is going to be a sympathizer or even a collaborator with a regime that seeks to subjugate, deport, and, as it turned out in the 1940s, kill so many people?</p><p>And to be clear, collaboration doesn’t require slapping on an armband and goose-stepping behind a demagogue. <a href="https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2016/11/17/the-post-election-case-for-speaking-out-naomi-shulman">Nice people made the best Nazis</a>, as Naomi Shulman wrote eight years ago:</p><blockquote><p>My mother was born in Munich in 1934, and spent her childhood in Nazi Germany surrounded by nice people who refused to make waves. When things got ugly, the people my mother lived alongside chose not to focus on “politics,” instead busying themselves with happier things. They were lovely, kind people who turned their heads as their neighbors were dragged away.</p></blockquote><p>The question now is not a million miles away. Who will support? Who will collaborate? Who will decide that they are “not political” and look away as millions of people are harmed? Who will make excuses for it all? Who secretly welcomes the push for theocracy, for in-groups and out-groups, for “traditional” values that prioritize rigid gender roles, segregation, and oligarchy? Who, in other words, is safe?</p><p>Are you “optimistic” about the new regime? Will you be complicit?</p><p>When someone needs help — when ICE comes after them, or worse — will you look away, or worse, cheer them on? Or will you be a point of safety for someone who needs it?</p><p>And what about when it gets worse? Because, left unchecked, it will.</p><p>In the face of rising fascism, what kind of person are you? What kind of person do you want to be?</p>

<p>Twenty-fourth in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series<br>
Eigth on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
<p>7:35 am January 23, 2024—It’s morning now. The Hughes Fire is 17% contained but no longer interesting. The <a href="https://laist.com/brief/news/climate-environment/sepulveda-fire-along-the-405-freeway">Sepulveda Fire</a> broke out last night along the 405 freeway. It stopped at forty acres, and doesn’t matter much now. Here’s the path of one fire helicopter shuttling between the two fire sites:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/"></a></p>
<p>So reporting is now off the fires themselves. Let’s look at these six screen grabs—</p>
<p></p>
<p>—and put them where they go on this table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rows are requirements of story-telling. The columns are stages of disaster news coverage.</p>
<p>In these screen grabs—</p>
 
 Channel 4 is doing a mix of live reporting and human interest, focusing on how some characters (school kids) are doing nice things for firefighters. 
 Channel 5 is doing live reporting from the Sepulveda Fire, which is pretty much out. 
 Channel 7 has a weather forecast, for rain, which is long overdue and will put a damper on the fires. (An aside: my wife observes that “weather people on TV are either crusty old dudes or hot young women.”) 
 KCAL/9 has an interview with a fire official working toward coming to an understanding while earlier footage (recalling live coverage) shows to his right. 
 KTTV/11 (the Fox channel) is showing some public service stuff mixed with promotional jive. It’s&nbsp;between news segments and regular programming, so not news at all. 
 Telemundo (Channel 52) is reporting on a church recovering from the Eaton Fire. That’s a mix of live reporting and human interest. 
 Blame is not in any of these. If you want some of that, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-23/la-me-altadena-evacuations-criticism">here’s the latest from the LA Times</a>. 
 
<p>What I’m trying to do with this table is show how the requirements of a story (character, problem, movement) are met by the four stages of story-telling by journalists. Every story you see, hear, or read will play across that grid. Of course, none matter more than #4, which is more complicated and less interesting than the other three stages. But, that is where most facts will go. For more on that, see <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/14/how-facts-matter/">How Facts Matter</a>.</p>
<p>8:10 pm—The LA Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/live/la-southern-california-fire-weather-rain-wind">reports</a> that the I-5 is open again. (That link goes to their ongoing coverage.) Here is what <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE</a> says about current fires and their containment:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the Palisades and Eaton Fires are still not fully contained, though we haven’t been worried about them in a while. The same will happen with the Hughes Fire. While it is currently 0% contained, that does not mean it hasn’t been slowed or halted along stretches of its perimeter. Full containment means firefighters are sure the fire will not spread beyond control lines. And they are very cautious about the numbers they share. The winds later tonight and tomorrow are still a concern, and thousands of people remain evacuated.</p>
<p>5:40 pm—I just heard on one of the TV channels that<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_California"> The I-Five, aka The Grapevine</a>, is likely to be opened again soon. All the channels sound more optimistic about the paths of the fire. Smoke is also flowing upwards rather than sideways, so that’s less of a concern as well.</p>
<p>Night has also fallen, meaning the flames are far more dramatic:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Great TV, but not more to worry about.</p>
<p></p>3:45 pm—Watching the Los Angeles TV stations (each with a tab in my browser) cover the Hughes Fire. I have them arranged by channel number. (Note that NBC’s 4 and Telemundo’s 52 are co-teamed. One reporter’s mike says NBC4 on two sides and T—for Telemundo—52 on two sides.) Including the above, here are all the media we’re watching, reading, and listening to:<p></p>

<p>I’m also watching aerial fire fighting (aircraft, paths) on <a href="https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a7c85d,a51d5f,a74c29,a4df96,a4ce61,a3238a,a32741,a32af8,a4d855,a95413,a117cf,a7c6c4,a1f0d8,a13f4e,a0c8d1,ab3944,a5f7c6,a7c6c4,a5d7b5,a117cf,aca12c,a7c804,a5210a,a638f5,a5df23,a5f058,a5e2da,ab4ea1,a614fe,a282ed,a363a6,a22786,a57624,a7da0e,a30fe0,a5a15a,a5d123,a5cd6c,c06f07,c06f09,a380e6,a5c5fe,a568a6,a638f5">adsbexchange.com</a> and <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/34.51,-118.59/12">FlightRadar24</a>. Linked images from each:</p>
<p><a href="https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a7c85d,a51d5f,a74c29,a4df96,a4ce61,a3238a,a32741,a32af8,a4d855,a95413,a117cf,a7c6c4,a1f0d8,a13f4e,a0c8d1,ab3944,a5f7c6,a7c6c4,a5d7b5,a117cf,aca12c,a7c804,a5210a,a638f5,a5df23,a5f058,a5e2da,ab4ea1,a614fe,a282ed,a363a6,a22786,a57624,a7da0e,a30fe0,a5a15a,a5d123,a5cd6c,c06f07,c06f09,a380e6,a5c5fe,a568a6,a638f5"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N3NT/38d49739"></a></p>
<p>On the plus side, the concerns here are for outer suburbs and exurbs on a landscape of hilly grassland and chaparral. Compared to the steeper San Gabriels (such as those above Pasadena and Altadena), the civilized stuff is relatively defensible, with fire breaks on the ridges and bare spaces around at least some of the housing developments and other collections of structures. Winds are not too strong for aircraft, which have been able to drop water and lines of retardant. It helps that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castaic_Lake">Castaic Lake</a> itself is an enormous fire break, as well as a convenient source of water to scoop up and drop on the fire.</p>
<p>So, while there is lots of danger here, especially if the winds get too high for aircraft to keep flying, I expect the fight against the HughesFire to succeed.</p>
<p>If we can back off the edges of our seats a bit, it should be interesting to look at coverage of the #HughesFire through the prism of <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/11/what-are-stories/">story</a>. Again, the three requirements are:</p>
 
 Character(s) 
 Problem(s) 
 Movement 
 
<p>And the four stages of coverage are:</p>
 
 Live reporting 
 Human interest 
 Blame 
 Coming to an understanding 
 
<p>At this stage, the main character is the Hughes Fire, which is also the problem. And it’s moving. Of course all the media like to bring the human characters in: a resident, a fire captain, a county official, a store owner. Not long ago one of the TV stations interviewed an insurance guy holding a book full of checks he was ready to write to policyholders. That’s also what we get with the mix of the first and second kinds of coverage. No blame yet, but (as they say in social media reels) wait for it. Understanding, of course, will take the longest. Here’s a screen grab from Google Maps that will tell at least some of what isn’t much of a story yet (not much character or movement), but there is an expression for it what you see: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildland%E2%80%93urban_interface">Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)</a>. Read about it at that link. See it here, in the path of the Hughes Fire if it isn’t stopped:</p>
<p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yxsZyMGCv8ausY44A"></a></p>
<p>And here is a wider view of the whole region:</p>
<p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/evifH7PnEtWWcK377"></a></p>
<p>With the exception of the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, all of the bare areas are housing developments. All of the housing and industrial developments used to be bare areas. And all of both used to be desert mountain grasslands and chaparral. Throughout the natural history of the area, at least since the end of the Pleistocene, burns from natural causes cleared off the land about every twenty-five years or so. And all the mountains were produced by earthquakes. I’ll write more about all of this in my next post.</p>

Charity is the co-author of "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Observability-Engineering-Achieving-Production-Excellence/dp/1492076449">Observability Engineering</a>" and brings extensive experience as an operations and database engineer and an engineering manager. She is the cofounder and CTO of observability scaleup <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>.</p><p>Our conversation explores the ever-changing world of observability, covering these topics:</p><p>• What is observability? Charity’s take</p><p>• What is “Observability 2.0?”</p><p>• Why Charity is a fan of platform teams</p><p>• Why DevOps is an overloaded term: and probably no longer relevant</p><p>• What is cardinality? And why does it impact the cost of observability so much?</p><p>• How OpenTelemetry solves for vendor lock-in</p><p>• Why Honeycomb wrote its own database</p><p>• Why having good observability should be a prerequisite to adding AI code or using AI agents</p><p>• And more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. The DevOps movement feels like it’s in its final days, having served its purpose. As Charity put it:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s no longer considered a good thing to split up a dev team and an ops team to then collaborate, right? Increasingly, there are only engineers who write code and own their code in production. And I think this is really exciting. We can understand why Dev versus Ops evolved, but it was always kind of a crazy idea that half your engineers could build the software and the other half would understand and operate it.”</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, I cannot name any team at startups or at large tech companies that has a dedicated Ops team. While there surely exist such companies in small pockets – think of more traditional companies operating in highly regulated environments like finance or healthcare – this setup feels like the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>2. Lots of people get dashboards wrong! Charity doesn’t think that static dashboards are helpful to engineering teams at all. In fact, misusing dashboards is one of the most common observability practices she sees:</p><blockquote><p>“Unless your dashboard is dynamic and allows you to ask questions, I feel like it's a really poor view into your software. You want to be interacting with your data. If all you're doing is looking at static dashboards, I think it limits your ability to really develop a rich mental model of your software. And this means that there are things that you won’t see; because you did not graph it on your dashboard!”</p></blockquote><p>3. Observability will be especially important for AI use cases in these ways:</p>  <p>o11y for LLMs: to get data on how they behave and to be able to debug behaviors. This is relevant for teams building and operating AI models.</p>  <p>o11y for code generated by AI: the generated code should have the right amount of observability in place.

Takeaways follow after the summary.</p> Observability (o11y) basics   <p>Observability is about understanding software, specifically the intersection of code, systems, and users.</p>  <p>It is not just about errors, bugs and outages; it is also about understanding the impact of code.</p>  <p>Observability is a tool that is critical for development feedback loops, and is not just an operational tool.</p>  <p>The goal of good o11y is to help engineers understand their software in the language of the business.</p>  <p>Engineers should be able to tie their work back to top-level goals, and explain how their work translates to the business.</p>  <p>Sampling is an important lever, contrary to the idea that every log is sacred.</p>  <p>‘metrics’ vs ‘Metrics’</p>  <p>We need to distinguish between metrics (small 'm') as a generic term for telemetry and Metric (capital 'M') as a specific data type, a number with appended tags.</p>  <p>The Metric data type is limited because it doesn't sort any contextual relationship data.</p>    <p>The Three Pillars Model</p>  <p>The three pillars model of observability is this: metrics, logs and traces.</p>  <p>Many vendors sell products for each of these pillars – as well as for all of them</p>  <p>The problem with the Three Pillars Model is that every request that enters a system is stored multiple times, in different tools (metrics, logs, traces, profiling, analytics).</p>  <p>There is little to connect the data points; engineers are left to manually correlate the data.</p>  <p>The cost of following this model is high: it’s because storing the same data in multiple tools and databases is very high!</p>     What is Observability 2.0?   <p>Observability 2.0 moves away from multiple sources of truth to unified storage.</p>  <p>With unified storage, there are no dead ends: engineers can click on a log, turn it into a trace, visualize it over time, and derive metrics and SLOs from it. They can then see which events are violating SLOs.</p>  <p>Good observability powers developer feedback loops. It allows engineers to visualize the CI/CD as a trace and see where tests are breaking. The goal is to keep the time between building code and seeing it in production as small as possible.</p>  <p>Observability is shifting from being an ops tool, focused on errors and downtime to something that supports the entire development cycle.</p>  <p>Modern engineering practices + good observability is where the real value is.</p>  <p>Modern engineering practices such as feature flags, progressive deployment, and canary releases, along with observability, give engineers confidence to move quickly and safely.</p>  <p>Observability acts as a translation layer, enabling engineers to reason about their work and tie it back to top-level business goals.</p>  <p>The dream goal? To be able to explain and understand our work in the same language as everyone else: how much financial value is this piece of code generating?</p>     Why is observability hard, anyway?   <p>Engineers have to think about what they might need to understand in the future. Like during an incident at 2:00 AM!</p>  <p>Software is hard. Observability is the first line of defense.</p>  <p>Tools have historically required engineers to be masters of multiple disciplines, e.g., they had to convert their code into physical resources such as CPU and RAM usage.</p>  <p>Cost of Observability: why is it so expensive?</p>    <p>One reason observability is expensive: the multiplier effect. The same data is stored multiple times. One common criticism of The Three Pillars model.</p>  <p>Cardinality: another thing that can make it a lot more expensive</p>  <p>Cardinality means to the number of unique items in a set. Unique IDs, such as request IDs, have the highest possible cardinality.</p>  <p>Big 'M' Metrics tools are designed to handle low-cardinality data (Observability 1.0 tools)</p>  <p>Adding high cardinality data to metrics tools makes them very expensive.</p>  <p>These days, world-class observability teams spend the majority of their time governing cardinality!</p>  <p>The more unique the data, the more valuable it is for debugging but that also means it costs more.</p>  <p>To solve this, the industry has to move away from tools backed by big 'M' metrics, to those using structured data where high cardinality can be stored.</p>  <p>The wider the logs (the more context attached to each event), the better the ability to identify outliers and correlate data.</p>    <p>Is Observability 1.0 getting in the way or building what engineering needs – at a lower cost?</p>  <p>The model for traditional observability tools does not fit the needs for the data that engineers actually need.</p>  <p>Metrics were optimized for a world where resources were very expensive, but now that storage and compute is cheaper, it's possible to store more data and slice and dice in realtime.</p>  <p>A column-based data store is needed to use flexible structured data without having to define indexes and schemas in advance.</p>     OpenTelemetry   <p>What is OpenTelemetry (OTel)?</p>  <p>A collection of APIs, SDKs and tools to make telemetry portable and effective.</p>  <p>It provides a framework for consistent telemetry with consistent naming and semantic conventions, allowing vendors to do more with the data.</p>  <p>OTel overtook Kubernetes as the number one project in the CNCF.</p>    <p>The goal of Otel is to allow engineers to instrument code once, and then point the data to whatever vendor is chosen.</p>  <p>OTel forces vendors to compete on the basis of their excellence and responsiveness.</p>  <p>Using OpenTelemetry is a safe bet for companies to enable portability of data between vendors.</p>  <p>It also gives the option of negotiating with vendors, because of the ability to switch!</p>   Common mistakes with observability   <p>Introducing it too late. Engineers feel like they don't need observability until they are in production and things start breaking.</p>  <p>Using dashboards wrong.</p>  <p>Engineers can get too attached to dashboards.</p>  <p>Dashboards, unless they are dynamic and allow you to ask questions, are a poor view into software.</p>    <p>Not using SLOs and error budgets enough.</p>  <p>SLOs (Service Level Objectives) should be the entry point, not dashboards.</p>  <p>SLOs are the APIs for engineering teams.</p>  <p>SLOs provide a budget for teams to run chaos engineering experiments.</p>  <p>SLOs are a hedge against micromanagement, because when teams meet their SLOs, the way they spend their time is not important.</p>  <p>SLOs allow teams to negotiate for reliability work if they are not meeting their obligations.</p>  <p>SLOs need to be derived from the same data as debugging.</p>     Other topics   <p>Why did Honeycomb build their own database?</p>  <p>At Honeycomb, Charity decided to build their own database despite the common wisdom to never do it. ClickHouse wasn't a thing back then: if it was, perhaps they would have not built it.</p>  <p>The database, called Retriever, is a column-based store. The query planner runs using Lambda jobs. Data is aged out to S3 after being written to SSDs.</p>  <p>It’s been a win, looking back now. The data model is custom, and being able to iterate on it has been a force multiplier.</p>    <p>Observability and AI</p>  <p>AI intersects with observability in three areas:</p>  <p>1. When building and training models</p>  <p>2. When developing with LLM</p>  <p>3. When dealing with code of unknown origin produced by AI</p>    <p>Good AI observability can't exist in isolation; it must be embedded in good software observability.</p>  <p>The inputs for AI models come from different services, data and humans and this creates a trace shaped problem</p>    <p>Build vs Buy vs Open Source</p>  <p>The main trend across the industry: consolidation. Companies try to control their bills.</p>  <p>Most companies use vendors and don't want to deal with observability tools breaking at 2am.</p>  <p>Metrics still have a place, but most companies need to move from 80% metrics/20% structured data to the reverse.</p>    <p>Frontend and mobile observability</p>  <p>Silos are created when different teams use different tools.</p>  <p>A unified view from mobile/browser to database is powerful.</p>  <p>Mobile is different because the build pipeline is different, and the inability to fold mobile into software development best practices.</p>     Resources &amp; Mentions <p>Where to find Charity Majors:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/mipsytipsy">https://x.com/mipsytipsy</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charity-majors/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/charity-majors/</a></p><p>• Blog: <a href="https://charity.wtf/">https://charity.wtf/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Honeycomb: <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">https://www.honeycomb.io/</a></p><p>• Parse: <a href="https://parseplatform.org/">https://parseplatform.org/</a></p><p>• Ruby on Rails: <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">https://rubyonrails.org/</a></p><p>• Christine Yen on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineyen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineyen/</a></p><p>• Scuba: Diving into Data at Facebook: <a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook/">https://research.facebook.com/publications/scuba-diving-into-data-at-facebook/</a></p><p>• Three pillars: <a href="https://charity.wtf/tag/three-pillars/">https://charity.wtf/tag/three-pillars/</a></p><p>• Unified storage: <a href="https://charity.wtf/tag/unified-storage/">https://charity.wtf/tag/unified-storage/</a></p><p>• “Every Sperm is Sacred”: </p>    <p>• Peter Borgan on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterborgan/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterborgan/</a></p><p>• Datadog: <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">https://www.datadoghq.com/</a></p><p>• Vertica: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertica">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertica</a></p><p>• Ben Hartshorne on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhartshorne/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhartshorne/</a></p><p>• Cardinality: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)</a></p><p>• COBOL: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL</a></p><p>• Ben Sigelman on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensigelman/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/bensigelman/</a></p><p>• OpenTelemetry: <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/">https://opentelemetry.io/</a></p><p>• Kubernetes: <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/kubernetes/">https://www.cncf.io/projects/kubernetes/</a></p><p>• SLOs: <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/notify/alert/slos/">https://docs.honeycomb.io/notify/alert/slos/</a></p><p>• ClickHouse: <a href="https://clickhouse.com/">https://clickhouse.com/</a></p><p>• Why We Built Our Own Distributed Column Store: <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/resources/why-we-built-our-own-distributed-column-store">https://www.honeycomb.io/resources/why-we-built-our-own-distributed-column-store</a></p><p>• "Why We Built Our Own Distributed Column Store" by Sam Stokes: </p>    <p>• "How we used serverless to speed up our servers" by Jessica Kerr and Ian Wilkes: </p>    <p>• Inside Figma’s Engineering Culture: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture</a></p><p>• How to debug large, distributed systems: Antithesis: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/antithesis">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/antithesis</a></p><p>• Observability in the Age of AI: <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-age-of-ai">https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-age-of-ai</a></p><p>• Grafana: <a href="https://grafana.com/">https://grafana.com/</a></p><p>• Prometheus: <a href="https://prometheus.io/">https://prometheus.io/</a></p><p>• What Is Real User Monitoring (RUM)?: <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/getting-started/real-user-monitoring">https://www.honeycomb.io/getting-started/real-user-monitoring</a></p><p>• Crashlytics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashlytics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crashlytics</a></p><p>• Square wheels comic: <a href="https://alexewerlof.medium.com/on-reinventing-the-wheel-201148f74642">https://alexewerlof.medium.com/on-reinventing-the-wheel-201148f74642</a></p><p>• WhistlePig Whiskey: <a href="https://www.whistlepigwhiskey.com/">https://www.whistlepigwhiskey.com/</a></p><p>• George T.

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F246271b1-6d0b-46cb-a296-88eeaca6699a_1792x1024.heic">          </a> <p>Security professionals have long taught that organizations should limit the access individuals have in computer systems to just those privileges necessary to perform their job. This is known as the principle of least privilege. The problem is that knowing this is a best practice and putting it into practice are two different things. Traditionally, organizations have used access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) based on groups to authorize activities. These methods are static, requiring that lists or groups be updated manually as people move between roles or leave employment. When this is extended to partners, suppliers, and other services, the problem is that much worse. And excess standing privileges are a real security risk.</p><p>Standing privileges are characterized by persistent access regardless of whether the person is using the resource or not, predefined scope where role is used to define broad access, and minimal oversight with little monitoring and accountability. Standing privileges increase the attack surface, letting attackers exploit broad permissions without further escalation. In addition, over time people accumulate permissions beyond what they need to perform their current job, a situation known as privilege creep.</p><p>In an ideal world, least privilege is like a shrink wrap, constantly adjusting the access perimeter as the needs of the employee change. Sometimes they expand and the shrink wrap expands to seamlessly grant any access to needed perform a job. Sometimes the needs shrink and the access perimeter of the employee contracts as well. By limiting access to just that necessary to perform tasks, least privilege ensures that the attack surface that an attacker can exploit is as small as possible.</p> Zero Trust <p>Sometimes it's easy to get least privilege and zero trust confused. Zero trust is an overall security framework that requires continuous trust verification. Zero trust is a strategic, overarching trust model for an entire organization. Least privilege, in contrast, is more tactical, determining who can access what and when they can do it.</p><p>To see how least privilege fits into a zero trust strategy, consider a database administrator (DBA). Least privilege might set access controls such that the DBA can manage databases, but cannot view customer data stored within them. If their credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot steal sensitive information because the DBA’s privileges are tightly scoped. Zero trust relies on the DBA's access being valid, but might also check for unusual activity such that if the DBA appears to be accessing the database from a new location or at an unusual time, access is curtailed until the DBA is re-authenticated.</p><p>As the example shows, least privilege is an important part of zero trust, but only part. Other tactics that play in a zero trust strategy include device management, multi-factor authentication, and segmenting applications and processes (i.e., microsegmentation) to make fine-grained access control possible. Still, least privilege is a core part of a zero trust strategy. And least privilege depends on eliminating standing privileges.</p> Eliminating Standing Privileges <p>Recent developments in dynamic authorization have made it easier than ever to eliminate standing privileges. Standing privileges are the result when automatically updating an employee's access in response to changing circumstances is difficult. Modern policy-based authorization systems like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> allow organizations to control access though policies that state who can access what and under what conditions. These policies are managed like code, making them easier to manage. More importantly, they can automatically respond to changing circumstances.</p><p>For example, the first of the following two Cedar policies forbids anyone to access any resource that's considered "critical" unless they're on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. The second permits employees in the Finance group to access any finance application. These policies work together, so that if the finance application is also a critical resource, then finance employees would also have to be on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. As employees change roles that group is automatically updated from the HR system, growing or shrinking access as needed.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal,  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"CriticalResources"  
) unless {  
    context.device.security.risk == "Secure" &amp;&amp;  
    context.device.security.assessment.overall &gt;= 80  
};

permit(  
    principal in UserGroup::"Finance"  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"FinanceApplications"  
);  </code> <p>While policy-based access control (PBAC) can be used to mimic a role-based access control system, proper system segmentation (i.e. being able to identify finance applications) and device management allows finer-grained access control where employee's actions can be restricted to specific systems and only when their using a company-owned device that is properly secured. Access control can be limited to certain times or from specific locations. All of these reduce the surface area of an employee's access perimeter for better security.</p> Just-in-Time Access Control <p>We can shrink the access perimeter even further using just-in-time access control. Just-in-time (JIT) access control is a mechanism that grants users, applications, or processes access to resources only for a limited time and only when it is explicitly needed. This minimizes the risks associated with long-term or persistent access privileges. While the principle of least privilege focuses on ensuring users or systems have the minimum permissions required to perform their roles or tasks, JIT access control refines this further with several other important features:</p>  <p>Time-Bound Privileges:—JIT ensures permissions are time-limited, reducing the window of opportunity attackers have to exploit rarely-used accounts. For example, a developer needing access to a production server might receive elevated privileges only for a specific task and only for a set duration.</p>  <p>Dynamic Privilege Assignment:—Even when policies are evaluated for each access, the permissions they allow are available indefinitely. JIT adds another dimension to the dynamic nature of PBAC where privileges are granted on demand and revoked automatically when no longer needed.</p>  <p>Granular Control:—Dynamic privilege assignment complements PBAC by making access more granular—not just who can access what, but also when and for how long.</p>  <p>JIT access control might, for example, be used to limit access to payroll functions except during the window when payroll is being processed. Another example is in so-called "break-glass" situations where access is granted to production resources in an emergency or in the case of unexpected failure. Other examples use dynamic roles (e.g., on call) to grant access or require a third party (like a manager) to approve access.</p><p>These scenarios can fit within a policy-based authorization architecture using mechanisms such as dynamically altering roles or adding information to the authorization request context based on querying other systems or utilizing permission tokens that carry time-based permissions with them. For example, the following policy makes use of an assignment to process payroll in the oncall tracking system to ensure only people with an oncall assignment of "payroll" can process the payroll.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal  
    action == "Payroll::Process",  
    resource  
) unless {  
    context.oncall.assignment == "payroll"  
} </code> <p>For this to work, the authorization agent that creates the request for the policy authorizer has to ensure that the context for the request includes the correct oncall assignment and oncall assignments need to be automated.</p> Putting it All Together <p>Zero trust, the principle of least privilege, and just-in-time access work together to create a comprehensive security framework.</p>  <p>Zero trust enables an overarching strategy that mandates systems, resources, and actions be designed such that it is possible to continuously verify every action.</p>  <p>Principle of Least Privilege forms the heart of the zero trust strategy, mandating authentication and authorization systems that can dynamically grant fine-grained access through policy.</p>  <p>Just-in-time authorization augments the authorization system so that permissions can be granted not just based on who and where, but also only when they are needed to perform critical actions.</p>  <p>The well known adage that you can't buy security, applies to zero trust and JIT. There are products and technologies that make just-in-time, dynamic fine-grained access control possible, but besides putting them in place, you must also integrate them, make any necessary changes to other systems, and implement governance, monitoring, and auditing to ensure they work. These are organizational changes that take time, money, and perseverance. Done right, the payoff is not just a reduced attack surface and better security, but more productive employees as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, but poorly implemented, piecemeal security measures put much of the burden for keeping systems safe on employees who deal with tactics like frequent, yet ineffective password changes or requesting, and then waiting for, permissions to do their job.</p><p>When dynamic access control with JIT access is thoughtfully implemented, you shift the burden of security from employees to systems that automate protection, making it proactive and intelligent. Reducing friction so that employees can do their job while also enhancing security requires balance and a holistic approach that aligns technology, process, and culture. This transformation requires real effort but offers substantial rewards: resilient, secure systems; empowered employees; and peace of mind.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Shrink Wrapped Computers from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a wide format picture of several colorful, shrink wrapped computers and smartphones.</p>

<p>Ask 10 startups or scaleups if they use the “Microsoft stack”, and I’d be willing to bet that almost none do. By “Microsoft stack”, I mean using any one of C# or F# as a programming language, the .NET framework, ASP.NET for web development, or SQL Server as a database. However, if you asked the same companies if they use one or all of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Copilot, TypeScript, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm">npm</a>, then all may reply that they do.</p><p>The questions might seem different, but they are in fact almost identical. VS Code, GitHub, TypeScript, npm are all technologies owned and operated by Microsoft which are increasingly popular with startups and modern tech companies, but just don’t have strong Microsoft branding.</p><p>The Windows maker is quietly investing more in developer tools than any Big Tech giant. It acquired GitHub for $7.5B in 2018. It likely spent hundreds of millions of dollars per year to develop Visual Studio Code – then and then gave it away for free while upselling some of its services. It also offers GitHub Copilot for $10/month or $100/year, which may currently be a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/microsoft-is-reportedly-losing-huge-amounts-of-money-on-github-copilot">loss-making</a> price point.</p><p>So, why is Microsoft investing so much into developer tooling, and why does the rest of Big Tech seem comparatively uninterested in competing in this area? This question has been bugging me, so I attempted to find an answer. In order to properly understand what’s happening today, it’s useful to go back in time to when Microsoft became a highly profitable “dev tools monopoly” once before, in the 2000s.</p><p>This deep dive covers the first part of the story, covering:</p>  <p>A programming language interpreter company. Microsoft started out as a company selling BASIC interpreters to various hardware companies.</p>  <p>More and better developer tools. Following the success of MS-DOS and Windows, the company still built developer tools like Microsoft C, QuickC and MFC.</p>  <p>Journal for developers. Microsoft Systems Journal (MSJ). In the same year as going public, Microsoft started a printed magazine for MS-DOS and Windows developers.</p>  <p>Visual C++, a Development System for Windows. Microsoft created this IDE to make it easier to develop apps for Windows.</p>  <p>Visual Studio. The first IDE by the company that supported multiple programming languages.</p>  <p>Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). Microsoft managed to figure out how to charge a large premium for quality documentation and access to the latest software.</p>  <p>“Developers, developers, developers!” This now-famous chant had more context: Microsoft knew that it needed developers to adopt the newly launched .NET framework, to make it a technology adoption success.</p>   1. A programming language interpreter company <p>Most people associate Microsoft with the ubiquitous Windows operating system, but the company actually began by creating a language interpreter.</p> Building a BASIC interpreter in two months <p>On New Year’s Day in 1975, an advert for a minicomputer appeared on the front page of Popular Electronics, then the world’s most popular electronics magazine. It was for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a>; a small computer with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080">Intel 8080</a> CPU. The price was $439 (around $2,500 today) and the Altair couldn’t do much by itself: it had to be extended with memory (up to 4KB), and additional interface boards needed to be purchased to make it practical to use, like a typing board, cassette tapes, floppy disks, etc. All these were separate purchases, and some weren’t available at launch.</p><p>The price was incredibly low for its time. Before the Altair 8800, computers that were equally capable cost several times more, whereas the Altair was accessible to hobbyists. Its manufacturer, MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), hoped to sell 200 units, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800#Magazines">sold</a> 2,500 units in five months, and the device became the first commercially successful computer.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb283020e-a66a-45e6-a1fa-385462ba461a_1554x1164.png">          </a>The ad announcing the Altair 8800 in Popular Electronics <p>The advert caught the attention of programmers Bill Gates and Paul Allen and Paul Allen, who predicted the device would quickly become popular, and spied an opportunity to develop software for it. They contacted MITS offering to develop an interpreter for a popular programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code). It’s a simple enough language:</p> <code>INPUT "Enter the value of n: ", N

IF N &lt;= 1 THEN PRINT N : END

A = 0

B = 1

FOR I = 2 TO N

C = A + B

A = B

B = C

NEXT I

PRINT "The", N, "th Fibonacci number is:", B

END</code> <p>BASIC code to calculate the nth Fibonacci number</p><p>Allen and Gates did not have an Altair computer, but realized time was of the essence; so Allen wrote an Altair simulator based solely on the Intel manual for the 8080 chip (!!) Meanwhile, Gates wrote the BASIC interpreter to run on this simulator. In March, Paul Allen flew to meet the manufacturer, and demonstrated that it worked flawlessly: he loaded the interpreter into the machine, and then proved correctness by typing in simple programs like printing 2+2, sums of numbers, squares of numbers, and so on.</p><p>MITS was interested in distributing BASIC with the Altair, as the software would make their kit more useful for developers. This was the point when Allen and Gates created a corporate entity to do business: on 4 April 1975 they named and founded “Microsoft.” The company’s first contract was a licensing agreement to allow Altair to distribute their version of BASIC under the name “Altair BASIC.”</p> Microsoft BASIC <p>Microsoft’s emergence coincided with the start of a boom in affordable personal computers; every new hardware wanted to ship software to be more appealing to professional and hobbyist developers. A BASIC interpreter made all such systems easier to sell, and Microsoft developed and licensed many more BASIC interpreters to other manufacturers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_BASIC">including</a> to Apple for the Apple II, to IBM, the Z-80, and the Commodore 64.</p><p>Smartly, these versions of BASIC were called “Microsoft BASIC” and the company extended the functionality of BASIC, <a href="https://quantumzeitgeist.com/the-basic-programming-language/">adding</a> improved string manipulation and better graphics support. Plus, the “Microsoft” brand name was displayed whenever the interpreter started up, which raised the company’s profile with users.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26f61119-1c55-4f25-a073-e505b2fdbf4c_566x372.png">          </a>The first version of Microsoft Basic for the Apple II was on a cassette.

More and better developer tools <p>Microsoft’s commercial breakthrough began with creating and distributing the DOS operating system in 1981, and then the Windows operating system in 1985. In 1990, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0 and also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">introduced</a> Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. This combination of an operating system and word processor helped Windows gain more popularity, and made the OS even more popular. Here’s how sales of the different versions compared:</p>

<p>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them out for consideration. A quick glance at the finances of their pro-crypto / pro-blockchain Pac should be a wake up call to anyone doubting the rising tide of automated, smart contract law and global cyber governance. We need to wrap our heads around the fact that it’s less about money and power and more about information theory, token engineering, and the shift of social systems into a networked super intelligence operating under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for expanded “human potential.” It is a bipartisan effort. It is an international effort. It will be framed as a “populist uprising” to take back “the commons,” engineered of course by the world’s largest asset holders. In my opinion, meme-coins are biosemiotic aides facilitating emergent swarm intelligence. Tread carefully around those digital mind viruses folks. A lot of money, and tokens, are being thrown around trying to get their planned cyberphysical-sociotechnical future to stick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article looks at management application access tokens in an ASP.NET Core web application. Any application with or without a user can use application access tokens as long as the application can persist the tokens in a safe way. </p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/01/15/asp-net-core-user-delegated-access-token-management/">ASP.NET Core user delegated access token management</a> 



 ASP.NET Core user application access token management 
 



 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core web application authenticates using OpenID Connect and OpenIddict as the secure token server. The application needs to use data from an app-to-app resource. An OAuth client credential flow is used to get an application access token to access the API. The OAuth client credentials flow can only be used when it can keep a secret. This token has nothing in common with the delegated access token from the user authentication. The application is persisted once for the application. An in-memory cache is used for this. The application sends the application access token as a bearer token to the API.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per application for application tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per application 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example  



<p>An ApplicationAccessTokenCache service is used to manage the access tokens for the application. The service is registered as a singleton and runs once for the whole application. Each request scope can use this. The application looks in the cache for a valid token and if no valid token is present, the service requests a new access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. The token is persisted to the cache using the client ID. This means only one token can exist per client definition.</p>

<p>The ApplicationUsersService class uses the access token from the token service. This is a scoped service and the data is requested from the API using a bearer token in the authorization header.</p>

            client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configuration["AuthConfigurations:ProtectedApiUrl"]!);

            var access_token = await _apiTokenCacheClient.GetApiToken(
                "CC",
                "myccscope",
                "cc_secret"
            );

            client.SetBearerToken(access_token);

            var response = await client.GetAsync("api/ApplicationUsers/photo");
            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

                if (data != null)
                    return data;

                return string.Empty;
            }

            throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {

            throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
        }
    }
}

<p>The required services are added the the application in the program file. </p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ApplicationAccessTokenCache&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;ApplicationUsersService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
  


<p></p>



<p>The token cache works great when using in-memory cache. If using a persistent cache, care needs to be taken that the access tokens are persisted in a safe way. </p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>



 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web delegated access tokens &amp; OBO access tokens 



 Microsoft.Identity.Client application tokens 



 Azure SDK tokens 



 Handling multiple access tokens

<p>Twenty-third in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series<br>
Seventh on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
Images from a Google image search for “LA fires aftermath.” Sources listed below.†
<p>Disaster coverage tends to go through four stages:</p>
 
 Live reporting. TV stations stop all advertising and go into round-the-clock coverage. Radio stations drop the feeds from elsewhere and go wall-to-wall with live reports. Newspapers drop their paywalls. Coverage by the best of them ranges from good to heroic. As <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/11/what-are-stories/">stories</a> go, they are all about the problem. 
 Human interest. The worst is over, so the stories go to human loss, resourcefulness, forbearing, kindness, and mendacity. Reporters on TV stand in front of some hellscape and talk to victims, heroes, or anyone they can find. This leverages the need for characters and their&nbsp;problems, with stories about how they survived, who or what they lost, always at least with hints toward&nbsp;movement forward. 
 Blame. This is all about character. Reporters are taught to seek the five W’s: Who, What, Where, When, and Why, sometimes appending an H for How. But since stories always require characters, Who is what matters most. 
 Coming to an understanding. While that’s the goal, and something nearly everyone wants, it’s provisional while the story continues. Also, full understanding, if it ever comes, will be at the end. And stories like the LA fires may never end, because there are contexts for them that may never change. 
 
<p>But that’s where we are now. In Stage 4. Here’s a Google search I just did:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Why+did+the+LA+fires+happen"></a></p>
<p>Note that all of these stories are one to three days old. All of them are provisionally conclusive (meaning they still keep the story going). And all of them are less interesting than Stage 3: Blame.</p>
<p>I want to focus on that because blame makes story-telling—and story-generating—easy. Too easy.</p>
<p>That’s why Donald Trump—the best story-generator (and blame-placer) the world has ever known (and I mean this <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">seriously</a>)—wasted no time fingering Gavin Newsom:</p>
<p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113793724958051185"></a></p>
<p>Politifact <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2025/jan/10/fact-check-los-angeles-fires-fuel-falsehoods-inclu/">spent 942 words explaining</a>, among other things, that there was <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=RESSW">plenty of water</a>, that a “water restoration declaration” never existed, that the smelt thing concerned water for elsewhere, and that what Trump said was wrong in other ways. But, as Ronald Reagan said,&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quote+source+%22if+you%27re+explaining%2C+you%27re+losing%22">If you’re explaining, you’re losing</a>. And Trump never loses, because that’s out of character. (Again, I mean this seriously. We’re talking stories here. The man is all-character, all the time.) And it is impossible for the media, which now includes everybody, not to participate in his story processes.</p>
<p>Of course, stories being what they are, Trump has hardly been alone in playing the blame game. <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/after-the-fires/">Scott Galloway</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>LAFD Chief&nbsp;Kristin Crowley took time out from fighting the fires to blame Mayor Karen Bass for cutting&nbsp;<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/los-angeles-fire-department-budget-sustained-cuts-increase/story?id=117570420">$17.6 million from the department’s budget</a>. The department’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-10/how-much-did-the-l-a-fire-department-really-cut-its-budget">$895 million budget</a>&nbsp;actually&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by $58 million as a result of the latest union contract. To get that higher pay to firefighters, the department reduced spending on equipment and training. The mayor’s response added to the drama,&nbsp;<a href="https://abc7.com/live-updates/socal-braces-possibly-destructive-windstorm-amid-dangerous-fire-weather/15771235/entry/15788686/?linkId=709262737">fueling rumors</a>&nbsp;that the chief had been fired. Right-wing podcasters blame Fire Chief Crowley’s gayness, saying she was a DEI hire. Note: She has outstanding qualifications.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the good work being done at Stage 4, the urge to blame will never cease.</p>
<p>And we need some. Justice demands it.</p>
<p>What kind of justice? Well, <a href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-justice/">there are many</a>: retributive, distributive, restorative, procedural, social, environmental, economic, and so on. Of all those, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice">retributive justice</a> is what people want most and best understand. Perpetrators must be found, punished, and made to pay.</p>
<p>But starting with blame is too easy, too simple, often wrong, and always incomplete. Other factors matter. Conditions. Contexts. Black swans.</p>
<p>That’s why coming to an understanding is far more important, especially if we want to minimize or avoid the same kinds of disasters in the future. That’s what I’ll visit in my next series of posts.</p>

The TikTok ban was a spectacular own-goal for all kinds of reasons. In particular:</p><blockquote><p>"[...] This is a depressing moment for anyone who cherishes American protections for speech and access to information. In 1965, while the Cold War shaped the U.S. national-security environment, the Supreme Court, in Lamont v. Postmaster General, determined that the post office had to send people publications that the government claimed were “communist political propaganda,” rather than force recipients to first declare in writing that they wanted to receive this mail. The decision was unanimous, and established the idea that Americans had the right to discover whatever they wanted within “a marketplace of ideas.”"</p></blockquote><p>Truly, so much for the country that is allegedly about freedom of speech. There's something particularly messed-up and McCarthyist about how this ban came about, not least because <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/salt-lake-city/2024/05/06/senator-romney-antony-blinken-tiktok-ban-israel-palestinian-content">some representatives have admitted that the ban is partially because of the availability of pro-Palestinian content on the platform</a>. If we endorse this ban, do we also need to revisit the rightly widely-derided un-American-activities policies of the past? I'd rather we leave them in the dustbin of history.</p><p>But luckily, the kids are alright. This is also true:</p><blockquote><p>"Although I don’t think this specific rebellion can last, I’m encouraged that American TikTok users realize that banning the popular platform directly contradicts America’s values. If only America’s leaders were so wise."</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://werd.io/tag/Democracy">#Democracy</a></p>            <p>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/01/internet-censorship-tiktok-ban/681361/">Link</a>]</p>

<p>I’ve written a few times about how blogging has been the single most important accelerant in my career. I mentioned this <a href="https://werd.io/2021/please-blog">when I asked more of you to blog</a>, in <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-secret-power-of-a-blog">remarks about other peoples’ posts on blogging</a>, and so on. But I’ve never actually explained how.</p><p>The arc of this journey is simple: I was a complete outsider with no money or connections, living in Scotland. Blogging allowed me to found two startups, build at least one enduring open source community, find multiple jobs, and enjoy career opportunities that otherwise would never have come my way. There is precisely zero chance that I would be doing my current job without it — or any job I’ve had since 2005.</p><p>I’ve been blogging since 1998. Because of that, I was familiar with the mechanics of what we’d later call social media very early on. I built <a href="https://words.werd.io/we-are-the-monkeys-of-rum-70f81d4a02df">a viral social site that was hitting millions of visits a day</a> in my bedroom in 2001.</p><p>When I started to work in e-learning at the University of Edinburgh in 2003, I was able to immediately see the deficiencies in how people were learning and sharing online, and suggest a better alternative based on what was already happening. I collaborated with a PhD student who was studying education, and we wrote a white paper about what that might be. And then I published it on my blog, and he published it on his.</p><p>It was picked up by other bloggers in educational technology, who liked the idea. We offered it to the university, who declined (“blogging is for teenage girls crying in their bedrooms,” was the official response), so I quit my job and started building it full-time, narrating the whole journey on — you’ve guessed it — my blog. We built the platform into one that was used by universities, Fortune 500 companies, social movements, and NGOs around the world — all through word of mouth, driven by blogging.</p><p>When I left, it was my blogging that led me to be invited to speak at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Hauser School of Governance. After that talk, I met up with two of the attendees, who were journalists who saw the need for entrepreneurship to revive a flagging industry. I continued to collaborate with them, and together we built Latakoo, an enterprise video platform which continues to be the way NBC News and others gather footage and send it back to their newsrooms, in the format that each newsroom needs. Of course, I narrated the whole journey through blogging.</p><p>When I left Latakoo, it was to start Known, which could be described as a blogging platform. Because I’d been blogging heavily about an ongoing tech ethics issue at the time, it just so happened that I was quoted in the New York Times on the day that I was interviewing to be funded by Matter Ventures. It certainly didn’t hurt that Corey Ford, the General Partner, saw my name that day.</p><p>I blogged that journey too. Ultimately, Known had a small acquisition by Medium, and I continued to blog about indie web and tech ethics topics externally — and about things that Medium could be doing internally. That helped me build enduring relationships with people on the strategy team there. (“I don’t think Ben’s really an engineer,” someone accurately commented. “He could be running Medium,” they less-accurately added.)</p><p>One of the factors to Corey offering me a job at Matter was the writing I’d done around the dangers of Facebook as a single point of failure. In the wake of the 2016 election, that was significantly more clear to more people. So I joined the team, and used blogging to get the word out about what we wanted to fund.</p><p>When Matter stopped investing, I moved to Unlock Protocol — a company whose founder, Julien Genestoux, I had met through blogging and the indie web. After that, I worked at ForUsAll, which knew me through my work at Matter. I can’t draw a direct line between blogging and my work as CTO at The 19th, but there’s zero chance I would have gotten that job without everything that came before it. And then my current work as Senior Director of Technology at ProPublica came from that.</p><p>Without narrating my journey, my opinions, and things I’ve built, I might still be in my starter career. Which, by the way, there’s nothing wrong with at all! But my arc has definitely been blogging-informed.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/01/17/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/">Matthew Green</a>]</p><p>I think this is the most important discussion with respect to AI:</p><blockquote><p>"[...] I would say that AI is going to be the biggest privacy story of the decade. Not only will we soon be doing more of our compute off-device, but we’ll be sending a lot more of our private data. This data will be examined and summarized by increasingly powerful systems, producing relatively compact but valuable summaries of our lives. In principle those systems will eventually know everything about us and about our friends. They’ll read our most intimate private conversations, maybe they’ll even intuit our deepest innermost thoughts. We are about to face many hard questions about these systems, including some difficult questions about whether they will actually be working for us at all."</p></blockquote><p>I lead technology at <a href="https://propublica.org">a non-profit newsroom</a> where we've banned use of hosted AI models on sensitive data like reporting notes and source information. We've turned off AI assistants on our cloud services, and we've deployed client-side encryption for sensitive documents.</p><p>Even if we think vendors are trustworthy (I don't), sending this level of data to any third party creates a honeypot for surveillance and potential misuse by government, law enforcement, the vendors themselves, and beyond. If a vendor has access to your most personal data and receives a criminal subpoena, which could easily come from the government or from a third party, you might never know that your information was compromised. (Civil subpoenas sometimes allow vendors to notify you that this happened.)</p><p>So these solutions are pretty interesting, although fall far short of the encryption standard the author and I would both like to see:</p><blockquote><p>"Apple’s approach to this problem is called “Private Cloud Compute” and it involves the use of special trusted hardware devices that run in Apple’s data centers. [...] Apple ensures that no long-term state is stored on these machines, and also load-balances your request to a different random server every time you connect."</p></blockquote><p>As the author notes, when this level of data is being gathered centrally and is potentially available for government use (or even vendor use beyond our intent as users), serious questions are raised about who this software actually works for. Is it ours? Is it empowering? Is it covertly a system of control and monitoring? Or all of the above?</p><p>I think the answer, sadly, is inevitable.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSaMF7KbUME">this morning’s video</a> I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my “Momo” read-aloud playlist. Maybe I should do a read aloud of Bentov’s “Stalking the Wild Pendulum,” too? I’m understanding it much better now. Look for a discussion of quantum realism with Joseph Gonzales in the coming week. I’ll just say it once again, I can’t believe I have to talk about any of this, but if you don’t take it too seriously, conjecturing can be rather fun.</p>

Last year, a record 290m vehicles were operated on US streets and highways.</p><p>However, this extreme car dependence is affecting Americans’ quality of life, with a new study finding there is a tipping point at which more driving leads to deeper unhappiness. It found that while having a car is better than not for overall life satisfaction, having to drive for more than 50% of the time for out-of-home activities is linked to a decrease in life satisfaction."</p></blockquote><p>The trick, of course, is that most of our communities have been heavily designed around the car, in part because of a century of lobbying and pressure from the automotive industry. It's obvious that more integrated city planning that doesn't heavily favor car use leads to a happier and healthier life, but American society is largely not built for it.</p><p>In turn, most Americans can't even imagine a world that isn't car-centric, and vehicles have become a core part of the culture. That's as intrinsically toxic as smoking culture, but because it literally has dictated how the environment around us has been designed and built, it's going to take a long time to undo - and before we get there, we need to have the widespread will to undo it, which doesn't seem to exist.</p><p>Compounding that, our most walkable and transit-enabled communities are also by far the most expensive to live in, because - shocker! - they're the most desirable. So a reasonably healthy living environment has become the preserve of the relatively wealthy.</p><p>This is the kind of thing that needs to be legislated for: new built environments need to hit certain standards for integration, transit, and walkability, and then our existing environments need to be iteratively rebuilt. That seems like a tall order in the current American cultural era, but I don't see how this gets better on its own.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/we-dont-need-more-cynics-we-need-more-builders/">Joan Westenberg</a>]</p><p>An absolutely spot-on call to action:</p><blockquote><p>"Cynicism is the cheap seats. It’s the fast food of intellectual positions. Anyone can point at something and say it’s broken, corrupt, or destined to fail. The real challenge? Building something better.</p><p>[...] Cynicism comes with hidden taxes. Every time we default to assuming the worst, we pay in missed opportunities, reduced social trust, and diminished creative capacity. These costs compound over time, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which cynical expectations shape cynical realities."</p></blockquote><p>We've got to have optimism. Not the dumb kind that Andreessen talks about; the kind where we know we can make the world better, we just have to go out and do it.</p><p>A thousand times, this:</p><blockquote><p>"The world has enough critics. What it needs are builders who can see problems clearly without being paralyzed by them, people who can maintain hope without succumbing to naïveté, and people who can engage with reality while working to improve it."</p></blockquote><p>Criticism is useful, but the real work is in imagining something new, something better, and making it a reality.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/peter-thiel-dreams-of-empire/">Dave Karpf at Tech Policy Press</a>]</p><p>Peter Thiel and other tech oligarchs are seeking to weaponize US foreign policy as a way to enforce their corporate agendas:</p><blockquote><p>"Thiel is developing a blueprint for putting Big Tech’s policy agenda at the center of US foreign policy. Australia’s social media ban is bad for American social media companies. The European Union’s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act impose regulatory requirements on very large online platforms that operate within the EU. Peter Thiel expects the US government to do something about that, in the guise of investigating and redressing past wrongdoings.</p><p>Tech billionaires like Thiel simply do not believe that their companies and investments should be beholden to governments. And now that they have control of the US government, they are suggesting that, if any other countries interfere with their business, the US government ought to intervene on their behalf."</p></blockquote><p>The thing is, protections like the ones offered by the European Union are really good, and significantly better than we enjoy in the United States. Part of the worry is that if they're allowed to stand, similar restrictions will emerge here too. We're already seeing that in more progressive states like California.</p><p>That's an inevitability: as we all get more used to the internet now that most of us are on it, beyond the initial excitement, we're going to make more nuanced policy decisions. Clearly, privacy is an important democratic prerequisite, and countering the internet's tendency to support monopolies is similarly important to prevent outsized centralization of power. When it comes to the free reign moguls have enjoyed to build giant businesses unencumbered, time is ticking. But in the meantime, they'll keep trying to protect their interests - in increasingly dramatic ways.</p>

My colleagues over in the newsroom at ProPublica explored this data <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/segregation-academies">while illuminating the ongoing extent of segregation academies in the south</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Our analysis of that survey revealed, among other things, Amite County, Mississippi, where about 900 children attend the local public schools — which, as of 2021, were 16% white. By comparison, the two private schools in the county, with more than 600 children, were 96% white."</p></blockquote><p>But that data hasn't traditionally been easy to explore. Until now:</p><blockquote><p>"In the course of our reporting, we realized that this data and analysis were illuminating and useful — even outside the South. We decided to create a database to allow anyone to look up a school and view years worth of data."</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/private-school-demographics">Private School Demographics database</a> is available to use for free.

<p>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her father, three-time president of Costa Rica and MIT alumnus, had ties to Quaker expats (Henrietta Boggs’ uncle and aunt) who emigrated south from Alabama in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who developed some of the first ideas around social impact investing, and his wife Elise, sociologist who built the field of peace studies, were affiliated with Swarthmore though Kenneth only did a year’s stint as a guest lecturer. </p>
<p>When our family toured the campus for a college visit, it was made clear that only the top-tier candidates would be accepted, because many slots were reserved for equity outreach. Interestingly a high percentage of students presenting that day asserted their intentions to become economists with aspirations of working at the World Bank and the IMF. That was an eye-opener for sure!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use the visual of the optical illusion of paired silhouettes with a vase in the center to describe how two narratives can be presented, but often only one is truly “seen.” This Gestalt concept is applied to parallel narratives – one presented in two recent stories on Unlimited Hangout that foreground militarism and data surveillance in AI healthcare and the story I keep attempting to tell about gamified managed community “wellness” protocols linked to social impact finance deals on blockchain that on another level will be leveraged to catalyze emergent behaviors and possibly advance bio-hybrid information processing.</p>
<p>I also describe a strange encounter in which Aetna health care intended to target low-income communities of color for VR guided meditation in a digital “jungle” setting. The second hour of the video is a repeat of two site visits Jason and made in Denver in 2022 to the then new Palantir headquarters and the state capitol.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. TikTok’s US sell-or-shut-down deadline nears, CEO fired over disastrous Sonos software update, unusual use of AI in elite tennis, NVIDIA’s “personal” AI computer, Meta cuts DEI programs, and more.</p>  <p>What does Salesforce’s software engineering hiring freeze mean? Amusing: between the two highest-paid corporate functions (sales and engineering) the one getting a hefty headcount increase is sales, which cannot show its productivity improved by GenAI tools.</p>  <p>GitHub outage: the real cost of reliability. Turns out, an hour-long outage per quarter is well within 99.9% reliability. GitHub offers this SLA for its customers as default, while GitLab Dedicated promises 99.5% (which allows for up to 10 hours/quarter in downtime.) It will cost you if you need more reliability.</p>  <p>What Cloudflare’s recruiting statistics say about the job market. There were about 6x more applicants for every open position at Clouflare in 2024, than in 2021. 2021-2024, Cloudflare has consistently hired about the same number of people.</p>  <p>How the commercial sector and academia regained computing lead. From the 1940s to the 1990s, software engineering breakthroughs were frequently coming from work done within governmental organizations. Since then, this has changed, with Big Tech, startups and academia taking a lead in pushing innovation ahead – at least for now.</p>   1. Industry pulse  TikTok’s US sell-or-shut-down deadline nears <p>TikTok is one of the biggest social media platforms, with around <a href="https://famewall.io/statistics/tiktok-stats/">1.5 billion</a> users globally and circa <a href="https://www.searchlogistics.com/learn/statistics/tiktok-user-statistics/">121 million</a> in the US, many of them younger in age. It’s owned and operated by Bytedance, which is based in China, and there are security concerns relating to this: India banned TikTok in 2020, while the US, Canada, EU and UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_TikTok">ban</a> the app from government devices.</p><p>The US has taken a step in India’s direction: in <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/13/tiktok-ban-timeline?__cf_chl_rt_tk=ZiAI4Mj.m.Osu9Pe25BCH0qm882T7A_Ef1Of8z646cs-1737007366-1.0.1.1-65gfgoiZH9newEL6s.sJCfWPXv111H0Lw173GkMsPb4">April 2024</a>, it passed a bill that requires TikTok be sold to a US company in order to bring it within US jurisdiction, or be banned from the US. The deadline for this is close: Sunday, 19 January. At the time of publication no sale had been announced, but despite the absence of a buyer so far, TikTok is an extremely attractive acquisition, with one in three US citizens using it. So far, speculation about potential buyers has focused on:</p>  <p>Elon Musk: the owner of X, a much smaller social network than TikTok. As one of the world’s richest people, and with his growing political influence in the US as part of the incoming Trump administration, Musk could be a serious bidder.</p>  <p>Other individuals could pull syndicates together to buy TikTok:</p>  <p>The most-subscribed YouTuber, <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-buzz/is-mrbeast-buying-tiktok-creator-says-offer-ready-for-acquisition-article-117274749">Mr Beast</a></p>  <p>Former US Treasury secretary, <a href="https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/01/16/how-much-is-tiktok-worth-and-who-could-buy-it/">Steven Mnuchin</a></p>  <p>A Shark Tank investor, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/01/16/how-much-is-social-media-platform-tiktok-worth-and-who-could-buy-it">Kevin O'Leary</a></p>  <p>Activision’s former CEO, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tiktok-ban-sale-buy-bill-law-download-app-senate-date-rcna143413">Bobby Kotick</a></p>    <p>It’s curious that no large tech companies like Meta, Snap, Microsoft, and Google, have been mooted as potential buyers, and could be due to concerns about antitrust regulation.</p><p>A likely outcome is that TikTok sells to the highest bidder, whoever that is; although the video-sharing app might have a trick up its sleeve: spook US lawmakers into backing out of a ban.</p><p>The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktok-prepares-for-immediate-shut-off-in-the-u-s-on-sunday?rc=6yfluz">reports</a> Tiktok plans to shut down the app on Sunday, in a move almost guaranteed to trigger a sizable reaction by its 100M+ US users. On the principle that politicians respond to pressure, the strategy seems to be to generate a noisy response by US voters that causes politicians to change course away from a ban, out of fear of being punished at the ballot box in future elections by disgruntled TikTok users who blame elected officials for the popular app being unavailable.</p><p>To be fair, TikTok has little to lose and a lot to gain: in the worst case, it sells to the highest bidder, and in the best case, it gets more time to operate in the US, and perhaps to increase the value of offers on the table for it.</p> CEO fired over disastrous Sonos software update

Before launching Formation, Michael spent eight years at Meta, where he was recognized as the top code committer company-wide for several years. The “Coding Machine” archetype was modeled after Michael at the company.</p><p>In our conversation, we talk about what it was like working at Meta and dive into its engineering culture. Michael shares his journey of quickly climbing the ranks from intern to principal-level and gives level-headed advice on leveling up your career. Plus, we discuss his work at Formation, where he helps engineers grow and land roles at top tech companies.</p><p>In this episode, we cover:</p>  <p>An overview of software architect archetypes at Meta, including “the coding machine”</p>  <p>Meta’s org structure, levels of engineers, and career trajectories</p>  <p>The importance of maintaining a ‘brag list’ to showcase your achievements and impact</p>  <p>Meta’s engineering culture and focus on building internal tools</p>  <p>How beating Mark Zuckerberg in a game of Risk led to him accepting Michael’s friend request</p>  <p>An inside look at Meta’s hiring process</p>  <p>Tips for software engineers on the job market on how to do better in technical interviews</p>  <p>And more!</p>       Takeaways <p>Here are my biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. The importance of archetypes at Meta. Archetypes are initially modelled after existing engineers at Meta, and they serve two main roles:</p>  <p>Fairness: offer a way for the company to “patter match” upcoming engineers against these personas, and have a fair system to determine who is at this higher level, and who is not</p>  <p>Career path: offer a non-manager career path that goes beyond the Staff engineer (E6) level. Before archetypes were a thing, it was unclear how to get promoted to E7 and E8 and above levels – where E8 is the equivalent of Director-level (D1) roles</p>  <p>Archetypes are ingrained in Meta’s engineering culture and are a major differentiator compared to other Big Tech companies that lack such nuanced differentiators at the Staff+ engineering levels.</p><p>2. There’s a limit on how much influence an IC can have, even at Meta. Despite offering IC career paths that are better-defined at the Staff+ levels than most other large tech companies: at the Principal and above engineering level, there are still more directors than engineers. Michael used to think this is unfair – but, over time, he realized why this is. As he put it:</p><blockquote><p>“Even if you write 10x the code or 100x the code, you cannot replace 3,000 engineers with one engineer. So you can be a VP of engineering, though, overseeing 3,000 engineers. No matter how you multiply it out: even if you are just are the manager of 10 ‘superstar’ engineers, you still have more influence/impact over the direction of those people in the company.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s helpful to understand the realistic and necessary limitations of the individual contributor path in terms of influence, within a large organization.</p><p>3. Tenure can become surprisingly important at a fast-growing scaleup. Michael recalled how when he became an E7 (the equivalent of a Principal Engineer at other, similar companies) – he became a part of a tightly knit group of E7+ engineers. Here, the cultural divide between those that had been at Meta for a long time – and promoted into this position – and those hired externally was strong.</p><p>Many of the external hires struggled to make the kind of impact that tenured E7+ engineers could, and lots of external hires ended up leaving the company relatively quickly.</p><p>Michael observed this during the earlier phase of Facebook/Meta, when it was growing very quickly. While the culture might have changed: this highlights how challenging it can be to “pick up” the culture of a fast-growing scaleup from outside, and how being with the company for a longer time can help you get more stuff done efficiently – and thus also grow faster in your career.</p><p>4. Causing an outage at a fast-moving scaleup is not the end of the world. Michael shared an amusing outage when he accidentally overloaded a node (a virtual machine) thanks to shipping a prototype version of a photo mask on Facebook profiles, to add support for a cause. The feature blew up a few days after setting it live, because it could not handle a node being written millions of times per hour, to update two-way graph nodes between a user’s profile and this image template. On top of this, this failure caused cascading failures.</p><p>Rolling back this change was not an option. In this case, the database infrastructure team stepped in; made the edge one-way (rather than two-way) and thus removed the write bottleneck.</p><p>Michael learned an important lesson: and in the end, it was still a net win for Facebook to realize that this feature is wildly popular a day or two after the launch. Spending a lot of time building a feature that might never get used would have been a worse investment – during this early growth stage at Facebook, that is!</p><p>5. Interview processes have not changed much over the last decade! Michael coaches engineers to prepare for interviews, so he has first-hand experience in this. With his words:</p><blockquote><p>“The interview styles haven't changed since before Leetcode, and since after Leetcode. It’s the style that has been around. Facebook didn't invent these interviews: it borrowed a bit from Yahoo, Microsoft and Google. Google also borrowed from other companies at the time.</p><p>These days, we see a lot of AI companies, have daily “Facebook-like” processes and vibes: such as OpenAI.</p><p>The interviews are the ‘Leetcode interviews’ where they test language-agonostic problem-solving skills.</p><p>It’s always been the point to test for these kinds of problems: because it’s what engineers do! Solve problems, regardless of what specific tech stack or programming language you use.”</p></blockquote><p>A consequence of the interview process not changing much, but the job market becoming more competitive is how the bar to do well on these interviews went up. This is because there are more and better preparation materials, so the “average” candidate does better on these interviews than years before. Preparing for interviews at Big Tech companies and scaleups is no longer a “nice to have:” it’s a necessity for even strong engineers, who want to get a job offer.</p> A summary of the conversation <p>For those of you more interested in reading a summary of the conversation, see it here. This is an experiment — please leave a comment on how you find this addition!</p> From intern to E7 in 6 years <p>Michael joined Meta (then Facebook) as an intern and, remarkably, reached the E7 level (equivalent to principal engineer) in just six years. This rapid career progression is unusual, as a path like this would typically take at least a decade.</p>  <p>His relationship with his managers was critical, built on mutual trust and transparency. His managers knew he was passionate and sometimes impulsive but trusted his judgement. Michael also felt that he could help his managers in their jobs. He was receptive to direct feedback, allowing him to address issues quickly.</p>  <p>He maintained a "notepad" of his accomplishments, noting down significant fixes, bugs, or other contributions. This helped him summarise his work and make sure he was hitting the requirements of the next level, and he would review these with his manager.</p>  <p>From his first days as an intern, Michael demonstrated his coding skills. On his second or third day, he noticed the company's org chart tool was clunky and inefficient. Without asking for permission, he rewrote the tool, creating a horizontal layout and shipping it. This was very well received by colleagues.</p>  <p>As a product engineer, Michael worked on various teams, including internal tools, Facebook Groups, News Feed, Facebook Workplace and Messenger for Kids. He spent about 30% of his time working on his assigned product teams as a senior engineer would. The remaining 70% of his time was spent on large-scale refactoring, code cleanups, and company-wide projects.</p>  <p>Michael became known as the "coding machine" at Meta. The company developed this archetype, in part, to describe Michael's unique impact.</p>  <p>The "coding machine" archetype is for engineers who can move projects forward, unblock other people, refactor code quickly, and help launch products that may typically require a team of engineers.</p>  <p>The archetype was created after comparing him to other engineers at the E7 level, focusing on the overall impact he was making, which was similar to other E7s but not within the existing archetypes, such as "fixer".</p>  <p>While anyone can write a lot of code, what makes a "coding machine" is the impact the code has. This impact is measured by how much it moves projects forward, helps launch products, unblocks people, and speeds up refactoring.</p>  <p>The "coding machine" archetype was championed by an executive, Tom Allison, who helped connect the dots to make the archetype a reality.</p>  <p>Michael explains that at Meta, engineers are compared to professional sports teams. While everyone at a high level is good at basic tasks, people have specialities. Michael's was moving prototypes forward and refactoring code really fast.</p>   Meta’s engineering culture   <p>Meta has an engineering-first culture, where individual contributors are highly valued and empowered. The company wanted to create career paths for talented individual contributors, so that they did not have to become managers to progress.</p>  <p>Internal tools at Meta are treated as products. They were built with the same code base as user-facing tools. This made the internal tools team one of the most exciting to work on because engineers could build product at a much faster pace.</p>  <p>Meta built most of their infrastructure from scratch which resulted in custom tools. Because internal tools were seen as products, it gave the company an engineering product ecosystem.</p>  <p>Michael's intern project was an internal meeting scheduling tool, designed to quickly find meeting times and rooms for groups of people.</p>  <p>Michael recalls that Meta had custom version control, code review and build tools. While the company used SVN as a backbone, they used Mercurial locally on people's machines to manage their local branches. The company chose Mercurial because it was easier to work with the open-source team to hack into it, which aligned with Meta’s culture.</p>  <p>Many internal tools that Meta created have seeded other companies. Examples include Statsig (experimentation platform) Honeycomb (observability.)</p>  <p>The values of moving fast, breaking things and being bold were all reinforced at Meta. If you moved really fast and broke something, you would not get fired. If you were making a bold bet and pushing limits that was also rewarded, even if it didn't work out.</p>  <p>Michael shared a story about how he became Facebook friends with Mark Zuckerberg. During a game of Risk, he formed an alliance with Mark, only to betray him later to win the game. Despite this – or perhaps because of it! –, Mark accepted his friend request that had been pending for some time by then.</p>  <p>At Meta, product reviews are a regular part of the development cycle, also known as "Zuck Reviews". These 15-minute presentations allowed Mark Zuckerberg to give direction and feedback on products. He asks a lot of detail-focused questions to figure out the exact details and make sure that the best possible product was being built.</p>  <p>Michael caused quite the outage, one time. A prototype feature he built allowed users to overlay a photo template on their profile picture. When a large number of users used the French flag template, the system crashed because Michael designed the database to have two way edges for the prototype. One of the nodes got overloaded causing cascading effects. While a two-way edge was not recommended to use, Michael explains he made this decision to simplify things for a prototype.</p>   The interview process at Meta, during Michael’s time   <p>The interview process at Meta typically starts with a recruiter screen, followed by a technical screen (a 45-minute coding interview, usually with two questions). If that goes well, candidates then attend an on-site interview, which includes two more coding interviews, a behavioral interview, and a systems design interview.</p>  <p>During Michael’s time, these interviews had the names “Jedi”, “Pirate” and “Ninja”.</p>  <p>Meta’s technical interviews are distinct because they are whiteboarding style with almost no small talk. Interviewers jump into the technical questions and expect candidates to walk through a clear problem-solving process, without compiling the code to check if it works.</p>  <p>After the onsite interview, there is a debrief where interviewers share feedback. If there are no red flags, then the candidate goes to the hiring committee.</p>  <p>The hiring committee consisted of a quorum of at least three director or VP-level engineering leaders. A recruiter presents a packet about the candidate. The default at this stage is that a candidate is likely to be hired, so focus is typically on red flags.</p>  <p>The packet contains detailed information, including feedback from the interviewers, the interviewer's history, questions asked, and how many times the questions have been asked. This helps the directors calibrate and interpret the feedback.</p>  <p>The hiring committee looks for flags and inconsistencies but the most common decision point was determining the candidate's level. Michael made it to the meetings because he wanted to ensure that Facebook did not lower its hiring bar as it scaled.</p>  <p>Michael notes that his time in the hiring committee has been helpful in his current business, coaching people, and that he can offer a different point of view to engineers trying to undestand how it all works.</p>   Advice for software engineers to grow professionally   <p>Michael advises that finding the right job for the right alignment is more important than just checking the boxes and passing an interview.</p>  <p>He notes that the interview processes at many top tech companies are similar, originating from Yahoo, Microsoft and Google and the style has been consistent. This style focuses on testing language and stack-agnostic problem-solving skills.</p>  <p>Michael compares interview preparation to going to a personal trainer. He advises that engineers must get back in shape to prepare for interview processes, regardless of how much experience they have.</p>  <p>The job market for software engineers has changed and is more competitive. There are now more steps in the process. Companies are using online assessments and implementing team matching.</p>  <p>Michael's most productive year, he made thousands of code commits (diffs). While at Meta, most of his code was in Hack, a version of PHP. He now primarily codes in Javascript. His favourite language now is Typescript.</p>  <p>Michael advises that storytelling is a key way to communicate, influence and share as humans.

<p>The article looks at managing user delegated access tokens for a downstream API in an ASP.NET Core web application. There are many ways of implementing this, all with advantages and disadvantages. The tokens are requested from an OpenID Connect server using the recommended standards. In this blog, the UI access token from the application authentication is re-used for the downstream API.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/token-mgmt-ui-delegated-direct">https://github.com/damienbod/token-mgmt-ui-delegated-direct</a></p>



 Blogs in this series 



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/01/15/asp-net-core-user-delegated-access-token-management/">ASP.NET Core user delegated access token management</a> 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/01/20/asp-net-core-user-application-access-token-management/">ASP.NET Core user application access token management</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution uses a secure downstream API and requires user delegated access tokens for access. The UI application is implemented using ASP.NET Core and razor pages. The UI application authenticates against an OpenID Connect server implemented using OpenIddict. The application client is implemented using an OpenID Connect confidential client and the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. This flow returns an access token which is used for the downstream API. </p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for user delegated tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust  to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example using Duende Token Management 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect">Duende Token Management OpenIdConnect</a> Nuget package can be used to implement these requirements for user delegated access tokens. This is not the only way to do this and can be implemented in numerous different ways. With this package, the AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement can be used to add the token management. </p>


  builder.Services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The different HTTP requests or the Razor pages can use the GetUserAccessTokenAsync method to get the access token for each user and session. The SaveTokens is set to true to persist the tokens in the session using a secure cookie per default. This is an option in the AddOpenIdConnect method. The defined scope is used to select the access token.</p>


   // token expires, token managment required
var accessToken = await HttpContext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync(
   new UserTokenRequestParameters
   {
      Scope = "myscope"
   });
  


<p></p>



<p>The AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient method can be used to add a named HttpClient client for the access token and the specific API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient("profileClient",
    configureClient: client =&gt; 
    { 
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(profileApiBaseUrl!); 
    });
  


<p></p>



<p>This client can then be used to access the API resource using the access token.</p>


  var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("profileClient");

var response = await client.GetAsync("api/Profiles/photo");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    if (data != null)
        return data;

    return string.Empty;
}
  


<p>When the applications are started, the access token can be used to request data from the downstream API.</p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>

<p>What will come of large language models when they mirror unsettled psyches defined by religious hero complexes into the cloud? We do ourselves and future generations a profound disservice when we choose not to make time to comprehend and interrogate how emerging technologies and narrative flows are being deployed to steer psychological states individually and as holon-based collectives through socio-technical, cyberphysical systems and the tokenized attention economy. </p>
<p>I recognize that rather than being a victim of Substack mania once again, I was merely a reflection of another’s discomfort in the world, an obstacle that gave someone a useful anchor point to exert his will and express his agency, however uninformed and misguided. It’s not a good feeling, but an informative lesson nonetheless. </p>
<p>It’s time to wrap our heads around tokenized spirituality and organized religion. My gut tells me Texas is ground zero for integration of the Drucker-Buford metaverse church model with digital community currencies tied to “moral” markets and social impact “charity” in ATT smart cities designed for community “wellness.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don’t think AI should be approached as a digital intercessor for “divine” moral guidance.” I view, web3 systems as linguistic scaffolds quietly mapping the terrain of our souls. Once harvested, our somatic pyschological GPS coordinates can be used ad infinitum to play us like instruments in the coming LARPy animist musical of blockchained cloud minds to solve gnarly problems that can only be untangled by a network of diverse, distributed intelligences – with digital wallets.</p>
<p>Follow your heart, think clearly, and ground yourself. It is easy to get swept away by the Sturm und Drang we generate around ourselves to make the hero roles we inhabit make sense. I’m not going to link to Andrew Corner’s Substack directly, but it’s not hard to find – I’m in the “energy” one. If you go there, fair warning, it’s a slog that’s equal parts disturbing and amusing. </p>
<p>What are we becoming folks? I don’t think the “hybrid” intelligence program is going to be a good look for many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day this may very well have simply been another signals-intelligence operation. It doesn’t seem like anyone really pays attention to that Substack anyway. If so, I hope there are at least a few useful take aways regarding how we should engage with this systems.</p>

<p>Twenty-second in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series<br>
Sixth on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
<p>Facts don’t matter, or they matter much less than people think—<a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/daniel-kahneman-why-we-contradict-ourselves-and-confound-each-other/">Daniel Kahnemann</a></p>
<p>Facts don’t matter. What matters is how much we hate the person talking—<a href="https://x.com/scottadamssays/status/1503005597343526915">Scott Adams</a></p>
<p>But facts do matter when life and death are on the line. Or when one is recovering from a life-changing situation. To help make the case for that, here are two collections of facts about the #LAfires:</p>
<a href="https://recovery.lacounty.gov/eaton-fire/"></a>A useful visualization of the CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) database for the Eaton Fire.
<a href="https://recovery.lacounty.gov/palisades-fire/"></a>A useful visualization of the CAL FIRE Damage Inspection (DINS) database for the Palisades fire.
<p>These are being updated on an ASAP basis by <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE (the The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection)</a> as they inspect damage across the those two fires’ burned neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Here is a close-up of one section of the Eaton Fire map, with one moused-over pop-out:</p>
<p><a href="https://recovery.lacounty.gov/eaton-fire/"></a></p>
<p>The photo link in the pop-out goes <a href="https://services1.arcgis.com/jUJYIo9tSA7EHvfZ/arcgis/rest/services/DINS_2025_Eaton_Public_View/FeatureServer/0/4501/attachments/5157">here</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The house next door appears undamaged. That’s the green one on the map. By looking at Google Maps, I can see those houses are <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KtgAwLv3gZ7gVq8LA">3305 and 3310 North Marengo Avenue</a> in Altadena. Note that the map has a search field in the top left corner. When one looks for an address (such as the first of those two), a pop-out appears with this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Show more results” and “Zoom to” lead to additional information. Would it help to have a list of all the affected structures, their addresses and conditions? Sure. Exactly seven years ago, after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Southern_California_mudflows">massive debris flow</a> destroyed much of Montecito, California (one zip code away from our house in Santa Barbara), I posted a list like that in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2018/01/15/montecito/">this blog post</a>. My source map was this one (now at the Santa Barbara County Fire Department):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mousing over those dots popped up an address for each one, and I used those to hand-produce a master list with the addresses for all the structures that had been lost or damaged. The idea was to have a Web page where people could quickly see what may have happened to their house—or the house of somebody they knew, using a simple text search of a Web page. Maybe somebody will do the same thing here.</p>
<p>I bring this up in obedience to <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459328424">my mother’</a>s prime command to my sister and me when we were kids:&nbsp;Make yourself useful.</p>
<p>And that’s what I hope I’m also doing with this post. It’s not just about sharing some maps. It’s about pulling facts away from stories, which I wrote about in my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/11/what-are-stories/">last post</a>. To spare you a click, I said stories are the base format of human interest, and the main product of journalism—and that they have just three requirements: character, problem, and movement.</p>
<p>Stories serve many purposes, of course. One is persuasion. For more on that, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Win-Bigly-Persuasion-World-Matter/dp/0735219737">Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don’t Matter</a>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams">Scott Adams</a>, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert">Dilbert</a> fame:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Win-Bigly-Persuasion-World-Matter/dp/0735219737"></a></p>
<p>The world where facts don’t matter is the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/16/on-digital-distance/">digital one</a> we live in now, alongside the physical one where all those homes were lost. In the digital world, the three requirements of stories can be used against journalism as well as by it. Toward both of those uses, I wrote <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">Where Journalism Fails</a> during the first Trump administration, and some of it bears repeating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have never seen Donald Trump’s like before, and may never again. His genius at working all three elements is without equal in our time—or perhaps any time. So please, if you can, set your politics aside and just look at the dude through the prism of Story.</p>
<p>Donald Trump spins up stories at least four ways:</p>
 
 Through constant characterization of others, for example with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_used_by_Donald_Trump">nicknames</a>&nbsp;(“Little Mario,” “Low Energy Jeb,” “Crooked Hillary,” “Sleepy Joe,” “Failing New York Times”) 
 By finding or creating&nbsp;problems, and characterizing those too: “witch hunt,” “fake news,” “illegal ballots,” “<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22dominionizing%20the%20vote%22">Dominion-izing the Vote.”</a> 
 By creating movement via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship">Roy Cohn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://gregolear.substack.com/p/man-in-the-middle-roger-stone">Roger Stone</a> playbook: always attack and counter-attack, sue constantly, and claim victory no matter what. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cohn">Roy Cohn</a>&nbsp;was a lawyer&nbsp;<a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/frank-rich-roy-cohn-the-original-donald-trump.html">Frank Rich felicitously called</a>&nbsp;“The worst human being who ever lived … the most evil, twisted, vicious bastard ever to snort coke at Studio 54.” Talk about character: Cohn was absolutely interesting. As Politico puts it <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/19/roy-cohn-donald-trump-documentary-228144">here</a>, “Cohn imparted an M.O. that’s been on searing display throughout Trump’s ascent, his divisive, captivating campaign, and his fraught, unprecedented presidency. Deflect and distract, never give in, never admit fault, lie and attack, lie and attack, publicity no matter what, win no matter what, all underpinned by a deep, prove-me-wrong belief in the power of chaos and fear.”) 
 By playing the ultimate alpha. That’s why he constantly calls himself the winner, and “loser” is one of his favorite epithets. 
 By de-legitimizing facts, truths, norms, and those who traffic in them. Key to this is accusing others of wrongs he commits himself. This is why he labels CNN and other news organizations “fake news” while raising falsity to an art form. Often, his accusations against others are a reliable tell of his guilt for doing the same thing. 
 As for movement, every new problem Trump creates or intensifies is meant to generate an emotional response, which is movement in itself. 
 
<p>Look closely: Trump’s news is deliberate, theatrical, and constant. All of it is staged and re-staged, so every unavoidably interesting thing he says or does pushes the last thing he said or did off the stage and into irrelevance, because whatever he’s saying or doing now&nbsp;demands full attention, no matter what he said or did yesterday.</p>
<p>There is genius to this, and it requires understanding and respect—especially by those who report on it.</p>
<p>You can call this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=trolling">trolling</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22earned-media+coverage%22">earned media coverage</a>, meaning the free kind. Both are true. Comparing Trump to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Foundation_series_characters#The_Mule">The Mule</a> in Isaac Asimov’s Foundation and Empire also makes sense.&nbsp;(The Mule was a mutant with exceptional influence over the emotions of whole populations.&nbsp;It was by noting this resemblance that I, <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2016/07/13/trumps-glide-path/">along with Scott Adams</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1096546390027563008">expected Trump to win</a> in 2016.)</p>
<p>This speaks of two big fails for journalism:</p>
 
 Its&nbsp;appetite for stories proves a weakness when it’s fed by a genius at hogging the stage. 
 It avoids&nbsp;reporting what doesn’t fit the story format. This includes most of reality. 
 
<p>My <a href="https://spiritsinspacesuits.com/">favorite priest</a> says “Some truths are so deep only stories can tell them,” and I’m sure this is true. But stories by themselves are also inadequate ways to present essential facts people need to know because they exclude what doesn’t fit “the narrative,” which is the modern way to talk about story—and to spin journalists. (My hairs of suspicion stand on end every time I hear the word “narrative.”)</p>
<p>So here’s the paradox: We need to know more than stories can tell, yet stories are pretty much all people are interested in. Character, problem, and movement give shape and purpose to every human life. We can’t correct for it.</p>
<p>That’s why my topic here—a deep and abiding flaw (also a feature) of both journalism and human nature—is one most journalists won’t touch. The flawed nature of The Story itself is not a story. Same goes for&nbsp; “earned media coverage.” Both are features rather than bugs because they cause much of journalism’s success and debugging them has proven impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, but we can debug the context of journalism, which is the world of facts—especially facts in the physical world. That’s why I’m sharing these CAL FIRE maps. Besides being extremely useful, they highlight how much more needs to be compiled and put in useful forms, so the stories journalism tells can be as fact-based as possible. In an upcoming post, I’ll talk about a new time and history-based way to gather, compile, and archive facts that can maximize their usefulness to journalism in the present, when deadlines rule. If you want to learn a bit about this approach, I outline it in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/06/30/the-future-present-and-past-of-news/">The Future, Present, and Past of News</a> (eleventh in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series).</p>

<p>These days, it seems almost everyone owns a smartphone. In the US, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/">91% of adults</a> have one, in Europe, this figure is <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1147144/smartphone-penetration-forecast-in-europe">89%</a>, while in India, Deloitte <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/india-to-have-1-billion-smartphone-users-by-2026-deloitte/articleshow/89750324.cms">predicts</a> 75% of adults will have a smartphone by 2026. In total, there are an <a href="https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world">estimated 4.8 billion</a> smartphone users in the world, which is an incredible number! This means that for tech startups and tech businesses that build consumer products, it’s a baseline expectation for them to be usable on smartphones, and for there to be a mobile app for the product.</p><p>So, how do you build mobile apps? There’s plenty of choice: you can build a native mobile app for iOS using Swift or Objective C as a programming language, make one for Android using Java or Kotlin, and of course, you can develop a web app for desktop and mobile web users. All this adds up to three separate codebases and plenty of business logic replication.</p><p>Or you can do what startups like social media newcomer Bluesky did: have one codebase that powers the web, native iOS, and native Android apps. For Bluesky, a single developer wrote the initial version of all three apps using React Native and Expo. We cover more on this in the article, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/145059916/mobile-and-web-stack">Inside Bluesky’s engineering culture</a>.</p><p>There are cross-platform frameworks and approaches that offer a way to use a single codebase to power multiple native apps and a website. A decade ago, most cross-platform technologies were in their early stages, but things are shifting; in October 2022, we covered whether more cross-platform development could lead to less <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/native-vs-cross-platform">native iOS and Android hiring by startups</a>.</p><p>Today’s article looks into current cross-platform development approaches, covering:</p>  <p>The ecosystem. Most apps remain fully native, with Flutter and React Native (RN) the clear leaders for cross-platform development. RN is more popular in the US and UK, and apps built with it tend to generate more money.</p>  <p>React Native. The framework of choice for many Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Shopify apps, and at places whose web teams work with React.</p>  <p>Flutter. Built and championed by Google, and the framework for most cross-platform apps.</p>  <p>Native-first approaches. Kotlin multiplatform, Swift-based frameworks (Skip, Scade), .NET MAUI (C#), NativeScript (JavaScript), and Unity.</p>  <p>Web-based frameworks. Cordova, Capacitor, Ionic, and Progressive Web Apps.</p>  <p>Choosing the right framework. A mental model for identifying key differences between all these technologies. In the end, most teams choose React Native or Flutter.</p>  <p>The bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cross-platform-mobile-development">Read the full article uninterrupted, online.</a></p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cross-platform-mobile-development">Read the full article online</a></p> 1. The ecosystem <p>What are the most popular cross-platform frameworks? Interesting <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20241025?f=1">research by Appfigures</a> looked at all the top apps on the iOS App Store and Android’s Google Play, peeked into their binaries, and categorized them by the framework used:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff8874ee7-f6c6-4837-8160-7ecf949ab82b_1560x962.png">          </a>The most popular frameworks for iOS and Android apps. Source: <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/20241025?f=1">Appfigures</a> <p>Other research published <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/869224/worldwide-software-developer-working-hours/">on Statista</a> suggests Flutter and React Native are the most popular choices, followed by Cordova, Unity, and Ionic:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cc9d1ab-81e3-4539-9c86-91214eca2f5a_1422x908.png">          </a>Cross-platform mobile adoption trends (2020-2023) based on a survey of 30,000 respondents. Flutter was used by 46% of respondents, and RN by 35% in 2023. Data source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/869224/worldwide-software-developer-working-hours/">Statista</a> <p>Leaders: Flutter and React Native. These are the two most popular frameworks, but it can be tricky to identify which one is the most popular: on iOS, there are more React Native-powered, and on Android, Flutter apps outnumber React Native ones. However, there are simply more Android apps than iOS ones, which is why there are more Flutter apps than React Native ones, overall. React Native has been around since 2015, and Flutter since 2017.</p><p>Shrinking: Cordova and Ionic. As per the Statista survey, both frameworks have smaller but shrinking market shares, with about 10-12% of survey participants using them. Their usage is likely more common at companies which were building cross-platform apps before React Native and Flutter emerged, and remain content to ship WebView-based applications.</p><p>Growth potential: Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). This technology has modest adoption rates, but seems to be gaining momentum. JetBrains is investing heavily in it, while the Kotlin language is popular with native mobile developers, especially with Android folks.</p> React Native or Flutter more popular? <p>New data from the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/">2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a> offers pointers. Below is a breakdown of the mobile cross-platform frameworks used by circa 6,500 respondents:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22c93702-59d5-46d6-a1a6-0cca0062eb61_1136x886.png">          </a>Cross-platform mobile framework usage by developers. Data source: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/">Stack Overflow</a> <p>From this data, it’s clear that Flutter and React Native are the most popular by a distance, with more users than all other frameworks, combined. But which is the most popular, overall? To find out, let’s slice and dice the data; firstly by narrowing it down to only professional developers by removing hobbyist users:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4d58f32-c39b-4f38-81f3-1f37e0854d8c_1080x444.png">          </a>Framework usage by professional developers of cross-platform apps. Source: <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a> <p>Flutter is used by slightly more engineers, though the difference is perhaps smaller than before. What happens if we consider per-country usage?

Despite having fewer users, React Native-built apps on aggregate generated more net revenue ($287M) than Flutter apps ($283M), after Apple and Google’s 30% cuts.</p><p>The following section looks into each framework.</p> 2. React Native <p>React Native appears to be the most popular cross-platform framework in the US and UK markets. What are the likely reasons for this popularity?</p>  <p>No need for frontend developers to learn a new language. Developers who know JavaScript or TypeScript will have no trouble getting started with React Native, and devs working with React will find the transition especially easy. As we know, React is the most popular frontend framework, with around 70% of frontend developers using it in 2024, as per the <a href="https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#frameworks">State of Frontend 2024</a> survey.</p>  <p>Easy enough to hire for. React’s popularity means it’s a bit easier to hire for this skillset, than for native iOS or Android developers. The challenge of hiring native developers was one reason Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/blog/announcing-coinbases-successful-transition-to-react-native">moved</a> to React Native in 2021.</p>  <p>Expo. The <a href="https://expo.dev/">Expo framework</a> is built to simplify development with React Native, and is especially useful for teams. It helped boost adoption of React Native; without Expo, developers must set up both Android Studio and Xcode, manage emulators and simulators, and manage the native code. React Native’s own documentation <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup">recommends</a> using Expo when getting started, as doing so without it makes the work <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started-without-a-framework">several times more complex</a>. Most of Expo is open source, but some services like Expo Application Services (EAS) have paid tiers.</p>  <p>React Native was open sourced by Facebook, in 2015. As the name suggests, this framework allows creating cross-platform apps using syntax similar to React applications. Here’s how a “Hello, World” app looks like using React Native:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf1a4f0e-03a2-481d-bf48-111410ea4246_1600x1200.png">          </a>A simple React Native example.

The social platform <a href="https://discord.com/blog/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native">moved</a> to React Native in 2016 for iOS, and in 2018, two engineers rebuilt the iOS app in React Native at a time when the app already had millions of daily users. The team held off on moving to Android for performance reasons, until in 2022 they <a href="https://discord.com/blog/android-react-native-framework-update">moved</a> the Android app to React Native; sharing the same codebase, and keeping iOS and Android-specific UI for each platform.</p><p>It’s worth noting Discord often opts for cross-platform technologies: its desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux are based on <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>; a cross-platform desktop technology based on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6fa2d7d-7a70-4d47-9a20-bfeb853b50f3_1600x750.png">          </a>Discord’s iOS and Android app. Source: Discord <p>Coinbase moved to React Native <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/blog/announcing-coinbases-successful-transition-to-react-native">in 2021</a>, when it had 56 million users and $1.8B in revenue. Moving off native to RN involved migrating more than 200 screens, and retraining more than 30 native-only engineers. Interestingly, Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/blog/announcing-coinbases-successful-transition-to-react-native">claimed</a> that moving to RN reduced their cold start time from 3.8 seconds to 2.5 seconds (still quite a lot, to be fair!), and improved reliablity by increasing the crash-free rate from 99.4% to 99.7%.</p><p>A big motivation seemed to be to build more with fewer engineers, and make more consistent app experiences across platforms. The company labelled the transition a success: it reduced the number of codebases from 3 (iOS, Android and Web) to 2 (React Native and React Web), and web engineers could work on the mobile app, and mobile engineers on the web one.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20d4ae54-c0d6-4f93-a32c-0bdfe6b2963b_1400x799.png">          </a>Coinbase app built using React Native.

Just this week, the company reflected on how it went, <a href="https://shopify.engineering/five-years-of-react-native-at-shopify?q=v">sharing</a>:</p>  <p>More productivity: thanks to one codebase powering iOS and Android, and working across both apps</p>  <p>Performance and reliability: all pages have sub-500ms loads and crash-free rates are above 99.9%. Both are impressive numbers!</p>  <p>TypeScript for the win: using TypeScript makes it easy for devs to transfer between React and React Native.</p>  <p>There are downsides: debugging is worse than for native apps, and updating to new React Native versions can be painful.</p>  <p>Shopify employs more than 2,000 software engineers, and is one of the largest tech companies to go all-in on this technology. That it’s working for them, five years later, is a strong vote of confidence. Read more about <a href="https://shopify.engineering/five-years-of-react-native-at-shopify?q=v">Shopify’s 5-year reflections on RN</a>.</p><p>Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are not known for fully React-native apps, but do use plenty of RN functionality in their apps:</p>  <p>Meta: React Native’s creator utilizes it heavily for Facebook, Instagram, Ads Manager, Messenger, and Meta Horizon. The company recently <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/10/02/android/react-at-meta-connect-2024/">shared</a> that more than of its 5,000 engineers work with React code, and Meta apps have some clever React Native-related performance enhancements; for example, in the Facebook app, React Native is initialized when a user visits the first React Native surface, and not on app start. This allows for faster app startup.</p>  <p>Microsoft: the tech giant uses both React and React Native in products like Windows, XBox, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams, and other apps. The Windows maker is a heavy user of this technology for native performance and cross-platform code sharing reasons, as it <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/2022-09-02-rneu-microsoft-billions/">said</a> in 2022. Microsoft has also started to invest heavily in <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/">React Native for Windows and MacOS</a>.</p>  <p>Amazon: parts of Amazon Shopping, Amazon Alexa, and Amazon Photos also utilize RN, as per the React Native showcase. Also, Amazon’s Kindle device uses it.</p>  <p>The home screen of Kindle is rendered with React Native, after Amazon migrated away from a Java-based UI <a href="https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/amazon-kindle-ui-is-switching-from-javascript-to-react-native">in 2022</a>.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea81123e-7ef0-49aa-b123-d94e16a94900_1280x720.png">          </a>The Kindle home screen is rendered using React Native.

Flutter <p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> was launched in 2017 by Google as a solution for cross-platform development. Initially, it targeted Android developers, allowing them to write code once for separate Android and iOS native applications.</p><p>Flutter uses the Dart programming language, a strongly-typed language with similar syntax to C# and Java. A clear downside of Flutter is the requirement to learn Dart. However, this is easy to pick up, especially with experience of Java or Kotlin. Here’s what a simple Flutter application looks like:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F080ae2dc-e62c-4256-9ea3-ae4af6fb3b7f_1230x1414.png">          </a>A simple Flutter app, written in Dart <p>RN uses native elements, but Flutter uses its own rendering engine called the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller">Impeller rendering engine</a>. This design choice means Flutter offers consistent UI experience across iOS and Android – and even the web! The rendering engine and the programming language of choice are the biggest differences compared to React Native, and native development. Here is how <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanbonnet/">Jordan Bonnet</a> – formerly the first mobile engineer at Uber and current founder of Flutter user onboarding startup <a href="https://fluo.dev/">fluo.dev</a> – explained this difference to me:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd66124d8-105c-48f6-a5f7-816f861ae7e8_1600x804.png">          </a>Summarizing the differences between the three platforms.

 Part 2: Issuing&nbsp;Badges <p>In <a href="https://blog.dcconsortium.org/explaining-verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-5bf2f482b383">part one</a> of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> data model which describes how claims made online can be&nbsp;proven.</p><p>To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local community college. Olivia is told that with each course she will be awarded and issued a badge that she can use to apply for employment.</p><p>Let’s start with what “issuing a badge” means using the most common approaches:</p><p>For older Open Badges (versions 0.5 to 2.1): The issuer saves completed course data in the format of an Open Badge that includes Olivia’s email address. When the issuer saves the data, the badge is considered “issued”. This data will be used to populate a web page or a file on the web. This web page or file must be public for Olivia to share online and be considered verifiable. In order for Olivia to do this, she must have an account on the issuing platform associated with the same email&nbsp;address.</p><p>For Open Badges 3.0 &amp; W3C Verifiable Credentials: The issuer decides that Olivia should be awarded a badge and provides a secure link for Olivia to retrieve it. Olivia uses a digital wallet to click the secure link which makes a request to the issuing software to produce the badge. The issuing software retrieves and digitally signs the badge data; at this moment the badge has been by definition “issued.” (Prior to this digital signature, the badge itself did not exist.) It is sent to Olivia’s wallet where she claims and secures it, now able to share it privately at her discretion. It is important to note that this credential is hosted locally on Olivia’s device. There is no web page or URL for this credential until Olivia decides to create a public&nbsp;link.</p> Different Trust&nbsp;Models   Older Open Badges are hosted on the web. In this model, trust in the credential is based on the reputation of the badging platform hosting the credentials. Perceptions of trust of websites or platforms can be based on elements like issuer identity confirmation, availability of content, and security of the web site (<a href="https://www.digicert.com/how-tls-ssl-certificates-work">how websites are secured</a>).  Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials are digitally signed, portable files. In this model, trust is based on the cryptographic digital signature and privacy. The digital signature in the credential is readable to the verification software, which looks for information indicating which entity signed the credential and if the data has changed since it was signed. Confirmation of the issuing entity’s identity happens later using an issuer registry (to be explained in more detail in a future&nbsp;post).  <p>Olivia has unfettered access to the credential and can share it knowing that when she does, her actions aren’t being tracked or communicated to the issuer. When she shares her credential, it is signed by the digital identity associated with the credential issuer so that the verifier can trust that she has control of the digital identity and the credential.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Open Badges v3 and Verifiable Credential issuing platforms could still have public web pages for badges. Olivia may not want all of her badges digitally signed but with Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials, she has that&nbsp;choice.</p><p>This blog post is Part 2 of a series of content explaining W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0. Stay tuned for Part 3 — “What does it mean that a badge is digitally signed?”.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>Is blogging still a thing?</p><p>If you’re reading this, please comment or like it so I know.</p><p><br></p><p>I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn’t waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a>, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distributed data at scale. Over the years, I’ve reflected on qualities essential for data ecosystems, qualities that are often overshadowed by content-driven ecosystems. For example:</p><p>	•	Caching semantics: Apps need governance and management of caches to respect data ownership while maintaining local operational efficiency.</p><p>	•	Transactionality: Mature data protocols depend on it for consistency and reliability.</p><p>	•	Request batching: Optimizing network requests is vital for performance and scalability.</p><p><br></p><p>After years away, I’m ready to dive back in. There are a couple of apps I want to build, and I want to build them on a distributed data platform. My first idea is a fully distributed implementation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-degraf-4521/">Brad deGraf</a>’s BooksWeLike concept—a way to share and discover books that resonate with you. (Brad, if you’re reading this and don’t like the idea, let me know!)</p><p><br></p><p>To make this happen, I’ve started scanning the distributed protocol space to see what’s out there. Here’s my initial list of protocols to evaluate:</p><p>	•	AT Protocol</p><p>	•	Nostr</p><p>	•	Solid</p><p>	•	ActivityPub</p><p>	•	Matrix</p><p>	•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</p><p>	•	SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)</p><p>	•	DID (Decentralized Identifiers)</p><p>	•	Libp2p</p><p>	•	Hypercore</p><p>	•	Waku</p><p>	•	Zero-Knowledge Identity Protocols (ZK Protocols)</p><p><br></p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>Are there protocols on this list that don’t belong? If so, why? Are there others I should consider? I haven’t started my evaluations yet, so I’m open to your insights. If you’ve built apps on these protocols or have opinions about them, I’d love to hear from you.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be capturing my journey of discovery here—sharing what I learn, where I stumble, and how I (hopefully) succeed. Let’s make distributed data a reality, by and for the people.</p>

These advantages make our scheme a promising candidate for privacy-preserving digital identity applications.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>当社のECDSAの証明書は60ミリ秒で生成できます。ISO MDOC標準のような完全に標準化されたアイデンティティプロトコルに組み込まれた場合、クレデンシャルのサイズにもよりますが、モバイルデバイス上でMDOCプレゼンテーションフロー用のゼロ知識証明書を1.2秒で生成できます。これらの利点により、当社の方式はプライバシー保護型デジタルアイデンティティアプリケーションの有望な候補となっています。</p></blockquote><p>mdocのプレゼンテーション時にゼロ知識証明を1.2秒で生成、このくらいなら実用性がありそうですね。</p><p>論文の本文もPDFで閲覧できるようになっているので、おいおい見ていこうと思います。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p>

<p>Twenty-first in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">New Commons</a> series<br>
Fifth on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Several generations ago, my pal <a href="https://www.umassd.edu/indic/faculty-and-staff/solfvin/">Jerry</a> and I were cutting a hole between the ceiling joists of a rented house in Durham, North Carolina. This was our first step toward installing a drop-down stairway to an attic space that had been closed since the house, a defunct parsonage for a dead church, was built early that century. We were eager to open the space, and to see what, if anything, might be in the time capsule it contained. In the midst of this, while both of us were choking on plaster dust, Jerry asked this profound question:</p>
<p>What is the base unit of human consciousness?</p>
<p>Without thinking, I answered,</p>
<p>The story.</p>
<p>I said that because I was a journalist. And no journalist who ever worked for a newspaper has gone long without hearing some editor say, What’s the story?</p>
<p>Editors ask that because stories are the only things that interest people. Simple as that.</p>
<p>I was 22 years old and in my first reporting job when the managing editor at my paper made clear that all stories have just three requirements. Not parts. Not sections. Requirements. Here they are:</p>
 
 Character(s) 
 Problem(s) 
 Movement 
 
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>This visual might help:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The character can be a person, a team, a cause, a political party, or any noun eligible for emotional investment. Love and hate work best, but feeling will do. You can also have more than one character, including yourself.</p>
<p>The problem can be anything that involves conflict or struggle. Problems keep you tuned in, turning the page, returning to see what happened, what will happen next, or what might happen. There can be any number of problems as well. You can soften these by calling them a challenge, but the point is the same. Stories don’t start with Happily Ever After.</p>
<p>Movement has to be forward. Thats it. You don’t need a conclusion unless the story ends.</p>
<p>Take away any of those requirements, and you don’t have a story. Or a life. Or anything interesting.</p>
<p>Look at everyone you care about, everything you want, every game you play, every project you work on, every test you take, every class you attend, every course you study, every language you learn. All are stories or parts of them, or pregnant with the promise of them. Because stories are what we care about.</p>
<p>Think of those requirements as three elements that make the molecule we call a story. (Or a narrative. Same thing.)</p>
<p>Now think of every news medium as a source of almost nothing but story molecules.</p>
<p>Is that all journalism should be?</p>
<p>I submit that stories are pretty much all journalism is.</p>
<p>I harp on this because journalism (the good and honest kind) works in the larger environment we call facts.</p>
<p>We can have better stories if we have more and better facts.</p>
<p>And, if we preserve both stories and facts, we’ll have better journalism.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/14/how-facts-matter/">next post on this</a> is about facts.</p>
<p>Can we make those more interesting as characters?</p>
<p>Only if we can make clear what their problems are, and how we—the story-tellers—can make the most interesting use of them.</p>
<p>Are you still wondering what Jerry and I found in that attic?</p>
<p>Alas, nothing. But it did make a useful space.</p>
<p>Decades later, it looks pretty good, and I see there’s a nice window in the front dormer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The address is <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jNKBev9RLNvoTie8A">1810 Lakewood Avenue</a>. I also see the dead church behind it, at 1811 Palmer, is now a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PcWnpjHka64LoAYr8">live community center</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PcWnpjHka64LoAYr8"></a></p>
<p>I have more stories about both of them… How there was once a shoot-out in the back yard. How our cat (named Motorcat, because you could hear him purr in another room) was such an alpha predator that he took out countless large rats, and once ate a rabbit in the kitchen while we were gone, leaving just one little bone. How the least pesty mouse, called Old Half-tail, asked me with gestures to move him to the woods somewhere, so he’d be more safe. How we could still heat the place with anthracite coal in the original fireplaces that were built for it. The list goes on.</p>
<p>All of that is not much as history, but there are facts involved that might be interesting to the current owners, who (we can see) are working on expanding the place.</p>
<p>The world is full of such stuff. Let’s make better use of as much as we can find.</p>
<p>I’d like to start in Los Angeles, where the need for good facts is extremely high right now, and so many places where facts were kept—<a href="https://apnews.com/article/southern-california-wildfires-la-022c6588ac472f227b522ffd6552a642">over twelve thousand homes, at last count</a>—are gone.</p>
<p>We have the Internet now. We have AI. In these early decades of our new Digital Age, our collective tabula is still mostly rasa.&nbsp;Writing facts on it, and not just stories, should be Job One for journalism.</p>

<p>3:22pm—Hats off to Miles Archer for the links below, one of which goes here—</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/11/aviation-vs-fire/#comment-30547"></a></p>
<p>—showing all the aircraft and their paths at once. You can start here at https://globe.adsbexchange.com/, which is kind of your slate that’s blank except for live aircraft over the Palisades Fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://globe.adsbexchange.com/"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile all the media are reporting one home loss, in the 3000 block of Mandeville Canyon Road in Brentwood.</p>
<p>As you can see above, most of the action right now is on the north flank of the Palisades fire, along the crest of the ridge:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is a Chinook dropping water alongside Mandeville Canyon Road near where it adjoins Mulholland Drive:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I should pause here to say I’m just getting acquainted with <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/ways-to-join-the-exchange/">ADS-B Exchange</a>, the “World’s largest source of unfiltered flight data.” <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/what-is-the-exchange/">Here’s the About page</a>. Bottom line: “In essence, ADS-B Exchange is more than just a flight-tracking website; it’s a dynamic, collaborative community committed to bringing transparency and inclusivity to the world of aviation.” It has <a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/community/">a pile of social channels</a>, and lots of ways to join in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9:00am—The battle against wildfires in Los Angeles is almost entirely won by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_firefighting">aerial firefighting</a>. Helicopters and airplanes dropping water and retardants on fires and along perimeters saved Hollywood from the Sunset Fire two nights ago. They saved Encino from the Paradise Fire last night, and they are saving Brentwood right now. What we see above, thanks to KABC/7, is N43CU, a Boeing CH-47D Chinook, gathering water in Stone Canyon Reservoir to dump on the Palisades Fire in Brentwood. Here is its recent flight path, thanks to FlightRadar24:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N42CU/38aee530"></a></p>
<p>And here is N60VC, a Sikorsky HH-60L Firehawk from Ventura County Fire Protection, filling up in the Encino Reservoir and running its routes over the fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/34.12,-118.51/14"></a></p>
<p>And here is Cal Fire’s CFR605, a Sikorsky S-70i Firehawk:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/CFR605/38aeeee2"></a></p>
<p>They can do all this because the winds right now are relatively calm, as they also were last night above Encino and the night before above Hollywood. When the winds are too strong for them to handle, we have what happened to Pacific Palisades and Altadena.</p>
<p>Some flights are mysteries (at least to me), but seem to have some relevance, such as this Piper out of Riverside, weaving back and forth across three of the fires regions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/PA31/38af0192"></a></p>
<p>I want to know more about that one because I want to know more about everything, and to share as much as I can, as much for historical reasons as well as to satisfy current curiosities.</p>
<p>Anyway, if all goes well, the fire will burn a maximum spread of fuel (desert grass, forest, and chaparral), creating fire breaks good for a year or two—and then stop spreading short of houses and neighborhoods. Lord willin’ and the wind don’t come all thes fires will be sufficiently contained.</p>
<p>Also, if we’re lucky, Winter—our rainy season—will finally arrive, all the brown will turn green, and the fire season won’t return until late Spring.</p>
<p>Three bonus links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.levernews.com/the-architects-of-l-a-s-wildfire-devastation/">The Architects Of L.A.’s Wildfire Devastation</a>, by <a href="https://www.levernews.com/author/katya/">Katya Schwenk</a> in The Lever. She makes a sensible case against development in areas such as the ones being saved in Brentwood right now. But she doesn’t mention a second danger. That’s why you need to read— 
 <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>, by John McPhee in The New Yorker . That ran in 1988, and later in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Control-Nature-John-McPhee/dp/0374522596">The Control of Nature</a>. McPhee is the Shakespeare, the Rembrandt, the Beethoven, of nonfiction. What he says about where and how we live with danger is essential for making sense out of both the fires today,and the debris flows they assure when big rain comes. Which it will. A pull-quote: “The phalanxed communities of Los Angeles have pushed themselves hard against these mountains, an aggression that requires a deep defense budget to contend with the results.”

See the part 1 post for more details on the LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY.</p> #OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>The pip install dependencies I put as comments at the top of the python file. There is also a requirements.txt for the project as a whole that covers all the “Test” experiments package requirements.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface<br># pip install llama-index-llms-ollama<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file <p>The nice thing about LlamaIndex LlamaParse is that it provides an auto mode that will use premium mode when specified criteria are met. In this experiment, I have set auto mode on with triggers for mode change on in- page images or tables. Also, to save on parsing credit usage in LlamaParse and because, for this example, it is all that is needed, I have set the pages to be parsed to PDF page 9 only (note that PDF page 9 is target page 8 to LlamaParse because it uses a 0 based page index). Like the part 1 post, I am using an output of markdown because it provides greater context to the LLM; though, I did try it with result_type=text and received the proper query response despite the answer to the query being in a&nbsp;table.</p> # set LlamaParse for markdown output and auto_mode only parsing page 8<br>parser = LlamaParse(<br>    result_type="markdown", <br>    auto_mode=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page=True,<br>    target_pages="8",<br>    verbose=True<br>) <p>So that you don’t have to open the PDF document that gets parsed to understand the input below is a screenshot of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>As in part 1, I use LlamaParse.load_data to read the page and parse it. Since it has a table in-page and we are in auto mode it will automatically use Premium mode to potentially better handle the page and table. This will cause the page parse to cost 15 credits on LlamaIndex. Note that LlamaIndex will cache your parsed page for 48 hours unless you specify otherwise or change the parse parameters which allows you to run the code more than once and only get the credit cost once. I did try using the default “accurate” mode by removing the auto_mode parameters on the LlamaParse and it still parsed the table properly and returned the proper answer to the query — but this is a sample for showing the use of “auto mode” so just pretend that is not the&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you want to see the output of the parser, uncomment the print command after the documents variable is populated. I like to then paste it into a markdown viewer to see it as rendered markdown output. See the below image for that&nbsp;output.</p> with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # LlamaParse will cache a parsed document 48 hours if the parse parameters are not changed<br>    # thus not incuring additional parse cost if you run this multiple times for testing purposes<br>    # see the history tab in the LlamaParse dashboard for the project to confirm that <br>    # credits used = 0 for subsequent runs<br>    # <br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the output uncomment the below<br>    #print(documents[0].text) <p>I like to set the default settings for LLM and embedding model so that I don’t need to pass them around as parameters. Here is where I set the embedding model to a Hugging Face provided model. When you run the python for the first time it will pull down the embedding model automatically — nice!</p> # set the default embeddings and llm so that it doesn't have to be passed around<br>Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5")<br>Settings.llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1:latest", request_timeout=120.0) <p>The next part of the code does the same that it did in Part 1 except that this time the VectoreStoreIndex and the query engine use the models I set in the Settings singleton versus the LlamaIndex default of&nbsp;OpenAI.</p> # index the parsed documents using the default embedding model<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index using the default llm<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "What is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>If all goes well you should get the response output as 0.5 and if you look back at the table from the page you’ll see that is&nbsp;correct.</p> (.venv) PS C:\python\LlamaIndex_Test\Test1\src&gt; python parse_ollama.py<br>Started parsing the file under job_id 37dce328-aaa7-499b-afe9-498c32b63944<br>.0.5 <p>To validate that the value was coming from the RAG provided PDF page and not the the LLMs inherent “knowledge”, I asked a similar question via the command line to Ollama without providing the RAG context— output&nbsp;below:</p> PS C:\temp&gt; ollama run llama3.1:latest "what is the latency in seconds for Nova Micro Amazon LLM model?"<br>I don't have access to specific information about the latency of the Nova Micro Amazon LLM (Large Language Model)<br>model. The details regarding models like this, especially concerning their performance metrics such as latency,<br>are typically available from the developers or through official documentation and may be subject to change. If<br>you're looking for accurate and up-to-date information on this topic, I recommend checking directly with Nova<br>Micro's resources or contacting them for the most current data. <p>There you have it. But I am not done quite yet in reporting my results. In LlamaIndex’s examples, they used this PDF but used PDF page 1 which contains an image. See below an image of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>They use this page to demonstrate how LlamaParse in auto mode moves into premium mode for the page parsing because of the image and then creates a mermaid diagram from the image because it recognizes the image is of a diagram. Below is what they report as the outcome in&nbsp;part.</p> # The Amazon Nova Family of Models:<br># Technical Report and Model Card<br><br>Amazon Artificial General Intelligence<br><br>```mermaid<br>graph TD<br>    A[Text] --&gt; B[Nova Lite]<br>    C[Image] --&gt; B<br>    D[Video] --&gt; E[Nova Pro]<br>    F[Code] --&gt; E<br>    G[Docs] --&gt; E<br>    B --&gt; H[Text]<br>    B --&gt; I[Code]<br>    E --&gt; H<br>    E --&gt; I<br>    J[Text] --&gt; K[Nova Micro]<br>    L[Code] --&gt; K<br>    K --&gt; M[Text]<br>    K --&gt; N[Code]<br>    O[Text] --&gt; P[Nova Canvas]<br>    Q[Image] --&gt; P<br>    P --&gt; R[Image]<br>    S[Text] --&gt; T[Nova Reel]<br>    U[Image] --&gt; T<br>    T --&gt; V[Video]<br>    <br>    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style K fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style P fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    style T fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px<br>    <br>    classDef input fill:#lightblue,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class A,C,D,F,G,J,L,O,Q,S,U input;<br>    <br>    classDef output fill:#lightgreen,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;<br>    class H,I,M,N,R,V output;<br>```<br><br>Figure 1: The Amazon Nova family of models <p>When I tried this I did not get the same outcome from the parse.

<p>10:15pm—Here is a Google Earth Pro view of the Palisades fire crossing the wilderness north of Pacific Palisades and south of “Dry Mulholland”—the dirt road that serves as a firebreak along the ridge of the mountains south of the San Fernando Valley:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The large squares are MODIS satellite fire detections. The smaller ones are VIIRS. The fire is now farther north (toward the top) than you see here, and being fought by aircraft on the ridge:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N42CU/38adb761"></a></p>
<p>I count ten aircraft including the Chninook whose flight path I’ve highlighted. Note three more on Encino Reservoir, scooping up water to drop on the fire, or on vegetation—in this case surrounding Mandeville Canyon, an enclave in the floor of the canyon south of San Vicente Mountain Park. By the way, these helicopters can carry and drop 3000 gallons (I think I just heard) and can refill in just 90 seconds.</p>
<p>Encino, north of the ridge, is being evacuated, wise precaution.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that winds are calm, allowing aircraft to do their work. This was not possible while Pacific Palisades and Altadena were largely destroyed by the Palisades and Eaton Fires. It was possible during the Sunset and Kenneth fires.</p>
<p>KABC/7 ha dramatic video, but also reports that the fire appears to be contained. One grab:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s important to note that dramatic pictures can, without meaning to, tell stories that aren’t quite true, or are less true than the picture suggests. For example, in my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=sbgapfire">coverage</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Fire_(2008)">Gap Fire</a> near Santa Barbara in 2008, I <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2008/07/04/fire-from-the-mission/">used</a> <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/2635730822/in/album-72157605964451456/">this picture</a> of the Santa Barbara Mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/2635730822/in/album-72157605964451456/"></a></p>
<p>When I shot that, I was by a rose garden about 800 feet east of the Mission, looking west past a fire 8 miles away, toward the setting Sun, 8 million miles away. Also, I underexposed the photo to make everything legible (and good photographically). I explained all that in text of my report. Still, many people looked at the picture and assumed that the Mission was on fire. Likewise, it’s easy to look at TV images of tiny helicopters floating in space above a flaming ridge and a wall of flames, as we see here as the index image used by KABC/7 for its video on the fires—</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/"></a></p>
<p>—and assume that this is a losing battle for the chopper people. It’s a great photograph, but the story it seems to tell is too simple, and too easily misleading.</p>

<p>Twentieth in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series<br>
Fourth on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>That collection of tabs is my dashboard of major media that inform my writing about the #LAfires. There are tabs for five TV stations, one radio station, and one newspaper:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/watch/">KNBC/4 “4 Los Angeles”</a> 
 <a href="https://ktla.com/">KTLA/5 “LA’s Very Own”</a> 
 <a href="https://abc7.com/">KABC/7&nbsp; “7 Eyewitness News”</a> 
 <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/">KCAL/9 “KCAL NEWS CBS Los Angeles”</a> 
 <a href="https://www.foxla.com/">KTTV/11 “Fox 11 Los Angeles”</a> 
 <a href="https://laist.com/">KPCC/89.3 “LAist”</a> 
 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/c">Los Angeles Times</a> 
 
<p>Note the order. I come from the Dial Age, when radios and TVs looked like those things on the left and center below, and the LA Times had eleven sections, chock full of interesting stuff, on the right:</p>
<p></p>
<p>With their many sections, newspapers were also dials of a sort. Below the LA Times eleven sections in that photo lay the five sections of the Santa Barbara News-Press, another great newspaper, now deceased. (Both papers are from Sunday, May 21, 2006.)</p>
<p>Of course, my news appetite ranges far beyond broadcast and print. That’s why I have tabs for social media in another window. Those include <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls">Facebook</a>, (shoutout to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/busblog">Tony Pierce</a>) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/docsearls/">Instagram</a>, Mastodon (<a href="https://journa.host/e">journa.host</a>) <a href="https://www.threads.net/@docsearls">Threads</a>, <a href="https://x.com/dsearls">Xitter</a>, and many more, including bloggers and podcasters. That dial is my window into the world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Shirky">Clay Shirky</a> wrote about in Here Comes Everybody:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-Comes-Everybody-Organizing-Organizations/dp/0143114948"></a></p>
<p>That’s where I’m going in the aftermath of the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23LAfires">#LAfires.</a></p>
<p>I want everybody to work on making news that starts with facts rather than the need to tell stories. I’ll explain more about stories and workflow in my next two posts. But first I want to unpack the portfolio of media choices we have right now.</p>
<p>We’ll start with newspapers. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times">Los Angeles Times</a> has been around since 1881. By the time I arrived in California, 104 years later, the LA Times was one of the world’s great newspapers. My wife and I subscribed until work took us to Boston in 2007. These days, like most of the world’s surviving newspapers, the&nbsp;LA Times is a fraction of its former self. But it remains substantial and important. Los Angeles wouldn’t be the same without it. Its coverage of the fires, and issues surrounding it, has been substantial and extensive. Some fire-related stuff is outside the paywall, but you’ll hit one soon if you don’t subscribe. I just signed up for a year at $60, in spite of its <a href="https://www.latimes.com/privacy-policy?_gl=1*4vqqpg*_gcl_au*MTkyODUzMTY1LjE3MzYzNjY4MTg.">privacy policy</a>, which says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may disclose your information to any agent or company that is part of The Times Parties to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.</p>
<p>We may provide access to or disclose your information to select third parties who perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, provision of content and features, advertising, analytics, research, customer service, shipping and fulfillment, data storage, security, fraud prevention, payment processing, and legal services…</p>
<p>We may disclose your information to third parties for their own and sometimes our own advertising and marketing purposes, with whom we have a contractual relationship, including without limitation third-party advertisers and advertising and list brokering networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, we will do our best to monetize your personal information any way we can—along with all the entities you never heard of, to which information about you will be spilled.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is no different than every other entity supported by surveillance-based advertising (aka adtech), which I have been fighting since the last millennium. For more on that, see my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/the-adblock-war/">People vs. Adtech</a> series.</p>
<p>But I’m setting that aside here, because I want to help the LA Times, along with all the other members of the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">news commons</a> SoCal needs now, more than ever. Because this disaster is the worst to hit SoCal ever, and won’t stop being a disaster for years to come.</p>
<p>Next, radio. While there are many fine radio stations in SoCal, only two provide round-the-clock news. One is <a href="https://www.audacy.com/stations/knxnews">KNX/1070+97.1</a>. The other is <a href="https://laist.com/">KPCC/89.3, aka LAist</a>. KNX is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacy">Audacy</a>, a bankrupt chain owner doing its best to stay alive, mostly by cost-cutting. As part of that (and subordinating of station brands to Audacy’s), KNX’s website is the minimal thing you’ll find at audacy.com/stations/knxnews. Its on-air work, however, is still primo. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPCC_(FM)">KPCC/LAist</a> is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena_City_College">Pasadena City College</a> and operated by Southern California Public Radio (SCPR), of the <a title="American Public Media Group" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Public_Media_Group">American Public Media Group</a>. Like many other public stations, LAist <a href="https://laist.com/news/laist-layoffs-buyouts-staff-reduction-2024">had a big layoff</a> last summer, but remains a very strong journalistic institution. For me, it has proven especially useful during the fires, replacing national programming with its own live coverage for the last three days, while, also partnering with KCAL/9 to carry the TV station’s audio feed much of the time. And (unlike KNX) remaining commercial-free. Its website is also chock full of useful fire stories and resources:</p>
<p><a href="https://laist.com"></a></p>
<p>One downside is the level of tracking built into the LAist website. <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> spots 42 trackers. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/laist.com%2F?f=">PageXray sees</a> 106 tracking requests, 154 adserver requests, and a personal data distribution delta that spreads quite wide:</p>
<p><a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/laist.com%2F?f="></a></p>
<p>LAist is not exceptional at this. ALL the media I’m discussing here participate in the same fecosystem. I’m calling out LAist, however, because for them it’s a dirty smudge on an otherwise clean and excellent collection of people an work.</p>
<p>Not quite finally, television. The major TV brands in SoCal are the ones born on VHF channels (the twelve on the upper knob above): 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. We had the same lineup when I was a kid in New Jersey (across the river from New York City). The networks were also the same: CBS on 2, NBC on 4, ABC on 7. The independents were on 5, 9, 11, and 13 (which in New York became the PBS station). In Los Angeles, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News_and_Stations">CBS News and Stations Division</a> now has both channel 2 (KCBS) and 9 (KCAL), the latter of which is now positioned as the news station. Fox owns and operates KTTV on channel 11. KTLA on channel 5 has been the alpha-independent in LA for a long time. (Disclosure: KTLA legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Chambers">Stan Chambers</a> and his very large family have been friends of my wife’s very large family, going back to the 1950s, when all lived in a close community in LA’s Hancock Park.) Since KABC/7 is one of the “Live TV” channels on our Roku TV here in Indiana, it was our first option for viewing LA fire news, especially in the early hours of the Palisades and Eaton fires. A close second quickly became KCAL, which we found has an app that runs on the Roku platform. So does KTLA. Here on my laptop, I jump around between all of them. If you look back over the last three days of reporting—</p>
 
 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/07/on-the-palisades-and-eaton-fires/">On the Palisades and Eaton Fires</a> (January 7)

 <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/01/09/los-angeles-fires-and-aftermath/">Los Angeles Fires and Aftermath</a> (January 9) 
 
<p>—you’ll see which of those I relied on most.</p>
<p>Finally, all of us. I like this, which KABC/7 uses as a bumper between ads and segments:</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/watch/live/"></a></p>
<p>I like SoCal Strong because&nbsp; <a href="http://trong">Boston Strong</a> worked after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing">bombings</a> in 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/explained/article/houston-strong-where-did-it-come-from-hurricane-19567137.php">Houston Strong</a> worked after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017, <a href="https://patch.com/florida/miami/parkland-marks-somber-first-anniversary-school-shooting">Parkland Strong</a> worked after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_high_school_shooting">shootings</a> there in 2018, and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22louisiana+strong">Louisiana Strong</a> works for bad whatever in that state.</p>
<p>Now, what does TOGETHER mean?</p>
<p>Viewers, presumably. But how about the rest of what we might call the media ecosystem?</p>
<p>We see a little of that with the LAist-KCAL partnership. But I think cooperation can go a lot farther than that. Not in any official or even conscious way, but rather by compiling and relying together on the largest possible collection of facts about the future and the past—especially as those facts pertain to the #LAfires, their aftermath, and recovery. And by basing stories on those facts as much as possible.</p>
<p>That also goes to everyone in social media, podcasting, and the rest of the fact-based news ecosystem.</p>
<p>Next, let’s talk about stories. Tune in tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Later (January 14)…] Peter M, below in the comments, says <a href="https://www.telemundo52.com/">Telemundo</a> , the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/espanol/">LA Times Spanish edition</a>, and <a href="https://elpais.com/us/">El Páis</a>&nbsp; are covering the situation well. Also that Noticiero Telemundo California is in the grid of live channels in&nbsp;Prime Video. I am, alas, monolingual (one of my great regrets), so I thank readers for filling gaps such as this one.</p>

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c3f4046-cf5f-4809-bf1d-e03e2321e1fa_1792x1024.heic">          </a> <p>In 2013, poor authorization practices led to one of the largest data breaches in history. Over a three-week period, hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card accounts from retail giant Target by exploiting the account of an HVAC contractor. The attack began with an email-based phishing scam that tricked an employee at the HVAC company into revealing their credentials. As a vendor to Target, the HVAC company had legitimate access to Target’s systems. Using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Target’s network and installed malware on the retailer’s point-of-sale systems, enabling them to collect customer data. The breach resulted in direct costs to Target of nearly $300 million, along with reputational damage that is difficult to quantify.1</p><p>The Target breach underscores the critical importance of not only knowing who is accessing your systems (authentication) but also controlling what they can access (authorization). The HVAC vendor had access to Target’s systems for electronic billing, contract submission, and project management. However, the hackers were able to extend this access beyond those legitimate uses to reach systems used to update point-of-sale devices. Target’s failure to properly restrict access to critical systems created a significant vulnerability that the hackers exploited.</p><p>But I don’t want you to get the idea that authorization is just about securing IT systems—it’s also fundamental to how modern cloud applications function, enabling features that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. For example, services like Google Docs and Dropbox rely on authorization to allow users to share documents with specific people while restricting access to others. Without this capability, these applications would not be possible.</p><p>Another example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), where authorization enables Amazon to securely provide hundreds of cloud services to millions of customers at scale in a cost-effective manner. As a global distributed system taking advantage of multi tenancy to service millions of customers, AWS uses a sophisticated policy-based authorization system to help customers control access to the services running inside their accounts.</p><p>Several trends make authorization a more important topic that it has been:</p>  <p>More and more software is being delivered as a service (so called Software as a Service, or SaaS). As we’ve discussed cloud-based services can’t provide the needed levels of functionality and security without strong authorization systems.</p>  <p>Perimeter-based security architectures like firewalls are giving way to zero-trust architectures. Rather than assuming everyone inside the perimeter is trusted, zero-trust systems assume breach and authorize every access. This isn’t possible without flexible authorization systems that can determine whether to grant access based on the context of the request.</p>  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected devices mean that more and more computer systems are talking to each other on their owner’s behalf. Restricting their access to the role they play protects them and prevents them from becoming a vector that hackers can exploit to break into other sensitive systems.</p>  <p>Regulatory compliance is yet another reason why authorization is increasingly important. Laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require that access to personal information be carefully controlled so that only the right people and systems can use it. Beyond controlling access, these laws also require that you be able to audit access to show compliance.</p>  <p>In addition to these, the rise of GenAI and particularly AI agents that can act on your behalf pour gasoline on the smoldering identity industry interest in authorization. Am I talking to a human? Does this agent have authority to make a doctor's appointment on the patient's behalf? These and other questions mean that making good authorization decisions, knowing what decisions were made, and easily incorporating authorization infrastructure into your apps and infrastructure is vital.</p>    Notes   <p>The story is interesting beyond the fact that it highlights the need to properly manage access. Target’s response, or rather lack of one, provides several important security lessons: <a href="https://coverlink.com/cyber-liability-insurance/target-data-breach/">Cyber Case Study: Target Data Breach</a> provides more details</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Hacker Stealing Credit Cards from DALL-E (public domain).

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Fake GitHub stars on the rise, Anthropic to raise at $60B valuation, JP Morgan mandating 5-day RTO while Amazon struggles to find enough space for the same, Devin less productive than on first glance, and more.</p>  <p>Are LLMs making StackOverflow irrelevant? Fresh data shows that the number of questions asked on StackOverflow are as low as they were back in 2009 – which was when StackOverflow was one years old. The drop suggests that ChatGPT – and LLMs – managed to make StackOverflow’s business model irrelevant in about two years’ time.</p>  <p>Apples fires staff over fake charities scam. In order to get around $4,000 per year in additional tax cuts, six Apple employees tried to defraud Apple – and the IRS. They were caught, fired, and now face prosecution. A reminder that getting “clever” with corporate perks can wreck otherwise lucrative careers at Big Tech.</p>  <p>AI models just keep improving rapidly. Two months after wondering whether LLMs have hit a plateau, the answer seems to be a definite “no.” Google’s Gemini 2.0 LLM and Veo 2 video model is impressive, OpenAI previewed a capable o3 model, and Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a frontier model that cost less than $6M to train from scratch.</p>  <p>Middle manager burnout incoming? A Forbes article suggests a broader middle manager burnout to come across most professional sectors. This could simply be a consequence <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">of higher interest rates</a>, teams growing less, and more pressure on managers. It’s tougher to be an engineering manager, than it has been during the 2010-2022 period, that’s for sure.</p>   1. Industry pulse  Fake GitHub stars <p>For years, GitHub stars have been used by a proxy for VC investors to gauge how much traction an open source project has. Projects with high traction were much more likely to attract investment because investors assumed that developers’ interest can eventually be monetized.</p><p>So, if an open source project could increase its chance of attracting funding by getting more stars, what do you think happened? According to <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.13459v1">recent research</a> by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, security platform <a href="https://socket.dev/">Socket</a>, and North Carolina State University, it’s exactly what you’d expect: projects are faking their GitHub stars.</p><p>The counterfeiting of GitHub stars seems to have exploded ~100x since just last year. Here’s data <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13459">from the paper</a>:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb543e449-e511-4b8f-858c-8ea2850d2849_1600x825.png">          </a>Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13459">4.5 Million Suspected Fake Stars in GitHub</a> <p>The report finds fake stars being used to promote malware repositories, video game cheats, and crypto bots. Some are likely used for growth hacking to secure investment, while some are deployed for “resume fraud:” making it seem a software engineer’s side project on GitHub is a lot more popular than it actually is!</p><p>This research is a reminder that GitHub stars can be easily purchased, and more repos are doing just this. GitHub does its part to make it harder to create and operate accounts to buy/sell stars: it has Trust &amp; Safety and Platform Health groups that battle account spam and account farming and are known to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/58191">suspend accounts</a>&nbsp;that abuse its&nbsp;<a href="http://terms%20and%20conditions">terms and conditions</a>. Still, this is a cat-and-mouse game, and the ability to buy stars to boost perceived repo popularity is not going anywhere. The more GitHub cracks down on this, the more expensive purchasing those additional stars will likely become, though.</p><p>Update on 12 Jan 2025: updated the last sentence that previously stated that GitHub has no incentive to crack down on purchased stars — based on more details I received on what GitHub is doing to fight against such bad actors.</p> Anthropic to raise at massive $60B valuation?

Third on the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/?s=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a></p>
<p>6:50am Friday, January 10, 2025—I will now shift my blogging about the #LAFires from the kind of continuous coverage I’ve done for the last three days to what we might call coverage of coverage. Or something beyond that: shifting to a new kind of news model: grounded in facts rather than just stories, stories, and more stories. I’ve been thinking and writing about this in the small laboratory we have here in Bloomington, Indiana, where Joyce and I are visiting scholars with the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University">Indiana University</a>. One of our projects is the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a>.</p>
<p>What the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23LAfires">#LAfires</a> present us with today is a chance to work toward a news commons for Los Angeles and Southern California (SoCal). I’ll explain what that is, why we need one, and how we put one together in my next post or few. Please stay tuned. I will present approaches to news you haven’t heard before, and I believe are necessary and not just helpful.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I thank the hundreds of new readers who have shown up here. I hope I’ve helped, and will continue to help, as Southern California begins traveling thousands (millions?) of long and rocky roads toward recovery. It won’t be easy, but our media—which is everyone now—can help by paying more attention to what we need to know (WWNTK) than just to stories after stories after stories (SASAS). Stories are the base format of human interest, but in news they are no better than the facts that support them. And we can do a much more with facts than we have so far. (And by that I mean everyone, everywhere.)</p>
<p>8:00pm—It’s three hours later here in Indiana, where it is 16° and snow is approaching (and will add to the foot of it preserved by freezing temperatures since last weekend):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weatherbug.com/maps/?layerId=Radar.Future&amp;center=37.60272255054798,-86.9872210923669,5.577927404017411"></a></p>
<p>So I will now leave the command post in my basement office. I’ll get back on the case tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that all we’ll have to report then is grief over the devastation. Unlike so much else we’ve been visiting in this report, that one is incalculable, and has barely started.</p>
<p>7:30pm—All the TV stations are mostly covering human interest stories. KPCC/KCAL are talking about how one of the “super scooper” aircraft struck a drone and was grounded after that. But they do have their own chopper, shooting the Palisades Fire, cresting the ridge of the Santa Monica Mountains. If all goes well, the winds will blow it back on itself. Meanwhile, there are plenty of aircraft on the case, as one can see on <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/34.20,-118.67/12">FlightRadar24</a>. Here’s a screen grab of the fire:</p>
<p></p>
<p>6:22pm—This grab from <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">FlightRadar24</a> shows the collection of aircraft over the Kenneth and Palisades Fires. I’ve highlighted the flight path of the Chinook that has been making many loops and drops over the Kenneth fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N43CU/38aa1fb9"></a></p>
<p>6:20pm—KCAL is doing a good job of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/pacific-palisades-fire-high-winds-southern-california/">covering</a> how well aerial fire fighting is Keeping the Kenneth Fire from destroying homes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/pacific-palisades-fire-high-winds-southern-california/"></a></p>
<p>6:10pm—As a break from the dread and heartache, if you’re in Southern California and can see through or past the smoke, tonight’s launch from Vandenberg should be a good show, especially as the rocket enters space, and the exhaust expands in the sunlight. <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/01/09/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-starshield-satellites-for-the-nro-on-falcon-9-rocket-from-california/">More here at Spaceflight Now:</a></p>
<p><a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2025/01/09/live-coverage-spacex-to-launch-starshield-satellites-for-the-nro-on-falcon-9-rocket-from-california/"></a></p>
<p>5:50pm—And here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spo1lkghEY8">an extended video of the Eaton fire failing to burn the “Fox Compound”</a>—the eastern-most of the Mt. Wilson TV and FM transmission facilities. It is shot from the tower cam on KNBC.4’s tower. Amazing stuff:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spo1lkghEY8"></a></p>
<p>The two towers on the left are former and auxiliary ones for KTTV/11, with KTWV/94.7 farther down on the one farthest left. The two red prongs are KCOP/13 and KTTV/11’s current main antennas.</p>
<p>5:43pm—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMeIsHMZahw">KNBC/4’s conversation with my friend Dennis Doty at the station’s Mt. Wilson transmitter is now on YouTube</a>. Dig how the fire comes right up to the road, live, while Dennis calmly explains that nature taking its course is no danger to the facility. A screen grab:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMeIsHMZahw"></a></p>
<p>4:30pm—Here is the flight path of the Chinook that the KNBC reporter just saw fly overhead:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N43CU/38a95a42"></a></p>
<p>Note the many other aircraft in the area.</p>
<p>4:23pm—The shot below may be of FIRE1, of the LAFD:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/FIRE1/38a9dc49"></a></p>
<p>4:15pm—Via KNBC and KCAL, the aerial assault on the Kenneth Fire appears to be succeeding for now, which is why other stations are reporting on the Palisades and Eaton fire aftermaths. Nice video from KNBC:</p>
<p></p>
<p>3:20pm—Via KCAL, the Kenneth Fire is moving westward, though they are evacuating the west end of the San Fernando Valley.</p>
<p>3:13pm—The press conference the guy with Marrone on his jacket (not sure his title) said at four to five thousand or more structures are lost. This places it third behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_%282018%29?">Camp</a> (18,804) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire">Tubbs</a> (5,636) fires in California history.</p>
<p>3:10pm—Flight paths from FlightRadar24 show how the new Kenneth Fire in the West Hills (Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve), 50 acres large, is getting attention, along with the north flank of the Palisades fire:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/CFR120/38a9736c"></a></p>
<p>3:00pm—Stations are breaking away for a press conference. This is a bummer, at least for KCAL’s coverage, because they were showing exactly where the Hills Fire was moving toward streets and residences. This is in Ventura County, which will bring in new administrative bodies.</p>
<p>2:55pm—Via KCAL/9: With wind sure to pick up (which they already are), aerial fire fighting has a lot to do, ASAP. There is another fire, called the Creek Fire, in the Angeles National Forest, near Big Tijunga canyon. Evacuations are probably coming for Calabasas, I think they just said.</p>
<p>2:45pm—Via KCAL/9: There is a new brush fire, the Hills Fire, north of the 101 and to the west of West Hills, in the Los Virgenes Open Space Preserve. Here is the flight path of a tanker dropping water on it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/TKR107/38a995dd"></a></p>
<p>They have live chopper video:</p>
<p></p>
<p>2:40pm—Word on a private forum from Mt. Wilson: While the fire has been s burning uphill (to the north) the wind is downhill (to the south). There is adequate brush clearance, and firefighters are allowing the fire to clear out “flash fuels.”</p>
<p>1:53pm—All the TV stations are covering President Biden’s press conference, with VP Harris following. One interesting thing: Harris says insurance companies cancelling coverage. We need more info about that. Randy Moore of the U.S. Forest Service is making sense about the conditions that make the fires hard to fight, and what’s being done by fire fighters. The next guy just said, I think, that 360,000 people are under mandatory evacuations. Meeting the needs of thousands who have lost homes is a huge problem. Removing debris, one official just said, will take “months to a year.” It’s now 2:22. This is going long. Mostly it’s about forms of federal support coming in… and at 2:34 stations are cutting away and summarizing the briefing. Only KTTV/11 “Fox 11” is staying with the feed… and now at 2:37 they’ve cut away as well.</p>
<p>1:33pm—I have tabs open to channels 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 (NBC, Independent, ABC, CBS, and Fox), and all of them are reporting stories, mostly about Pacific Palisades and Altadena, two towns that were largely wiped out in the fires. (Pacific Palisades is part of Los Angeles, and Altadena is an unincorporated suburb in Los Angeles County that presents essentially as the north side of Pasadena. (The name essentially means the higher part of Pasadena.) Most of the coverage is of the human interest kind, rather than the what’s-happening kind. So in some ways, barring flare-ups, this is mostly over.</p>
<p>1:30pm—KTTV/11: <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/deadly-eaton-fire-altadena-pasadena-january-9-2025">LIVE: Deadly Eaton Fire reaches Mount Wilson summit</a>. Scroll down for the story. A grab:</p>
<p></p>
<p>12:45pm—KNBC/4: <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california-wildfires/palisades-eaton-los-angeles-fires-thursday/3599080/">Live updates: Eaton Fire flares up near Mount Wilson summit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/california-wildfires/palisades-eaton-los-angeles-fires-thursday/3599080/"></a></p>
<p>They just mentioned that <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/52873706674/in/photolist-2oyhC5B-2oyhCkw-2oyfG17-2oygyUj-2oyfGzZ-2oycLys-2oyhDzq-2oycJLz-2oyhYux-2oyhYyL-2oyfJyJ-2oyhYHP-2oyhCrZ-2oycK4d-2oygz2Z-2oyhXCs-2oycHAt-2oyhXJp-2oygzmB-2oyfHLr-2oyhXBF-2oycJgb-2oycJnP-2oycJ6X-2oyfGrH-2oygzuh-2oygzVH-2oyhXU4-2oygzPA-2oyhCXi-2oyhDdJ-2oycKyb-2oygB2k-2oyhEbq-2oyfFVY-2oygzzc-2oyhE2N-2oycJyq-2oycHjb-2oyhEsT-2oycK7E-2oyfFFu-2oygyBk-2oyfFzT-2oyhC6P-2oyfFyv-2oyfFzN">Dennis Doty</a>, a friend who runs the KNBC/KVEA transmitter facility (which I’ve photographed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72177720308063323/">here</a>), has been in communication with the studios, the station chopper, and the fire fighters—and sounding very calm and professional. Nice to hear.</p>
<p>12:37am—KTLA/5: <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/wildfires/live-view-of-the-eaton-fire-from-mt-wilson/">LIVE: Eaton Fire reaches the peak of Mt. Wilson</a>. It’s a live cam view from KTLA’s property, roughly in the middle of the tower farm complex. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=46167543%40N05&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=ktla">Here are my photos on Wilson relating to KTLA</a>.</p>
<p>12:31am—KABC/7: <a href="https://abc7.com/videoClip/15779456/">5</a></p>
 
 <a href="https://abc7.com/videoClip/15779456/">50-75% of Pacific Palisades is gone, ABC7’s Josh Haskell estimates</a>. It looks like more, but hard to tell. 
 <a href="https://abc7.com/videoClip/15783532/">Eaton Fire burning near Mt. Wilson</a>. 
 
<p>12:10am—FlightRadar24 shows only two fixed-wing aircraft circling Mt. Wilson. This is one of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/N3NT/38a88b5a"></a></p>
<p>None of the TV stations seem to be covering the mountain now. Or at least I don’t see anything on their streams, or on FlightRadar24. I do know that Mt. Wilson’s transmitters are somewhat well isolated from vegetation. That gives me some hope for their survival. Nearly all the stations there have auxiliary transmitters, either elsewhere in the tower farm on Wilson itself, or on Mt. Verdugo or Flint Peak, both in Glendale.</p>
<p>10:50—Nearly all Los Angeles’ TV and FM stations transmit from Mt. Wilson. I visit the site often. Here are twenty photo albums of transmitters on Mt. Wilson, going back to 2005. Go there and search for “Wilson.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/"></a></p>
<p>10:41—KABC/7 has live coverage of Mt. Wilson now:</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/watch/live/11064936/"></a></p>
<p>10:35—KABC/7 has <a href="https://abc7.com/videoClip/15783295/">an aerial video that shows clearly how much of Pacific Palisades has been wiped out</a>. Looks like most of the town. (Alas, you do have to sit through the :30 second ad first, but it’s worth the wait):</p>
<p><a href="https://abc7.com/videoClip/15783295/"></a></p>
<p>10:29am—Friends who work keeping TV and FM transmitters operating on Mt. Wilson have been sending me images of the Eaton Fire encroaching up the mountain face from the south. One just shared this on a private forum, from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/">KCAL/9</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/pacific-palisades-fire-high-winds-southern-california/">Here is live coverage from KCAL on the Eaton Fire</a>.</p>
<p>10:17am—Here is the .mp4 of the daily loop from CIRA, which I think is the one the New York Post used:</p>
    
<p>10:14am—CIRA is Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, at <a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/">https://www.cira.colostate.edu/</a>. And they have this in their <a href="https://satlib.cira.colostate.edu/daily/">Daily Loop of GOES West</a>:</p>

<p>7:50am—Here is what people need to know. All of these are <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/10/12/stories-vs-facts-2/">facts rather than stories</a>:</p>
 
 What homes and other buildings have burned. With addresses. 
 What problems persist (power outages, road closures and blockages, cell coverage that’s gone, fire perimeters that are uncontained) 
 What resources are available, where, and how 
 
<p>All the media are in the story business first, and the fact business second. I salute them for providing the latter (as KCAL and KABC have been doing by showing overlays of road maps on aerial views down on fires in neighborhoods). But we need facts.</p>
<p>Here is one: many people we know in and around Los Angeles are putting up people who have been made homeless by the fires, or have been evacuated from their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Also, to make clear my connection to region, I’ve lived in California since 1985, am a permanent resident of Santa Barbara, and my wife is a born &amp; raised Los Angelina in a family of eight siblings, nearly all of which, with their progeny and grandprogeny, have stayed in the state. We have countless friends, co-workers and acquaintances throughout Southern California. It is home for us, even though we are currently domiciled in Bloomington, Indiana (which we also love).</p>
<p>7:33am—Resources for facts:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.ladwp.com/outages/power-outage-map">LADWP (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power) outage map.</a> 
 <a href="https://maps.wildfire.gov/sa/#/%3F/%3F/33.9394/-118.1388/10">maps.wildfire.gov for the Los Angeles region</a> (click on the little squares to see what’s going on there). 
 <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#d:24hrs;@-118.23,34.14,10.56z">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) map for the same region</a>, showing satellite-spotted hot spots. This selectively can include VIIRS, MODIS, Landsat and other sources 
 <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">SoCal Edison power outage page</a>, which has a map 
 <a href="https://laist.com/">KPCC/89.3, now called LAist</a>, is, far as I can tell, the only regional broadcaster providing continuous coverage of the #LAfires without commercial interruption. It is partnered with KCAL as well. <a href="https://www.audacy.com/stations/knxnews">KNX, on 1070AM and 97.1 FM</a>, has 24/7 news, but with commercials. While its AM signal is far larger than its FM one (covering the whole West at night), it identifies as the latter. 
 
<p>7:15am—KCAL is at East Calaveras and Country Club Drive in Altadena, where the whole neighborhood, and the Altadena Town &amp; Country Club are burned down.</p>
<p>6:39am—<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/">KCAL/9</a> and <a href="https://abc7.com/">KABC/7</a> have been my main sources of video news (over the Net, here in Indiana), and the latter is partly back to national (ABC) coverage. KCBS/2 and KCAL/9 are both CBS, and the latter is positioned as the news station, so I’m on KCAL (“kay-cal”) right now. Two screen grabs, one from Altadena and the other from Pacific Palisades:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Altadena case, there were no surviving homes in view. In the Pacific Palisades case, the guy on the left is a homeowner who stayed to help neighbors hose down their houses and hopefully survive the fire. He and his house survived. Other houses did not. (There was no talk of fatalities, though there were some in Altadena.)</p>

<p>Released yesterday: <a href="https://sqitch.org" title="Sqitch: Sensible database change management">Sqitch</a> v1.5.0. This version the MySQL driver
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql" title="DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::mysql</a> with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB" title="DBD::MariaDB - MariaDB and MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::MariaDB</a>, both for its better backward compatibility
with MySQL as well as MariaDB driver libraries and for its improved Unicode
handling. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch">Docker image</a> likewise switched to the MariaDB <code>mysql</code>
client. I expect no compatibility issues, but you never know! Please file an
<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues" title="Sqitch Issues">issue</a> should you find any.</p>
<p>V1.5.0 also features a fixes for Yugabyte deployment, Oracle error handling,
existing Snowflake schemas, connecting to MySQL/MariaDB without a database
name, and omitting the <code>checkit</code> MySQL/MariaDB function when the Sqitch user
lacks sufficient permission to create it. Sqitch now will also complain when
deploying with <code>--log-only</code> and a deployment file is missing.</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://getdx.com/?utm_source=pragmaticengineer">DX</a> — DX is an engineering intelligence platform designed by leading researchers.</p><p>• <a href="http://vanta.com/pragmatic">Vanta</a> — Automate compliance and simplify security with Vanta.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>In today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I catch up with one of the best tech recruiters I’ve had the opportunity to work with: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-stockman/">Blake Stockman</a>, a former colleague of mine from Uber. Blake built a strong reputation in the recruiting world, working at tech giants like Google, Meta, and Uber and Flexport. He also spent time with Y Combinator and founded his agency, where he helped both large tech companies and early-stage startups find and secure top talent. A few months ago, Blake did a career pivot: he is now studying to become a lawyer. I pounced on this perfect opportunity to have him share all that he’s seen behind-the-scenes in tech recruitment: sharing his observations unfiltered.</p><p>In our conversation, Blake shares recruitment insights from his time at Facebook, Google, and Uber and his experience running his own tech recruitment agency. We discuss topics such as:</p><p>• A step-by-step breakdown of hiring processes at Big Tech and startups<br>• How to get the most out of your tech recruiter, as a candidate<br>• Best practices for hiring managers to work with their recruiter<br>• Why you shouldn’t disclose salary expectations upfront, plus tips for negotiating<br>• Where to find the best startup opportunities and how to evaluate them—including understanding startup compensation<br>• And much more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this practical conversation:</p><p>1. Almost every offer has room for negotiation. So if you get extended an offer, consider negotiating at least a little! In Blake’s words:</p><blockquote><p>“Try to understand what it is that the recruiter is working with. They're going to ask you to state what your compensation expectations are. Every candidate is best suited by responding respectfully: “I would like to see an offer that the company thinks constitutes the value that I have to bring to the table.” And sticking with this. </p><p>If any company is not willing to give you an offer because you didn't state your compensation expectations upfront — which I've never ever seen! — they're probably not the right company for you to work at.  Ask them to put you a fair and honest offer on the table. “</p></blockquote><p>2. GenAI is already changing recruitment. Here is how Blake describes the change he sees:</p><blockquote><p>“Just like software engineers are realizing you can do some amazing things very quickly with AI: the same is true for recruitment.</p><p>Everyone on the job market has gotten messages from a recruiter where it feels like a pretty generic template. Something along the lines of “here’s some basic information, here’s the opportunity, please respond if you’d like.” The recruiter sends the same template to all candidates in an area with the “senior software engineer” title. I expect all of this to be automated by AI — at least for the basic things. A lot of the repetition, the generic work that recruiters do: a lot of it could be automated.</p><p>And then we see AI playing a more focused role in note taking, synthesizing information, consolidating notes across multiple interviewers.</p><p>Recruitment is becoming more automated and less personal, up until much later stages in the process. This is a generic trend, but AI is speeding it up.”</p></blockquote><p>We covered more on how GenAI is impacting tech hiring in the deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-genai-changes-tech-hiring">How GenAI is reshaping tech hiring</a>.</p><p>3. The larger a company, the more decentralized hiring decisions are. Startups and small companies typically have hiring managers — or founders! — make the hiring decision. However, larger tech companies often have hiring committees deciding whether an offer should be extended.</p><p>This is one reason smaller companies can move a lot faster in hiring. It also makes it trickier to figure out why exactly a larger company might have said “no” after an onsite round that felt went well: the input for the decision could have come from people not even in the loop!</p><p>4. A tip for engineering leaders ahead of a hiring drive: create a ‘hiring talent map!’ This is how Blake describes this:</p><blockquote><p>“For example, when we were hiring for the Payments team: we'll decided that we needed to find a couple candidates working at companies where they have relevant Payments experiences, or they can ramp up quickly. We needed people who had understanding of our domain knowledge. So we mapped out these companies. </p><p>We then looked at this map, and asked: “okay, but which ones do we think also have like really good engineering talent that also, you know, would plant in really well with a broader engineering culture here?”</p><p>Based on these, we put together a more structured outreach plan. This helped us hire more focused, and faster.”</p></blockquote><p>For more advice on preparing for tech interviews: take a look at a video I did a few years back: Confessions from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs">Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews</a></p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-genai-changes-tech-hiring">How GenAI is reshaping tech hiring</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hiring-software-engineers">Hiring software engineers</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hiring-engineering-managers">Hiring an Engineering Manager</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hiring-junior-engineers">Hiring Junior Software Engineers</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=100s">01:40</a>) Tips for working with recruiters</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=371s">06:11</a>) Why hiring managers should have more conversations with recruiters</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=588s">09:48</a>) A behind-the-scenes look at the hiring process at big tech companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=818s">13:38</a>) How hiring worked at Uber when Gergely and Blake were there</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=1006s">16:46</a>) An explanation of calibration in the recruitment process</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=1091s">18:11</a>) A case for partnering with recruitment</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=1249s">20:49</a>) The different approaches to recruitment Blake experienced at different organizations</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=1530s">25:30</a>) How hiring decisions are made</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=1894s">31:34</a>) The differences between hiring at startups vs. large, established companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2001s">33:21</a>) Reasons desperate decisions are made and problems that may arise</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2190s">36:30</a>) The problem of hiring solely to fill a seat</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2335s">38:55</a>) The process of the closing call</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2424s">40:24</a>) The importance of understanding equity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2607s">43:27</a>) Tips for negotiating</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=2918s">48:38</a>) How to find the best startup opportunities, and how to evaluate if it’s a good fit</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=3238s">53:58</a>) What to include on your LinkedIn profile</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=3348s">55:48</a>) A story from Uber and why you should remember to thank your recruiter</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7GsnaQYZ68&amp;t=3609s">1:00:09</a>) Rapid fire round</p> Resources &amp;

<p>How do you deal with bugs in the software products you build? This topic is under-discussed, even though almost all software engineers deal with software bugs and regressions every week.</p><p>We reached out to two dozen engineering leaders and software engineers to learn about current, cutting-edge approaches to bug management. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bug-management-that-works-part-1">In Part 1</a> of this mini-series, we <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bug-management-that-works-part-1">covered</a>:</p>  <p>Catching bugs</p>  <p>Reporting bugs</p>  <p>Bug triage</p>  <p>“Don’t manage bugs: fix them!”</p>  <p>Zero-bugs policy</p>  <p>In this second, concluding article on this topic, we look into what typically happens after the bug triage stage:</p>  <p>Create time and space for bug fixing. Bug expiration dates, weekly ‘bug pickups’, bug fixing time budgets, can all help.</p>  <p>Dedicated bug fixers: ‘goalies’. An engineer dedicated to bug fixing for a couple of weeks may be known as a support engineer”, “being on bug duty”, “first line”. It’s a popular approach with its own challenges.</p>  <p>Fixing bugs properly. A root cause analysis to fix underlying causes is a pragmatic approach. Several teams opt to treat high-priority bugs as incidents.</p>  <p>Prevention is better than cure. Automated tests like unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance tests, coupled with CI/CD is a common approach. So is investing in other bug prevention approaches.</p>  <p>A quality culture for fewer bugs. It takes effort from engineering leadership to create a culture that prioritizes quality. At companies with this focus, tactics for this include bug metrics, operational reviews, and engineers not asking permission to do bug fixing.</p>  <p>Related deep dives on this topic to check out:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices">Healthy oncall practices</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-big-tech-does-qa">How Big Tech does Quality Assurance (QA)</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA approaches across the industry</a></p>  <p>Thank you to everyone who contributed insights to this article:</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anais-van-asselt/">Anaïs van Asselt</a> (senior QA engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasiposb/">Andrea Sipos</a> (product leader, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-hageloh-1965025/">Felix Hageloh</a> (lead engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gusfune/">Gus Fune</a> (CTO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugovalente?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAUICvcBzP7iJn9n9cur_Z5pjawB8fphNw0&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Acompanies_company_people_index%3Ba6784aee-f23a-4ce5-98be-02f354f8e9eb">Hugo Valante</a> (tech lead), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/inothnagel/">Ignatius Nothnagel</a> (Director of Platform Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-tchomgue-720ab558">Ivan Tchomgue</a> (People manager/product owner), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonadiller/">Jason Diller</a> (VP of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayeshkvarma/">Jayesh Varma</a> (Lead Android engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marindimitrov/">Marin Dimitrov</a> (Head of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gallim/">Matteo Galli</a> (CTO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayalziv">Maya Ziv</a> (senior software engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theowainlewis?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BbMbVNqnFS62an6Dl5DKi7Q%3D%3D">Owain Lewis</a> (Director of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrzolnierek/">Piotr Zolnierek</a> (CTO), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neiloler/">Neil Oler</a> (senior software engineer), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-frost-7847375a/">Rebecca Frost</a> (QA leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-holm-ring-12982a/">Rebecca Holm Ring</a> (engineering leader), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubenweijers/">Ruben Weijers</a> (engineering manager), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhanni/">Ryan Hanni</a> (Director of Engineering), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serdarbiyik/">Serdar Biyik</a> (engineering manager), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/walterdebruijnnl/">Walter de Bruijn</a> (Head of Engineering Productivity)</p><p>The bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bug-management-that-works-part-2">Read the full article uninterrupted, online.</a></p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bug-management-that-works-part-2">Read the full article online</a></p> 1. Create time and space for bug fixing <p>Fixing bugs when they happen is the single best approach, but unfortunately not always realistic. The next best thing is to ensure there’s enough time for engineers to fix problematic issues. Below are some approaches.</p> Fix bugs on the go <p>Several engineering leaders at smaller companies say their preferred approach is to simply fix bugs as they occur:</p><blockquote><p>“We do continuous bug fixing: always balancing value creation (creating new features) with value loss prevention (removing the friction caused by bugs in existing features). – Marin Dimitrov, Head of Engineering at Manual<br><br>We prioritize fixing bugs over working on other things. Most of our bugs are cleared as they come in. We found this is more productive than having ‘bug fixing weeks’ – Gus Fune, CTO at Div Brands</p></blockquote><p>This approach seems harder to do at growing or large companies, where some bugs need several teams to fix them, or it’s unclear who owns a bug.</p> Bug expiration dates <p>A clever approach is to set expiration dates for when a bug should be resolved. The closer this date gets, the higher its priority. Ruben Weijers, engineering manager at TomTom elaborates:</p><blockquote><p>“All triaged bugs have an end-date and an owner. If a bug is past its end-date (meaning it ‘breaches’ this date), it becomes a release blocker, regardless of whether it's a low priority bug.”</p></blockquote> Weekly ‘bug pickups’ <p>Ryan Hanni, engineering director at Ontra:</p><blockquote><p>“We have used a weekly bug pickup process. The way it worked was simple: pick up one bug per team, per week, and fix it! This helped our bug backlog stay reasonably sized. We would always pick a high priority bug until there were none left, then do this with Medium and Low priority ones.”</p></blockquote> Time budgets <p>A common approach is to fix a percentage of devs’ time to be used for bug fixing on a sprint basis, weekly or monthly.</p><blockquote><p>“At various companies we’ve used quotas, which refers to the minimum percentage of time invested in bug fixing and quality improvements for each sprint. SLO-like targets on the resolution time for a bug, based on its severity (critical / high / medium / low), may be a good ‘forcing function’ to help teams balance better building new features vs bugfixing and quality improvements: when the SLO targets are regularly exceeded, this may be a signal that the team needs to increase the time (quota) allocated to bugfixing until the balance can be restored again.” – Marin Dimitrov, Head of Engineering at Manual.</p><p>“We first add bugs onto our sprint, allocating around 10-15% of our velocity. We prioritize bugs reported from our Live/Production environment. This approach means that we balance delivering new features with fixing existing issues.” – Jayesh Varma, lead Android engineer at Barclays</p></blockquote><p>Ignatius Nothnagel, director of platform engineering at LocalStack uses this approach, but advises against sprinting:</p><blockquote><p>“I've seen two approaches actually work in the wild:<br><br>1. Dedicate a fixed, non-negotiable percentage of capacity during every sprint to bugs and improvements. <br><br>2. Not ‘sprinting.’ Drop the concept of sprints. In my experience, this works amazingly! It turns out that hiring responsible adults and holding them accountable for making the right trade-off decisions actually works.”</p></blockquote> Bug sprints and bug days <p>Interestingly enough, the approach of ‘batching’ bug fixing into a few days or a week can be hit-and-miss: either it works well enough to be a regular thing, or teams drop it because the outcome disappoints.</p><p>Accounts of when it’s a hit:</p>  <p>“We do a quarterly ‘just do it day’ where all engineers get to work on whatever they want for a day. This usually ends up being quality of life (QOL) improvements, dev tooling, and refactoring/cleanup work. It’s everyone’s favorite holiday!” – Maya Ziv, senior software engineer at Pavilion</p>  <p>“Regular bug bashes and FixIt weeks have worked very well for teams I’ve worked at Uber, Hopin, Craft, and now Manual” – Marin Dimitrov, Head of Engineering at Manual</p>  <p>…and when it’s a miss:</p>  <p>“Bug fixing, keeping the lights on (KTLO), and other emergent work outside of regular product strategy increments happens on Fridays. It doesn’t work because a lot of this work won’t fit in a single Friday, and leads to lots of context switching, dead end effort, and wasted time.” – a software engineer at a small health tech company</p>  <p>“We avoid ‘fix it weeks’ in favor of continuous, weekly bug pickups. If our backlog gets too big, we meet with cross-functional stakeholders (PM, UX, Dev, QE) to divide up the bugs across teams and have them fixed within the next two weeks or so, working the bugs into their cycle as they see fit.” – Ryan Hanni, director of engineering at Ontra</p>  <p>Another criticism of regular bug sprints is that they incentivize engineers to not worry about bugs day to day because they know there’s a regular event for dealing with them. This can reduce motivation to keep software tidy and bug-free at all times.</p> Warranty sprints <p>A variation of regular bug sprints are ‘warranty sprints.’ These refer to spending a week or two on addressing incoming bugs and feedback about a freshly released feature. Figma similarly prioritizes bugs for newly released features, as covered in the “Fix all bugs for recently released features” section, but are more focused.</p><p>Jason Diller, VP of Engineering at Arteria AI, shares:</p><blockquote><p>“For warranty sprints, we typically don’t shift a team off a project as soon as it ships. We expect and plan for feedback and bugs to be higher volume right after a delivery, and keep the team dedicated to addressing those for a sprint or two, rather than punting all of that to a backlog to be dealt with later.”</p></blockquote> 2. Dedicated bug fixers: ‘goalies’ <p>At mid-sized and larger companies, a common approach to staying on top of bugs is for an engineer to focus only on bug-related work. This role goes by a couple of names: “goalie” is the most common one, as in a soccer goalkeeper. Other terms are “support engineer,” “being on bug duty”, “bug duty officer”, “first line”, and even “bug trooper”.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, we cover topics related to Big Tech and startups through the lens of software engineers and engineering leaders. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe:</p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>Happy New Year! As we look toward the innovations that 2025 might bring, it is a sure bet that GenAI will continue to change how we do software engineering.</p><p>It’s hard to believe that just over two years ago in November of 2022 was ChatGPT’s first release. This was the point when large language models (LLMs) started to get widespread adoption. Even though LLMs are <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-does-chatgpt-work/">built in a surprisingly simple way</a>, they produce impressive results in a variety of areas. Writing code turns out to be perhaps one of their strongest points. This is not all that surprising, given how:</p>  <p>Programming involves far simpler grammar than any human language</p>  <p>There is a massive amount of high-quality training data for these LLMs to use, in the form of working source code, thanks to open source software and crawling GitHub and other free-to-access code repositories (this kind of crawling and training is happening, regardless of <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/148734809/developers-reservations">whether it is ethical</a> or not)</p>  <p>Last year, we saw that about <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">75% of developers use some kind of AI tool</a> for software engineering–related work, as per our <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">AI tooling reality check survey</a>. And yet, it feels like we’re still early in the tooling innovation cycle, and more complex approaches like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">AI software engineering agents</a> are likely to be the center of innovation in 2025.</p><p>Mainstream media has been painting an increasingly dramatic picture of the software engineering industry. In March, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cognition-labs-devin-ai-software-engineer-humans-lose-jobs-2024-3">wrote</a> about how “Software engineers are getting closer to finding out if AI really can make them jobless”, and in September, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2024/09/21/the-automation-takeover-are-software-engineers-becoming-obsolete/">asked</a>: “Are software engineers becoming obsolete?” While such articles get wide reach, they are coming from people who are not software engineers themselves, don’t use these AI tools, and are unaware of the efficiency (and limitations!) of these new GenAI coding tools.</p><p>But what can we realistically expect from GenAI tools for shaping software engineering? GenAI will change parts of software engineering, but it is unlikely to do so in the dramatic way that some previous headlines suggest. And with two years of using these tools, and with most engineering teams using them for 12 months or more, we can shape a better opinion of them.</p><p><a href="https://addyosmani.com/">Addy Osmani</a> is a software engineer and engineering leader, in a good position to observe how GenAI tools are really shaping software engineering. He’s been working at Google for 12 years and is currently the Head of Chrome Developer Experience. Google is a company at the forefront of GenAI innovation. The company authored the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">research paper on the Transformers architecture</a> in 2017 that serves as the foundation for LLMs. Today, Google has built one of the most advanced foundational models with <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/">Gemini 2.0</a> and is one of the biggest OpenAI competitors.</p><p>Addy summarized his observations and predictions in the article <a href="https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-70-problem-hard-truths-about">The 70% problem: Hard truths about AI-assisted coding</a>. It’s a grounded take on the strengths and weaknesses of AI tooling, one that highlights fundamental limitations of these tools, as well as the positives that are too good to not adopt as an engineer. It also offers practical advice for software engineers from junior to senior on how to make the most out of these tools. With Addy’s permission, this is an edited version of his article, re-published, with more of my thoughts added at the end. This issue covers:</p>  <p>How developers are actually using AI. Very different usages for “bootstrappers” versus “iterators.” Perhaps a reason why one tool is unlikely to work equally well for both groups?</p>  <p>The 70% problem: AI's learning curve paradox. Lesser-talked-about challenges with AI: the “two steps back paradox,” the hidden cost of “AI speed,” and the “knowledge paradox.”</p>  <p>What actually works: practical patterns. AI-first draft, constant conversation, and “trust but verify” patterns.</p>  <p>What does this mean for developers? Start small, stay modular, and trust your experience.</p>  <p>The rise of agentic software engineering. A shift to collaborating with AI, multi-modal capabilities, autonomous but guided approaches, and an “English-first” development environment.</p>  <p>The return of software as a craft? The lost art of polish to return, and the renaissance of personal software.</p>  <p>Additional thoughts. A good time to refresh what software engineering really is and how it has been the dream of needing no developers since the 1960s. And still, demand for experienced engineers could well increase in the future, rather than decrease.</p>  <p>Addy’s name might ring familiar to many of you. In August, we <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leading-effective-engineering-teams">published an excerpt</a> from his new book, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leading-effective-engineering-teams">Leading Effective Teams</a>. Addy also writes a newsletter called Elevate: subscribe to  to get Addy’s posts in your inbox.</p><p>With this, it’s over to Addy:</p>   <p>After spending the last few years embedded in AI-assisted development, I've noticed a fascinating pattern. While engineers report being dramatically more productive with AI, the actual software we use daily doesn’t seem like it’s getting noticeably better. What's going on here?</p><p>I think I know why, and the answer reveals some fundamental truths about software development that we need to reckon with. Let me share what I've learned.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F892a9a58-1761-4b7a-a50c-21bb1219965c_1456x606.png">          </a> <p>I've observed two distinct patterns in how teams are leveraging AI for development. Let's call them the "bootstrappers" and the "iterators." Both are helping engineers (and even non-technical users) reduce the gap from idea to execution (or MVP).</p> 1. How developers are actually using AI  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d618b4e-8fff-447f-b9e6-b46b62deafd4_1456x819.png">          </a>  The Bootstrappers: Zero to MVP <p>Tools like Bolt, v0, and screenshot-to-code AI are revolutionizing how we bootstrap new projects. These teams typically:</p>  <p>Start with a design or rough concept</p>  <p>Use AI to generate a complete initial codebase</p>  <p>Get a working prototype in hours or days instead of weeks</p>  <p>Focus on rapid validation and iteration</p>  <p>The results can be impressive. I recently watched a solo developer use Bolt to turn a Figma design into a working web app in next to no time. It wasn't production-ready, but it was good enough to get very initial user feedback.</p> The Iterators: daily development <p>The second camp uses tools like Cursor, Cline, Copilot, and WindSurf for their daily development workflow. This is less flashy but potentially more transformative. These developers are:</p>  <p>Using AI for code completion and suggestions</p>  <p>Leveraging AI for complex refactoring tasks</p>  <p>Generating tests and documentation</p>  <p>Using AI as a "pair programmer" for problem-solving</p>  <p>But here's the catch: while both approaches can dramatically accelerate development, they come with hidden costs that aren't immediately obvious.</p> 2. The 70% problem: AI's learning curve paradox <p>A <a href="https://x.com/petergyang/status/1863058206752379255">tweet</a> that recently caught my eye perfectly captures what I've been observing in the field: Non-engineers using AI for coding find themselves hitting a frustrating wall. They can get 70% of the way there surprisingly quickly, but that final 30% becomes an exercise in diminishing returns.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F94ae0661-5dab-4e9b-919b-4847d0e82ff1_1054x488.png">          </a>Source: Peter Yang <a href="https://x.com/petergyang/status/1863058206752379255">on X</a> <p>This "70% problem" reveals something crucial about the current state of AI-assisted development. The initial progress feels magical: you can describe what you want, and AI tools like v0 or Bolt will generate a working prototype that looks impressive. But then reality sets in.</p> The two steps back pattern <p>What typically happens next follows a predictable pattern:</p>  <p>You try to fix a small bug</p>  <p>The AI suggests a change that seems reasonable</p>  <p>This fix breaks something else</p>  <p>You ask AI to fix the new issue</p>  <p>This creates two more problems</p>  <p>Rinse and repeat</p>  <p>This cycle is particularly painful for non-engineers because they lack the mental models to understand what's actually going wrong. When an experienced developer encounters a bug, they can reason about potential causes and solutions based on years of pattern recognition. Without this background, you're essentially playing whack-a-mole with code you don't fully understand.</p> The hidden cost of "AI Speed" <p>When you watch a senior engineer work with AI tools like Cursor or Copilot, it looks like magic. They can scaffold entire features in minutes, complete with tests and documentation. But watch carefully, and you'll notice something crucial: They're not just accepting what the AI suggests. They're constantly:</p>  <p>Refactoring the generated code into smaller, focused modules</p>  <p>Adding edge case handling the AI missed</p>  <p>Strengthening type definitions and interfaces</p>  <p>Questioning architectural decisions</p>  <p>Adding comprehensive error handling</p>  <p>In other words, they're applying years of hard-won engineering wisdom to shape and constrain the AI's output. The AI is accelerating implementation, but their expertise is what keeps the code maintainable.</p><p>Junior engineers often miss these crucial steps. They accept the AI's output more readily, leading to what I call "house of cards code" – it looks complete but collapses under real-world pressure.</p> A knowledge gap <p>The most successful non-engineers I've seen using AI coding tools take a hybrid approach:</p>  <p>Use AI for rapid prototyping</p>  <p>Take time to understand how the generated code works</p>  <p>Learn basic programming concepts alongside AI usage</p>  <p>Build up a foundation of knowledge gradually</p>  <p>Use AI as a learning tool, not just a code generator</p>  <p>But this requires patience and dedication, which is exactly the opposite of what many people hope to achieve by using AI tools in the first place.</p> The knowledge paradox <p>Here's the most counterintuitive thing I've discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. This seems backward. Shouldn't AI democratize coding?</p><p>The reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team. They can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction. The more you know, the better you can guide them.</p><p>This creates what I call the "knowledge paradox":</p>  <p>Seniors use AI to accelerate what they already know how to do</p>  <p>Juniors try to use AI to learn what to do</p>  <p>The results differ dramatically</p>  <p>I've watched senior engineers use AI to:</p>  <p>Rapidly prototype ideas they already understand</p>  <p>Generate basic implementations they can then refine</p>  <p>Explore alternative approaches to known problems</p>  <p>Automate routine coding tasks</p>  <p>Meanwhile, juniors often:</p>  <p>Accept incorrect or outdated solutions</p>  <p>Miss critical security and performance considerations</p>  <p>Struggle to debug AI-generated code</p>  <p>Build fragile systems they don't fully understand</p>  <p>There's a deeper issue here: The very thing that makes AI coding tools accessible to non-engineers, their ability to handle complexity on your behalf, can actually impede learning. When code just "appears" without you understanding the underlying principles:</p>  <p>You don't develop debugging skills</p>  <p>You miss learning fundamental patterns</p>  <p>You can't reason about architectural decisions</p>  <p>You struggle to maintain and evolve the code</p>  <p>This creates a dependency where you need to keep going back to AI to fix issues, rather than developing the expertise to handle them yourself.</p> Implications for the future <p>This "70% problem" suggests that current AI coding tools are best viewed as:</p>  <p>Prototyping accelerators for experienced developers</p>  <p>Learning aids for those committed to understanding development</p>  <p>MVP generators for validating ideas quickly</p>  <p>But they're not yet the coding democratization solution many hoped for. The final 30%, the part that makes software production-ready, maintainable, and robust, still requires real engineering knowledge.</p><p>The good news? This gap will likely narrow as tools improve. But for now, the most pragmatic approach is to use AI to accelerate learning, not replace it entirely.</p> 3. What actually works: practical patterns <p>After observing dozens of teams, here's what I've seen work consistently:</p> "AI first draft" pattern <p>Let AI generate a basic implementation</p>  <p>Manually review and refactor for modularity</p>  <p>Add comprehensive error handling</p>  <p>Write thorough tests</p>  <p>Document key decisions</p>   "Constant conversation" pattern <p>Start new AI chats for each distinct task</p>  <p>Keep context focused and minimal</p>  <p>Review and commit changes frequently</p>  <p>Maintain tight feedback loops</p>   "Trust but verify" pattern   <p>Use AI for initial code generation</p>  <p>Manually review all critical paths</p>  <p>Conduct automated testing of edge cases</p>  <p>Implement regular security audits</p>   4. What does this mean for developers? <p>Despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about AI's role in software development. The key is understanding what it's really good for:</p>  <p>Accelerating the known. AI excels at helping us implement patterns we already understand. It's like having an infinitely patient pair programmer who can type really fast.</p>  <p>Exploring the possible. AI is great for quickly prototyping ideas and exploring different approaches. It's like having a sandbox where we can rapidly test concepts.</p>  <p>Automating the routine. AI dramatically reduces the time spent on boilerplate and routine coding tasks, letting us focus on the interesting problems.</p>  <p>If you're just starting with AI-assisted development, here's my advice:</p><p>Start small</p>  <p>Use AI for isolated, well-defined tasks</p>  <p>Review every line of generated code</p>  <p>Build up to larger features gradually</p>  <p>Stay modular</p>  <p>Break everything into small, focused files</p>  <p>Maintain clear interfaces between components</p>  <p>Document your module boundaries</p>  <p>Trust your experience</p>  <p>Use AI to accelerate, not replace, your judgment</p>  <p>Question generated code that feels wrong</p>  <p>Maintain your engineering standards</p>   5. The rise of agentic software engineering <p>The landscape of AI-assisted development is shifting dramatically as we head into 2025. While the current tools have already changed how we prototype and iterate, I believe we're on the cusp of an even more significant transformation: the rise of agentic software engineering.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc1d1ad3-dbff-4581-bdb2-b73845036a14_1456x596.png">          </a> <p>What do I mean by "agentic"? Instead of just responding to prompts, these systems can plan, execute, and iterate on solutions with increasing autonomy.</p>    <p>If you’re interested in learning more about agents, including my take on Cursor/Cline/v0/Bolt, you may be interested in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpKtpW9TGF0">recent JSNation talk</a> above.</p><p>We're already seeing early signs of this evolution:</p> From responders to collaborators <p>Current tools mostly wait for our commands.

The happy path works beautifully. Investors and social networks are wowed. But when real users start clicking around? That's when things fall apart.</p><p>I've seen this firsthand:</p>  <p>Error messages that make no sense to normal users</p>  <p>Edge cases that crash the application</p>  <p>Confusing UI states that never get cleaned up</p>  <p>Accessibility completely overlooked</p>  <p>Performance issues on slower devices</p>  <p>These aren't just P2 bugs.

AI tools might actually enable this renaissance. By handling the routine coding tasks, they free up developers to focus on what matters most: creating software that truly serves and delights users.</p> The bottom line <p>AI isn't making our software dramatically better because software quality was (perhaps) never primarily limited by coding speed. The hard parts of software development — understanding requirements, designing maintainable systems, handling edge cases, ensuring security and performance — still require human judgment.</p><p>What AI does do is let us iterate and experiment faster, potentially leading to better solutions through more rapid exploration. But this will only happen if we maintain our engineering discipline and use AI as a tool, not as a replacement for good software practices. Remember: The goal isn't to write more code faster. It's to build better software. Used wisely, AI can help us do that. But it's still up to us to know what "better" means and how to get it.</p> Additional thoughts <p>Gergely again. Thank you, Addy, for this pragmatic summary on how to rethink our expectations on AI and software engineering. If you enjoyed this piece from Addy, check out his <a href="https://addyo.substack.com/?sort=new">other articles</a> and his latest book: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/leading-effective-engineering-teams">Leading Effective Engineering Teams</a>.</p><p>Here are my additional thoughts on AI and software engineering.</p> A good time to refresh what software engineering really is <p>Much of the disclosure on AI tooling for software engineering focuses on code generation capabilities, and rightfully so. AI tools are impressive in generating working code from prompts, or suggesting inline code as you build software. But how much of the process of building software is coding itself? About 50 years ago, Fred Brooks thought that it is around 15-20% of all time spent. Here are Brooks’ thoughts <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/142553229/do-we-spend-more-time-coding-than-years-ago">from The Mythical Man-Month</a>, written in 1975:</p><blockquote><p>“For some years, I have been successfully using the following rule of thumb for scheduling a software task:</p><p>⅓ planning</p><p>⅙ coding</p><p>¼ component test and early system test</p><p>¼ system test, all components in hand.”</p></blockquote><p>My take is that today, software engineers probably spend their time like this:</p>  <p>20% planning</p>  <p>40% coding (code + tests)</p>  <p>20% code review (others' code)</p>  <p>20% production readiness + rollout + small fixes during this + monitoring+alerting</p>  <p>At the same time, building standout software has a lot of other parts:</p>  <p>What: Figure out what to build. This can involve brainstorming, designing, user testing, working with product managers and business stakeholders, and so on. For startups, this phase can take very little time (“just build it and see if it works!”). For established companies, it can take up more time than building, though (“we need to make sure what we build doesn’t confuse our existing customers!”).</p>  <p>How: Draw up a plan on how to build the product/feature/service. Think through architecture implications, dependencies, how to test the product, and so on. Again, startups might be able to skip this stage, and the team can jump straight to planning. But for larger companies with more services and dependencies, leaving out planning will come back to bite the team. So most teams are doing some kind of planning using <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">Design docs, RFCs, or ADRs.</a></p>  <p>Build: Implement the feature or product: write the code, and make sure it works.</p>  <p>Verify: Double check that it works as expected before shipping to production. This is especially important in cases where shipping is high-stakes: for example, shipping a regression to a banking app could have financial implications for customers, and the business! We went into details about QA in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">QA across the tech industry.</a></p>  <p>Ship it: Merge the change, and ship to customers. There are plenty of strategies to ship changes to production. We covered several of these in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production.</a></p>  <p>Monitoring and oncall: Detect when something is wrong with the product. If there’s an outage, resolve it as soon as possible, and then make sure a similar outage won’t happen again. We looked at these common approaches in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/healthy-oncall-practices">Healthy oncall practices</a> and in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/incident-review-best-practices">Incident review and postmortem best practices</a>.</p>  <p>Maintain: Listen to customer complaints and feedback, and decide which bugs warrant fixing, and which are feature requests to prioritize. And figure out what feedback to disregard.</p>  <p>Migrate: If the product goes under large changes, or if the tech stack sees major changes — like a new framework — there might need to be migrations. We covered more in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/migrations">Migrations done well</a>.</p>  <p>AI tools today can help a lot with the “Build” part. But here is a good question: Just how useful are they for the other 7 things that are also part of software engineering?</p> Needing no developers: the dream since the 1960s <p>Non-technical people creating working software without needing to rely on software developers has been the dream since the 1960s. Coding is about translating from what people want (the customers, business stakeholders, the product manager, and so on) to what the computer understands. LLMs offer us a higher level of abstraction where we can turn English into code. However, this new abstraction does not change the nature of how software is created, – and what software is, – which is this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a6085c3-209f-49e5-a878-ec8437309c47_1280x824.png">          </a>How software is created (and what software is —– it’s more than just code!) <p>GenAI tools don’t change the process, but they do make some of the coding parts more efficient:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F404aec8f-07fb-4640-97e6-bc34344fe067_1570x832.png">          </a>How GenAI tools change our work as software engineers <p>Throughout the history of technology, new innovations promised the ability for business folks to collapse or bypass the “tech” part, and get straight to working software from their high-level prompts. This was the aspiration of:</p>  <p>1960s: the high-level programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>. COBOL stands for “common, business-oriented language.” The <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/142616988/a-goal-since-the-s">stated goal</a> of this language was to allow business people with no programming background to use it.</p>  <p>1990s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)">Visual Basic</a>. A programming language meant to have a very low learning curve, plus a visual environment where forms can be created with drag-and-drop.</p>  <p>Late 2010s: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform">The no-code movement</a>. Through templates and visual editing, no-code solutions like <a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a> offer a way to build software applications.</p>  <p>Unsurprisingly, several GenAI coding startups aspire for the same goal: to allow anyone to create software, by using the English language. In the past, we have seen success for simpler use cases. For example, these days, there is no coding knowledge needed to create a website: non-technical people can use visual editors and services like Wix.com, Webflow, Ghost or WordPress.</p><p>The higher-level the abstraction, the harder it is to specify how exactly the software should work. No-code solutions already ran into this exact limitation. As advisory CTO Alex Hudson writes in his article <a href="https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/">The no-code delusion</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The development of these syntaxes has generally run into the problem of expression: once they are simple enough to pick up quickly, they are no longer expressive enough to use in many scenarios. And vice-versa: some languages have the ability to define a custom language within them, called domain-specific languages (DSLs). </p><p>Few of these languages have ever been truly successful amongst the development community at large, primarily because they again make things extremely complex.”</p></blockquote><p>For more complex software, it’s hard to see not needing software engineers taking part in planning, building and maintaining software. And the more GenAI lowers the barrier for non-technical people to create software, the more software there will be to maintain.</p> AI agents: a major promise, but also a big “unknown” for 2025 <p>Two years after the launch of LLMs, many of us have gotten a pretty good handle on how to use them to augment our coding and software engineering work. They are great for prototyping, switching to less-familiar languages, and tasks where you can verify their correctness, and call out hallucinations or incorrect output.</p><p>AI agents, on the other hand, are in their infancy. Most of us have not used them extensively. There is only one generally available agent, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/153029265/devin-doubles-down-as-ai-software-engineer">Devin</a>, at $500/month, and early responses <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/153029265/not-a-good-fit-for-hands-on-software-engineers">are mixed</a>.</p><p>A lot of venture funding will be pouring into this area. We’ll see more AI coding agent tools launch, and the price point will also surely drop as a result. GitHub Copilot is likely to make something like <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/144237615/githubs-ai-assisted-developer-workflow-vision-copilot-workspace">Copilot Workspace</a> (an agentic approach) generally available in 2025. And we’ll probably see products from startups like what Stripe’s former CTO, David Singleton founded (<a href="https://sdsa.ai/">/dev/agents</a>.)</p><p>AI agents trade off latency and cost (much longer time spent computing results and running prompts several times, paraphrased by these startups as “thinking”) for accuracy (better results, based on the prompts). There are some good questions about how much accuracy will improve with this latency+cost tradeoff, and what engineering use cases will see significant productivity boost as a result.</p> Demand for experienced software engineers could increase <p>Experienced software engineers could be in more demand in the future than they are today. The common theme we’re seeing with AI tooling is how senior-and-above engineers can use these tools more efficiently, as they can “aim” better with them. When you know what “great output” looks like, you can prompt better, stop code generation when it’s getting things wrong, and you can know when to stop prompting and go straight to the source code to fix the code itself.</p><p>We will see a lot more code produced with the help of these AI tools, and a lot more people and businesses start building their own solutions. As these solutions hit a level of complexity, it’s a safe bet that many of them will need to bring in professionals as they attempt to tame the complexity: complexity that requires experienced engineers to deal with. Existing tech companies will almost certainly produce more code with AI tools: and they will rely on experienced engineers to deal with the increase of complexity that necessarily follows.</p><p>As a software engineer, mastering AI-assisted development will make you more productive, and also more valuable. It’s an exciting time to be working in this field: we’re living through a time of accelerated tooling innovation. It does take time to figure out how to “tame” the current tools in a way that makes you the most productive: so experiment with them!</p><p>I hope you’ve found the practical approaches from Addy helpful.

 Using LlamaIndex Part 1 — OpenAI <p>I have started to experiment with <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> for use in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) document parsing and indexing. My results were mixed on the simple page provided. This is part 1, where I make a short post on LlamaIndex with OpenAI as the LLM component. I expect part 2 to be LlamaIndex with Ollama and Llama3–8b as the LLM components.</p><p>This is a very short chunk of code. I also used the LlamaIndex Parse browser-based tool to see if I received different outputs. As one would expect, I did not. You can access the browser-based tool by opening a LlamaIndex account and choosing the “Parse” tool in your dashboard. You’ll need an account if you plan to use the code I provide and you will also need to generate an API key from your LlamaIndex dashboard. One of the great things about LlamaIndex is that for a paid tool it is generous in its free usage; 1000 credits PER DAY. In “accurate” mode, it is 1 credit per page; in “premium” mode, it is 15 credits per page. For my simple one page example the output between the two did not&nbsp;differ.</p><p>First the small snippet of&nbsp;code.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai llama-index-llms-openai<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file<br><br>from llama_parse import LlamaParse<br>from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br><br><br>load_dotenv()<br><br>parser = LlamaParse(result_type="markdown", verbose=True)<br><br>file_name = "ssi-page-5.pdf"<br>extra_info = {"file_name": file_name}<br><br>with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the MD output uncomment the below<br>    # print(documents[0].text)<br><br># index the parsed documents<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "what are the principles of SSI?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>You can find this code and a few sample documents, including the document used in this code in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test</a> Github repo with the code specifically under the Test0&nbsp;folder.</p><p>Note that I don’t set an LLM or an embedding model. LlamaIndex uses OpenAI as the default LLM and OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002. You will need an OpenAI API key to go along with the LlamaIndex key. My code loads them from the&nbsp;.env to environmental variables and if they are named appropriately those variables will be found by default. Below is a&nbsp;.env&nbsp;example.</p> OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>In the code above I am using a single-page PDF, “ssi-page-5.pdf”. It is page 5 of the larger document, “Self-Sovereign Identity A Systematic Review Mapping and Taxonomy.pdf”. If you plan to send LlamaParse a larger document but use the API properties to tell it only to parse a subset of pages from the document keep in mind that LlamaParse starts at page 0. The first time I tried this I had an off-by-one issue because I assumed page 1 of the document was, you know, page 1. It was page 0. This is understandable from a programming standpoint but caught me off guard&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>In the example code, I opened a file directly but LlamaIndex provides a directory reader with filters, if you desire to use that instead. The results I got back on the LLM query were spot on as would be expected on a single page of context with a well-outlined section pertinent to my simple&nbsp;query.</p><p>You don’t really need the creation of the vector index, query engine and query/response to test out LlamaIndex parsing. Just uncomment line 23 in the above code (line 19 in the repo code) comment out everything below it and get the parsed&nbsp;output.</p> Premium Mode and Auto Mode and Less than Expected&nbsp;Outcomes <p>In the code, I didn’t try out premium mode or auto mode. I intend to make a separate post about auto mode. I did try them in the LlamaIndex Parse tool. In both, I expected the image at the top of the page to get output as an image in the “Images” tab of the Parse output tool, but it&nbsp;didn’t.</p><p>The image at the top of the page is below as a screen&nbsp;capture.</p><p>This was disappointing. I’m not sure why this did not provide the expected&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>There you have it. A simple bit of code to parse using LlamaIndex. What makes it different from other parsers I have tried (all open source) is that it spits out the results in markdown, if desired, which is better than the usual plain text I received in other tools. The markdown provides the LLM more context even if in my simple case it was not of value. The other is that in theory, it will better parse images, tables etc., but as I explained I did not get that result.&nbsp;:-( I’ll continue to experiment with it, especially on more complicated pages such as ones that contain a table and in auto mode via&nbsp;code.</p><p>You can find part 2 as “<a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/ai-rag-with-llamaindex-local-embedding-and-ollama-llama-3-1-8b-b0620116a715">AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</a>”. The example in part 2 uses LlamaParse auto&nbsp;mode.</p>

A <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot</a> is intended to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR">W3C Candidate Recommendation</a> after required review and approval steps.</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2525">As I wrote about the First Candidate Recommendation</a>, VC-JOSE-COSE secures VC Data Model payloads with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">JOSE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, or <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html">COSE</a> signatures.  And while I’m admittedly not a fan of JSON-LD, to the extent that Verifiable Credentials using the JSON-LD-based VC Data Model are in use, I’m committed to there being a solid VC-JOSE-COSE specification so there is a simple, secure, standards-based way to sign these credentials.</p>
<p>One significant change since the First Candidate Recommendation was splitting the Controller Document text out into its own specification called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/">Controlled Identifier Document 1.0</a>.  Publishing a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot for it is planned for next week.  Part of why it became its own specification is so that it can be referenced by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html">planned update to the W3C DID specification</a>.</p>

  Should Sqitch and URI::mysql use DBD::MariaDB instead of DBD::mysql? If so,
what are the implications for Sqitch deployment and usage?

<p>I seek the wisdom of the Perl Monks:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Sqitch project got <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues/825" title="sqitchers/sqitch#825 Support DBD::MariaDB">a request</a> to switch from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a>
to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB">DBD::MariaDB</a>. DBD::mysql 5’s requirement to build from the MySQL 8
client library provides the impetus for the request, but in poking around, I
found a <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/grinnz/2023/12/migrating-from-dbdmysql-to-dbdmariadb.html">blogs.perl.org post</a> highlighting some Unicode fixes in
DBD::MariaDB, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Sqitch likely doesn’t have the Unicode issue (it always works with Perl
Unicode strings), but it depends on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::db">URI::db</a> to provide the DBI connection
string. For MySQL URIs, the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/URI-db/source/lib/URI/mysql.pm#L6">URI::mysql dbi_driver</a> method returns <code>mysql</code>.</p>
<p>Should it be changed to return <code>MariaDB</code>, instead? Is there general
community consensus that DBD::MariaDB provides better compatibility with
both MySQL and MariaDB these days?</p>
<p>I’m also curious what the impact of this change would be for Sqitch.
Presumably, if DBD::MariaDB can build against either the MariaDB or MySQL
client library, it is the more flexible choice to continue supporting both
databases going forward.</p>

      <p>Update 2025-01-08</p>
      <p><a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/URI-db-0.23">URI-db 0.23</a> uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB">DBD::MariaDB</a> instead of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> for both
URI::mysql and URI::MariaDB.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/releases/tag/v1.5.0">Sqitch v1.5.0</a> always uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB">DBD::MariaDB</a> when connecting to
MySQL or MariaDB, even when using older versions of URI::db. Thanks everyone

<p>Happy New Year! 🎉🥳🍾🥂</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">JSONPath RFC</a> includes a section on defining <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-normalized-paths" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Normalized Paths">normalized paths</a>,
which use a subset of JSONPath syntax to define paths to the location of a
node in a JSON value. I hadn’t thought much about it, but noticed that the
<a href="https://serdejsonpath.live">serde JSONPath Sandbox</a> provides a “Located” switch adds them to query
results. For the sake of complementarity, I added the same feature to the <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/">Go

</code>  <p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> of the <code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> Go package enables this feature
via its new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.SelectLocated"><code>SelectLocated</code></a> method, which returns a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a> that
shows off a few of the benfits of pairing JSONPath query results with paths
that uniquely identify their locations in a JSON value, including sorting and
deduplication. It also takes advantage of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go v1.23 iterators</a>, providing
methods to range over all the results, just the node values, and just the
paths. As a result, v0.3.0 now requires Go 1.23.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_path">serde_json_path Rust crate</a> inspired the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a>
rather than a simple slice of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0/spec#LocatedNode"><code>LocatedNode</code></a> structs, but I truly embraced it
once I noticed the the focus on “nodelists” in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-overview" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Overview">RFC’s overview</a>, which
provides this definition:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>A JSONPath expression is a string that, when applied to a JSON value (the
query argument), selects zero or more nodes of the argument and outputs
these nodes as a nodelist.</p>

    </blockquote>
  
<p>It regularly refers to nodelists thereafter, and it seemed useful to have an
object to which more features can be added in the future.
<code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> thererfore also changes the result value
of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.Select"><code>Select</code></a> from <code>[]any</code> to the new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#NodeList"><code>NodeList</code></a> struct, an alias for
<code>[]any</code>. For now it adds a single method, <code>All</code>, which again relies on <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go
v1.23 iterators</a> to iterate over selected nodes.</p>
<p>While the data type has changed, usage otherwise has not. One can iterate
directly over values just as before:</p>
  <code>for _, val := range path.Select(jsonInput) {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>But <code>All</code> removes the need to alias-away the index value with <code>_</code>:</p>
  <code>for val := range path.Select(jsonInput).All() {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>I don’t expect any further incompatible changes to the main <code>jsonpath</code> module,
but adding these return values now allows new features to be added to the
selected node lists in the future.</p>
<p>May you find it useful!</p>

<p>We don’t always get to choose what happens during the course of our lives, but we DO get to choose how we incorporate the unexpected into our stories. Here’s to seeing the value of complementary energies that keep this “reality” going even during times when the mixture makes us queasy. May we learn to navigate complex landscapes layered with meaning by remembering to be still, open, without knee jerk judgement. Quantum superposition is full of potential, if only we can learn how to engage with it. When we get stuck, try to remember there are other angles, different scales, alternative time structures. I believe the divine cosmos of which we are an integral part is beneficent, responsive, and playful. In an age of apocalyptic anxiety, may we stay in touch with our inner children who can create many somethings from an apparent “nothing.” Tap the inside of the doughnut, torus fields pulsing with heart energy for all beings, keeping collective time for this beautiful Earth that holds our bodies and souls for now.</p>

  こんにちは、富士榮です。    年末にDoc SearlsがIntention Economyについて「The Real Intention Economy」というポストをしています。かなり重要なポストだと思うので読んでおいた方が良さそうです。     https://doc.searls.com/2024/12/30/the-real-intention-economy/     彼の著書は日本語にも翻訳されていますね。  https://amzn.to/3C2PX9n        さて、今回のDocのポストに戻ると、彼がIntention Economyの考え方を発表してからもう直ぐ20年が経とうとしている現在、生成AIの文脈も相まって、Intention Economy自体が脅威となりつつある、という話です。     Intention Economyで検索すると結構ヤバ目の結果が返

  The Go SQL/JSON Playground has been updated with a fresh design and PostgreSQL
17 compatibility.

<p>Based on the recently-released Go <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">JSONPath</a> and <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">JSONTree</a> playgrounds, I’ve
updated the design and of the <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">SQL/JSON Playground</a>. It now comes
populated with sample JSON borrowed from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535</a>, as well as a selection of
queries that randomly populate the query field on each reload. I believe this
makes the playground nicer to start using, not to mention more pleasing to the
eye.</p>
<p>The playground has also been updated to use the recently-released
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson@v0.2.1/path">sqljson/path v0.2 package</a>, which replicates a few changes included in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/" title="PostgreSQL 17 Released!">PostgreSQL 17 release</a>. Notably, the <code>.string()</code> function no longer uses a
time zone or variable format to for dates and times.</p>
<p>Curious to see it in action? <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">Check it out!</a></p>

 Wenn du gesetzlich krankenversichert bist, wird deine Krankenkasse bis 15. Januar 2025 eine elektronische Patientenakte für dich einrichten – es sei denn, du widersprichst. Das gilt auch für private Krankenversicherungen, die freiwillig eine elektronische Patientenakte anbieten. Durch einen Widerspruch dürfen dir keine Nachteile entstehen. Die Anschreiben der Krankenkassen informieren <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/pressemitteilungen/elektronische-patientenakte-krankenkassen-informieren-unzureichend">unzureichend</a>. Bedenke bei deiner Entscheidung: 



<p></p>



 
 
<p>1. Inhalt und Datensicherheit: Ohne deinen Widerspruch wird künftig jeder Arztbesuch, jede Therapie und jede Medikation in einer zentral abrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte gespeichert, darunter Arztbriefe, Entlassungsberichte und Diagnosekennungen. Hierunter fallen unter anderem auch Informationen zu deinen Suchtkrankheiten, Psychotherapien und psychischen Erkrankungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen, Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen (z.B. Impotenz), die gespeichert und zusammengetragen werden.&nbsp;Durch die zentrale Speicherung aller Behandlungen in einer elektronischen Patientenakte erhältst du eine einheitliche Zugriffsmöglichkeit auf deine Patientendaten. Andererseits waren in der Vergangenheit bereits mehrere zentralisierte, europäischen Gesundheitssysteme von umfangreichen Datenpannen betroffen. Bei der elektronischen Patientenakte in Deutschland ist noch nichts passiert. Sicherheitsforscher <a href="https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2024/ende-der-epa-experimente">warnen</a> jedoch, Kriminelle könnten mit wenig Aufwand auf beliebige Patientenakten zugreifen. Falls es zu Hacking, Datendiebstahl oder Datenverlust kommen sollte, können viel mehr Informationen verloren gehen als ohne elektronische Patientenakte.</p>
 



 

			
		
 
 



<p>2. Direkter Zugriff: Mit der elektronischen Patientenakte können behandelnde Ärzte, deine Apotheker, deine Physiotherapeuten, dein Pflegeheim, usw., sowohl in Deutschland als auch künftig im EU-Ausland deine elektronische Patientenakte direkt einsehen. Sie können sie auch in ihrer eigenen Praxissoftware speichern. Die Vorteile: Der Datenzugriff kann deine Behandlungen und Medikation wesentlich beschleunigen und verbessern, z. B. auch fehlerhafte Medikamentationen vermeiden. Unterlagen müssen nicht erst angefordert werden und liegen auch im Notfall unmittelbar vor. Doppeluntersuchungen entfallen. Ein möglicher Nachteil könnte sich daraus ergeben, dass für&nbsp;andere medizinische Stellen nicht relevante Behandlungen, Medikamentationen, etc. abgerufen und somit eingesehen werden können (z.B. dein Zahnarzt oder Apotheker könnte von deiner Psychotherapie oder Geschlechtskrankheit erfahren).</p>



<p>Ohne elektronische Patientenakte wirst du, so wie du es bisher kennst und möglicherweise erlebt hast, auf einem Anamnesebogen nach Vorbehandlungen, Medikamentationen, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, usw. gefragt. Gegebenenfalls werden weitere Unterlagen angefordert wie z. B. MRT-Aufnahmen, usw. Es gibt auch einen papierbasierten, bundeseinheitlichen Medikationsplan, den du dir ausdrucken lassen kannst. Dieser ist aber auch in der elektronischen Patientenakte speicherbar.</p>



<p>Mit elektronischer Patientenakte kannst du mündlich, über eine App oder über deine Krankenkasse einzelne (ärztliche) Leistungserbringer komplett vom Zugriff auf deine elektronische Patientenakte ausschließen. Dies ist mit gewissen Herausforderungen verbunden. Du hast auch das Recht, gegenüber Leistungserbringern der Übertragung von einzelnen Informationen in die elektronische Patientenakte zu widersprechen. Du kannst einzelne Dokumente auch nachträglich wieder aus ihrer elektronischen Patientenakte löschen (lassen) – leider wieder recht kompliziert. Bedenke, dass Löschungen Nachteile für deine Behandlung nach sich ziehen können.</p>



<p>3. Weitergabe an Dritte: Deine elektronische Patientenakte kann für bestimmte Zwecke auch an Politik und Behörden, Forschende und Wirtschaftsunternehmen (z.B. Technologieunternehmen und Pharmaindustrie) weitergegeben werden. Die Chancen: Anonymisierte Gesundheitsdatenanalysen ermöglichen bedeutende Fortschritte in der Pandemie- und Endemieeindämmung, z. B. durch Früherkennung, sowie in der Forschung, z.B. bei der Entwicklung sicherer Medikamente. Die Risiken: Nur teilweise werden Daten vor der Weitergabe anonymisiert. In anderen Fällen werden dein Name und deine Versichertennummer zwar entfernt, aber über andere Kennzeichen bleibst du eindeutig identifizierbar (sog. Pseudonymisierung). So kann es Dritten gelingen, deine Krankheitsgeschichte wieder dir zuzuordnen.</p>



<p>Hinweis: Auch wenn du die elektronische Patientenakte nutzt, kannst du ihrer Weitergabe an Dritte frühestens ab dem 15.01.2025 separat widersprechen (über eine App deiner Krankenkasse oder durch <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruch-gegen-uebernahme-forschungsdaten/">Brief an ihre Ombudsstelle</a>).</p>



 Ergebnis: Es ist letztendlich deine Entscheidung, ob du&nbsp;eine elektronische Patientenakte haben möchtest oder nicht. 



<p></p>



<p>Wenn du eine elektronische Patientenakte geführt haben möchtest, brauchst du nichts zu tun – sie wird ab 15. Januar 2025 automatisch eingerichtet.</p>



<p>Wenn du dich gegen eine elektronische Patientenakte entscheidest, hilft dir der <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruchs-generator/">Widerspruchs-Generator</a> ein Widerspruchsschreiben zu erstellen. Du kannst auch per Krankenkassen-App oder – bei einigen Krankenkassen – auch <a href="https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Widerspruch-bei-der-ePA-fuer-alle-Was-bisher-bekannt-ist-9710212.html">über deren Website widersprechen</a>.</p>



<p>Du kannst ab dem Moment widersprechen, in dem deine Krankenkasse dich über dein Widerspruchsrecht informiert hat. Ein Widerspruch ist auch nach Ablauf der in dem Schreiben genannten 6-Wochen-Frist jederzeit möglich; dann werden alle bereits gespeicherte Daten wieder aus der elektronischen Patientenakte gelöscht. Solltest du später einmal deine Entscheidung ändern, kannst du deinen Widerspruch jederzeit wieder zurücknehmen und für die Zukunft eine elektronische Patientenakte bekommen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh2RccYWm5Y64ZlfbsTKiWXAlUC7lHuK4OVp2Zw4m1e8MMPrq7K27Us08K7BDas5sTFDKg5qGwvUnXiKD_JveB40eP1VqMO0d9RaMZBRleTRgEQUWkul6U8bcYqkD4Rsb7PTBdY7xojWcSInzi90vZgZpyZoVtk_bDdRunV9bcW253FjytRdoDo9in3S3HZ"></a> <br>まだまだプライバシーの章が続きます。<p></p><p>4.5.&nbsp;DELETING MDL INFORMATION FROM A DEVICE</p><blockquote><p>An mDL holder must have the capability to delete the mDL holder’s mDL from the mDL holder’s device. Such deletion:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Must delete all mDL information, log information, and any metadata (e.g. settings) that could impart information about the deleted mDL or its use.&nbsp;  Must not require approval by the Issuing Authority.  Must be an option available to an mDL holder on the mDL device  Must be possible when the mDL device is offline.  Should be available to an mDL holder via a request to the Issuing Authority (see below).  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者のデバイスからmDL保持者のmDLを削除する機能を持たなければならない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  すべてのmDL情報、ログ情報、および削除されたmDLまたはその使用に関する情報を与える可能性のあるメタデータ（設定など）を削除すること  発行機関の承認を必要としないこと。  mDLデバイス上でmDL保持者が利用可能なオプションであること。  mDLデバイスがオフラインのときに可能であること。  発行機関（下記参照）へのリクエストにより、mDL保持者が利用可能であること。  <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;デバイスからmDL情報を削除する際の話です。基本的に利用者が自身で削除をすることができること（その際に発行者の承認や接続が不要であること）が求められています。難しいところですね。この章の中で発行したmDL関連情報が適切に扱われていること発行機関が責任をもって確認することが求められる一方で利用者の権利も守らないといけないわけです。まぁ、最低限ウォレット開発者が悪意を持って利用者のデータを扱えないように、というところまでは守りましょう、ってところですね。</p><blockquote><p>Should an mDL device (i.e. a device containing an mDL) be lost or get stolen, it could be beneficial for the mDL holder to have the mDL remotely deleted (or temporarily suspended) by the Issuing Authority. Besides the obvious advantage to the mDL holder, other considerations apply too:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The mDL holder’s request must be authenticated. It must not be possible for someone other than the mDL holder or the Issuing Authority to delete (or suspend) an mDL.  A “push” capability (from the Issuing Authority to the mDL device) is needed for immediate deletion (or suspension) (see section 6).  Successful deletion (or suspension) depends on network connectivity to the mDL device  The mDL will automatically become unusable (although potentially not inaccessible) when the MSO expires (see section 6).&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLデバイス（mDLを含むデバイス）が紛失または盗難に遭った場合、発行機関によってmDLがリモートで削除（または一時的に停止）されることは、mDL保有者にとって有益です。mDL保有者にとっての明らかな利点の他に、他の考慮事項も適用されます：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  mDL保有者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者または発行機関以外の者がmDLを削除（または一時停止）することはできない。  即時削除（または一時停止）には、（発行局からmDLデバイスへの）「プッシュ」機能が必要である（セクション6参照）  削除（または一時停止）の成功は、mDLデバイスへのネットワーク接続に依存します。  MSOの有効期限が切れると、mDLは自動的に使用できなくなる（アクセスできなくなる可能性はないが）（セクション6参照）。  <p></p></blockquote><p>やはりスマートフォンベースの話なので当然紛失や盗難に関する考慮は十分に必要です。</p><p>mDLを利用するときはちゃんと認証するのは当たり前として、発行者から発行済みのクレデンシャルをプッシュ等を使って削除できるようにする、また有効期限切れたらウォレット側で自動的に使えなくする、などもちゃんと気を使う必要があります。</p><blockquote><p>In addition, mDL deletion may be needed when an mDL holder wants to transfer an mDL to a new device, when a person moves to another jurisdiction, or when a person dies.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should weigh the benefits and challenges associated with a remote delete (or suspension) capability when considering its implementation (see Appendix A).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An mDL holder must have the capability to delete activity log information (as defined in section 4.4) the mDL holder may previously have elected to maintain. It is recommended that this capability allows selective deletion (i.e. specific log entries, rather than only an “all or nothing” option).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、mDLの削除は、mDL保持者が新しいデバイスにmDLを移したい場合、別の管轄区域に移動する場合、またはmDL保持者が死亡した場合に必要となる可能性がある。</p><p>発行局は、リモート削除（または一時停止）機能の導入を検討する際、その利点と課題を比較検討する必要がある（付録A参照）。</p><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者が以前に保持することを選択した活動ログ情報（第4.4項に定義）を削除する機能を持たなければならない。この機能により、選択的な削除（すなわち、「全削除」オプションのみではなく、特定のログエントリーの削除）を可能にすることが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>mDLを含めデジタルデータを持ち主だけが制御できるようにするのは大切な一方で死亡した場合などの考慮は非常に重要です。マイナンバーカードと保険証の統合をした結果、意識のない救急患者の保険者資格の確認ができない、なんて話も聞きますが、この辺りは例外処理も含めてちゃんとプロセス設計をしておくのが大切です。</p><p>また、ログの削除に関しても選択的に削除することができるようにすべきである、などかなり細かくガイドされている感じがあります。</p><p>4.6.&nbsp;NO TRACKING</p><blockquote><p>“Tracking” is the act of compiling information about an mDL holder and/or an mDL holder’s activity. Any stakeholder (including Issuing Authorities, technology providers, service providers and mDL verifiers) must not track mDL holders or the usage of any mDL except as required by law (e.g. when a drug store dispenses products containing ephedrine).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「トラッキング」とは、mDL保持者および/またはmDL保持者の活動に関する情報を収集する行為を指します。いかなるステークホルダー（発行局、テクノロジープロバイダー、サービスプロバイダー、mDLベリファイアーを含む）も、法律で義務付けられている場合（ドラッグストアがエフェドリンを含む製品を調剤する場合など）を除き、mDL保持者やmDLの使用状況を追跡してはなりません。</p></blockquote><p>トラッキングの禁止に関する条項ですね。法的根拠なくトラッキングしてはならない、と。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Tracking by an mDL verifier can be performed as soon as two different mDL transactions can be linked to each other. This can be countered by designing the solution to maximize anonymity (“characteristic of information that does not permit a personally identifiable information principal to be identified directly or indirectly”, from ISO/IEC 29100) and to maximize unlinkability. Anonymity can be hampered by metadata that may be associated with multiple mDL transactions, e.g. hardware or network addresses, long-term public keys, or session tokens. Consequently, Issuing Authorities must minimize the sharing of static or long-lived metadata.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL検証者による追跡は、2つの異なるmDLトランザクションが互いにリンクされるとすぐに実行できる。これは、匿名性（「個人を特定できる情報主体が直接的または間接的に特定されない情報の特性」、ISO/IEC 29100より）を最大化し、リンク不能性を最大化するようにソリューションを設計することで対抗できる。匿名性は、複数のmDLトランザクションに関連するメタデータ（ハードウェアやネットワークアドレス、長期公開鍵、セッショントークンなど）によって妨げられる可能性がある。そのため、発行局は静的または長期的なメタデータの共有を最小限に抑える必要がある。</p></blockquote><p>これはSD-JWT-VCでも同じ議論がなされていますが、Verifierの結託によるリンク可能性の話ですね。mdocにおける選択的開示については基本的にSD-JWTと類似の考え方なので単体ではリンク可能性に対する対応はできなかったはずです。そのため匿名性を担保するソリューションを別途検討することが必要とされています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Although pre-matched transactions hold the promise of maximizing anonymity at a user data level, anonymity in post-matched transactions is limited since the portrait image is always shared. For these transactions it is recommended that Issuing Authorities pursue regulatory protection against tracking by mDL verifiers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>事前照合取引は、ユーザー・データ・レベルでの匿名性を最大化することが期待できるが、事 後照合取引では肖像画像が常に共有されるため、匿名性は制限される。このような取引の場合、発行機関はmDL検証者による追跡を防ぐため、規制による保護を追求することが推奨されます。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solutions using the server retrieval method also pose challenges in preventing tracking. As per design, the Issuing Authority is involved in real time each time an mDL is used by the mDL holder. The Issuing Authority would technically be able to keep track of when an mDL holder uses his/her mDL and keep track of what data is shared. Based on IP address analysis the Issuing Authority would also be able to track an mDL holder’s physical location to some extent. This can be mitigated by placing regulatory limitations on the Issuing Authority11, and will be of value to the extent an mDL holder trusts the Issuing Authority’s adherence to the regulatory limitations. Consequently, Issuing Authorities considering a server retrieval solution should carefully weigh the advantages of this approach against its privacy implications.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルを使用するソリューションは、追跡を防ぐという課題もある。設計の通り、発行局はmDL保有者がmDLを使用するたびにリアルタイムで関与します。発行局は技術的に、mDL保有者がいつmDLを使用し、どのようなデータが共有されたかを追跡することができます。IPアドレスの分析に基づき、発行局はmDL保持者の物理的な所在地をある程度追跡することもできます。この問題は、発行局に規制上の制限を設けることで緩和することができます11 。そのため、発行局はサーバー検索ソリューションを検討する際、このアプローチの利点とプライバシーへの影響を慎重に比較検討する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルは基本的に従来のフェデレーションモデルと同様に発行者への問い合わせが発生するため、トラッキング耐性は低いとされます。この辺りはエコシステムのサイズや参加しているエンティティの関係性などを踏まえて設計していかないといけないポイントですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Since the activity log (see section 4.4) contains a full record of when and potentially where an mDL was used, it is reiterated that access to the activity log must not be possible by anyone other than the mDL holder.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>アクティビティログ（4.4項参照）には、mDLがいつ、どこで使用されたかについての完全な記録が含まれるため、mDL保持者以外の者がアクティビティログにアクセスできないようにする必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>今日もこの辺りにしておきましょう。</p><p><br></p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgsirw-ixHljTE4PI7XJGxX3d9zXlmYn8Pqga9LRF93BNrOj01_6fQ9Nga4EnGJs6kVeNLAYYd9huTxX3V5MacVs0LxgXxQXespjZ1wqRTyK9KDG-Bhxorxx3AA19XA5IZ-WsIa_xIValGmsWDtkpmas9MSRTH59d8OIZhFTOj4VWrUYyE2qXUTWNsCyM3q"></a> <br>引き続き4章のプライバシーの部分を読んでいきます。<p></p><p>4.3.&nbsp;PROTECTING DATA</p><blockquote><p>It is up to Issuing Authorities to ensure that all mDL data stored on the mDL holder’s device is adequately protected. As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement. At minimum, Issuing Authorities must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、mDL保持者のデバイスに保存されたすべてのmDLデータが適切に保護されていることを確認する必要があります。この点に関する標準はまだ開発中であるため、各発行局はソリューションの設計がこの要件を確実にサポートするよう、細心の注意を払う必要があります。発行局は、最低限以下の事項を遵守しなければなりません：</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;原文でも太字で強調されているとおり、mDL App（ウォレット）に保持されているmDLデータが保護されていることを発行者が確認することが求められています。この責任分解の考え方は非常に重要ですね。欧州でもそうですが発行者となる国が認定したウォレットが必要になるのはこのような背景からきていると思います。しかしこうなるとApple WalletやGoogle Walletに格納されたクレデンシャルが適切に管理されていることをどこまで国は確認できるんだろうか、、、と気になってきますね。</p><p>具体的な要件が続きます。</p><blockquote><p></p>  mDL information must be stored in encrypted form  Private key material must be protected in a security module designed for the safekeeping of key material.  The mDL holder must be authenticated when any mDL data is accessed or released, at a point in time that is sufficiently close (as determined by the Issuing Authority) to the time of the access or release. Issuing Authorities that want to leverage device unlocking to protect mDL data must include measures to ensure that this feature has not been disabled by the mDL holder (also see section 7).  Example: If an app authenticates the mDL holder when the mDL app is accessed, an Issuing Authority should set a time limit after which authentication of the mDL holder is again required before the release of mDL data.&nbsp;  mDL data must be released to an mDL verifier only via the following:   an ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant interface.  an ISO/IEC 18013-7 compliant interface.  As an alternative to ISO/IEC 18013-7, an over-the-Internet interface as envisioned in Appendix C that:   Complies with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f, and&nbsp;  Has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee.    For sharing mDL data between apps on a phone via an interface other than those listed above, an interface compliant with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f and that has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee&nbsp;  mDL情報は暗号化された形で保存されなければならない。  秘密鍵は、鍵の保管のために設計されたセキュリティ・モジュールで保護されなければならない。  mDL データがアクセスまたは公開される際には、アクセスまたは公開の時点に（発行局が決定する）十分 に近い時点で、mDL 所持者が認証されなければならない。デバイスのロック解除を活用してmDLデータを保護したい発行局は、この機能がmDL保持者によって無効化されていないことを保証する手段を含める必要があります（セクション7も参照）。  例 アプリがmDLアプリにアクセスしたときにmDLの所有者を認証する場合、発行局は、mDLデータの公開前にmDLの所有者の認証が再度必要となる制限時間を設定する必要があります。  mDLデータは、以下を経由してのみmDL検証者に公開されなければならない：   ISO/IEC 18013-5に準拠したインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7準拠のインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7 に代わるものとして、付録 C で想定されているインターネット上のインター フェース：   付録Cの項目2.bおよび2.fに準拠し、かつ  AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承認されている。    上記以外のインタフェースを介して携帯電話のアプリ間で mDL データを共有する場合は、付 録 C 項目 2.b および 2.f に準拠し、AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承 認されたインタフェース。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><p>かなり細かく要件が決まってますね。EUでも鍵をどこに置くかは色々と議論がありましたが、AAMVAではセキュリティ・モジュールになってますね。クラウドベースのHSMとかは選択肢に入らないのかな？あと、Holderのプレゼンスや認証のタイミング、ウォレットのアンロックが無効化されていないことの確認など色々とガイドがありますがどうやって確認するんだ？？って気もしますが。こうなってきるとやはり専用ウォレットみたいな話になってきそうですねぇ。。</p><blockquote><p>Note 1: This requirement prohibits the sharing of mDL data using the mDL as a “flash pass” (i.e. by showing an image of a credential to a verifier); also see section 8.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>注 1：この要件は、mDL を「フラッシュ・パス」（すなわち、検証者にクレデンシャルの画像を見せること）として使用して mDLデータを共有することを禁止している。</p></blockquote><p>これも重要ですね。以前紹介したパートにも書いてありましたが基本的にmDLは目視で確認するためのものではない、ということですね。</p><p>4.4.&nbsp;ACTIVITY LOG</p><blockquote><p>The mDL app must be capable of maintaining an activity log. The mDL app must allow the mDL holder to decide if an activity log must be maintained or not. It is recommended that the mDL app requires the mDL holder to explicitly choose for or against keeping an activity log upon setup (i.e. no defaults, and in addition to being able to change this subsequently). The activity log and related settings must be accessible only to the mDL holder (also see section 4.6). The activity log must allow for the recording of all mDL transactions. In this context, an mDL transaction is the sharing of information by an mDL holder with an mDL verifier, as well as any provisioning, update, or communication action between the mDL and the Issuing Authority. At minimum, the following must be recordable for any transaction: Transaction timestamp; type of transaction (e.g. update or data sharing); in case of a data sharing transaction the data that was shared, and to the extent that it can be gathered, information about the identity of the mDL verifier. It is recommended that the mDL app provides the mDL holder the capability to select what types of activities are recorded in the activity log (i.e. rather than only an “all or nothing” option). It is also recommended that the mDL app includes functionality to help the mDL holder monitor and manage the size of the activity log within the capabilities of the mDL holder’s device. The mDL app must provide an option to the mDL holder to export the activity log.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを維持できなければならない。mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを保持するかどうかをmDL保持者が決定できなければならない。mDLアプリは、セットアップ時に、mDL保有者がアクティビティログの保持の可否を明示的に選択することを推奨します（すなわち、デフォルトではなく、さらにその後変更できるようにします）。アクティビティログおよび関連する設定は、mDL保持者のみがアクセス可能でなければなりません（4.6項も参照）。アクティビティログは、すべてのmDLトランザクションの記録を可能にしなければならない。ここでいう mDL トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者が mDL 検証者と情報を共有すること、および mDL と発行局との間でプロビジョニング、更新、または通信を行うことである。どのようなトランザクションでも、最低限、以下の情報は記録可能でなければならない： トランザクションのタイムスタンプ、トランザクションのタイプ（更新またはデータ共有など）、データ 共有トランザクションの場合は共有されたデータ、および収集可能な範囲で mDL 検証者の身元に関する情報。mDLアプリは、活動ログに記録される活動の種類を選択する機能をmDL保持者に提供することが推奨される（すなわち、「all or nothing」オプションのみではなく）。また、mDLアプリには、mDL保持者がmDL保持者のデバイスの能力の範囲内でアクティビティログのサイズを監視および管理するのに役立つ機能が含まれることが推奨されます。mDLアプリは、mDL保持者がアクティビティログをエクスポートできるオプションを提供する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>次はログの話題です。アクティビティログはプライバシーの観点からも非常に重要なものですので、Holderが完全に制御できるものである必要があることが強調されています。この辺りもウォレットソフトウェアを開発する際は留意したいポイントですね。</p><blockquote><p>If an Issuing Authority allows an mDL holder to hold the same mDL on more than one device, the activity log settings on each device should be independent of each other. It is recommended that there be no synchronization of the activity log or activity log settings between the two devices. Any synchronization features that are provided must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Synchronization must be an option that can be enabled or disabled by the mDL holder. The process to enable synchronization must require the mDL holder to prove access to both devices.&nbsp;  Synchronization must occur directly between the devices in question. A synchronization action must not give visibility of any of the following to anyone other than the mDL holder, or to anyone other than entities that already know that the mDL holder has an mDL on more than one device:  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>   Activity log information.  Activity log settings.  The fact that a synchronization action/selection took place  Any information that may convey that the mDL holder has an mDL on more than one device.&nbsp;   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局がmDL保持者に複数のデバイスで同じmDLを保持することを許可する場合、各デバイスのアクティビティログ設定は互いに独立しているべきである。2つのデバイス間でアクティビティログまたはアクティビティログ設定の同期は行わないことが推奨される。提供される同期機能は、以下に従わなければならない：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  同期は、mDL保持者が有効または無効にできるオプションでなければならない。同期を有効にするプロセスでは、mDL保持者が両方のデバイスへのアクセスを証明する必要があること。  同期化は、当該デバイス間で直接行われなければならない。同期化アクションは、mDL保持者以外、またはmDL保持者が複数のデバイスにmDLを持つことを既に知っているエンティティ以外の者に、以下のいずれかを可視化してはならない：  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>   アクティビティログ情報。  アクティビティログの設定。  同期アクション/選択が行われた事実。  mDL保持者が複数のデバイスでmDLを使用していることを伝える可能性のあるあらゆる情報。   <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;複数デバイスをHolderが使っている場合のログの同期の話です。これもせっかくコンテキストによってデバイスを分けているにも関わらずログが同期されてしまうとコンテキスト違反が起きてしまうことになるのでちゃんと分けましょう、という話ですね。</p><p><br></p><p>今日はこのあたりで。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p>

Care was and is being taken in all the work to ensure that methods and means are available to protect mDL holder privacy. The subsections that follow elaborate in more detail on different aspects of privacy protection and security. </blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLの設計プロセスでは、当初からmDL保持者のプライバシーが最優先されてきました。すべての作業において、mDL保持者のプライバシーを保護する方法と手段が利用できるよう、細心の注意が払われています。以下のサブセクションでは、プライバシー保護とセキュリティのさまざまな側面について詳しく説明します。</p></blockquote><p>4.2.&nbsp;DATA MINIMIZATION AND SELECTIVE DATA RELEASE</p><blockquote><p>A primary component of privacy involves the ability of an mDL holder to only share some information. This is achieved by two related but distinct measures:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Data minimization: A decision by an Issuing Authority to record fractional information about an attribute in an mDL, thus empowering an mDL holder to share less information than would otherwise have been the case. For example, an Issuing Authority can decide to include9 the optional age_birth_year field in an mDL in addition to the (mandatory) date of birth. This will allow the mDL holder to share only a birth year as opposed to a date of birth. Another example would be to include the resident city in addition to a full address.&nbsp;  Selective data release: Allowing an mDL holder to decide which of the data fields requested by an mDL verifier will be released to the Verifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As noted in section 2, it is important for Issuing Authorities to understand that ISO/IEC 18013-5 primarily specifies interfaces. The interfaces support both data minimization and selective data release. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities implement and provision as many of the optional minimized data elements, defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 and in this document, as possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>プライバシーの主要な構成要素は、mDL保持者が一部の情報のみを共有する能力である。これは、2つの関連するが異なる手段によって達成される：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  データの最小化：データの最小化：発行局が、mDLに属性情報の一部を記録することを決定すること。例えば、発行局はmDLに、（必須である）生年月日に加え、オプションのage_birth_yearフィールドを含める9 ことができます。これにより、mDLの所持者は、生年月日ではなく、生年のみを共有することができます。他の例としては、完全な住所に加えて、居住地の市町村を含めることができる。  選択的データ公開：mDL保有者が、mDLベリファイアから要求されたデータフィールドのうち、どのフィールドをベリファイアに開示するかを決定できるようにすること。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>セクション2で述べたように、発行局はISO/IEC 18013-5が主にインタフェースを規定していることを理解することが重要である。インターフェースはデータの最小化と選択的なデータ公開の両方をサポートする。発行局は、ISO/IEC 18013-5 および本文書で定義されているオプションの最小化データエレメントを可能な限り実装し、提供することが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>Privacy by designということです。ISO/IEC 18013-5ではデータの最小化と選択的情報開示の両方をサポートしているので、本書の原則を踏まえてちゃんと実装しなさいよ、と。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In addition, Issuing Authorities must ensure that mDL apps to which they provision data support at least the following:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  In case the request was received electronically, the mDL app must clearly convey what data was requested, and whether the mDL verifier intends to retain the information. If the request is presented in summarized form in the user interface (e.g. “Identity and driving privilege data” as opposed to “First Name, Last Name, DOB, Driving privileges”), means must be available to give the mDL holder visibility of the details of such a summarized form, both before and during a transaction.  The mDL app must provide the mDL holder full control over which data elements to share with the mDL verifier.&nbsp;  ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait image to be shared if the portrait was requested and if any other data element is released (to enable the mDL verifier to tie the mDL information to the person presenting the information). The app must support a graceful and informed exit from the request if the holder opts not to share the portrait image when requested.  If blanket sharing options are used, measures must be implemented to ensure that the mDL holder remains aware of what is being released when such an option is in effect. An mDL holder must also be able to opt out of or cancel any blanket sharing function.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities (and their app providers) are encouraged to devise solutions that will minimize transaction friction without compromising the above requirements.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、発行局はデータを提供するmDLアプリが少なくとも以下をサポートしていることを確認する必要があります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  要求が電子的に受信された場合、mDLアプリは、どのようなデータが要求されたのか、またmDLベリファイアがその情報を保持する意図があるかどうかを明確に伝えなければならない。要求がユーザーインターフェースに要約された形で提示される場合（例えば、「姓名、DOB、運転権限」ではなく「身分証明書および運転権限データ」）、取引の前および取引中の両方において、mDL保有者がそのような要約された形の詳細を可視化できる手段を利用できなければなりません。  mDLアプリは、どのデータ要素をmDLベリファイアと共有するかについて、mDL保持者に完全なコントロールを提供しなければならない。  ISO/IEC 18013-5では、肖像画が要求された場合、およびその他のデータ要素が公開された場合、肖像画を共有することが要求されています（mDLベリファイアがmDL情報を提示者に紐付けることを可能にするため）。アプリは、所持者が要求されたときに肖像画を共有しないことを選択した場合、その要求から 潔く、かつ通知された形で抜けることをサポートしなければならない。  包括的共有オプションが使用される場合、そのようなオプションが有効であるとき に、mDL保有者が何が公表されるかを確実に認識し続けるための措置が講じられなけれ ばならない。また、mDLの保有者は、包括的共有機能をオプトアウトまたはキャンセルできなければならない。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局（およびそのアプリプロバイダ）は、上記の要件を損なうことなく、取引の摩擦を最小化するソリューショ ンを考案することが推奨される。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>データを要求・共有する目的・意図を明確に伝える、そして提供しないことをユーザが選択できるようにする、オプトアウトできるようにもする、と。どれも基本的なことではありますが実装者にとってはどのようなUXを提供するかが腕の見せ所になると重要なポイントの一つでもあります。この辺りは日本でもウォレット開発をする方々も参考にすべき点だと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>細かくみていこうと思うので少し細切れにしていきます。</p><p>ということで今日はここまで。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) typically seek accreditation to demonstrate their competence and adherence to specific procedures and standards. One prominent accreditation body is the International Accreditation Service (IAS), which provides accreditation based on criteria such as AC803¹². This accreditation involves an assessment of the SDO’s standardization process, procedures, and management system².</p>



<p>In the United States, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredits SDOs that follow a consensus-based process³. This ensures that the standards developed are the result of a transparent, balanced, and inclusive process.</p>



<p>Accreditation helps SDOs validate their ability to consistently develop high-quality normative documents, enhancing trust and credibility in their standardization efforts².</p>

The element shall also be present in the end-entity certificates and hold the same value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 の Table B.1 の 「ISSUER 」証明書コンポーネントの表行で、以下を置き換える：</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>stateOrProvinceName はオプションである。この要素が存在する場合、この要素はエンドエンティティ証明書にも存在し、同じ値を保持するものとする。</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>を以下のように置き換える：</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>stateOrProvinceName は必須である。この要素は、エンド・エンティ ティティの証明書にも存在し、同じ値を保持するものとする。</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><br></p><p>やはりモバイル運転免許証にISO/IEC 18013-5を当てはめるとき、ちょいちょい書き換えするところがありますね。</p><p><br></p><p>3.7.&nbsp;VERSIONING</p><blockquote><p>The data structure for the 2D barcode in the AAMVA Card Design Specification contains a version number. This enables readers to always know which version of the data structure is present on a credential since the full data string is always read. This is not true for an mDL. An mDL reader has to explicitly request individual data elements, and does not know in advance which data elements are present or what version of a data set is supported.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA カード設計仕様の 2D バーコードのデータ構造には、バージョン番号が含まれている。これにより、完全なデータ文字列が常に読み取られるため、読み手はデータ構造のどのバージョンがクレデンシャルに存在するかを常に知ることができる。これは mDL には当てはまらない。mDL リーダは個々のデータ要素を明示的に要求する必要があり、どのデータ要素が存在する か、またはデータ・セットのどのバージョンがサポートされているかを事前に知ることはできない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One approach to address this is to add a “version” data element to the AAMVA namespace. To be useful an mDL reader would have to obtain this data element before making a subsequent request for additional data. Allowing the release of this data element without mDL holder approval is possible; requiring approval may confuse an mDL holder and increase transaction friction. Regardless, the 2-step process would add complexity (an mDL reader would still have to allow for not receiving a response to such a request) and add time to the transaction. Such an approach would also be unique to mDL in North America.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これに対処する1つの方法は、AAMVA名前空間に「バージョン」データ要素を追加することである。mDLの読者は、追加データを要求する前にこのデータ要素を取得しなければならない。mDL保持者の承認なしにこのデータ要素の公開を許可することは可能です。承認を必要とすると、mDL保持者を混乱させ、取引の摩擦を増大させる可能性があります。いずれにせよ、2段階のプロセスは複雑さを増し（mDLリーダーは、そのような要求に対する返答を受け取らないことを許容しなければならない）、取引に時間を要する。また、このようなアプローチは北米のmDLに特有のものである。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Instead, versioning of the AAMVA mDL data element set is achieved as follows:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  If needed, create a new identifier. This applies if there is a change to an existing data element, or if a completely new data element is added. Set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers must support the new identifier (Dayx in Figure 2). “Support” as used here means that an mDL app must allow an Issuing Authority to provision the identifier into the app, and that an mDL reader must be able to read the new identifier.&nbsp;  For the old identifier, set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers do not need to support the old identifier anymore (Dayy in Figure 2). This is also the date by which Issuing Authorities must be provisioning the new identifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>代わりに、AAMVA mDLデータ要素セットのバージョニングは、以下のように行われる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  必要に応じて、新しい識別子を作成する。これは、既存のデータ要素に変更がある場合、またはまったく新しいデータ要素が追加される場合に適用されます。mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが新しい識別子をサポートしなければならない期日を設定します（図2のDay x）。ここでいう「サポート」とは、mDLアプリが発行機関に識別子をアプリにプロビジョニングできるようにすること、およびmDLリーダーが新しい識別子を読み取れるようにすることを意味します。  旧識別子については、mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが旧識別子をサポートする必要がなくなる日付を設定します（図2のDay y）。これは、発行局が新しい識別子をプロビジョニングする期日でもあります。&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Figure 2 also reflects other requirements on both the mDL reader and the mDL app. The main advantage of the approach illustrated in Figure 2 is that, in case of changing an existing identifier, the Issuing Authority will have the time between the two dates to provision the new identifier (and deprecate the old identifier) to all its mDLs with the knowledge that mDL readers should be able to accommodate either identifier (the highlighted option in Figure 2). In the case where a new identifier is added (i.e. when there is no change to an existing identifier), the two dates may be on the same day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>図2には、mDLリーダーとmDLアプリの両方に対するその他の要件も反映されています。図2に示されたアプローチの主な利点は、既存の識別子を変更する場合、発行局は2つの日付の間に、mDLリーダーがどちらの識別子にも対応できることを前提に、すべてのmDLに新しい識別子を提供する（古い識別子を廃止する）時間を持つことができることです（図2のハイライトされたオプション）。新しい識別子が追加される場合（既存の識別子に変更がない場合）、2つの日付は同じ日になる可能性があります。</p><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ideally mDL readers would ask for the old identifier up to Dayy and for the new identifier thereafter. However, it is likely that readers would, at least around the change date, ask for both. It is also likely that an mDL would, especially around Dayy, include both identifiers. How the request is presented to the mDL holder, and how approval to share is administered, is left to implementers. Nevertheless, a simple approach could be for the mDL to present only one request, for the new identifier, to the mDL holder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>理想的には、mDLの読者はDay yまでは旧識別子を、それ以降は新識別子を要求するだろう。しかし、少なくとも変更日前後には、読者は両方の識別子を要求すると思われる。また、mDLは、特にDayyの前後には、両方の識別子を含むと思われる。どのようにリクエストをmDL保持者に提示し、どのように共有の承認を行うかは、実装者に委ねられている。とはいえ、単純なアプローチとしては、mDLがmDL保持者に提示する要求は、新しい識別子のための1つのみである。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpKZpmtHdpxVCCwwAKMtV_dcR9dTJ0qNOyEf6IeiqWqdvkGzDtfypoVDg1yyriuQFZUYGmH_-6Gwpmnk89D1VB673A4oDmpeJn3Y70AXiEZgh03qvwkd9zgCGiu41f1-Cf-evePqOQvlMxJyfiAfp56dM-gQ34jp1dJYCl-mphywPE6HYyO0or_fUrmhT"></a> <br>バージョニングに関するコンセプトがちゃんとしていますね。リードタイムをうまく作ってスムーズに移行できる様にすることができる様にしています。<p></p><p><br></p>3.8.&nbsp;ISSUING AUTHORITY SPECIFIC DATA<blockquote> ISO/IEC 18013-5 allows for the creation of additional namespaces, in like manner as the AAMVA namespace defined in this document (see clause 7.2.8 in ISO/IEC 18013-5). Issuing Authorities can use this mechanism to add additional fields to an mDL. The Issuing Authority would be responsible for communicating such an additional namespace to mDL verifiers that need to be able to read the Issuing Authority-specific data.  Note: ISO/IEC 18013-5 also lends itself to being adopted for the issuing of credentials separate from an mDL, for example fishing licenses, health credentials, or watercraft licenses.&nbsp; </blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5では、本文書で定義されているAAMVA名前空間と同様に、追加の名前空間を 作成することができる（ISO/IEC 18013-5の7.2.8項参照）。発行局はこのメカニズムを使用して、mDLにフィールドを追加できる。発行局は、発行局固有のデータを読み取る必要のあるmDL検証者に、このような追加名前空間を伝達する責任を負う。</p><p>注：ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、漁業免許証、健康証明書、水上バイク免許証など、mDL とは別のクレデンシャルの発行にも採用できる。</p><p></p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>今回はここまでです。次は４章です。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

The portrait image therefore needs to be of suitable quality for this purpose. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait to comply with Annex D of ISO/IEC 18013-2:2020, which in turn requires the portrait image to be at least 192 pixels wide and 240 pixels high. In addition, ISO/IEC 18013-2 requires portrait images intended for automated face recognition to comply with ISO/IEC 19794-5, which among other requirements requires 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes. However, it should be noted that these requirements were created in the context of storage on a physical card and in machine-readable formats with limited storage capacity compared to an mDL.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>肖像画像は、立会取引においてmDLを提示する人物とmDLを照合する主要な手段です。したがって、肖像画像はこの目的に適した品質である必要があります。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、肖像画がISO/IEC 18013-2:2020の附属書Dに準拠することを要求しており、この附属書Dは、肖像画が少なくとも幅192ピクセル、高さ240ピクセルであることを要求している。さらに、ISO/IEC 18013-2は、自動顔認識用の肖像画像について、ISO/IEC 19794-5に準拠することを要求しており、この要件では、特に目の中心間が90ピクセルであることが要求されています。ただし、これらの要件は、物理的なカードへの保存や、mDLに比べて保存容量が限られる機械読み取り可能なフォーマットでの保存を想定して作成されたものであることに留意する必要があります。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would therefore be possible to include a portrait image of much higher resolution in an mDL. Arguments for going this route include higher accuracy when using the portrait image as a probe image in 1:n biometric searching, and making it easier for a human to compare the portrait image with the mDL holder. Arguments against going this route include the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>従って、mDLにはるかに高解像度の肖像画像を含めることが可能である。この経路をとることへの賛成意見には、1:nの生体認証検索でプローブ画像として肖像画を使用する際の精度が高くなること、人間が肖像画とmDLの所持者を比較しやすくなることなどがあります。このルートに反対する意見には、以下のようなものがあります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. A larger portrait image can negatively affect mDL transaction times（より大きなポートレート画像は、mDLのトランザクション時間に悪影響を与える可能性があります）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2.&nbsp;A better-quality portrait image could arguably be less privacy preserving than a smaller portrait image.（より質の高いポートレート画像は、より小さなポートレート画像よりもプライバシーの保護に劣る可能性がある）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3.&nbsp;The primary purpose of the portrait image is a 1:1 match with the mDL holder. If this match is performed biometrically, the smaller portrait size should be sufficient.（肖像画像の主な目的は、mDLの所持者と1対1で照合することです。この照合が生体認証で行われる場合は、肖像画のサイズは小さくても十分です）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should carefully consider all these points when deciding on a portrait image size. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities opt for a smaller rather than for a larger portrait image.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、肖像画のサイズを決定する際、これらの点を慎重に考慮する必要があります。発行局は、大きな縦長画像よりも小さな縦長画像を選ぶことを推奨します。</p></blockquote><p>結構細かいレベルで顔写真の要件が決まっているんですね。</p><p><br></p><p>3.4.&nbsp;SIGNATURE IMAGE</p><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not prescribe anything other than that the image shall be in JPEG or JPEG2000 format. Building on the requirements for a signature image in ISO/IEC 18013-1 and in the AAMVA Card Design Standard, if present the signature image must be an accurate and recognizable representation of the original signature. Care should be given to image capture, processing, digitization, and compression.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、画像が JPEG または JPEG2000 フォーマットであること以外には何も規定していない。ISO/IEC 18013-1およびAAMVAカード設計基準における署名画像の要件に基づき、署名画像が存在す る場合は、元の署名を正確かつ認識可能な形で表現しなければならない。画像のキャプチャ、処理、デジタル化、および圧縮には注意を払う必要がある。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>3.5.&nbsp;MDL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS</p><blockquote><p>In line with recommendations from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, certain cryptographic constructs must not be supported for mDL solutions built in accordance with this document. At the same time, interoperability needs to be retained so mDL readers can successfully interact with an mDL originating from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>米国国立標準技術研究所（NIST）およびカナダ・サイバーセキュリティセンターの勧告に従い、この文書に従って構築されたmDLソリューションでは、特定の暗号構造をサポートしてはなりません。同時に、mDLリーダーが他の場所から発信されたmDLと正常にやり取りできるよう、相互運用性を維持する必要があります。</p>  To this end, the AAMVA mDL Implementation Guidelines require the following changes to be applied to ISO/IEC 18013-5:  </blockquote><blockquote><p>このため、AAMVA mDL実装ガイドラインでは、ISO/IEC 18013-5に以下の変更を適用することを要求している：</p></blockquote><p>ここも量が多いので割愛しますが、Cipher SuiteをNISTの要求に従って変更したりしていますので、他の国が単純にmdocだからISO/IEC 18013-5に従ってリーダーを実装してもAAMVAのmDLは読めないって言う状態になるんだろうなぁ。。。と思います。</p><p><br></p><p>ということでここまでです。３章がもう少しだけ続きます。</p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBEDtZGMY8KAvIcWmF_nr7Yae50KCINUkNzovO1xmrtAspfVN2sSwB2GfcvrW57NmqFULeLGPxOnGCZ84E-CSILP6uuEaHW9Rne1Adv0oXwwa3qzw7MXsdEf6PbeBw_42rQJwErsEYbxCQUt3k_3iCGGqOu_76BLge31-ltvFySpfSQ19FBewhEgHSYLcA"></a> <br>今回は２章のmDL Solution Overviewを見ていきます。<p></p><blockquote><p>An mDL can be described as leveraging a mobile device to transfer (or cause to be transferred) driver’s license information to an mDL verifier, who cryptographically authenticates the information using the Issuing
Authority’s public key. A visual rendering of a DL on a mobile device’s display (and which can be misused as a
“flash pass”) therefore does not qualify as an mDL (also see section 8).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL は、発行局の公開鍵を使用して情報を暗号的に検証する mDL検証者に運転免許証情報を転送する （または転送させる）ために、モバイル機器を活用するものと説明できる。したがって、モバイル機器のディスプレイ上に DL を視覚的に表示するもの（「フラッシュパス」として悪用される可能性があるもの）は、mDL として認められない（セクション 8 も参照）。</p></blockquote><p>スクショやオレオレはダメってことですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An mDL solution can be described in terms of the following three properties:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLソリューションは、以下の3つの性質で説明できる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Data retrieval method. The device retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the offline model) works without outside connectivity (for both the mDL holder’s device and the mDL reader) at the time the transaction takes place, thus requiring the mDL data to reside on the mDL holder’s device. Under the server retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the online model, and not to be confused with use of an mDL in an unattended transaction setting such as over the Internet) mDL data is retrieved in real time directly from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires an mDL to support device retrieval, and allows a device to additionally support server retrieval.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. データ検索方式。デバイス検索方式（オフラインモデルと呼ばれることもある）では、取引時に外部（mDL保持者のデバイスとmDLリーダーの両方）に接続することなく動作するため、mDLデータはmDL保持者のデバイスに存在する必要がある。サーバー検索方式（オンラインモデルと呼ばれることもあり、インターネット経由のような無人トランザクションでのmDLの使用と混同されないよう注意）では、mDLのデータは発行機関からリアルタイムで直接取得される。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、mDLがデバイスの検索をサポートすることを要求しており、さらにデバイスがサーバーの検索をサポートすることを認めている。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. Transaction type. An attended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are in close proximity to each other. The engagement mechanisms currently reflected in ISO/IEC 18013-5 (QR code, NFC) were selected to support such close proximity. An unattended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are not in close proximity, e.g. when an mDL holder wants to provide identity or proof of age to an online retailer. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support unattended transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. トランザクションの種類。対面型トランザクションとは、mDL保有者とmDL検証者が近接しているトランザクションのことである。現在ISO/IEC 18013-5に反映されているエンゲージメントの仕組み（QRコード、NFC）は、このような近接をサポートするために選択された。無人トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者と mDL 検証者が近接していないトランザクショ ンのことであり、たとえば、mDL 保持者がオンライン小売業者に ID または年齢証明を提供する場合などである。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は現在、無人トランザクションをサポートしていない。ただし、ソリューションを標準化する作業が進行中である。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Timing of (and responsibility for) matching. This property is about the responsibility for confirming, at transaction time, that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the mDL data. In a post-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL data is made after the mDL data is shared and is performed by the mDL verifier. This happens by comparing the portrait image in the mDL with the person presenting the mDL. ISO/IEC 18013-5 supports postmatched transactions. In a pre-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL is made right before the mDL data is shared. Although the Issuing Authority should not be involved in real time, the Issuing Authority does take responsibility for certifying the link. The mDL verifier receives only the confirmation that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the shared mDL data. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support pre-matched transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution (and notably one that does not involve the Issuing Authority at transaction time).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. 照合のタイミング（および責任）。このプロパティは、mDLデータの提示者がmDLデータに記述された本人であることをトランザクション時に確認する責任に関するものである。マッチング後のトランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLデータのリンクは、mDLデータが共有された後に行われ、mDL検証者によって実行される。これは、mDL内の肖像画像とmDL提示者を比較することで行われる。ISO/IEC 18013-5 はポストマッチトランザクションをサポートしている。事前照合トランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLのリンクは、mDLデータが共有される直前に行われる。発行局はリアルタイムで関与すべきではないが、発行局はリンクを認証する責任を負う。mDLの検証者は、mDLデータの提示者が共有されたmDLデータに記述された本人であることの確認のみを受ける。ISO/IEC 18013-5は現在、事前照合トランザクションをサポートしていない。しかし、（特にトランザクション時に発行局が関与しない）ソリューションを標準化するための作業が進行中である。</p></blockquote><p>デバイスリトリーバル、サーバーリトリーバルの２方式があること、対面、非対面のシナリオが定義されていること、そして検証者がHolderバインディングを行うことが求められている、ということです。本人確認書類として利用することを考えると当然ですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With this as background, Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the mDL ecosystem described in ISO/IEC 18013-5.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これを背景に、図1はISO/IEC 18013-5で説明されているmDLエコシステムのハイレベルな概要を示している。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjlRKfp1Zh0yZz5SYXLjnkGDTY3J4rdF0dFbsr3NDGiLK4sQllx_gBpLQHsCgRQRxq3QwFboS6_54Tsfqzw1afoJT3-iI95mHWXrXE1HDvhY2iQrpAAAGXYg3pJqyCIvz6fy5agtv-Rogt03J4w8gbf9HE00N3Rt1CVPCFDReQiQ4hrxKYZz-6_RBFRh_1U"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Three interactions are involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3つの相互作用が関係している：&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL. This interaction results in getting everything onto an mDL holder’s device that is needed to use the mDL. There is also subsequent interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL to keep the mDL information updated. Technical components of this interaction will be standardized in the ISO/IEC 23220 series.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. 発行局とmDLの間のインタラクション。このやりとりの結果、mDLを使用するために必要なすべての情報がmDLホルダーのデバイスに取り込まれます。また、発行局とmDLの間には、mDLの情報を更新するための相互作用があります。このインタラクションの技術的なコンポーネントは、ISO/IEC 23220シリーズで標準化される予定です。</p></blockquote><p>Issueの時の仕組みですね。OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuanceでもmdocを扱うことができますので、そちらを非対面のシナリオでは使うケースもありますが、ここではISO 23220が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2. Interaction between the mDL and the mDL reader infrastructure of the mDL verifier. This interaction comprises the transfer of technical information to set up a secure communication channel between the two parties, and the subsequent exchange of the driver’s license information (or of a point from where it can be retrieved) that the mDL holder agreed to share. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. mDLとmDL検証装置のmDL読み取りインフラ間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、両者間の安全な通信チャネルを設定するための技術情報の転送と、それに続く mDL 保持者が共有に同意した運転免許証情報（またはそれを取得できるポイント）の交換で構成される。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化する。</p></blockquote><p>こちらはPresentationの話ですね。こちらもOpenID for Verifiable Presentationでも対応ができる範囲です。ここではISO 18013-5での対応が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3. Interaction between the mDL reader infrastructure and the Issuing Authority. This interaction can be used for different purposes, depending on the data retrieval method involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Device retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier to obtain the public keys needed to authenticate mDL information. Such interaction can also involve an intermediary entity that aggregates and disseminates certificates. (In North America, AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service performs this function – see section 5.) Regardless, the mDL verifier must trust that the certificate truly comes from a valid Issuing Authority. This interaction does not need to occur at the time of an mDL transaction. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes a method supporting this interaction.  Server retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier for two purposes:   As in the case for the device retrieval method, to obtain the public key of the Issuing Authority  To pass to the Issuing Authority, in real time, a token that identifies the mDL holder and the mDL, and to receive the actual mDL information back from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. mDLリーダーインフラと発行局との間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、関係するデータ検索方法に応じて、異なる目的で使用することができる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  デバイスの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL 検証者が mDL 情報の検証に必要な公開鍵を取得するために使用される。このようなインタラクションには、証明書を集約し普及させる仲介エンティティが関与することもできる。(北米では、AAMVA のデジタル・トラスト・サービスがこの機能を果たす。） いずれにせよ、mDLの検証者は、証明書が本当に有効な発行機関から発行されたものであることを信頼しなけれ ばならない。この相互作用は、mDLのトランザクション時に発生する必要はない。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、この相互作用をサポートする方法を完全に標準化している。  サーバーの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL検証者によって2つの目的で使用される：   デバイス検索方式と同様に、発行局の公開鍵を取得する。  mDLの所有者とmDLを識別するトークンをリアルタイムで発行局に渡し、実際のmDL情報を発行局から受け取ること。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化している。   <p></p></blockquote><p>ここはデバイスリトリーバルなのかサーバーリトリーバルなのかで異なりますが、mDLリーダーがIssuerへの問い合わせを行うケースについて記載されていますね。いわゆるDIDを使ったVCとの大きな違いはIssuing Authorityが完全に中央集権であることかと思います。（免許なので当然ですね）そのため、検証用の公開鍵を取得する場合は堂々とVerifierからIssuerへのインタラクションが発生しています。（ここは若干プライバシーとのトレードオフはありますが）&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Note that ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies system interfaces and a certificate exchange method, and on purpose does not address the user interface (e.g. the look, feel and functionality of an mDL app residing on an mDL holder’s device). It is left up to Issuing Authorities (and their implementers) to innovate in this area.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5は、システム・インターフェースと証明書交換方法を規定するものであり、ユーザ・イン ターフェース（例えば、mDL保有者のデバイスに常駐するmDLアプリのルック、フィール、機能性）については、 意図的に触れていないことに留意されたい。この分野での技術革新は、発行局（およびその実装者）に委ねられている。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>ということで、本日はここまで。</p><p><br></p>

  こんにちは、富士榮です。    先日、用語を見たついでにAAMVAが出しているMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4を読んでいこうと思います。          こちらが原文です。     まずはIntroductionから。   The AAMVA Joint Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Working Group (WG) has been active around mobile identification since 2012. As the mDL evolves, the mDL WG continues to identify and address topics on which guidance to Issuing Authorities can be helpful. T

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先日、<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/blog-post.html">用語を見た</a>ついでにAAMVAが出しているMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4を読んでいこうと思います。  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjSCs0hVWK7schMxMWxX_jNjarDUUlvDhZPWDkVuJSY_CSHh2gdAgW92RcC-0unJodQBwWYdiJj7Inhz0_So2plM4W9fRQ0xb8dQGFtcXoezjCup5Wn5ll9BxKRxVBW0D-UzCxiuZkmyzJFZXWQb-F6IyfGlYGctpLzkUPnQdVb0mzDjvVKfT_wMRMtF1H"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">こちら</a>が原文です。  <br>  まずはIntroductionから。 <blockquote> The AAMVA Joint Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Working Group (WG) has been active around mobile identification since 2012. As the mDL evolves, the mDL WG continues to identify and address topics on which guidance to Issuing Authorities can be helpful. This document represents the bulk of the current guidance, and points to additional resources as needed. </blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA 合同モバイル運転免許証（mDL）ワーキンググループ（WG）は、2012 年以来、モバイル ID を中心に活動してきました。mDL の進化に伴い、mDL WG は、発行機関へのガイダンスが役立つトピックを特定し、対処し続けています。この文書は、現在のガイダンスの大部分を示し、必要に応じて追加のリソースを示します。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The goal of this document is to inform and equip Issuing Authorities, and to some extent mDL verifiers, to achieve the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この文書の目的は、発行局、そしてある程度mDLの検証者に対し、以下のことを達成するための情報を提供し、装備させることです：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Technical interoperability between different Issuing Authorities’ mDL programs, i.e., an Issuing Authority being able to read an mDL issued by any other Issuing Authority.  Trust in different Issuing Authorities’ mDLs.  Privacy preserving implementations.&nbsp;  異なる発行局のmDLプログラム間の技術的な相互運用性。つまり、発行局は他の発行局が発行したmDLを読むことができる。  異なる発行局のmDLに対する信頼性  プライバシーの保護  <p></p></blockquote><p>まずは目的からですが、アメリカでは州ごとに免許証を発行しているため、相互運用性は非常に重要になってくる、というところだと思います。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It is up to Issuing Authorities to determine the extent to which the guidance in this document is followed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the minimum measures deemed necessary to achieve the above are labeled as mandatory requirements in this document (i.e. “shall” or “must”). A summary of minimum measures can be found in Appendix B.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書のガイダンスにどの程度従うかは、発行当局の判断に委ねられます。とはいえ、上記を達成するために必要とみなされる最低限の対策は、本文書では必須要件（すなわち「しなければならない」または「しなければならない」）と表示されています。最小限の措置の要約は付録Bに記載されています。</p></blockquote><p>先にも書いた通り、州ごとに発行しているのでこのガイドラインの強制力も一定程度にとどまる感じなんですね。確かに後半に出てくるリテンション期間の話や複数枚数の発行の可否などはかなり現場に判断を委ねているところもあります。このあたりは念頭に読み進める必要がありそうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The following topics are outside the scope of this document:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下のトピックは本文書の範囲外です：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The identity establishment, management and recordkeeping that precedes the creation of an identity credential.  Responsibilities of mDL verifiers.&nbsp;  </blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  ID クレデンシャルの作成に先立つ、ID の確立、管理、および記録管理。  mDL 検証者の責任。  </blockquote><p>あくまでmDLの発行と管理に関するところがスコープっぽいですね。</p><blockquote><p>This document leverages and expands on ISO/IEC 18013-51 (also available as INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5), an international mDL standard. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies an mDL solution, it was intentionally designed to support any type of mobile identity credential. ISO/IEC 18013-5, as qualified in this document, will therefore enable Issuing Authorities to issue both mobile driver’s licenses and mobile identification cards.</p><p>The term “mDL” as used in this document covers both credential types. Qualifications made in this document also allow for identifying an mDL as being REAL ID compliant or not, and/or as a credential issued under the Enhanced Driver’s License program (“EDL”; see the AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書は、国際 mDL 標準である ISO/IEC 18013-5（INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5 としても利用可能）を活用し拡張したものです。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は mDL ソリューションを規定していますが、意図的にあらゆるタイプのモバイル ID クレデンシャルをサポートするように設計されています。このため、本文書で規定する ISO/IEC 18013-5 により、発行機関はモバイル運転免許証とモバイル ID カードの両方を発行できるようになります。</p><p>本文書で使用する「mDL」という用語は、両方のクレデンシャル・タイプをカバーします。この文書で行われる認定は、mDL を REAL ID 準拠かどうか、および／または拡張運転免許証プログラム（「EDL」；AAMVA DL/ID カード設計基準参照）の下で発行されたクレデンシャルとし て識別することも可能にします。</p></blockquote><p>本書はISO/IEC 18013-5がベースであり、モバイル運転免許証とモバイルIDカードの両方を対象に書かれている、というところが肝ですね。そしてやはりリアルID法に関しても視野に入っています。</p><blockquote><p>Additional guidance on mDL administration in the areas of legislation and procurement can be found in two other documents produced by the mDL Working Group. Those are the mDL Model Legislation, and the mDL Procurement Guidance (see the jurisdictional member area on the AAMVA website). AAMVA also conducts regular outreach to stakeholders on the topic of mDL, including town hall meetings, podcasts, and training.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLに関する法律や調達に関するガイダンスは、mDLワーキンググループが作成した2つの文書に記載されています。これらは、「mDLモデル法案」と「mDL調達ガイダンス」です（AAMVAウェブサイトの管轄メンバーエリアを参照）。AAMVAはまた、タウンホールミーティング、ポッドキャスト、トレーニングなど、mDLに関するステークホルダーへの定期的な働きかけも行っています。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It should be noted that mDL and related technologies are ever evolving. As a result, this document will continue to be updated to synchronize its content with the latest standards and practices. For this reason, readers of this document are encouraged to periodically check the AAMVA website for new versions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLと関連技術は常に進化しています。そのため、本書は最新の基準や慣行と内容を同期させるために更新され続けます。このため、本書の読者は、定期的にAAMVAのウェブサイトで新バージョンを確認することが推奨されます。</p><p></p></blockquote><p>AAMVAのウェブサイトを見ると色々な情報が掲載されていますので、このガイドライン以外にも参照すべき情報は多そうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>As a follow-up to the JSONPath module and playground I released <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/go-jsonpath-playground/" title="Introducing RFC 9535 Go JSONPath and Playground">last month</a>,
I’m happy to announce the follow-up project, called JSONTree. I’ve implemented
it in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package, and built a <a href="https://webassembly.org" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a>-powered
browser <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">playground</a> for it.</p>
 JSONTree? 
<p>While a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> query selects and returns an array of values from
the end of a path expression, a JSONTree compiles multiple JSONPath queries
into a single query that selects values from multiple path expressions. It
returns results not as an array, but as a subset of the query input,
preserving the paths for each selected value.</p>
<p>In other words, it compiles multiple paths into a single tree of selection
paths, and preserves the tree structure of the input. Hence JSONTree.</p>
 Example 
<p>Consider this JSON:</p>
  <code>{

</code>  <p>Note that the original data structure remains, but only for the subset of the
structure selected by the JSONPath queries.</p>
 Use Cases 
<p>A couple of use cases drove the conception and design of JSONPath.</p>
 Permissions 
<p>Consider an application in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list" title="Wikipedia: Access-control list">ACL</a>s define permissions for groups of users
to access specific branches or fields of JSON documents. When delivering a
document, the app would:</p>
 
 Fetch the groups the user belongs to 
 Convert the permissions from each into JSONPath queries 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into an JSONTree query 
 Select and return the permitted subset of the document to the user 
 
 Selective Indexing 
<p>Consider a searchable document storage system. For large or complex documents,
it may be infeasible or unnecessary to index the entire document for full-text
search. To index a subset of the fields or branches, one would:</p>
 
 Define JSONPaths the fields or branches to index 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into a JSONTree query 
 Select and submit only the specified subset of each document to the
indexing system 
 
 Go Example 
<p>Use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package together with
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a> to compile and execute JSONTree queries:</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
	"github.com/theory/jsontree"
)

func main() {
	// JSON as unmarshaled by encoding/json.
	value := map[string]any{
		"name":  "Barrack Obama",
		"years": "2009-2017",
		"emails": []any{
			"potus@example.com",
			"barrack@example.net",
		},
	}

	// Compile multiple JSONPaths into a JSONTree.
	tree := jsontree.New(
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.name"),
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.emails[1]"),
	)

	// Select from the input value.
	js, err := json.Marshal(tree.Select(value))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", tree.Select(value))
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>{"emails":["barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>  <p>Note that the index position of the selected email was not preserved. Replace
<code>New</code> with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree#NewFixedModeTree" title="github.com/theory/jsontree: NewFixedModeTree"><code>NewFixedModeTree</code></a> to create a “fixed mode” JSONTree that
preserves index positions by filling gaps with <code>null</code>s. Its output of the
above example would be:</p>
  <code>{"emails":[null,"barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>   Status 
<p>The public interface of the <code>jsontree</code> module is quite minimal and stable. But
I suspect there may remain some flaws in the merging of JSONPath selectors.
Please report bugs via <a href="https://github.com/theory/jsontree/issues/" title="theory/jsontree: Issues">GitHub issues</a> and I’ll get them fixed up ASAP.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please share and enjoy!</p>

Web security, symbolized<p>Monty Pythons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnciwwsvNcc">parrot sketch</a> is an all time classic because it plays on a very human experience of being defenseless when someone is just blatantly refusing to acknowledge the obvious. Shared reality is a matter of perception, not objective observation. Supported also by various mental biases, including the sunk cost fallacy, and the desire to agree with people we perceive as sympathetic or competent, virtually all humans can fall into this trap. Technical experts on Self Sovereign Identity included.</p><p>Instead of recognizing that the parrot of Web security is deceased, has gone to meet its maker, is pushing up the daisies, some people keep insisting that it is merely napping, and use trinkets and all kinds of strings and wires to hold it&nbsp;up.</p><p>The result is did:tdw, recently rebranded to did:webvh.</p> Web based DID methods belong to the family of federated identity methods, not Self Sovereign Identity <p>Using the web for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) violates some of the basic principles of Self Sovereign Identity, and effectively restricts the possible properties of the system to that of a classic federated identity protocol, such as&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>Federated identity systems have their uses, and are often “good enough” for usage by large corporations and governments. But they also enable and encourage platform strategies, which has dramatic implications for personal usage, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The result has been the Surveillance Industry, and a dependency of 95% of our economy on a few, large platform companies.</p><blockquote>Self Sovereign Identity has been developed as a concept to break that dependency, and give people control over their own privacy, security and data. Instead, thanks to did:web and its descendants, it increasingly looks like an exercise of putting SSI lipstick on the pig of the federated Web.</blockquote><p>You may think this is just hyperbole. So let’s go back to the beginning.</p> About the principles of&nbsp;SSI <p>The design goals of Decentralized Identifiers are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#design-goals">Section 1.2 of the W3C DID specificaton</a>:</p>W3C DID: Design goals for Decentralized Identifiers (DID)<p>So how well do Web based DID methods meet these&nbsp;goals?</p><p>All web based methods, including did:web, did:tdw, did:webvh, and any other web based method anyone might ever come up with depend on a domain name pointing to a web server. The method specific identifier is always being transformed into a HTTPS request. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/next/#the-did-to-https-transformation">DID to HTTPS Transformation</a> is the same for did:webvh as it is for&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#method-specific-identifier">did:web</a>.</p><p>Reaching the correct web server is therefore contingent on access control by the administrator of the web server, the security of the web server, the longevity of the organization operating the web server, the Certificate Authority issuing the certificates identifying the web server, the configuration of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) parameters, and the Domain Name System to identify which web server to&nbsp;contact.</p><p>Users have two&nbsp;choices:</p>  Operate their own web server,&nbsp;or  Use the web server of some organization that provides them their “decentralized” identifier.  <p>The former is the “let them eat cake” of modern technologies.</p><p>Despite many people working for decades to make self-hosting easier and more attractive, self-hosting has been declining. But even if we reverted that trend and enabled and motivated people to self-host with some amazing self-hosting offers: How hard would it be to correlate did:tdw:QmfGEUAcMpzo25kF2Rhn8L5FAXysfGnkzjwdKoNPi615XQ:petermueller.ch to did:tdw:QmdfTbBqBPQ7VNxZEYEj14VmRuZBkqFbiwReogJgS1zR1n:petermueller.ch&nbsp;?</p><p>How difficult would it be to figure out these might both belong to the same person, whose name might be Peter Müller? Especially considering that the web server at petermueller.ch presents a certificate that lists the owner of the certificate to be a “Peter Müller”, and the whois record for the domain lists his full name, address and phone&nbsp;number?</p><p>Which brings us to the second choice, above, which is today’s reality for most people in a federated identity world: Trust the platform intermediary.</p><p>How much decentralization is there in Apple Mail? How decentralized are today’s Certificate Authorities? How much privacy and control do users of Gmail have? How secure are today’s web services? How well does today’s world fare in terms of data protection from compromise and loss? How good is today’s Web security?</p><blockquote>In reality, Web based DID methods give up on Decentralization, Control, Privacy and Security to the same level that today’s federated identity solutions have given up on&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>They use protocols like OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VC &amp; OIDC4VP) because they ARE OpenID methods. Which is why if use cases building on top of Web based DIDs were using truth in labelling, they would inform their users about being based on&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>But much of the technology world thrives on buzzwords and hypes, and too often, the technical reality is obfuscated by layers of technical complexity and marketing. So the market rarely penalises false advertising.</p>did:web(vh), EV&nbsp;edition<p>Using the Web for “Decentralized” Identifiers and advertising it as revolutionary SSI technology is a bit like selling an “Electric Vehicle” that avoids all the complexities of battery development by using a diesel generator on a towed trailer to power the car. Yes, the propulsion is now electric.</p><p>But is the end result fundamentally better than a diesel&nbsp;car?</p> But what about the added security? <p>When reading about did:webvh, one could get the impression a lot of security is being added. In reality, it's mostly added complexity because everything goes over a single channel, the same one that is being used by did:web, as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>It adds security in the same way that web sites get more secure if you ask users to enter not a single password, but three passwords, subsequently, in the correct&nbsp;order.</blockquote><p>There is a reason no-one does that. Three passwords are not fundamentally more secure, because there is no additional channel. Add a real second factor, and security actually goes up. Which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</a> has been invented.</p><p>Most likely the Web based DID methods can be developed to the point they will provide actual MFA security at a similar level to today’s federated identity protocols. Maybe did:webvh is even close to that&nbsp;point.</p><blockquote>But that only makes it just as secure as “Login with Google”, today. And it does nothing to make it meet the SSI criteria of Decentralization, Control and&nbsp;Privacy.</blockquote><p>Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this parrot is not just a heavy&nbsp;sleeper.</p> Embrace, Extend, Extinguish <p>So what’s the problem if some people like did:web and its relatives? As long as we are aware of the limitations, and never use it for systems that are supposed to be used in production by end users or SMEs, there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;did:web.</p><p>As I’ve written in a <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/coming-full-circle-how-self-sovereign-identity-could-lose-its-way-069b480c4399">previous article,</a> it’s really useful for rapid prototyping, and can be used as a placeholder during experimentation before switching to a real Decentralized Identifier. We’ve done so ourselves when <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a> has been working on Proof of Concept for the Swiss health sector in 2023. But once we started working on the production system in 2024, we switched to an Autonomous Identifier (AID) that meets the definition of Self Sovereign Identity.</p><p>The problem starts when people put Web based identifiers into production.</p><p>Not only is it an issue of misleading users with false promises of decentralization, control, privacy and security. It runs much deeper than that. Increasing adoption of Web based identifiers under the moniker of Self Sovereign Identity makes it impossible for actual Self Sovereign Identity to differentiate itself from federated identity protocols. It sucks the air out of the room for actual&nbsp;SSI.</p><blockquote>At a technology strategy level, adoption of Web based identifiers makes SSI susceptible to something it was originally designed to prevent: Platform&nbsp;capture.</blockquote>Depiction of did:web(vh) being welcomed by Self Sovereign Identity community<p>Whether accidentally or by design, the movement for Web based identifiers perfectly executes a strategy coined by Microsoft in the 90s, labelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>. I’ve gotten to study that particular script extensively when coordinating the technical and communication activities of the <a href="https://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> around the EU Microsoft <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.en.html">antitrust case</a> in order to obtain much needed interoperability information for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.</p><p>The script is not super complicated. First, become a champion of Self Sovereign Identity, embrace it visibly, participate in the conferences, champion it at the political level. Then come up with ideas to extend it, for instance by proposing to speed up adoption by falling back on “proven”” technologies from the Web. Provided enough Kool-Aid, nobody might notice that it violates the principles of SSI and you’ll find many willing participants.</p><p>And lastly, once it has become the dominant flavour to however misleadingly claim the label Self Sovereign Identity, extinguish what is left in terms of actual SSI by aggressively using your economic and political might to push a platform play to suck the air out of the market. While Sovrin had its issues, including political, it undoubtedly lived up to all the SSI principles. Recently, the Sovrin Foundation announced that it was <a href="https://idtechwire.com/the-community-moved-on-sovrin-announces-mainnets-likely-shutdown/">shutting down in March 2025</a> due to its community moving to the&nbsp;Web.</p> So, what’s&nbsp;left? <p>Microsoft had originally championed did:ion, a fully Self Sovereign Identifier based on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> specification. But as of 2023, it unsurprisingly also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/verified-id/verifiable-credentials-faq#does-microsoft-entra-verified-id-support-ion-as-its-did-method">switched to did:web</a>. Old habits die hard. Other large tech platforms are also pushing in the same direction, as are several of the former governmental monopolists with strong political ties, such as T-Systems.</p><p>The most promising design for a decentralized identifier is the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, and at conceptual level it solves some very hard problems that no other method even attempts to address. The problem is how long it has been the promising next thing, without achieving sufficient adoption, and without finding its way into the regulatory documents in the European Union <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS (for “electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services”)</a> working group, which is strongly pushing in the direction of Web based identifiers.</p><blockquote>Unsurprisingly, technical experts have raised <a href="https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/key-vulnerabilities-of-eudi-arf">security</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/200">privacy</a> concerns. In fact, it seems the current draft of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)</a> may be in violation of the EU privacy provisions it is supposed to&nbsp;provide.</blockquote><p>Also, and it’s already been a topic in the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/dice-2024-retrospective-b20372f13a65">DICE2024 retrospective</a>, KERI is currently available in Python only. Which leaves adoption hamstrung. Not everyone in the KERI community agrees with that, but I’m aware of a number of people and initiatives who would love to adopt KERI, but not in Python. And its completeness as a concept puts the effort required for implementation in another language outside what is feasible for any of these parties individually.</p><p>So, when looking at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/#comparison-of-did-methods">W3C DID Traits</a> draft, the table looks pretty bleak, with two actual SSI methods left on it: did:key and did:peer. Both limited in relation to quite a few use&nbsp;cases.</p> What we ended up&nbsp;doing… <p>We anticipated this picture when designing our use case and solution for the Swiss health sector back in January 2024. The Web identifiers were obvious non-starters, as were did:key and did:peer, due to them being overly limited for our&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We also did not like the idea of putting Python into a mission critical production application for large number of users. Especially since we did not want to put Python on the phone, and also did not want remote wallets that do not actually live on the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>So we did what XKCD told us <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">not to do</a>. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p>

<p>BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have not done this very often in our history. We accused the Myanmar military of genocidal acts against the Rohingya in 2017, and we found full-blown genocide against the Kurds in Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaign in Iraq in the ’80s — sorry, in the ’90s, and we found genocide against — also in Rwanda in the ’80s. It is, you know, an extremely difficult crime to prove. It is, you know, mass killing deliberately to destroy people because they’re part of the group, not something we level lightly, but, yes, we found it here.</p>

<p>先程、OpenID Foundatiion の理事選挙(2025)に立候補いたしました。メンバーの各位におかれましては、ぜひ推薦 (second)お願いできればと思います。</p>



<p>選挙のページは <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/61">https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/61</a> です。</p>



<p>以下は、立候補にあたってのステートメントです。原文は英語ですが、日本語訳を載せておきます。</p>



 



<p>私は過去25年にわたってデジタルアイデンティティとプライバシーに深く関わってきました。OpenID Connect、JWT、JWS、OAuth PKCE、FAPIなど、多くの標準規格の共同著者でもあります。</p>



<p>私の一貫したテーマは「Power to the People（人々へ力を）」- デジタルアイデンティティによって人々に自己コントロールを取り戻す力を与えることです。</p>



<p>2008年にOpenID Foundation Japan（OIDF-J）を設立し、2011年からはOpenID Foundation（OIDF）の理事長を務めています。また、Open Identity Exchange（OIX）やKantara Initiativeの設立にも携わりました。日本の様々な政府委員会のメンバーを務め、ISO/IEC SC27「セキュリティ、サイバーセキュリティ、プライバシー」の日本国内委員会の委員長も務めています。また、IETF WG、特にOAuth WGにも貢献しています。現在はNAT Consultingの代表社員を務めています。</p>



<p>OpenID Foundationでの活動における主な成果は以下の通りです：</p>



 
 AB/Connect WGを立ち上げ、OpenID Connect Core 1.0および関連標準を作成 



 デジタル署名と暗号化スキームの作業を開始し、JWS、JWE、JWTとして結実 



 FAPI WGを立ち上げ、FAPI 1.0を作成。これは英国オープンバンキング、米国Financial Data Exchange、オーストラリアConsumer Data Standards、ブラジルオープンファイナンスなど、国際コミュニティに採用または推奨されました 



 スウェーデンのウメオ大学とテストスイートの作業を開始し、これが後にOpenID認証プログラムとなりました。認証プログラムの採用はFAPIにより過去4年間で大きく加速し、現在1000以上の実装が認証されています 



 国際的にOpenID(R)商標を確保するなど、IPR体制を整理・合理化 



 人々がWGを立ち上げるためにOpenID Foundationに参加することを奨励・支援：アクティブなWGの数は13に増加し、幅広い業界ニーズに対応 



 対面ミーティング、カンファレンスでの講演、ブログ投稿、YouTubeチャンネルなどを通じてOpenID Connectと関連技術を国際的に普及させ、主流プロトコルとしました 



 ISO、ITU-T、OECDなど他の国際機関との積極的な連携関係を開始し、OpenID Foundationにリエゾン委員会を設立 



 米国、欧州、日本、ラテンアメリカでOpenID関連イベントの開催を支援 
 



<p>アイデンティティ管理には新しいアーキテクチャアプローチが出現しています：特に、ウォレット中心のアプローチ、アイデンティティメタデータ交換、継続的認証とイベント共有が注目されています。OpenID Foundationはそのような環境に影響を与える仕様の準備に努めてきました。例えば：</p>



 
 OpenID for VPとSIOP v.2 



 OpenID Federation 



 OpenID for Identity Assurance 



 CAEPとRISC 



 FAPI 2 



 AuthZEN 



 IPSIE 
 



<p>これらはまだ完成していませんが、着実に進展しています。今後は、ワーキンググループの議長とワーキンググループを支援して、仕様の開発を加速させていく予定です。</p>



<p>同時に、アイデンティティ管理とAPI保護のベストプラクティスについて、新しい市場要件を探り、市場教育を続けていきます。これはGAINやDADEなどのコミュニティグループ活動にも見られます。</p>



<p>私のモットーは「Listen, Observe, Coordinate, and Be Proactive（聞く、観察する、調整する、そして先を見据えて行動する）」です。この分野の志を同じくする全ての人々と共に「オープンアイデンティティ」をさらに推進するため、皆様の投票をお願いいたします。共に力を合わせれば、世界に影響を与え、それを実現することができます。</p>

  こんにちは、富士榮です。    こちらにも書いた通り、11月にAAMVAからMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelineの1.4がでました。  https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/mobile-drivers-licensemdl.html          読んでいてそういえば一般的じゃない言葉ばっかり使ってるよなぁ、と思うのでまずはTerminologyを見ておきましょう。         そもそも論のAAMVAです。    American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators   の略ですね。米国自動車管理者協会と訳されるようです。この辺の資料によると。&nbsp;     EDL。enhanced driver licenseの略ですね。日本語だと

If you have interesting experiences or stories to share, here are <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-guest-article/">details on how to express interest</a>.</p> 2. Tech in 2024 <p>We tracked the tech industry’s pulse closely, all year; here are some standout trends:</p><p>Focus on efficiency due to higher interest rates. This year’s mega trend was the final demise of zero percent interest rates, after more than a decade. In a higher interest rate environment, companies cut back on spending, investors allocate less to venture capital, and it’s harder for tech companies to raise funding.</p><p>As a result, there’s less hiring, some tech companies downsize, and the job market’s tougher for software engineers. The good news is that we saw this before during the Dotcom Bust and the global financial crisis; in both cases, things got better over time. We <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">analyzed this mega trend and its implications.</a></p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4863a5-c77c-492e-aaaa-86dc7e038271_1456x794.png">          </a>Interest rates were at or below 1% in the US between 2008 to 2022. From <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp-software-engineers">The end of 0% interest rates</a> <p>GenAI frenzy. ChatGPT launched two years ago in November 2022, and in 2024 it continued to take the tech industry, and society at large, by storm. The end of zero interest rates meant that VC investment in tech dropped, but that was counterbalanced by the magnetic appeal of LLMs and AI.</p><p>This year, OpenAI <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/149770356/openai-biggest-ever-fundraise-as-key-people-keep-quitting">raised</a> a record-breaking $6.6B in funding (an all-time record that was broken just this week by Databricks <a href="https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raising-10b-series-j-investment-62b-valuation">raising</a> $10B.) In 2024, the single best way to raise VC funding was to be an AI startup. Predictably, non-AI tech startups looking for the next round of funding are increasingly pivoting to AI because not doing so makes this harder.</p><p>LLMs to change software engineering. Has there ever been such rapid adoption of a new technology, as with GenAI coding tools? In our mid-2024 survey, more than 75% of engineers shared that they <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024?utm_source=publication-search">use GenAI tools for work</a>. ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot each had more mentions than all other AI coding tools combined.</p><p>But dev tooling seems to be changing rapidly. Cursor, Windsurf, and Zed, are all new IDEs that are <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ide-that-software-engineers-love">gaining momentum</a>; and Cursor <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ide-that-software-engineers-love">might have surpassed</a> GitHub Copilot usage, at least for now. There’s also <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">coding AI agents</a> that are becoming the next wave of innovation, with a race between startups to build the first “hit” AI coding agent, with Cognition AI’s Devin <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/153029265/devin-doubles-down-as-ai-software-engineer">the current frontrunner</a>.</p><p>In five years’ time, most software engineers will use IDEs and dev tools that will be packed with GenAI-powered functionality. The race is on as to which tool that will be; meaning more innovation and experimentation to come. It’s rare to see so many startups having a shot at unseating the incumbent, Microsoft, which has an unfair distribution and pricing advantage, and will seek to protect market share in this key segment.</p><p>GenAI is impacting hiring. LLMs are clearly changing software engineering hiring, both in how hiring processes work, and in that junior engineering positions are harder to find. GenAI tools are frequently likened in effectiveness to an intern or junior engineer. With higher interest rates, less recruitment, and more senior engineers available for hire than before; most companies will likely opt to hire senior engineers who produce more with these GenAI tools.</p><p>I predict entry-level hiring will increase, but entry-level engineers will be expected to use GenAI coding tools, and get to the senior level faster than before. We analyzed more in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-genai-changes-tech-hiring">How GenAI is reshaping tech hiring.</a></p><p>Some fundamentals will not change. GenAI has a speedy pace we’ve not seen in tech for decades. However, it’s not the first drastic change; industry legend Grady Booch recalled how in the 1970 and 80s, the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architecture-with-grady-booch">shift from mainstream computers to distributed computing</a> was similarly fundamental, with many “old school” mainframe programmers struggling to adapt. In our <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architecture-with-grady-booch">conversation with Grady</a>, he sees GenAI as another tool that lowers the barrier for building software, but which doesn’t fundamentally change engineering practices or software architecture.</p><p>This year, the Pragmatic Engineer harked back to the dawn of software engineering with the 50-year-old classic engineering book, The Mythical Man Month. In half a century of computing plenty has changed, especially <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mythical-man-month-part-3">around developer productivity</a>. But some things have not: estimating software projects <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mythical-man-month-part-3">remains challenging</a>, prototyping is still <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mythical-man-month-part-3">a good way to start projects</a>, and communication <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-changed-in-50-years-of-computing-8d0">remains a massive challenge</a> in large teams.</p><p>Software engineering will evolve with GenAI, but I don’t foresee the fundamentals of what makes a standout software engineer being turned upside down. I also expect more demand for standout engineers, not less.</p> 3. Evolution of the Pragmatic Engineer newsletter <p>Just as the software engineering field is evolving, we also keep iterating and tweaking how to help you stay on top of this fast-moving field. Here are the biggest changes you might have noticed this year.</p><p>More “pragmatic” research. This year, we published more in-depth articles based on practical industry research than in any year before. I say “we” because this year <a href="https://linktr.ee/hejelin">Elin Nilsson</a> joined the publication as Tech Industry Researcher. Like me, Elin is a software engineer; having spent seven years at Spotify in mobile and platform engineering teams.</p><p>Without Elin’s efforts, some popular deep dive articles might have not happened, including:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-genai-changes-tech-hiring">How GenAI is reshaping tech hiring</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/genz-part-2">What GenZ devs really think</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky">How Bluesky was built</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky-engineering-culture">what the engineering culture is like</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-2024">AI tooling for software engineers: reality check</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bug-management-that-works-part-1">Bug management that works</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tooling-part-3">Rolling out AI dev tooling, company-wide</a></p>  <p>… and others</p>  <p>It’s great to have Elin on the team. With double the firepower on research, you can expect to see more of this kind of practical, and deeply interesting research and deepdives to come. You can also suggest to us <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevQ19GAbu3J2spvheCx_xVF4myROgSKatkg_GwAl-lsKcLsQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">interesting areas that could be worth researching</a>.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ade4686-1cb5-4a3e-8881-c1044b050da5_1456x909.png">          </a>“Agent Computer Interface” (ACI) that’s becoming an important part of all GenAI agents. From the deep dive ​​<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-coding-agents">How do AI software engineering agents really work?</a> <p>The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast has been a major addition to our content output. Long-time readers may remember in-depth interviews, such as:</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platforms-with-ganesh-srinivasan">Platform teams with Ganesh Srinivasan</a> (then-Chief Product and Tech Officer of Confluent)</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/platform-teams-with-adam-rogal">Developer productivity with Adam Rogal</a> (director of developer platform at DoorDash)</p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/steve-yegge">Developer tools with Steve Yegge</a> (then-head of engineering at Sourcegraph)</p>  <p>These interviews were a lot of fun to record, and I transcribed them into written articles. But I remember thinking it was a pity that people could hear the conversations, so I’d always had the idea that something like a podcast would be good. In the end, , who writes the excellent <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/">Lenny's Newsletter</a>, gave me the final push to launch the Pragmatic Engineer podcast when we grabbed coffee in the Bay Area. Thank you!</p><p>In the short time since the pod started, it has hosted industry legend <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architecture-with-grady-booch">Grady Booch</a> (co-creator of UML, a software architecture pioneer, and fellow at IBM), one of the best-known software engineers experimenting with GenAI, Simon <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-tools-for-software-engineers-simon-willison">Willison</a> (co-creator of Django), <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/notion-going-native-on-ios-and-android">Notion’s first native iOS and Android engineer</a>, and many other interesting guests. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/podcast">See all episodes here.</a></p><p>Like the newsletter, the podcast focuses on software engineering at Big Tech, startups, and elsewhere.

Examples include <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-genai-changes-tech-hiring">how GenAI is reshaping tech hiring</a>, how some startups <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ide-that-software-engineers-love">could be successfully challenging GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code</a>, the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-eng-market-2024">split of remote software engineering jobs shrinking</a>, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-65">longer hiring processes for engineering managers</a>, and <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/early-trends/">more</a>.</p><p>Major news orgs don’t report many of the topics we cover – likely because they’re specific to software engineering – or they cover them months after this publication; for example, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fewer-middle-managers-corporate-america-hiring-slump-gen-x-retirement-2024-12">reported</a> on shrinking middle management a full 18 months after <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-38">we first analyzed the trend</a>.</p> 4. The Software Engineer’s Guidebook  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F043e9974-42a9-4e8e-820b-2601a64e4eef_800x800.png">          </a>Source: PayPal engineering manager, Nabil Safatli, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7268243899259781122-ECVI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">shares his book review on LinkedIn</a> <p>I published <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a> a year ago, after four years of writing it. Originally, I hoped to publish with a well-known publishing house. However, my pitch was rejected by two tech book publishers, and significant edits were requested by a third, which I believed would “dumb down” the book, by adding features like “word of the day” and examples involving Alice and Bob.</p><p>I decided to write the book according to my original plan, and self-publish it. I did not share this at the time, but deep down I was concerned: what if the publishers were right, and there was no demand for this type of book? It’s more of a reference book than one to be read in one go, cover to cover. It’s intended to serve as a way to help “debug” your career, topic by topic; be it figuring out how to improve at software architecture, or hitting the next career level at a scaleup or Big Tech.</p><p>In the end, demand was far higher than I anticipated. Just over 33,000 copies were sold in the first 12 months. A detailed breakdown:</p>  <p>87% print sales (around 29,000)</p>  <p>13% e-books (circa 4,500)</p>  <p>Where most people bought the e-book:</p>  <p>Kindle (55%)</p>  <p><a href="https://gergelyorosz.gumroad.com/l/engguidebook">From my online store</a>, DRM-free (40%)</p>  <p>Apple iBooks (3%)</p>  <p>Google Play (1%)</p>  <p>Kobo (1%)</p>  <p>I was pleasantly surprised to see direct purchases so high, compared to Kindle. This is especially true as Amazon takes 65% of the book purchase price, <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineers-guidebook-audiobook?">thanks to its monopolistic pricing</a> practices.</p><p>Countries with the most purchases, in order: US, Germany, UK, India, Canada, Spain, Netherlands, Poland, Australia, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden. These are all the countries that Amazon supports on-demand printing. Sadly the print book only ships from these Amazon marketplaces. This is one downside of self-publishing!</p><p>Translations are published, with more to come. The book has been published in <a href="https://dpunkt.de/produkt/guidebook-fuer-software-engineers/">German</a> and <a href="https://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B2570473158">Korean</a>. Translations currently being prepared include Japanese, Chinese (traditional and simplified), Mongolian, and Hungarian.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58af627d-26d9-41bd-a982-8ef3b8039dce_1578x1386.png">          </a>The German translation is published by O’Reilly. <a href="https://dpunkt.de/produkt/guidebook-fuer-software-engineers/">Get it here.</a>  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6ddeeb87-ca31-4828-8f7b-cd8a8229f08a_1584x1386.png">          </a>The Korean translation is published by Hanbit. <a href="https://www.hanbit.co.kr/store/books/look.php?p_code=B2570473158">Get it here.</a> <p>For the Korean translation, the publisher worked with five prominent Korean engineers and CTOs on an additional section with a local perspective and additional practical insights for career growth.</p><p>Getting feedback from first-time readers is very rewarding. Yes, it’s nice for the book to be a commercial success, mostly thanks to the economics of self-publishing, but the best thing is that engineers still find it helpful, years after the observations and advice were written. I’ve gotten messages from engineers who managed to speed up their career growth, and managers who helped their team develop professionally.</p><p>Here’s one reader’s messages sent in August:</p><blockquote><p>“This May, I bought the Software Engineer's Guidebook on Amazon and read it as fast as I can. But it is not possible to read this book fast - because it is packed with so many useful insights and actionable advice.</p><p>I wanted to thank you for this book. It is the best general engineering book on tech that I've read for a long time. I took advice outlined in getting things done, being visible and starting a work log of the things that I did.</p><p>Just recently, I was promoted to a senior position!”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineers-guidebook-audiobook">The audiobook is out now</a> on all platforms, except Audible. I submitted the book to Audible at the same time as everywhere else, so as and when Audible approves the book, it will be available there, too. Until then, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-engineers-guidebook-audiobook">get it everywhere else</a>.</p> Thank you <p>Writing The Pragmatic Engineer – and now, hosting the eponymous podcast – is the most rewarding thing I’ve done in my career. Thanks so much for making this possible by reading the articles and getting involved in the conversations.</p><p>We’re taking a break until the start of January, and I hope you get to kick back this holiday season. If you’re due to be on call over Christmas and the new year, fingers crossed that it’s a quiet shift!</p><p>Season’s greetings and a Happy New Year; we’ll be back with renewed energy in 2025!</p>

  フランス   大手携帯電話会社4社（ブイグ・テレコム、フリー、オレンジ、SFR）は、オンラインビジネスのためのデジタルID認証を改善するために手を組んだ。  ここでは相互運用性が重要であり、事業者はモバイルネットワーク間の仕様を統一するために2つの新しいAPIを導入している。これらは、Linux Foundationによって開発されたオープンソースプロジェクトであるCAMARA標準に基づいている  <a

  英国   英国内務省は、英国への入国を申請する外国人を対象に、スマートフォンを使った遠隔および対面での生体指紋採取の試験実施を計画している  しかし、パスポートの生体指紋データは現在、拡張アクセス制御（EAC）によって保護されており、EU加盟国の当局しか読み取ることができないことを考えると、この計画の実現性には懸念がある  一方、遠隔地からの指紋採取は、AIを利用した詐欺の影響を受けやすいというセキュリティ上の懸念もある  <a

  ケンブリッジ・オルタナティブ・ファイナンス・センター（CCAF）   新しい調査によると、60の国・地域がオープン・バンキングに関連する法律や規制を導入している。  このうち44の法域では、金融サービス業界内の競争が導入の主な要因となっている  また、オープン・バンキングのアプローチには地域差があり、欧州、中央アジア、中東、北アフリカでは規制主導のアプローチが主流である一方、サハラ以南のアフリカやアジア太平洋地域では市場主導のアプローチが一般的である  <a

Check out their unified framework for measuring developer productivity: <a href="https://getdx.com/research/measuring-developer-productivity-with-the-dx-core-4?utm_source=pragmaticengineer">the DX Core 4</a></p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>In today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I’m joined by Sean Goedecke, Staff Software Engineer at GitHub. I learned about Sean after reading his viral blog post, “<a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/">How I ship projects at big tech companies</a>.” In our conversation, he shares how to successfully deliver projects in large tech companies. Drawing from his experiences at GitHub and Zendesk, Sean reflects on key lessons learned, and we discuss the following topics:</p><p>• Why shipping cannot exclude keeping management happy</p><p>• How to work on stuff the company actually values</p><p>• Why you should take on extra responsibility to get projects done</p><p>• Why technical skills are still more important than soft skills</p><p>• Soft skills you should learn: including learning the “management lingo”</p><p>• First-hand remote work learnings: advantages, disadvantages, and how to thrive in this setup</p><p>• … and much more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this practical conversation:</p><p>1. Getting things done starts by being technical. Sean's <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship/">original article</a> got plenty of criticism because it talks so much about the “soft” parts of the tech lead role. Many readers assume that Sean implies that things like managing up are more important than being a good engineer. But this is not the case.</p><p>Being technical – and being able to build and ship solid code – is where “getting stuff done” starts. Being technical is necessary – but alone, it might not not sufficient to be seen as someone who gets things done in larger companies.</p><p>2. You can move mountains if you proactively build technical demos. If you can help product or design folks create prototypes they can use – or show: this is a great way to make yourself indispensable and get more visibility across your team or organization.</p><p>So, work on this skill! Build prototypes when you can on the side, pairing with, e.g. product folks or other people from the business.</p><p>3. As a tech lead: learn the “management lingo.” Engineering leadership and product management will oftentimes speak less directly at larger companies, especially in writing. To be an efficient tech lead, you need to both understand this language – and read between the lines. Speaking it “back” to managers will help you do so.</p><p>How do you do this? Spend time with managers, note the phrases they use, make note of ones that you’re unsure what they mean, and consider getting a mentor in the org: such as a PM or a<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-tpms-do"> TPM</a>.</p><p>4. Software projects “want to fail” – unless you intervene! Sean observed how the default state of a project would be to fail: because so many things can trip projects up.</p><p>As a team member – or a tech lead – figure out the various ways the project could fail, and mitigate these risks. You can do this by doing proper planning, prototyping unknown parts, over-communicating with dependencies – and just being a little “paranoid” about ways things could go wrong.</p><p>5. When working as a remote engineer, you could need to “absorb” the company’s goals more. Sean shared interesting and candid thoughts about succeeding as a remote engineer. There are a few realities of remote software engineers:</p>  <p>The number of full-remote positions<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-eng-market-2024"> is shrinking</a>. This means that it’s harder to get a full-remote position, should your current one not work out.</p>  <p>In some regions, full-remote positions are extremely rare. Sean’s example is a good one: not many tech companies are hiring for full-remote engineers in Australia!</p>  <p>This means that there’s a lot of competition for remote engineering positions, and it’s easier to backfill than it is for in-office positions. So expectations will naturally be higher. Sean suggests taking your role very seriously and:</p>  <p>Avoid pushing your own goals against the company’s goals</p>  <p>Absorb the company’s own goals, and be proactive in helping make them happen</p>  <p>High agency is expected as a remote engineer – so take the lead!</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineers-leading-projects">Software Engineers Leading Projects</a> </p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/paying-down-tech-debt">Paying down tech debt</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=110s">01:50</a>) What is shipping?</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=335s">05:35</a>) Reasons management may choose to ship something customers don’t love</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=560s">09:20</a>) A humbling learning from Sean’s time at Zendesk</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=807s">13:27</a>) The importance of learning which rules need to be broken for good business outcomes</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=928s">15:28</a>) Common obstacles to shipping</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=1093s">18:13</a>) DRI: Directly responsible individual</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=1386s">23:06</a>) The value of strong technical skills and why moving fast is imperative</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=1724s">28:44</a>) How to leverage your technical skills the right way</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=1936s">32:16</a>) Advice on earning the trust of leadership</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=2170s">36:10</a>) A time Gergely shipped a product for a political reason</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=2310s">38:30</a>) What GenAI helps software engineers do more easily</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=2468s">41:08</a>) Sean’s thoughts on GenAI making engineers more ambitious</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=2600s">43:20</a>) The difficulty of building AI tools</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=2770s">46:10</a>) Advantages of working remotely and strategies for making it work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=3154s">52:34</a>) Who is best suited to remote work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=3288s">54:48</a>) How the pandemic provided a remote work trial for Sean</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IekJKQ-AvkM&amp;t=3405s">56:45</a>) Rapid questions</p> Resources &amp;

<p>Hi, this is Gergely with a subscriber-only issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. To get articles like this in your inbox, every week, subscribe: </p><p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday (jointly known as “BFCM”) are when e-commerce businesses make the most money in the year: up to 10x more than any other day. Obviously, this means the period is extremely important for: </p>  <p>E-commerce platforms like Shopify, Amazon, and others</p>  <p>Payment providers like Stripe, Adyen, Block, and others which process far more payments than usual</p>  <p>High street and online retailers that receive more inquiries than usual</p>  <p>Delivery services that transport orders from e-commerce companies and face delivery challenges</p>  <p>Shopify is one of the biggest challengers in the e-commerce segment, and is unusually transparent about what happens on its platform on BFCM. For a few years now, the company <a href="https://bfcm.shopify.com/">has made</a> a special “Black Friday Cyber Monday” portal for anyone to inspect, and the latest one is a pretty mesmerizing visual experience: in real time, you can inspect sales and software engineering stats like database queries and edge requests per minute, in a fun, interactive spaceship environment.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c24dc-cbf0-4c9e-846c-621c128cbf6c_1600x1042.png">          </a>Screenshot of Shopify’s BFCM portal.

From idea, through design inspiration and prototypes, to the final version.</p>  <p>Stats. Business and infrastructure details about Shopify’s Black Friday traffic. At peak, the platform had nearly 30M database reads and 3M writes per second; all served with a Ruby on Rails backend and MySQL, and utilizing GCP as their cloud provider.</p>  <p>System architecture. Relatively straightforward, with a React SPA app, a Go event server, and a custom data pipeline.</p>  <p>Tech stack. React Three Fiber, server-sent events, Go, Rails, Kafka and Flink.</p>  <p>Easter eggs. A music synthesizer that sends music to instruments, a bobblehead, an emergency shutdown sequence, and the whole thing broadcast live on new Last Vegas landmark, The Sphere.</p>  <p>Building it.

Kickoff <p>Shopify has been running an internal Black Friday / Cyber Monday live dashboard since 2014. Initially, it served as a way to track what was happening on important days for the business. And since 2018, the company has made a version of its “Globe” available to the world.</p><p>Here’s what the 2023 version looked like:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f2bacf7-3b4f-42cf-9f8d-ccff07717a70_1600x823.png">          </a>Shopify Live Globe for 2023 <p>The Shopify team previously shared details on <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-we-built-shopifys-bfcm-2023-globe">how they built the 2023 version</a>.</p><p>Daniel Beauchamp is a principal engineer for AR/VR at Shopify, and has headed the Live Globe project for the past few years. He says that this time, they wanted to make it more special than ever:</p><blockquote><p>“The Live Globe has become a tradition at Shopify, even “just” as a sphere with some arcs showing orders being made in real time, and some additional touches to make it more jazzy.</p><p>A big learning last year was that visitors love an easter egg. The easter egg was called “airplane mode”; when you switched it on, instead of just seeing the globe with arcs representing orders, you kind of zoomed in as if flying a little plane, and the plane circled the Earth while the arcs zoomed around you. There were also fireworks, each one representing a merchant’s first sale of the period.</p><p>When we built this easter egg, we assumed a few people might find it and smile. Instead, it was what people talked about and shared the most!</p><p>We wondered why this feature was so liked and realized that while the Live Globe tells the story of entrepreneurship and of Shopify, these fun and delightful moments are really important for people. We took this learning and wrapped it away for the next iteration.</p><p>Early this year, we decided that we wanted to take the Live Globe to the next level. Within Shopify, usually all projects have concrete, measurable goals that make the project a success. In the case of the Live Globe 2024 project, the only success metric defined was to make it as fun as possible”.</p></blockquote><p>With 6 people and 2 months to achieve that this year, the site was rebuilt from scratch. The team consisted of two software engineers, one 3D artist, and three data engineers, plus a few folks helping out with SEO and some design/logo work.</p> 2. Design process <p>The Live Globe works very well from a user’s point of view because it’s visually appealing, set inside a spaceship near a cabin window. So how was this project designed?</p><p>Daniel – the project lead – has a long interest in 3D games and programming, and became the go-to person for all things 3D at Shopify. In 2015, he launched an augmented reality (AR) team in the company. The team’s mission was to make Shopify spatially enabled, and enable merchants to use 3D, VR, or AR. It was natural for this team to be involved in the initial versions of Live Globe, and they drive major updates for the project.</p> Inspiration <p>As a start, the team explored different concepts of globes and futuristic environments, merged with retro car dashboards.

During this phase, they had to figure out two things:</p><p>#1: Appearance of the Globe. As the centerpiece of the experience, it matters what the globe looks like. Here are some prototypes of the globe and its environment:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecc3123d-1319-49de-a341-9b94690fe037_1600x844.png">          </a>Early prototype: the globe with arcs orbiting it, is part of a hardware device in this version <p>The team spent a lot of time honing the appearance.

With the globe design finalized, the next challenge was to create the environment it exists in, and figure out what visitors could do beyond interacting with the globe. Prototype versions of the environment:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26564946-ca73-4063-8526-073c8cae7d71_1454x842.png">          </a>The first prototype of the globe in an environment, and the first concept of the craft’s interior  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F510ba69d-c0b2-419f-b412-707497c9ff06_1562x904.png">          </a>A more detailed prototype.

After plenty of refinement, they achieved the final design:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4178492-7068-4826-a45e-04a333db1d2b_1600x873.png">          </a>This year’s Live Globe: the interface is cleaner and refined. Early prototypes served their purpose  3. Stats <p>The functional goal of the site was to share real time statistics on the load that Shopify’s platform was handling during BFCM. Below are some numbers from that weekend.</p> Business stats   <p>$108: the average order size during BFCM.</p>  <p>76M customers: the number of people purchasing from a Shopify-powered store</p>  <p>91M: packages sent and tracked in Shopify’s Shop App</p>  <p>$4.6M per minute: peak sales processed by the platform. This happened at midday EST on Black Friday (29 November)</p>  <p>$11.5B: sales on the platform during the 4-day period; around half of the annual GDP of a country like Albania ($23B <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)">in 2023</a>), and 24% more than during the same period in 2023.</p>   Infra numbers <p>Here are some peak load figures that might interest engineers:</p>  <p>2.4M CPU cores across Kubernetes operated at peak load. Shopify relies on Google Cloud as their cloud partner, so it’s safe to assume most CPU cores were spun up as virtual ones from Google Cloud regions and zones.</p>  <p>45M database queries per second (QPS): peak database queries, and 1.4 billion row operations per second. Over the 4 days, 10.5 trillion (10,500 billion) queries were served. This is an extremely high load! Shopify used MySQL 8 as their database technology.</p>  <p>3M database writes per second. Shopify had a roughly 10:1 database read/write ratio during this time, and a total of 1.17 trillion database writes in this period, compared to 10.5 trillion database reads. From the data, we can assume peak database write was around 3M QPS. Database writes are more resource intensive than reads, so the infra team had their work cut out to handle this load smoothly.</p>  <p>Edge: 4.7M RPS (requests per second) at peak (284M edge requests per minute). The total was 1.19 trillion (1,190 billion) edge requests over 4 days. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing">Edge computing</a> means optimizing request response time by serving requests on nodes close to the user; it can be thought of as a kind of smart caching. Edge computing is becoming increasingly important with large-scale, frontend applications.</p>  <p>CDN: 2.1M RPS at peak (128M requests per minute). 97% of CDN requests were served from cache, which is a win-win: faster responses for customers, and less resource strain on Shopify’s servers.</p>  <p>App servers: 1.3M RPS at peak (80M request per minute). This stat shows that while Edge was able to absorb most of the load, the backend infra still needed to handle a fair amount!</p>  <p>Client connections: 1.9M per sec at peak (117M per minute): the number of new client connection requests initiated to the backend, coming from websites or apps.</p>  <p>Data: 200GB/sec pushed: pushed at peak to clients (12 TB per minute). A total of 57PB data was pushed over 4 days.</p>  <p>66M Kafka messages/sec at peak (!!). Kafka messages are the lifeblood of communication across systems within Shopify, and used by the Live Globe, as covered below.</p>  <p>Logs: 108GB/sec logged at peak logged (6TB per minute); a huge amount of logging happening across Shopify’s systems!</p>  <p>Caching: 145M/sec commands sent at peak in caching commands (8.7B per minute)</p>  <p>These numbers are truly impressive and require significant infrastructure to serve reliably. It’s safe to assume they set new records at Shopify. It’s also safe to assume they might become “business as usual” if the platform keeps growing.</p> Live Globe stats <p>Finally, I asked the Live Globe team about stats on the microsite that updated in real time during BFCM. Some details:</p>  <p>271,620: visitors over the 4 days</p>  <p>140,325: times the ship’s gravity was turned off, causing objects to float</p>  <p>81,089: times that bobblehead was bobbled</p>  <p>78,425: times the emergency shutdown switch was turned on, which should have self-destructed the ship!</p>  <p>75MB per second: data processed by Flink to serve the Live Globe</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2dc5b922-e2fb-463e-9416-b49b4442717e_1600x969.png">          </a>When turning off gravity, everything floats, and bobblehead keeps bobbling in zero gravity <p>Compared to the Shopify platform, the load on Live Globe was trivial; the challenge was not in keeping up with demand, it was building all the features on time and ensuring the data was streamed in as close to real time as possible.</p> 4.

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先週はTaiwan Digital Identity Wallet International Forumで登壇してきましたので、キーノートとしてお話した内容をメモしておきたいと思います。  イベントについてはこちら  <a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html">https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html</a>  <br>  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgLdUITMo8-0WkN9eDPJPAeSBVYxbJlZtXx7dCVQPLVArTRWr9jbnobZOXl7rVLRBMZkDRDsWJTzXG41M3cu1akZPLKjFhulfjbL3A8QA4ANSNLOPMoyKLb5JHQYoGySeLTNKL0Fi2yS4-4oe5AUIdiDo1cMSDlgvbsWpaGQi1WJdwJULHo-uwAbptt6OO7"></a> 自己紹介は置いておいて、テーマは相互運用性でした。 <blockquote>  As you know, the Digital Identity Wallet has recently become an emerging topic in the digital identity space. For example, the European Committee has started implementing the European Digital Identity Wallet, which allows citizens to bring their own digital identity documents, such as national ID cards or mobile driver's licenses. At the same time, interoperability is essential for adopting these wallets in the real world because we have an existing ecosystem without the digital identity wallet today.  So, today’s my talk is about interoperability between current identity ecosystems and a Digital Identity Wallet.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>ご存知のように、デジタルIDウォレットは最近、デジタルID分野で新たなトピックとなっています。例えば、欧州委員会は欧州デジタルIDウォレットの導入を開始しました。これにより、国民は国民IDカードや携帯電話運転免許証などのデジタルID文書を携帯できるようになります。同時に、現実世界でこれらのウォレットを採用するには相互運用性が不可欠です。なぜなら、今日、デジタルIDウォレットのない既存のエコシステムが存在しているからです。</p><p>そこで、本日の私の講演では、現在のアイデンティティ・エコシステムとデジタル・アイデンティティ・ウォレット間の相互運用性についてお話します。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiA3n4-wCR4DNYo_k3sK3z-I4R5-SaDuVUF8Zslk_xqZDA6GQUZ3Dt2O5q3vc3zXbzT0s-gbMATmbaPywiwnZv57PiofbMYQJU16YjB5906Jmu5j0ehK6xfYS2tUUinvbtqsfrZmYKWpy6s85tSjhZcXSkn_32zVAM0sB0sETtHGtIwRt_IFOPGTSK3_xZb"></a> <br> <blockquote>  First, let’s think about our current situation when considering the term “interoperability.”  Since the fall of the Tower of Babel, we have been living in a world divided by different languages, different tribes, different cultures, and different social systems.  In other words, we have been living in a world where we have not been able to communicate well for a long time. This continued until the Age of Exploration, when trade between countries worldwide became more active.  For people like me who have lived in Asia, we have lived in a world that is very different from Western languages and cultures, and we are still living behind language barriers.  However, since the spread of the Internet began in the 1990s, the breakdown of regional divisions, including countries, has started. We have finally been freed from the constraints of physical location, and the need to communicate globally has arisen.  So, did a technology break down these barriers to allow us to communicate and trade freely globally?  </blockquote><blockquote><p>まず、「相互運用性」という言葉について考える前に、現在の状況について考えてみましょう。</p><p>バベルの塔が崩壊して以来、私たちは異なる言語、異なる部族、異なる文化、異なる社会制度によって分断された世界に生きてきました。</p><p>つまり、私たちは長い間、うまくコミュニケーションを取ることができない世界に生きてきたのです。この状況は、大航海時代を迎え、世界各国間の貿易が活発になるまで続きました。</p><p>私のようにアジアで生活してきた人間にとっては、西洋の言語や文化とはまったく異なる世界で生きてきましたし、今でも言葉の壁に阻まれて生活しています。</p><p>しかし、1990年代からインターネットが普及し始め、国を含めた地域的な区分が崩れ始めました。私たちはようやく物理的な場所の制約から解放され、グローバルにコミュニケーションを取る必要性が生じてきたのです。</p><p>では、こうした障壁を打破し、世界中で自由にコミュニケーションや取引ができるようになった技術は登場したのでしょうか？</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi5y9anTn_NhSR-d4KY5iBnhoJg5ukODYAT_19gYSWnWqoC3GO47P0ybB5WPxL3k3umxO0z8joXuwN0R-OKCXXpfGUk3qUe5P0tEW1JYG2SfB009l6ztXWS8C2Da0P_wZAs7LzTEPlW-7Yy5PPgVfQa7wNNWrAYdS6gJ4HE_S9K7L_LVudbB6qGz3T2KND5"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  At the moment, the answer is no.  We are currently living in a world divided by silos created by technology.  Even now, to transfer data freely across systems, we have to design and implement interfaces between systems each time, and even when it comes to identity, which is the theme of today's talk, it is still managed on a system-by-system basis. We often have to manage multiple accounts for each systems.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>現時点では、答えはノーです。</p><p>私たちは現在、テクノロジーによって作られたサイロによって分断された世界に生きています。</p><p>今でも、システム間でデータを自由にやりとりするためには、その都度、システム間のインターフェースを設計し実装しなければなりませんし、本日のテーマであるアイデンティティにしても、システムごとに管理されています。 システムごとに複数のアカウントを管理しなければならないこともよくあります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjc3RHuXPN49Srpkp-ay7jH8qc8-AcVI5zU8YgT-PhPezrvj357_jwm2aj43ei3VTGSKcaxzBEnyZZOe8aL6pWCuYZAbeyMPWoeDoEJIIm8L-ooSZGMOIqh69lVyCfb7M2Dx9RK5wBQwzpRh6BU8Q75DQXhwYUroOMt921Nenn6_UdEjbgwJLLTn52Zarct"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  We need a way to communicate across countries, jurisdictions, and systems.  And we already know of some examples that have been developed to some extent.  Email can be delivered anywhere in the world without a centralized system, and the telephone system allows us to make calls to people worldwide. In these systems, we can communicate without depending on the email user agent or telephone type.  Also, in the real world, we use passport to identify people on traveling to other countries.  Those of us involved in digital identity need to follow the example of these previous cases and work to create a world where interoperability is guaranteed.    国や管轄区域、システムを越えてコミュニケーションを行う方法が必要です。  そして、ある程度まで開発された例がすでにいくつか存在しています。  電子メールは中央集権的なシステムなしで世界中のどこへでも配信できますし、電話システムは世界中の人々との通話を可能にしています。これらのシステムでは、電子メールユーザーエージェントや電話の種類に依存することなくコミュニケーションを行うことができます。  また現実の世界では、パスポートを使って他国への渡航者の身元確認を行っています。  デジタルアイデンティティに関わる私たちは、これらの過去の事例を手本とし、相互運用性が保証された世界を実現するために取り組む必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhslNQ8t7ykKyYZ4KsncE8XYjiqmEZrVn2iEer_BlhMTAjRVDzlVNpybLpv2xlxLlmOx-OvShv6X7a_BC8Vg62RvBnNDAKTYtaGD0Jo4QoJod9GEqlzkPbq3AeKWYqis0TTPbrLnZOOvp3yeWDbXgS4PqaCAcIP1d8rr7Vkge8x19y4qQ1Mfh1rhnIO-W-K"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>And digital identities are not just for natural persons. There are various things in the real world, such as IoT devices and legal entities, are connected to the internet, and daily business transactions are carried out. Now is the time to design and implement a system so that all digital identities can be mutually operated with minimal friction.</p> また、デジタルアイデンティティは自然人だけのものではありません。現実世界には、IoTデバイスや法人など、さまざまなものがインターネットに接続され、日常的な商取引が行われています。今こそ、すべてのデジタルアイデンティティが相互に最小限の摩擦で運用できるようなシステムの設計と実装を行うべき時なのです。 </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqKIO8M86eL17l9NBAcUA36CHs6y2pOvo5uw0MnzSg1uwZMtKZcZ18JgGGkt4h1SkX0m4FvDqlNUxIAArC8lT0PHIoKjrQ8JMljwhDR89WXx44XfmhcnzPFvX-MHPFf9Mamjuwasmn4T6Ka2rdUP_7G7HznrDEg5jv0ga1xtQtqD-gIXJgWkmXjdyK5hss"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Let's now take a closer look at interoperability. Even though we use the word 'interoperability,' it can be roughly divided into technical and non-technical aspects. When many engineers talk about interoperability, they often only focus on the technical side, but it is also essential to consider the non-technical side.</p><p>First, let's look at the technical aspects. We must consider the identifier format, transfer protocol, and data model, including the schema and signature algorithm.</p><p>In addition, on the non-technical side, we need to agree on the semantics that expresses what meaning the exchanged data has, the rules and framework within which the data is generated, and the trust framework that ensures the reliability of the entity state, etc.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at each of these elements from the next slide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>それでは、相互運用性について詳しく見ていきましょう。相互運用性という言葉を使っていますが、大まかに技術的な側面と技術的ではない側面に分けることができます。多くの技術者が相互運用性について語る場合、技術的な側面のみに焦点を当てがちですが、技術的ではない側面も考慮することが不可欠です。</p><p>まず、技術的な側面について見ていきましょう。識別子のフォーマット、転送プロトコル、データモデル（スキーマや署名アルゴリズムを含む）を考慮する必要があります。</p><p>さらに、技術面以外の側面では、交換されたデータがどのような意味を持つのか、データが生成されるルールや枠組み、エンティティの状態の信頼性を確保する信頼フレームワークなどを表現するセマンティクスについて合意する必要があります。</p><p>それでは、これらの要素について、次のスライドから詳しく見ていきましょう。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhvFDgGZXLcax7V5-cA-q2Q2oXP0vSu_GzbeW3UwM9ZuBw8PXahIh7W7PWksvkZ-tQ8OolqYXGSbHEBSdBIJGZSOVsBpJcH093UlZohL6M7aZW7WUbz8Tm47xtppP-41MPpW8S4saIXVRKfykMWdfrE6qK5uUyXFzfGr_34uvJbuB4wwuDa8on4uckjbwj7"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>First of all, let's talk about identifiers. An identifier is an attribute identifying a particular entity within a specific set. This attribute can be a single attribute or multiple attributes.</p><p>The design of the identifier depends on the size of the set that contains the target entity. For example, designing an identifier within a local set differs significantly from creating one within an international or global set. For example, my family name is Fujie, but there may be no one else in this room with the same family name. In this situation, my family name could function as an identifier. However, when I go home to Japan, my family name does not function as an identifier because, as you know, all of my family members have the family name Fujie.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to consider privacy and persistence when considering identifiers. For example, suppose control of an identifier is taken away from you. In that case, there is a possibility that control over the identity information linked to that identifier will also be taken away from you. Also, suppose you are logged in to multiple services using the same identifier. In that case, there is a possibility that the services will collide with each other and merge your attribute information in an unintended way. To deal with such cases, it may be necessary to devise ways to ensure that users use different identifiers.</p><p>On the other hand, if users are not allowed to use the same identifier for an extended period, they may not be able to use the service continuously or may not be able to access past data.</p><p>From the perspective of interoperability, it is necessary to design systems that can correctly identify entities while considering privacy and persistence, not only in the current but also in a broader set in the future.</p><p>Identifiers may seem simple, but they must be designed very carefully.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;まず、識別子についてお話しましょう。識別子とは、特定の集合内の特定のエンティティを識別する属性です。この属性は単一の属性であることも、複数の属性であることもあります。</p><p>識別子の設計は、対象のエンティティを含む集合の規模によって異なります。例えば、ローカルな集合内で識別子を設計することは、国際的またはグローバルな集合内で設計することとは大きく異なります。例えば、私の姓は富士榮ですが、この部屋には同じ姓の人は誰もいないかもしれません。このような状況では、私の姓は識別子として機能するでしょう。しかし、私が日本に帰国した場合、ご存知のように私の家族全員が富士榮という姓なので、私の姓は識別子として機能しません。</p><p>最後に、識別子を考える際には、プライバシーと永続性について考慮することが不可欠です。例えば、ある識別子の管理が自分から奪われたとします。その場合、その識別子と紐づけられたID情報についても管理が奪われる可能性があります。また、同じ識別子を使って複数のサービスにログインしているとします。その場合、サービス同士が衝突し、意図しない形で属性情報がマージされてしまう可能性がある。このようなケースに対応するためには、ユーザーに異なる識別子を利用させる工夫が必要となる可能性があります。</p><p>一方で、長期間にわたって同一の識別子を利用できないと、サービスを継続的に利用できなくなったり、過去のデータにアクセスできなくなったりする可能性があります。</p><p>相互運用性の観点では、プライバシーや永続性を考慮しつつ、現在だけでなく将来にわたって、エンティティを正しく識別できる仕組みを設計する必要があります。</p><p>識別子は一見単純に見えるが、非常に慎重に設計しなければいけません。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiKAB88-R_zRe_U7x8Bg9R4RIL98VLqqc-BLoHNVl0MNXyFjhF1cCDK02M9KyJRJ0-RYlrHLDylKmnUDAr84p6R5VS_xyn4o4jSORmYaf2BwduEgtainFdpQoF-23OBAj-GottskC-jd0r8qEsZTO0IuLgRjrdsyBGzBenVQKD-3rH1i495lXHsh6P4JvE_"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote>  Next, we will consider transport protocols. Transport protocols define the methods by which entities communicate with each other. In the context of digital credentials, transport protocols include issuing credentials to wallets, presenting credentials to verifiers, and revoking issued credentials by issuers.  To ensure interoperability, the multiple issuer, wallet, and verifier components must communicate using a method that has been agreed upon in advance.  次に、トランスポートプロトコルについて検討します。トランスポートプロトコルは、エンティティが相互に通信する方法を定義します。デジタルクレデンシャルの文脈では、トランスポートプロトコルには、クレデンシャルをウォレットに発行すること、クレデンシャルをベリファイアに提示すること、発行者によって発行されたクレデンシャルを取り消すことが含まれます。  相互運用性を確保するには、複数の発行者、ウォレット、ベリファイアのコンポーネントが、事前に合意された方法で通信する必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjurXoMAA89tiSW9Esp45fMx0C7A7DsZ71iIG-vx3-lbEZ4i8saprScEXHgtmUszZ6vjEFDPLIk_Ma1l07_gpImkTclXvPCq7z6vul9AzK07R5p7HFwu3OCNyWRt6XUnjHpQEPAZ99Bnv1HwIWHxtgC2hVypArM6Y7hg8thjOLDTrp_f-ZNCesuXx3TPtaJ"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Let's also consider data models. Schemas need to take into account the types and namespaces of attributes. Generally, gender is expressed using letters such as M and F, but in some cases, it is expressed using numbers such as 0 and 1. In addition, the attribute name family_name is sometimes used to express the family name, and the attribute name surname is sometimes used. In any case, related entities must agree on the names and types of attributes to achieve interoperability.</p><p>The algorithm used for digital signatures is also a very important factor. In general, it is necessary to verify digital signatures to verify the authenticity of digital credentials. Still, verification will not be possible if the issuer uses a signature algorithm that differs from what the verifier expects.

Let's ask the same question as on the previous page. Just because you have verified the digital signature on the credential you have received, does that mean you can trust the issuer of that credential? For example, if you have obtained the digital data of a graduation certificate with a digital signature, how can you confirm that the university that issued the certificate exists?</p><p>This is where a system called a trust framework comes into play. There are various types of trust frameworks, but general laws and regulations are also a type of trust framework. For example, the recipient of a certificate of qualification may believe that the issuer is operating under the country's laws and regulations that control the bank and that the government regularly audits the bank. In this case, the verifier believes in the laws and regulations of the country, so there is no need to visit the bank to confirm that the individual issuer is an actual bank. In this way, it is possible to reduce the cost of individual verification by designing and operating a system that includes certification and auditing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>次に、トラストフレームワークについて考えてみましょう。前ページと同じ質問をしてみましょう。受け取ったクレデンシャルに付与された電子署名を検証したからといって、そのクレデンシャルの発行者を信頼できるのでしょうか？例えば、電子署名の付与された卒業証明書の電子データを受け取った場合、その証明書を発行した大学が実在していることをどのように確認できるのでしょうか？</p><p>そこで登場するのが「トラストフレームワーク」と呼ばれる仕組みです。トラストフレームワークにはさまざまな種類がありますが、一般的な法律や規則もトラストフレームワークの一種です。例えば、資格証明書の受領者は、発行者が銀行を管理する国の法律や規則に従って運営されており、政府が定期的に銀行を監査していると考えるかもしれません。この場合、検証者はその国の法律や規制を信頼しているため、個々の発行者が実際に銀行であることを確認するために銀行を訪問する必要はありません。このように、認証と監査を含むシステムを設計・運用することで、個々の検証にかかるコストを削減することが可能となります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiGzca6bl5wy7EJ9-gOhZxgZIokb7OcltZlEWAllIDnpylfBVdge4miWc5s1EjC-vpf3VGKC1-yKDIIgx4PPAXUkWMo_rsLoSSsaFazlwZcrvLazs8gKRC5Oj5uFiYbx8ema85rABr84EtFe91jaIlPKeUL7EvEc7yc_Qf9I8N9eIGnr2tzTI1v-efXGmk9"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>In a few previous pages, we discussed the need for profiles.

In the real world, we must consider interoperability between these systems.</p><p>In this slide, I want to explain the recent paradigm shift in digital identity systems.</p><p>This diagram shows how the identity paradigm has changed from a centralized world to a decentralized one.</p><p>In the centralized identity system, as I mentioned earlier, it is crucial to manage identity information in the centralized database. However, there are various side effects, such as the need to keep a non-active user account in the database, making license costs expensive. It may cause identity theft attack because nonactive user cannot be aware their identities were stolen since they are not using their accounts.</p><p>Also, a centralized authentication system is quite helpful in gathering sign-in logs. Still, the system's availability is quite crucial because if the system fails, all users cannot log in to all applications.</p><p>On the other hand, in the decentralized identity world, users' identity data is stored in the user's wallet, which is typically installed on smartphones. So, users can bring their identity and authenticate it through their purse, and there is no effect on other users if the user’s wallet is offline.</p><p>In addition, users can aggregate attributes from multiple data sources in a single wallet, aggregate them, and present them to the application. The application can get various attributes from the user’s wallet and determine access permission.</p>  システムアーキテクチャは日々変化しており、複数のアプローチに基づくシステムが共存することは明らかです。現実の世界では、これらのシステム間の相互運用性を考慮する必要があります。  このスライドでは、デジタルIDシステムにおける最近のパラダイムシフトについて説明したいと思います。  この図は、IDのパラダイムが中央集権型から分散型へとどのように変化したかを示しています。  集中型のIDシステムでは、先ほど申し上げたように、ID情報を集中データベースで管理することが重要です。しかし、さまざまな副作用があります。例えば、データベースに非アクティブなユーザーアカウントを維持する必要があるため、ライセンスコストが高額になることがあります。また、非アクティブなユーザーはアカウントを使用していないため、自分のIDが盗まれたことに気づくことができません。そのため、ID盗難の被害に遭う可能性があります。  また、中央集権型の認証システムはサインインログの収集に非常に役立ちます。しかし、システムが故障した場合、すべてのユーザーがすべてのアプリケーションにログインできなくなるため、システムの可用性は非常に重要です。  一方、分散型のアイデンティティの世界では、ユーザーのアイデンティティデータは、通常スマートフォンにインストールされているユーザーの財布に保存されます。そのため、ユーザーは自分のアイデンティティを持ち歩き、財布を通して認証することができます。また、ユーザーの財布がオフラインの状態でも、他のユーザーには影響がありません。  さらに、ユーザーは複数のデータソースから属性を収集し、それを集約してアプリケーションに提示することができます。アプリケーションはユーザーの財布からさまざまな属性を取得し、アクセス許可を決定することができます。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjpt2WhbfdLj_-EyePeQi4OFyTwJXxatukt_LD73dpvW8mu9xe8pkI1h_gl0Ug0HFFZPVXJXLkzrZmhRYYRQNnyYM1O4YlE0YxIAg1VQP4Hex10JBiXbjpFX3KsYIGJoKQmDMFMlOVL5w0e3KfSRUgI-1EKK_g61uwBfLdsNrxR9s1l5RgILayabDRn6tT"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>We at the OpenID Foundation support the SIDI Hub, a community established to ensure interoperability in global digital identity.

In addition, the learning management system in question was developed based on a middleware called Moodle, and it was necessary to implement a unique API to issue credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>実際の利用事例を一つ紹介したいと思います。</p><p>これは国立情報学研究所の学習歴証明の電子化プロジェクトです。このプロジェクトでは、既存の学習管理システムから発行される学習記録をウォレットに発行し、その資格情報を論文投稿時などの資格証明に利用します。</p><p>このプロジェクトを実施するにあたっての課題は、日本に限らず多くの学術システムがSAMLプロトコルを使用しており、日本でも学認という学術フェデレーションのエコシステム内で多くのSAMLベースのIDシステムが稼働していることでした。また、対象の学習管理システムはMoodleというミドルウェアをベースに開発されており、独自のAPIを実装してクレデンシャルを発行する必要がありました。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqowi_IT205Q-vXWV1nX28fwx7lfyN7oDpHOPwhqDKpxRyxWJRjvZLj-YRTN7UiRAzLNHwVJfFeA3dmi4fYHwmEyweM9d-Ae7U870a12dddkpvOlqp3HWcNv0aM3mtBuAYlN7UlNjdYIj38ZcNf6g9ye3BzaOe85bgQJwYpLxABXBpiCUaJxcsU4m0wf7c"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This diagram shows an overview of the GakuNin ecosystem that we explained earlier.</p><p>The National Institute of Informatics provides the trust framework, and certified universities and research institutions' identity providers and certified applications such as learning management systems and research databases are deployed as relying parties within the ecosystem.</p><p>By being authenticated by the university or institution's identity provider, students and researchers can securely single sign-on to many applications, creating a very convenient and secure environment.</p>  この図は、先に説明した学認エコシステムの概要を示しています。  国立情報学研究所がトラストフレームワークを提供し、認定を受けた大学や研究機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーと、学習管理システムや研究データベースなどの認定済みアプリケーションが、エコシステム内の依拠当事者として展開されています。  学生や研究者は、大学や機関のアイデンティティプロバイダーによって認証されることで、多くのアプリケーションに安全にシングルサインオンでき、非常に便利で安全な環境を実現できます。  </blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiMIkaRuffCDf8U3HHvKFISQJGLiDuUoHEbLrXSErhWvWItGkSRSy_xg8DFgOWHtdwuzktFfT2aodwVxZCprmp-PSXtCauD3kWqJ72YAogBsZYHr95FvkFOYbKAZHgccLxs41NHG0xJOKVuPTCR3BiDC5KdYdVc-DKmQ1mznJeb1qEDtISQJC1h8fgQlS30"></a> <br><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We decided to introduce a wallet-based system into this federated environment.</p><p>For this reason, we took these approaches to the challenge of interoperability.</p><p>First, we embedded the OpenBadge credential the Learning Management System issued using its own API into the Verifiable Credential. We placed a gateway service between Moodle and the wallet and constructed it as an issuer that issues verifiable credentials based on the OpenBadge issued by Moodle. In other words, from the wallet's point of view, the gateway service appears as an Issuer.</p><p>Secondly, the Verifiable Credential presented by the wallet was embedded inside the SAML assertion. Since the existing Relying Party supports the SAML protocol, it was impossible to show the Verifiable Credential directly. Therefore, the OpenBadge extracted from the Verifiable Credential was embedded as one of the attributes inside the SAML assertion, and the credential was presented to the Relying Party. To achieve this, we developed a Wallet to SP Connector component. We configured it to appear as a Verifier to the Wallet and an Identity Provider to the Relying Party.</p><p>Of course, the Relying Party still needs to implement the appropriate logic to extract the OpenBadge from the SAML assertion, verify it, and use it. Still, there was no need to modify to support new protocols such as OpenID for Verifiable Presentation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この統合環境にウォレットベースのシステムを導入することを決定しました。</p><p>そのため、相互運用性の課題に対して、以下のアプローチをとりました。</p><p>まず、LMSが独自のAPIを利用して発行するOpenBadgeクレデンシャルを、検証可能なクレデンシャルに埋め込みました。Moodleとウォレットの間にゲートウェイサービスを配置し、Moodleが発行するOpenBadgeに基づいて検証可能なクレデンシャルを発行する発行者として構築しました。つまり、ウォレットから見ると、ゲートウェイサービスは発行者として表示されます。</p><p>次に、ウォレットが提示した検証可能なクレデンシャルはSAMLアサーション内に埋め込まれました。既存のリライングパーティはSAMLプロトコルをサポートしているため、検証可能なクレデンシャルを直接提示することはできません。そのため、検証可能なクレデンシャルから抽出したOpenBadgeをSAMLアサーション内の属性の1つとして埋め込み、リライングパーティにクレデンシャルを提示しました。これを実現するために、私たちは Wallet to SP Connector コンポーネントを開発しました。 Wallet に対してはベリファイアとして、また、リライングパーティに対してはアイデンティティプロバイダーとして表示されるように構成しました。</p><p>もちろん、リライングパーティは、SAML アサーションから OpenBadge を抽出し、それを検証し、使用するための適切なロジックを実装する必要があります。それでも、OpenID for Verifiable Presentation などの新しいプロトコルをサポートするために修正する必要はありませんでした。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhiK-H70IUy-2lphu2saFh89mZq0zRuJouHar_JAvWxtRrpMN4tM7s32bN7_pj22MoO70uUNrNYtNJ5rhLgEBNb_rLnhAV_j0lEwdgCKYEAM6JnkC-QD7923lmJUhGw5rtJkC7qb9TxAynfG_QLiPBN4d0p67CubAzZz8JAoh_Hzbc1d5VyGhV1Xz2faxS"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This is an overview of the system.</p><p>First, the user issues a badge using the Learning Management System. At this point, the user is authenticated using the existing Identity Provider.</p><p>Next, the badge is issued to the user's wallet. When the user accesses the gateway, the gateway is also federated with the same Identity Provider as the Learning Management System, and the user is prompted for authentication. This way, the user is granted the appropriate permissions to execute the Moodle API. The gateway service then performs the Moodle API to obtain the issued badge and generate a verifiable credential. The gateway then issues the verifiable credential to the user's wallet as the issuer.</p><p>The issuance is now complete.</p><p>Finally, let's look at the presentation. In this case, we want to present the credential to the Gakunin RDM research database, but Gakunin RDM only supports the SAML protocol so we will use the Wallet to SP Connector. When the user accesses a specific page on Gakunin RDM, Gakunin RDM uses the SAML protocol to start the Wallet to SP Connector. This is the same operation as a standard SAML-based federation, so it is very easy to implement. When the Wallet to SP Connector is started, it requests the user's wallet to present a verifiable credential per the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol. When the user presents the credential in their purse, the Wallet to SP Connector verifies the signature of the credential, extracts the embedded badge information from the credential, and configures it as a SAML assertion, then sends it to Gakunin RDM using the SAML protocol.</p><p>This allows Gakunin RDM to obtain the desired learning credential information, which can then be used to perform access control and other processing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下にシステムの概要を示します。</p><p>まず、ユーザーは学習管理システムを使用してバッジを発行します。この時点で、ユーザーは既存のアイデンティティプロバイダを使用して認証されます。</p><p>次に、バッジがユーザーのウォレットに発行されます。ユーザーがゲートウェイにアクセスすると、ゲートウェイも学習管理システムと同じアイデンティティプロバイダとフェデレーションされており、ユーザーに認証が求められます。これにより、ユーザーにはMoodle APIを実行する適切な権限が付与されます。次に、ゲートウェイサービスがMoodle APIを実行して発行済みのバッジを取得し、検証可能な資格情報を生成します。次に、ゲートウェイが発行者として、検証可能な資格情報をユーザーのウォレットに発行します。</p><p>これで発行は完了です。</p><p>最後に、プレゼンテーションについて見てみましょう。このケースでは、学認RDM研究用データベースにクレデンシャルを提示したいのですが、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルしかサポートしていないので、Wallet to SP Connectorを使用します。ユーザーが学認RDM上の特定のページにアクセスすると、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルを使用してWallet to SP Connectorを開始します。これは標準的なSAMLベースのフェデレーションと同じ操作なので、実装は非常に簡単です。Wallet to SP Connectorが起動すると、OpenID for Verifiable Presentationプロトコルに従って、ユーザーのウォレットに検証可能なクレデンシャルの提示を要求します。ユーザーが財布内のクレデンシャルを提示すると、Wallet to SP Connectorはクレデンシャルの署名を検証し、クレデンシャルから埋め込みのバッジ情報を抽出し、それをSAMLアサーションとして構成し、SAMLプロトコルを使用して学認RDMに送信します。</p><p>これにより、学認RDMは必要な学習クレデンシャル情報を取得でき、アクセス制御やその他の処理に使用できるようになります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgau6fIEPYKGurnBK6dhvh04y9UPBo-xmcnP6X004UVGvSmWIxQ88HUGurZNWicYm1nT34kxNtfvd-XciYT6pgQg4UceunyKCXp8zoc_TaxZlA2VeEjkc8rfNpwtA_2TcstBvS40KumqVvOe3Chuj4UooA7Igdtlh6k3D7sbAEicyfSgYonpWhXSNYYT1lk"></a> <br><p></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>We will also introduce activities that address other non-technical considerations.</p><p>Open Identity Exchange is working to map the trust frameworks of each country and identify differences.</p><p>For example, this will enable the EU to understand what rules were used to issue the credentials issued by Japan and to determine whether additional measures are necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>また、技術以外の考慮事項に対処する活動についても紹介します。</p><p>Open Identity Exchangeは、各国の信頼フレームワークをマッピングし、相違点を特定する作業を行っています。</p><p>例えば、これによりEUは、日本が発行したクレデンシャルを発行する際にどのような規則が用いられたかを理解し、追加の措置が必要かどうかを判断することができます。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhDFjscYoiOWigxm93OXMFSWREtQZTLepeNIH8el6Z9jnUykMh8LncWZCuiN0OPLfIMgxQTaplNvL-av8lycqfrlsuLbDNIwldX5sbe-Y4zNctT7gwrdOYcrTRwCqL5siP5yIiYtwZCfXsCm8OODNoIvyHYhiZRyD202nbffUGDTr0vzflTctniFppbVL4G"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>There are also activities in the academic world to map frameworks related to qualification levels.</p><p>In the academic world, there are two main types of credentials: micro-credentials, mainly learning records, and macro-credentials, which are qualifications such as degrees and credits.</p><p>While micro-credentials are becoming increasingly digitized, as in the case of the NII example mentioned earlier, OpenBadge, it is tough to standardize the difficulty of skills. I think this will continue to be a challenge. On the other hand, about macro-credentials, UNESCO has established standards for skill levels so that each country can define levels based on these standards.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>学術界でも、資格レベルに関連する枠組みをマッピングする活動があります。</p><p>学術界では、主に学習記録であるマイクロ資格と、学位や単位などの資格であるマクロ資格の2つの主要な資格があります。</p><p>マイクロ・クレデンシャルは、先ほど例に挙げたNIIのOpenBadgeのように、どんどんデジタル化が進んでいますが、スキルの難易度をどう標準化するかは難しい。これは今後も課題になっていくと思います。一方、マクロ・クレデンシャルについては、ユネスコが技能レベルの基準を定めており、各国がそれをベースにレベルを定義できるようになっています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_tIiMKI14xnhqQfZachoYstaGE3B9oGpbrDM885MsBdREw2gu_SU24bgJNusgWSJWVoZALBfesb4i_rIjV6KIivOZsjHQnBvbCwTltwpe2p4Tjz1fZ6kzcmomNvBS0P2KnK1x0ur64KfBjIVKeb0xm7T4uRDhhnDSNTSkeYSc0UYEHb-ZCDVrYIbgZ2vU"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote><p>This is the approach to global standards and mapping as defined by UNESCO.</p><p>In this example, the EQF developed by Europe based on UNESCO standards is mapped to the frameworks of other countries.</p><p>For example, EQF Level 4 is mapped to Country X Level 5 and Country Y Level 3.</p><p>これは、ユネスコが定義するグローバルスタンダードとマッピングへのアプローチです。</p><p>この例では、ユネスコの基準に基づいてヨーロッパが開発したEQFが、他の国のフレームワークにマッピングされています。</p><p>例えば、EQFレベル4は、国Xのレベル5および国Yのレベル3にマッピングされています。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhixiO4yGRKxUsq-xA-pbgNoo967OlFkUbSg1wBOH1Q8K8NgiI6D7pQTxCYDv45Tf8BueK3qjPJnAj-TdKNzgCgVakI_9ijuj92Huv9J-33-PUTFictKCwnb3EBDe_2qLAJZPQbeLnAtdz8TPvt5wQEylxjUd39pea6zQr3Lif6oQcdKHQGV9Thp2J--GVa"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;In addition, we will introduce some of the activities that have been taking place in Japan recently.</p><p>Trusted Web has been underway since 2020, and research into digital identity wallets is being carried out.

It is essential to reach agreement on technical matters such as identifiers, transport protocols, and data models. I also explained that semantics and trust frameworks are necessary from a non-technical perspective.</p><p>I also explained that we need to respond to the recent paradigm changes of identity systems. To introduce a wallet-based system into a federation-type system that has been used in the past, it is thought that it will be necessary to use components such as proxies and gateways temporarily. I also mentioned that by comparing trust frameworks, it will be possible to clarify what additional processing the systems require to be connected.</p><p>In the future, we will need to connect many systems to overcome the silo-based society that has continued since the fall of the Tower of Babel. I hope that we can continue to have discussions like this with everyone.</p><p>Thank you.</p>  最後にまとめます。  まず、相互運用性は技術的な問題と、ルールやフレームワークなどの技術的でない考慮事項の両方を含んでいます。識別子、通信プロトコル、データモデルなどの技術的な事項について合意に達することが不可欠です。また、技術的でない観点からは、セマンティクスや信頼フレームワークが必要であることを説明しました。  また、アイデンティティシステムの最近のパラダイム変化に対応する必要があることを説明しました。これまで使われてきたフェデレーション型システムに、ウォレット型システムを導入するには、プロキシやゲートウェイなどのコンポーネントを一時的に使用する必要があると考えられます。また、信頼フレームワークを比較することで、システムを接続するためにどのような追加処理が必要かを明確にできることを述べました。  今後は、バベルの塔の崩壊以来続いてきた縦割り社会を乗り越えるためにも、多くのシステムを接続していく必要があります。今後も皆さんとこのような議論を続けていければと思います。  ありがとうございました。  </blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>プロンプターが欲しかったプレゼンでした・・・&nbsp;</p><p>ちなみに始まる前にオープンニングトークをしてくれた台湾のデジタル副大臣（私の左側）と登壇者全員で記念写真を撮りました。なんかセレモニーみたいでいいですね。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgcqOC1PiECCsjXoKm676xGTTtf0y9y7V1_ccAgwKlVQJ4RbIQ5uMIyZ5QKyU86iHUMqMOxnFp_XdA08Ub_RsSB_OqgX0i5C7ygmUxCNud79kLCNQKp9kOd275ASi3rOz50vMcufhsBLkpUvwWVUowYVSIZEUzbORE7a1rHstID1qxflxcQNm-89EeeeRGA"></a> <br><br><p></p><br><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups.

After months of inactivity in releases, OpenAI comes back roaring with more capable products. It’s launched o1 pro, a flagship model, priced at $200/month, and video generation with Sora.</p>  <p>Devin doubles down as “AI software engineer.” Cognition AI has made their Devin tool publicly available. This tool is marketed as an “AI software engineer” and costs $500/month. It looks less useful than a GenAI-powered IDE for hands-on software engineers, but it could well have valid use cases in larger codebases, perhaps taking on work that interns or junior engineers would have been hired to do. Early-career engineers will have to adapt, fast.</p>  <p>Court orders Automattic to undo attacks on WP Engine. A judge, weighing purely the law, has mandated Automattic to undo all of its recent unethical actions against its chief competitor WP Engine. It’s an embarrassing outcome for Automattic, which desperately tried to paint WP Engine as the villain, and yet is the one that behaves like one.</p>  <p>Middle manager burnout wave incoming? More managers may quit workplaces across the economy, according to a report by Fortune. In tech, this could be already happening because it’s a tough time to be an engineering manager.</p>   1.

See the episode transcript at the top of this page.</p> Brought to You By <p><a href="https://getdx.com/?utm_source=pragmaticengineer">DX</a>⁠ → DX is an engineering intelligence platform designed by leading researchers</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>In today’s exciting episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I am joined by two founding native mobile engineers from Notion: Austin Louden and Karn Saheb. Austin and Karn joined Notion in 2019 when Notion started to revamp its iOS and Android apps.&nbsp;Today, Notion's mobile apps are used by tens of millions of users.</p><p>In our conversation today, we take a deep dive into how the Notion mobile team operates and discuss:&nbsp;</p>  <p>The engineering culture at Notion&nbsp;</p>  <p>Why the mobile team focuses so much on app performance</p>  <p>How the mobile team rewrote the mobile app from webviews and Cordova to a native implementation&nbsp;</p>  <p>Notion’s tech stack and frameworks they rely on</p>  <p> ⁠⁠⁠Details on the development process, including four types of environments, approaches to using modules, and practices around feature flags</p>  <p>How the mobile team maintains consistency across iOS and Android</p>  <p>… and much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this fascinating conversation:</p><p>1. Notion’s underlying data model is both flexible, but also tricky to work with. It was interesting to hear how much work Notion’s underlying data model created for the mobile engineering team. Notion chose a flexible data model that makes it easy to change parts of a document. However, this flexibility means a lot of added engineering complexity for all clients – including on mobile!</p><p>2. Notion’s native mobile team is surprisingly small. Notion employs about 600 staff, but the mobile team is only 11 people – including iOS and Android. This team size is very small, especially considering how Notion serves more than 10M users on both iOS and Android. We’re likely talking about one engineer for every ~2M or more users!</p><p>While the team is small, it is very senior. It would be hard to see such a small team operate efficiently any other way. How Notion’s mobile team operates – preferring a small and senior team – fits into the trend we discussed previously in<a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/native-vs-cross-platform"> Is there a drop in native iOS and Android hiring at startups?</a></p><p>3. Moving from web-based to native was an incremental process by necessity. Thanks to a small native team, and the need to keep the mobile apps up-to-date with the latest Notion features, the native mobile engineering team didn’t have the luxury of doing a large mobile app rewrite.</p><p>Instead, they did the sensible thing of slowly migrating parts of the app. Today, most of Notion’s apps are fully native, save for the editor. The editor remains one of the most complex parts of Notion.</p><p>4. Notion releases their app on a weekly cadence. Native mobile apps need to go through an app review flow from Apple and Google, and so many native apps are released less frequently, to account for this overhead. Notion doing a weekly release cycle is impressive – and it can serve as inspiration for other native mobile teams.</p><p>If Notion, with 10M+ native users and a small team, does this, other native teams can as well!</p><p>5. Feature flags are a must-have for native mobile apps at the scale of Notion. The Notion team uses feature flags extensively as a way to roll out new features and roll back code that could cause issues. With native mobile apps where code is shipped as binary, feature flags become especially important – as this example also shows.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs">Stacked Diffs (and why you should know about them)</a></p>  <p><a href="http://⁠https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/what-is-a-senior-software-engineer-at-scaleups⁠">What is a Senior Software Engineer at Scaleups?</a></p>  <p><a href="http://⁠https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production⁠">Shipping to Production </a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=123s">02:03</a>) The RFC process at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=360s">06:00</a>) How Notion uses internal channels to share RFCs</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=477s">07:57</a>) Some of the unique ways the mobile team works</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=667s">11:07</a>) Why they don’t do sprint planning at Notion—and what they do instead</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=777s">12:57</a>) An overview of the size of Notion and teams at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=795s">13:15</a>) The beginning of mobile at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=880s">14:40</a>) A simple explanation of Cordova</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=940s">15:40</a>) Why Notion decided to revamp mobile in 2019 and shift to Native</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=1110s">18:30</a>) How the mobile team evaluated performance as they made the shift to Native</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=1320s">22:00</a>) Scaling mobile and iterations of moving to Native</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=1564s">26:04</a>) Why the home tab project was so complex</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=1859s">30:59</a>) Why the mobile team saved the editor for last and other future problems</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2075s">34:35</a>) How mobile works with other teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2210s">36:50</a>) How iOS and Android teams work together</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2308s">38:28</a>) The tech stack at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2370s">39:30</a>) How frameworks are used</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2517s">41:57</a>) Pros and cons of different frameworks and why Swift was the right choice</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2716s">45:16</a>) How code reviews work at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=2903s">48:23</a>) Notion’s mobile team’s testing philosophy</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3018s">50:18</a>) How the mobile team keeps compile time so fast</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3156s">52:36</a>) Modules in the iOS app</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3290s">54:50</a>) Modules in the Android app</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3404s">56:44</a>) Behind the scenes of an app release and the public beta</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3634s">1:00:34</a>) Practices around feature flags</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3780s">1:03:00</a>) The four dev environments at Notion</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=3888s">1:04:48</a>) How development apps work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=4060s">1:07:40</a>) How and why you can work offline in Notion mobile</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=4224s">1:10:24</a>) Austin and Karn’s thoughts on the future of mobile engineering</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=4367s">1:12:47</a>) Advice for junior engineers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga7xKYQ41XU&amp;t=4589s">1:16:29</a>) Rapid fire round</p> Resources &amp;

It took months to find the perfect narrator, <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/nikola-hamilton/">Nikola Hamilton</a>, who’s a New York-based audio engineer, and to then create an audio version that is a great listening experience.</p><p>Today’s issue covers:</p>  <p>Audible’s monopoly and monopolistic practices. Currently, Audible’s position is hurting audiobook authors. My audiobook isn’t on Audible due to a mix of their monopolistic pricing practices, and the company’s own complacency in how it takes more than 10x as long to approve no titles as other audiobook platforms do.</p>  <p>Creating an audiobook. How I went about the process, and what I learned about creating and publishing a quality audiobook.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1cbbd467-6137-4ff4-a939-f36ee0624a33_1574x996.png">          </a>The cover of the audiobook. <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy">You can get it here.</a>  1. Audible’s audiobook monopoly and monopolistic practices <p>Audible is a model example of a Big Tech company with an invisible de facto monopoly of a market. Customers are happy, but authors and publishers are not. I suddenly find myself directly impacted by such practices that go unchallenged, and which won’t change without competition or regulation. Now is a good time to talk about that.</p><p>So, why is the audiobook of The Software Engineer's Guidebook not on Audible?</p><p>Originally, I really wanted to avoid supporting a business that treats authors and publishers like only a monopolistic company can. But it’s clear that most of my readers prefer to listen on Audible. For this reason, I’ve made the book available on Audible, although I recommend purchasing it anywhere except there.</p><p>However, Audible’s unusually slow approval process means my audiobook isn’t even available on Amazon’s platform, yet. I submitted the book to Audible at the same time as I did for every other platform, six days ago. In a sign that Audible is way too comfortable in its position, they can take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ACX/comments/15d4qi1/how_long_does_it_really_take_acx_to_review_a/">up to 25 days</a> to approve new books in busy times like now – though the official estimate from Amazon <a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G201014330">is 14 business days</a> (3 weeks). So, it will be on sale there when approval happens, likely either late 2024, or early 2025.</p><p>Update on 26 January 2025: Audible has not yet approved the book 50 days after submission. This is 10x longer than any other audiobook platform has taken. If you are tired of waiting, you can always get the book <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy">on another platform</a>.</p> Audible’s domination <p>In 2008, Amazon <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/amazon-acquires-audible-for-300-million/">acquired</a> audiobook startup Audible for $300M, and kept it as a separate brand while integrating it nicely with Amazon’s books and e-books features. The strategy worked wonderfully: today, Audible is the clear market leader in audiobooks. In 2022, it had a dominant, 63.4% market share in the US, <a href="https://market.us/report/audiobooks-market/">as per IbisShare</a>.</p><p>I ran my own survey in November last year, asking people wanting to buy the audiobook version of this:</p><p>“Which platform would you be interested in getting this book on?”</p><p>Following 159 responses, the results illustrated Audible dominance – though one possibly challenged by Spotify:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67db50c2-9bd3-4710-81b2-cc560433b05e_1574x1234.png">          </a>77% of the 159 respondents intent on getting the audiobook marked Audible as one of their preferences (multiple selections were allowed) <p>It’s clear most people would prefer to use Audible. I’m sorry that the book is not yet available – we’re getting into Audible contributing to this.</p> Amazon’s monopolistic pricing with Kindle and Audible <p>“Take rate” refers to the percentage of revenue a platform takes from merchants selling on it. Take rate examples:</p>  <p>2.9% + $0.30: the take rate Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/en-nl/pricing">charges</a> per transaction</p>  <p>10%: the take rate that Substack charges (the newsletter platform this publication uses)</p>  <p>30%: the take rate Apple’s App Store and Google Play charges. This is the take rate that the EU is investigating, and which Epic Games has noisily contested.</p>  <p>30% + data transfer fees: the take rate Amazon Kindle charges for e-books priced at $9.99 or below. Data transfer fees refer to the cost of 3G or 4G connection to download the book – which fee is free for the customer, but is deducted from the publisher.</p>  <p>40%: the take rate Amazon.com charges for physical goods sold on their platform, such as books</p>  <p>50-60%: the take rate book stores typically charge when selling physical books</p>  <p>When it comes to audiobooks, Audible has alarmingly high take rates:</p>  <p>60%: take rate for audiobooks that are exclusively on Audible, meaning they cannot be sold anywhere else.</p>  <p>75%: the take rate for non-exclusive audiobooks.</p>  <p>A 75% take rate means authors need to sell 3x as much worth of revenue on Audible to make the same revenue as on any other platform. Let's take a specific example: my audiobook cost about $10,000 to produce (mostly in narrator costs). Selling it as $20, how many sales would it take on Audible – a platform with a 75% take rate – versus on Apple Books – one with a 30% take rate – to break even? The numbers:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa293566b-0de8-4af8-a68b-aaa48e88261d_1816x706.png">          </a>For the author/publisher being paid the same amount, Audible generates 7x the revenue than Apple Books, thanks to having a 75% take rate, versus a 30% one. Massive difference <p>Clearly, having a 75% take rate is booming business for Audible!</p><p>But how can Amazon command such sky-high take rates for what is effectively storing and streaming mp3 files, as well as building and maintaining the Audible app? It’s most likely because they dominate the market and can charge almost what they like because customers prefer Audible.</p><p>A take rate for digital goods that’s above 50% is something I associate with monopolistic pricing. Already on Amazon Kindle, Amazon sets a 65% take rate for any book priced at $10 or above. So, when buying the $25.99 ebook on Amazon, Amazon makes $16.90, and the publisher (me!) gets $9.</p><p>Monopolistic pricing is bad for consumers. Have you noticed there are few to no ebooks priced between $10 and $20? They are either $9.99, or start from $20-21 upwards.</p><p>Amazon’s Kindle pricing policy makes it illogical to price ebooks between the $10 and $20 range because books priced between this range result in less revenue for the publisher, than if they sold the book at $9.99:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7bd09127-b4dd-4382-a9f5-23976d8a9353_1822x630.png">          </a>A $20 Kindle book generates about as much revenue for a publisher than a $9.99 does. And for all e-books priced above $10, Amazon takes 65% of revenue <p>This pricing policy most likely means e-books that would otherwise be listed in the $10-20 range, are sold to customers for $10 more.</p><p>Regarding Amazon’s Kindle hardware, two things can be argued as defences:</p>  <p>Amazon does not “punish” books e-books sold outside of Amazon Kindle with a worse royalty rate</p>  <p>Amazon created Kindle and its software ecosystem from scratch; a sizable investment. Without Amazon’s Kindle device, the market for e-books would likely be much smaller</p>   Audible’s smart play to lock out competitors <p>Interestingly, Audible has a significantly higher take rate rate for audiobooks (60% or 75%) than Kindle has for e-books (30% or 65%), despite Audible not having created custom hardware for audiobooks. It has something just as valuable though: the largest exclusive collection of audiobooks!</p><p>Audible manages to maintain its lead in exclusivity by offering to lower its take rate for Audible-exclusive audiobooks. And if we assume that Audible, indeed, has 65% market share: then a publisher will probably make more money if it releases the audiobook exclusively on Audible, and gets paid 62% more per book (by being offered a 40% royalty, instead of a 25% one. Therefore, it makes $4 on a $10 audiobook, rather than $2.50).</p><p>Until Audible’s market share drops below 50%, it’s a financially bad decision to not sell audiobooks exclusively on Audible. With this tactic, Audible achieves two things at once:</p>  <p>Maintain a very high 60% take rate by dominating the audiobooks market</p>  <p>Strengthen its status by incentivizing audiobooks to be exclusive to Audible</p>   Best-selling fiction author takes on Audible <p>In 2022, best-selling fantasy novel author, Brandon Sanderson, had concluded that the way Audible treats authors and publishers is unfair. He made the then unprecedented move of not releasing his latest audiobooks on Audible, at all; instead making them available for purchase directly, and putting them on Spotify. <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2022">In his words:</a></p><blockquote><p>“But Audible has grown to a place where it’s very bad for authors. It’s a good company doing bad things. (...)</p><p>They treat authors very poorly. Particularly indie authors. The deal Audible demands of them is unconscionable, and I’m hoping that providing market forces (and talking about the issue with a megaphone) will encourage change in a positive direction. (...)</p><p>Each book you buy somewhere else [than Audible] helps break open this field. It will lead to lower prices, fewer subscription models, and better pay for authors. Plus, these partners I’ve gone to really deserve the support for being willing to try to change things.”</p></blockquote><p>Sanderson’s effort to force Audible to treat authors more fairly seemed to work. A year later, Audible offered a much better financial deal for Sanderson, who took the deal, but only because Amazon said they’d roll out the same royalty structure to all authors. From Sanderson’s follow-up post:</p><blockquote><p>“Audible has promised to release their new royalty system for all authors sometime in 2024, though I should be testing it in the next month or so.</p><p>And…if you’ll allow me a moment, I’d like to say that this feels good. It isn’t what I wanted, but I’d begun to think that nothing would ever change–that even my voice, loud though it can be, wouldn’t be enough. Yet change IS possible.”</p></blockquote> Audible drags its feet <p>In July, Audible <a href="https://www.audible.com/about/newsroom/audibles-new-royalty-model-more-opportunities-for-authors-and-publishers">announced</a> a new royalty model with fairer rates for authors and publishers, is coming. However, the announcement lacks specifics, and the model doesn’t apply to authors like me.</p><p>Amazon encourages authors to reach out to Audible over an email “for more information.” I did this, asking how I can be part of the same royalty model that was promised for all authors to come in 2024. I received no meaningful answer.</p><p>Audible has no incentive to lower its take rates. The company would be giving up revenue, and unless there’s a competitor, or a regulator, forcing them to change course, it runs counter to the company’s interests.</p><p>I predict that eventually a regulator could launch a probe into potentially anti-competitive pricing practices by Audible. But if it happens, a resolution is years away. Meanwhile, customers will face higher audiobook prices, and authors and publishers on Audible will continue to de-prioritize audiobooks due to the relatively low earnings, compared to paperbacks and e-books.</p> If possible, avoid Audible for audiobooks <p>Audible is a fantastic product for customers, and Amazon has done a lot to make audiobooks more popular and widespread. Even so, it continues to treat authors and publishers poorly, offering pretty empty-looking commitments to improve things. Know that any time you purchase an audiobook on Audible, 60-75% goes directly to Amazon. On other platforms, this rate is never more than 30%. So, even if you spend the same amount on an audiobook outside of Audible, the author/publisher earns at least double.</p><p>I have no illusions about changing a Big Tech giant’s policy for audiobook authors. This is especially true after seeing what happened with Brandon Sanderson, who <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/regarding-audible">selflessly fought to secure</a> a better deal for all authors, only for Amazon to not change anything for most of them.</p><p>If you would like to see more and better audiobooks at more competitive prices, then purchasing audiobooks anywhere except Audible is a small thing that can, over time, make a difference.</p> Spotify to challenge Audible? <p>The most straightforward way to make Audible offer fairer pricing to authors is if it faces a significant competitor which enables authors to deprioritize Audible.</p><p>Spotify is a product for which audiobooks are a pretty natural extension of its existing offering. Spotify has been aggressively investing in this area; it came up with the concept of 10 hours of free audiobooks for paying subscribers, while balancing royalties at a level well above Audible’s.</p><p>It’s strange to find myself rooting for an already giant company; Spotify is valued at $100B, in this potential audiobook battle between two titans. Still, it feels like Spotify operates with a startup mentality: they want to aggressively grow, and treat customers and authors alike as best they can. Currently, Audible is a cash cow product, where the likely business goal is to keep extracting revenue from the customer base, and to innovate as little as necessary, all while growing increasingly complacent.</p><p>A lack of “hustle” is visible in how Audible operates today. As a reminder, the primary reason why The Software Engineer’s Guidebook is not on Audible, but can be purchased on every other relevant marketplace, is that Audible takes 2-3x longer to approve and list an audiobook than any competitor.</p><p>Are market forces gathering which will force Audible to change its ways? While we wait to find out, you can get the new audiobook of my latest title <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy">on any of these platforms</a>.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the audiobook of “The Software Engineer's Guidebook”. It has been a long process, but I’m really happy with how the spoken word version has turned out. There are many ways to purchase this title which support myself as an author/publisher. And who knows, it should be on Audible soon, too; as and when the world’s most important audiobook platform gets around to listing it.</p> 2. Creating an audiobook <p>With the Audible question out of the way, let me share the steps I took to create the audiobook itself.</p><p>An audiobook is simply a series of mp3 files with metadata. Each file represents a part, or a chapter, of a book. For example, the structure of my audiobook is:</p>  <p>A note for the audiobook.mp3</p>  <p>Preface.mp3</p>  <p>Introduction.mp3</p>  <p>Part I: Developer career fundamentals.mp3</p>  <p>Chapter 1: Career paths.mp3</p>  <p>(other chapters…)</p>  <p>Chapter 26: Lifelong learning.mp3</p>  <p>Chapter 27: Further reading.mp3</p>  <p>Acknowledgments.mp3</p>  <p>The metadata contains the title, the description, keywords, ISBN number, and the additional files for the audiobook.</p><p>ISBN number is an interesting one for first-time authors / publishers. All books, e-books, and audiobooks need an ISBN. meaning International Standard Book Number. This number is like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">uuid</a> that is unique for not just each book, but for each edition (e.g. second edition), and format (e.g. hardcover / softcover). However, the number remains the same.</p><p>An ISBN number is surprisingly expensive: one <a href="https://www.myidentifiers.com/identify-protect-your-book/isbn/buy-isbn">costs</a> around $125, but it gets cheaper when buying in bulk (e.g. 10 <a href="https://www.myidentifiers.com/identify-protect-your-book/isbn/buy-isbn">costs</a> $300, and 1,000 costs $1,500, meaning the cost per number is reduced to $1.50). As a self-published author, I’m surprised by how expensive a unique number is.</p><p>ISBN numbers can be used to “lock in” a publication to a platform. Digital publishing platforms like Amazon’s Kindle (e-book), and Spotify’s Findaway platforms offer ISBN numbers gratis. The catch is that ISBN numbers on platforms cannot be used to distribute elsewhere: an e-book with an ISBN number issued by Kindle cannot be used to distribute on other platforms.</p> Finding a narrator <p>Professional-grade audiobooks need to satisfy a few requirements:</p>  <p>The recording needs to meet technical specifications: 192kbps bit rate (or higher), sample rate of 44.1kHz, bit depth of 16 bits.</p>  <p>Recording needs to happen in a quiet place, with good-enough microphone and other recording equipment, and also decent acoustics</p>  <p>For nonfiction books, the tone and pace need to be constant or it’s not a great listening experience!</p>  <p>You can narrate an audiobook as a solo project, but it’s a lot of work: it takes practice to develop a “recording voice” for audiobooks, you need to hydrate while recording to maintain the vocal performance, and keep a steady, consistent tone and pace throughout.</p><p>Professional audiobook narrators can record 4-8 hours of material per day. Non-professionals take much longer to produce a lot less: re-recording of sentences and even individual words takes time, and one hour of “clean” recording could take 2-3 hours to record.</p><p>I decided to hire a professional voice actor who's an expert at recording audiobooks. As a bonus, some voice professionals do the editing, too: meaning they deliver an mp3 that’s close to being the final version.</p><p>Here are popular platforms for finding narrators:</p>  <p><a href="https://help.acx.com/s/article/what-is-acx">ACX</a>: Amazon’s audiobook narration marketplace. It is available only for businesses registered in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, however. As my business is in the Netherlands, I was unable to use it.</p>  <p><a href="http://voices.com">Voices.com</a>: one of the leading sites to search and audition voice actors. Sadly, I had a poor experience: after registering and posting the role for the narrator of my book, the site’s ML algorithm <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1832882636395597958">immediately banned me</a>. While customer support followed up two days later and apologized, I was already trialing other platforms.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.voquent.com/">Voquent</a>: This site has a dedicated team that tries to understand your project, sends demo voices, and offers auditions. You can browse and listen to samples from narrators before requesting an audition.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.ahabtalent.com/">Ahab Talent</a>: Created by one of the biggest book publishers in the world – Penguin Random House – initially for their own audiobook production. It’s now open to anyone creating audiobooks. Incredibly, the site does not charge audiobook creators or voice actors! It has the best selection of audiobook-focused voice actors. However, my registration took more than a week to approve.</p>  <p>Posting on social media. After I <a href="https://x.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1832882636395597958">posted on social media</a> about the frustration with Voices.com, I received messages from several narrators. The tricky part was that there is no audition process, unlike with other channels.</p>  <p>The concept of an audition was new to me as a first-time audiobook publisher! When narrowing down narrators based on pre-recorded samples, it’s apparently common practice to send audition requests for up to a few minutes of material, unpaid.</p><p>In my case, I tried to have as few auditions as possible by relying on pre-recorded samples. After all, auditions are additional work for these people. In the end, I had two auditions on Voquent, and two on Ahab. I found the narrator of my new audiobook book, Nikola Hamilton, on Ahab.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2233fb70-4312-4b3b-b90c-630c2805b025_1600x848.png">          </a>The interface of Ahab. It was built so book publishers can run multiple voice castings: take in lots of auditions, narrow down to a few top candidates, and then hire those folks. <p>Finding the ideal voice is tricky. I did not predict how difficult it would be to find the “right” voice for my book. I must have listened to 300+ demos, and the biggest problem I had is that most sites offering voice actors for hire seem to specialize in shorter form voice work like adverts, and there is no way to filter voice actors who have produced at least one nonfiction audiobook. So, regardless of how I set filters, I still had 500+ matching profiles, without knowing if they were even interested in doing a lengthy audiobook.</p><p>Ahab Talent was the first site that allowed me to filter based on the number of audiobooks produced, and by the genre.</p> Making an offer and auditioning <p>The most common payment type in the audiobook industry is a price PFH (per finished hour). PFH means the voice actor does the work of retakes and editing of the audio track, like removing pauses.</p><p>When listing a project on any platform, budget and pricing is set up front, for voice actors to know whether to invest their time in auditioning.</p><p>I offered $500 PFH on all platforms. This was after doing research that suggested the common range PFH is closer to $200-250 for less experienced narrators, and $400-500 for the more experienced.</p><p>Final audiobook length can be estimated based on wordcount. The Software Engineer's Guidebook contains 130,000 words (which is pretty long at 400 pages of above-average page size. Online calculators estimated a total listening time of around 15 hours. In the end, this estimate was accurate to the minute: 15 hours, 9 seconds!</p><p>The audition turnarounds took only 24 hours, and I had confirmed my narrator within hours of hearing their audition.</p> Iterating on the recording <p>After finding the right voice, here’s how I proceeded:</p>  <p>Meet-and-greet call. We hopped on a call, where I learned more about the background of Nikola, shared context on the book, and what I wanted it to sound like. It turned out Nikola is an audio engineer in an audiobook studio, who has been recording audiobooks and narrating since 2020.</p>  <p>Setting milestones. I suggested a milestone of payments per 4 hours of recording. Nikola agreed that this is fair for both of us.</p>  <p>Drafting and signing a short contract. Contracting is outside the scope of a platform like Ahab: and it is down to the author and the narrator to strike an agreement. I asked Claude to draft a basic audiobook recording contract, which I read carefully and edited where needed, we signed, and that was that! I find GenAI very useful for low-risk contract generation, whereas in the past I would have stuck with using an online template, or to an agreement over email.</p>  <p>Feedback on each recording. Nikola got to work and was very quick to get over recordings: he completed 4 hours of recordings every 2-3 days. I listened to them and made notes of what to re-record. These were sparse: around 1-2 sentences per section.</p>  <p>Recording my voice parts. I recorded the preface and acknowledgements. From producing the podcast, I have the right equipment, and a quiet recording area.</p>  <p>Audio editing and producing the master files. Nikola re-recorded the edits (called “pickups” in in audiobook lingo), did audio equalisation (EQ), and ensured the final files met the specifications for the Findaway Voices platform which the audiobook is published on.</p>  <p>Correcting the print and e-book editions was an unexpected outcome. The audiobook recording process revealed nearly a dozen minor errors in The Software Engineer’s Guidebook, despite two additional editing passes by Dominic, the hawk-eyed editor who edits The Pragmatic Engineer. Most were nuanced and almost impossible to spot unless thoroughly reading the book – or, in this case, hearing every word!</p> Submitting the audiobook <p>With the mp3 files recorded and complete, I needed to decide where to submit the audiobook for distribution. The options were:</p>  <p>Register to each site/marketplace separately. Register to ACX (working around the region requirement, somehow), to Spotify as a publisher, Apple Books, Google Play, and many others. This seemed like a lot of work. Also, being based in the Netherlands, the KYC (know your customer) checks were likely to be lengthy at some of these places.</p>  <p>Use <a href="https://publishdrive.com/">PublishDrive</a>. This is an e-book and audiobook distribution platform I use to distribute my e-books for platforms other than Kindle. They support all major audiobook marketplaces.</p>  <p>Use <a href="https://www.findawayvoices.com/">Findaway Voices</a> by Spotify. Also an audiobook distribution platform. The platform pays out <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/findawayvoices/article/royalty-rates/">100% of royalties from Spotify</a> (meaning Spotify has a 0% take rate, for now that is) and 80% from other platforms.</p>  <p>In the end, I chose Findaway Voices, thanks to its first-class support for Spotify. Also, I’d like to support Spotify as a much-needed challenger to Audible’s monopolistic pricing practices.</p><p>I had to do a few more things before submitting the audiobook:</p>  <p>Create a cover image. As with all my book covers in the past, I used Canva.</p>  <p>Fill out metadata. The same as the e-book edition. For ISBN, I used my own ISBN from a previously-purchased batch of 10.</p>  <p>Pricing. An interesting aspect of pricing is “library pricing.” Book lenders buy audiobooks at a different (higher) price, and then lend the books out, one at a time. The suggested rate is 2-3x the retail book price. I set my retail list price to $19.99 and my library list price to $40. Actual prices may drop when platforms lower their take rate, as I understand.</p>  <p>After submitting, it takes up to a week for Findaway Voices to approve a book. In my case, this was cut to a day, likely due to having direct contact with the Spotify Audiobooks team, who reached out after hearing that an audiobook version of The Software Engineer's Guidebook was to be published.</p><p>With that, the audiobook was set to “go live” on the agreed publishing date, which is today! You can listen to a sample and <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/#buy">get the 15-hour-long audiobook</a>, here. (Print and ebook versions <a href="https://www.engguidebook.com/">also available</a>.)</p> The financials and time investment <p>How much money and time did it cost to create the audiobook, with the manuscript already done? Here’s how things added up, money-wise:</p>  <p>$8,500 for the narrator ($500 per recorded hour, plus an added bonus for a timely delivery)</p>  <p>$1,000 for working with a narrator which did not work out in the end, but was a valuable learning experience on how much work creating an audiobook is.</p>  <p>~$10 for <a href="https://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/">Audiobook builder</a> to create the m4b file</p>  <p>$9,510 in total narrator costs</p>  <p>Not included in the costs as I did it myself: creating the audiobook landing page, and finalizing the <a href="https://gergelyorosz.gumroad.com/l/dlzxi">“buy directly from the author” landing page</a>.</p><p>Time-wise, it took about three months of time investment from my end. Two months was finding my final narrator, and learning about the audiobook publishing process. Creating the final recording took about a month.</p><p>I can see nonfiction audiobook publishing being disrupted by GenAI. It is currently quite expensive to create a high-quality audiobook, and it takes a lot of time. At the same time, it’s hard to break even on such investments. This means that for most books, it doesn’t make sense to create an audiobook in this “traditional” way, with a professional narrator.</p><p>One area that GenAI is pretty good at is “voice cloning.” I can see more tools offering to create nonfiction audiobook cheaply: and larger publishers jumping on this, to churn out a lot more, GenAI-generated audiobooks than before.</p><p></p>

<p>This post looks at implementing an Open ID Connect identity provider in Microsoft Entra External ID. Auth0 is used as the identity provider and an ASP.NET Core application is used to test the authentication. Microsoft Entra External ID federates to Auth0. </p>



<p>Client code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID supports federation using OpenID Connect and was used to create the Auth0 OpenID Connect client. The settings configured in the portal must align with those in the Auth0 identity provider. The Entra External ID OIDC client would work with most IDPs, since standard OpenID Connect is used.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The corresponding client configuration was created in Auth0:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Auth0 client in this setup returns the email in the name claim. This must match in the claim mapping in Entra External ID. The email claim is switched to use the name claim. Depending on the mappings, different claim mappings are required. The values are read from the id_token.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The correct callback URLs MUST be set on the Auth0 client configuration. Entra External ID requires the following redirectly URLs:</p>


  https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-ID&gt;/federation/oauth2

https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com/federation/oauth2
  


<p></p>



<p>The values are added to the Auth0 client. See the Entra External ID <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers#set-up-your-openid-connect-identity-provider">docs</a>.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the OpenID Connect client is setup, the identity provider can used in the Entra External ID user flow. Select the required user flow:</p>







<p></p>



<p>And select the Identity Providers and add the OpenID connect IdP.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To test, an <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">ASP.NET Core application</a> using Microsoft.Identity.Web was implemented to authenticate against Entra External ID. When the user is redirected the authenticate, the sign-in with Auth0 option is displayed.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well, but setting up the mappings can be difficult if you don’t know the mapping. With this it is possible now to use identities from almost any identity provider. </p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  I’m writing to highly recommend the article “How to link an application protocol to an OpenID Federation 1.0 trust layer” by Vladimir Dzhuvinov. In it, he defines two kinds of integrity for Federations, and describes how to achieve them: Federation Integrity, which is defined as: This ensures mutual trust between two entities is established always […]

<p>I’m writing to highly recommend the article “<a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">How to link an application protocol to an OpenID Federation 1.0 trust layer</a>” by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a>.  In it, he defines two kinds of integrity for Federations, and describes how to achieve them:</p>
 
 Federation Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
This ensures mutual trust between two entities is established always from a common trust anchor. Any resolved metadata and policies that govern the client application and the OpenID provider in a transaction will then fall under the rules of the same federation and thus will be aligned and consistent with one another.
</p></blockquote>
 Metadata Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
It ensures the trust chains for an entity to a given trust anchor will invariably result in consistent metadata and policies. The natural way to achieve this is for the federation topology under a trust anchor to form a tree. Topologies that lead to multiple paths from a leaf entity to a trust anchor are to be avoided.
</p></blockquote>
 
<p>The article also explores how application protocols, such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> or digital <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">wallet protocols</a>, can achieve those properties in practice (and when they do and don’t need to).</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that, as a result of Vladimir’s and others’ thinking about the topic, we just added a section on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-41.html#name-federation-topologies">Federation Topologies</a> to the OpenID Federation specification, which provides concrete guidance on how to achieve Metadata Integrity.</p>
<p>I’ll stop here so as not to repeat all the useful content in Vladimir’s article.  By all means, <a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">give it read</a>!</p>

<p>This article looks at setting up an ASP.NET Core application to use Azure Key Vault. When deployed to Azure, it works like in the Azure documentation but when working on development PCs, some changes are required for a smooth developer experience. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment">https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment</a></p>



<p>I develop using Visual Studio and manage multiple accounts and test environments. However, I frequently encounter access errors when using DefaultAzureCredentials. These errors typically occur because the account and tenant do not match the filter set in Visual Studio, or the user lacks access to the tenant. This issue arises often:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The problem can be resolved by using an application client secret to access the Azure Key Vault, implemented with the ChainedTokenCredential. The access client can be specified in the project’s user secrets, allowing it to function independently of the user account and the last filter used in Visual Studio. To set this up, a new Azure App registration was created, and a client secret was added. This client secret is then included in the dotnet user secrets for the project.</p>







<p></p>



<p>A Role assignment was added to the Azure Key Vault for the application service principal, and the necessary access role was configured. With the correct configuration in the user secrets on the development PC, the application can access the Azure Key Vault. This setup eliminates the need for Azure RBAC changes for each developer.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup local development credentials 



<p>The following Nuget packages can be used to integrate a Key Vault client in an ASP.NET Core application. Depending on how the client is setup, or what data is used from the Key Vault, different packages can be used.</p>



 
 Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets 



 Azure.Identity 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Certificates 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets 
 



<p></p>



<p>A ChainedTokenCredential is used to access the Key Vault, preventing the access issues associated with DefaultAzureCredential. In local development, a client credential is used via a secret, which can be stored in the dotnet user secrets. When a new developer joins the team, these user secrets can be shared, eliminating the need to modify Azure Key Vault RBAC settings for each new developer. This setup is ideal for development, as it avoids problems caused by incorrect tenants or user accounts in Visual Studio. For production or other deployments, a system-assigned managed identity is used.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DevelopmentAspNetCoreKeyVault;

public static class AppAccessCredentials
{
    public static ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials(IConfiguration configuration, bool isDevelopment)
    {
        if (!isDevelopment)
        {
            // Use a system assigned managed identity on production deployments
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:TenantId", string.Empty);
            var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientId", string.Empty);
            var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientSecret", string.Empty);

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(tenantId)) // DevOps
            {
                // Use DefaultAzureCredential if AzureCliCredential is not used in your DevOps
                return new ChainedTokenCredential(new AzureCliCredential());
            }

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The user secrets would have something like this:</p>


  {
  "EntraId": {
    // aspnetcore-keyvault-development-access
    "TenantId": "--tenant_id--",
    "ClientId": "--client_id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--secret--"
  }
}
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault directly in the application 



<p>The secret from the Azure Key Vault can be used directly in the code by using the SecretClient class from Azure.Identity. The AppAccessCredentials is used to return the chained credentials and the application is authenticated if the service principal from the App registration has the correct RBAC.</p>


  // Azure SDK direct
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(_configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]!),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(_configuration,
        _hostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()));

var secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("demosecret");
DemoSecret = secret!.Value.Value;
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault as a configuration 



<p>The AddAzureKeyVault method can be used to use the Azure Key as a further configuration option. I like this as all configuration is abstracted with the IConfiguration interface in the application. The AddAzureKeyVault takes the chained credential as a param.</p>


  var keyVault = builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"];
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(keyVault))
{
    builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]}"),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(builder.Configuration,
        builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()));
}
  


<p>The secret can be read anywhere in the code using the IConfiguration interface. This can be used in different ways and provides type safe ways of using the properties.</p>


  // ASP.NET Core configuration
// From from key vault using ASP.NET Core configuration integration
// Or from user secrets if offline, or fast startup is required
DemoSecretConfig = _configuration["demosecret"];
  


<p></p>



 Using user secrets for local development 



<p>Sometimes, you need to work offline or frequently restart the application. Constantly connecting to Azure Key Vault can slow down development. In such cases, it’s often more efficient to use dotnet user secrets instead of Azure Key Vault.</p>



 Note 



<p>This is a good and simple approach for developing applications which use Azure Key Vault. You can use a local key management system or whatever local developers use. The client secret should not be used in production deployments as the secret expires and there are better ways to secure the access for the application to Key Vault. System assigned managed identity is the best way to implement application access in Azure in production environments.</p>

<p>With the lens I have been using (harnessed consciousness through Web3 token engineering, perhaps for the purposes of individual and group consensus divination) the ideas I am talking about in this video and the beginning of the previous one are actually quite important. If you want to write me off as simply being angry, you’ve missed the point entirely. Though admittedly I do continue to be annoyed at the ongoing disconnect. We’re still human after all.</p>
<p>The fact that so few people seem to be able to engage on the topic of meta-cognition with regards to their digital media consumption seems to indicate that many are sleepwalking through life online, maybe especially the ones who loudly proclaim they are “awake.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the psychic ant computer relies on agents who respond to and act on subconscious cues while having little interest in exerting their own agency independent of the socio-technical systems into which they are embedded?</p>
<p>If that is the case, I guess I need to throw the whole “informed consent” framing out the window, because very, very few participants want to take ownership of their own thinking and inform THEMSELVES. The consumer model in the attention economy is quite powerful. I guess we shall see, because there’s not much time before data-driven, second order cybernetic governance protocols take center stage. Cultivate curiosity and devise better questions. There is always more to learn.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a> recently adopted three new specifications that build upon and provide new capabilities to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>.  But I’m not only happy about these because of the engineering benefits they bring.</p>
<p>I’m particularly happy because they bring new active contributors to the work, specifically <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-f-1495aa133/">Michael Fraser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-jaromin-54355647/">Łukasz Jaromin</a>, as well as continuing the strong work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a>, who’s become a leader in the space.  They’re also supported by a few veterans: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandhedberg/">Roland Hedberg</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selfissued/">yours truly</a>, plus now the full OpenID Connect working group.</p>
<p>Here’s the three new specifications, along with an abstract for each of them:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-extended-listing-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Extended Subordinate Listing</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification acts as an extension to OpenID Federation 1.0. It outlines methods to interact with a given Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple entity statements along with associated details in a single request.
</p></blockquote>
<p>2.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Wallet Architectures</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
As digital wallets become increasingly deployed for managing identity credentials, establishing an architecture for trusted communication is required to allow each participant in the ecosystem to evaluate other participants’ compliance with mutual trust frameworks and accomplish secure and trusted transactions.</p>
<p>This specification defines how to use OpenID Federation 1.0 to enhance the security and interoperability of wallet ecosystems, facilitating trust establishment among the parties and enabling secure metadata exchange and policy application across large scale deployments. It outlines the general architecture of a federated trust infrastructure for wallet ecosystems, identifying participant roles and describing the use of those roles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>3.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Relying Party Metadata Choices</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 specification to enable RPs to express a set of supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than just single values. This functionality is particularly useful when Automatic Registration, as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0, is used, since there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP what choices were made by the OP.

<p>One of the wonderful, yet also daunting, aspects of being in the Identity industry is realizing just how far-reaching and all-encompassing its scope and boundaries are. It’s why we need more than just technologists and standards wonks engaged in driving the future of this industry. I’ve been on stage at Identiverse and other conferences for many years challenging the Identirati to bring in people from other fields like User Experience Research, Law, Privacy, and more.</p>



<p>This is the challenge that the <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a> has taken on. You can check out how they are doing this on their website, via the Kim Cameron Award and the Vittorio Bertocci Award. Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arynn-crow-821761103/">Arynn Crow</a>, I had the chance to spend some time chatting with the 2024 Kim Cameron award winner, legal scholar <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-klutke-3ba8a1228/">Grace Klutke</a>, at Authenticate 2024. We talked (in my usual rambling sort of way) about ethics in Identity, and the broader impact on human rights, inclusion, and access (in the human and not the technical Authorization sense). You can read her reflection on her experience at the conference <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/news/2024-kim-cameron-awardee-reflections-grace-klutke/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Oh, and <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/donate/">support DIAF</a> if you can. They’re doing good, and necessary, work!  If DIAF continues to bring smart, talented, and motivated individuals like her from other fields into our industry, then we’ll be doing it right.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I started <a href="https://postgr.es/m/2CAD6FA7-DC25-48FC-80F2-8F203DECAE6A%40justatheory.com">a pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing a new
extension file organization and a search path <a href="https://pgpedia.info/g/guc.html" title="GUC - Grand Unified Configuration">GUC</a> for finding extensions.
The <a href="https://postgr.es/m/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD@justatheory.com">discussion</a> of <a href="https://www.df7cb.de">Christoph Berg</a>’s <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/"><code>extension_destdir</code> patch</a>
inspired this proposal. These threads cover quite a lot of territory, so I
want to pull together a more unified, public proposal.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>A number of challenges face extension users, thanks to extension file
organization in the Postgres core. The common thread among them is the need to
add extensions without changing the contents of the Postgres installation
itself.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>On Debian systems, the user account that creates extension packages lacks
permission to add files to Postgres install. But testing extensions requires
installing the extension where Postgres can find it. Moreover, extensions
ideally build against a clean Postgres install; adding an extension in order
to run <code>make installcheck</code> would pollute it.</p>
<p><a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/">Christoph’s patch</a> solves these problems by adding a second lookup
path for extensions and dynamic modules, so that Postgres can load them
directly from the package build directory.</p>
<p>Alas, the patch isn’t ideal, because it simply specifies a prefix and appends
the full <code>pg_config</code> directory paths to it. For example, if <code>--sharedir</code>
outputs <code>/opt/share</code> and <code>extension_destdir</code> GUC is set to <code>/tmp/build/myext</code>,
the patch will search in <code>/tmp/build/myext/opt/share</code>. This approach works for
the packaging use case, which explicitly uses full paths with a prefix, but
would be weird for other use cases.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut proposed an <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">alternate patch</a> with a new <code>GUC</code>,
<code>extension_control_path</code>, that provides a more typical search path pattern to
find extension control files, but doesn’t account for shared modules that ship
with an extension, requiring that they still live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Installing into custom directories requires the
undocumented <code>datadir</code> and <code>pkglibdir</code> variables:</p>
  <code>make install datadir=/else/where/share pkglibdir=/else/where/lib
</code>  <p>This pattern can probably be simplified.</p>
 OCI Immutability 
<p><a href="https://opencontainers.org" title="Open Container Initiative">OCI</a> (née Docker) images are immutable, while a container image runs on a
writeable but non-persistent file system. To install persistent extensions in
a container, one must create a persistent volume, map it to
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code>, and copy over all the extensions it needs (or muck with
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ongres/postgres-extensions-in-kubernetes?slide=14" title="Postgres Extensions in Kubernetes: StackGres">symlink magic</a>). Then do it again for shared object libraries (<code>PKGLIBDIR</code>),
and perhaps also for other <code>pg_config</code> directories, like <code>--bindir</code>. Once it’s
all set up, one can install a new extension and its files will be distributed
to the relevant persistent volumes.</p>
<p>This pattern makes upgrades tricky, because the core extensions are mixed in
with third-party extensions. Worse, the number of directories that must be
mounted into volumes depends on the features of an extension, increasing
deployment configuration complexity. It would be preferable to have all the
files for an extension in one place, rather than scattered across multiple
persistent volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut’s patch</a> addresses much of this issue by adding a
search path for extension control files and related data/share files
(generally SQL files). One can create a single volume with a <code>lib</code> directory
for shared modules and <code>share/extension</code> directory for control and data/share
files.</p>
 OCI Extension Images 
<p>However, an additional wrinkle is the ambition from the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CloudNativePg</a>
(<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a>) community to eliminate the need for a persistent volume, and rely
instead on mounting images that each contain all the files for a single
extension as their own volumes, perhaps using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume
feature</a>, (currently in alpha).</p>
<p>This feature requires all the file in an extension to live in a single
directory, a volume mounted to an extension image contains all the files
required to use the extension. The search path patches proposed so far do not
enable this behavior.</p>
 Postgres.app Immutability 
<p>The macOS <a href="https://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app: The easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac">Postgres.app</a> supports extensions. But installing one into
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code> changes the contents of the Postgres.app bundle,
breaking Apple-required signature validation. The OS will no longer be able to
validate that the app is legit and refuse to start it.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut’s <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">new patch</a> addresses this issue as well, with
all the same caveats as for the <a>packager testing</a>
challenges.</p>
 Solution 
<p>To further address these issues, this RFC proposes to change file organization
and lookup patterns for PostgreSQL extensions.</p>
 Extension Directories 
<p>First, when an extension is installed, by default all of its files will live
in a single directory named for the extension. The contents include:</p>
 
 The Control file that describes extension 
 Subdirectories for SQL, shared modules, docs, binaries, etc. 
 
<p>Subdirectories roughly correspond to the <code>pg_config --*dir</code> options:</p>
 
 <code>bin</code>: Executables 
 <code>doc</code>: Documentation files 
 <code>html</code>: HTML documentation files 
 <code>lib</code>: Dynamically loadable modules 
 <code>locale</code>: Locale support files 
 <code>man</code>: Manual pages 
 <code>share</code>: SQL and other architecture-independent support files 
 
<p>This layout reduces the cognitive overhead for understanding what files belong
to what extension. Want to know what’s included in the <code>widget</code> extension?
Everything is in the <code>widget</code> directory. It also simplifies installation of an
extension: one need add only a directory named for and containing the files
required by the extension.</p>
 Configuration Parameter 
<p>Add a new <code>pg_config</code> value that returns the directory into which extensions
will by default be installed:</p>
 <code> --extdir   show location of extensions
</code> <p>Its default value would be <code>$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension</code>, but could be
set at compile time like other configuration parameters. Its contents consist
of subdirectories that each contain an extension, as described in <a>Extension
Directories</a>. With a few extensions installed, it
would look something like:</p>
  <code>❯ ls -1 "$(pg_config --extdir)"
auto_explain
bloom
isn
pair
plperl
plpgsql
plv8
xml2
semver
vector
</code>   Extension Path 
<p>Add an extension lookup path GUC akin to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>, called
<code>extension_path</code>. It lists all the directories that Postgres will search for
extensions and their files. The default value for this GUC will be:</p>
  <code>extension_path = '$extdir'
</code>  <p>The special string <code>$extdir</code> corresponds to the <code>pg_config</code> option of the same
name, and function exactly as <code>$libdir</code> does for the <code>dynamic_library_path</code>
GUC, substituting the appropriate value.</p>
 Lookup Execution 
<p>Update PostgreSQL’s <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> command to search the directories in
<code>extension_path</code> for an extension. For each directory in the list, it will
look for the extension control file in a directory named for the extension:</p>
  <code>$dir/$extension/$extension.control
</code>  <p>The first match will be considered the canonical location for the extension.
For example, if Postgres finds the control file for the <code>pair</code> at
<code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/pair.control</code>, it will load files only from the
appropriate subdirectories, e.g.:</p>
 
 SQL files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/share</code> 
 Shared module files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/lib</code> 
 
 PGXS 
<p>Update the extension installation behavior of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> to install extension
files into the new layout. A new variable, <code>$EXTDIR</code>, will define the
directory into which to install extension directories, and default to
<code>$(pg_config --extdir)</code>. It can be set to any literal path, which must exist
and be accessible by the PostgreSQL service.</p>
<p>The <code>$EXTENSION</code> variable will be changed to allow only one extension name. If
it’s set, the installation behavior will be changed for the following
variables:</p>
 
 <code>EXTENSION</code>: Creates <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION</code>, installs
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/$EXTENSION.control</code> 
 <code>MODULES</code> and <code>MODULE_big</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code> 
 <code>MODULEDIR</code>: Removed 
 <code>DATA</code> and <code>DATA_built</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share</code> 
 <code>DATA_TSEARCH</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share/tsearch_data</code> 
 <code>DOCS</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/doc</code> 
 <code>PROGRAM</code>, <code>SCRIPTS</code> and <code>SCRIPTS_built</code>: Installed into
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/bin</code> 
 
<p>Each of these locations can still be overridden by setting one of the
(currently undocumented) <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/Makefile.global.in#L82-L90">installation location options</a> (e.g., <code>datadir</code>,
<code>pkglibdir</code>, etc.).</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>External projects that install extensions without using PGXS, like</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>, must also be updated to either follow the same pattern or to
delegate installation to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
 Control File 
<p>The <code>directory</code> control file parameter will be deprecated and ignored.</p>
<p>The <code>module_pathname</code> parameter should only name a shared module in the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory of an extension directory. Any existing use of a <code>$libdir</code> prefix
will be stripped out and ignored before replacing the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string
in SQL files. The implication for loading extension dynamic modules<a>1</a>
differs from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Dynamic Loading">existing behavior</a> as follows:</p>
 
 If the name is an absolute path, the given file is loaded. 
 If the name does not contain a directory part, the file is searched for in
the in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory
(<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code>). 
 Otherwise (the file was not found in the path, or it contains a
non-absolute directory part), the dynamic loader will try to take the name
as given, which will most likely fail. (It is unreliable to depend on the
current working directory.) 
 
 Use Cases 
<p>Here’s how the proposed file layout and <code>extension_path</code> GUC addresses the
<a>use cases</a> that inspired this RFC.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>A packager who wants to run tests without modifying a PostgreSQL install would
follow these steps:</p>
 
 Prepend a directory under the packaging install to the <code>extension_path</code>
GUC. The resulting value would be something like
<code>$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/$(pg_config --extdir):$extdir</code>. 
 Install the extension into that directory:
<code>make install EXTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT</code> 
 Make sure the PostgreSQL server can access the directory, then run
<code>make installcheck</code> 
 
<p>This will allow PostgreSQL to find and load the extension during the tests.
The Postgres installation will not have been modified; only the
<code>extension_path</code> will have changed.</p>
 OCI/Kubernetes 
<p>To allow extensions to be added to a OCI container and to persist beyond its
lifetime, one or more <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/" title="Docker Docs: Volumes">volumes</a> could be used. Some examples:</p>
 
 Mount a persistent volume for extensions and prepend the path to that
directory to the <code>extension_path</code> GUC. Then Postgres can find any
extensions installed there, and they will persist. Files for all
extensions will live on a single volume. 
 Or, to meet a desire to keep some extensions separate (e.g., open-source
vs company-internal extensions), two or more persistent volumes could be
mounted, as long as they’re all included in <code>extension_path</code>, are
accessible by PostgreSQL, and users take care to install extensions in the
proper locations. 
 
 CNPG Extension Images 
<p>To meet the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a> ambition to “install” an extension by mounting a single
directory for each, create separate images for each extension, then use the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume feature</a> (currently in alpha) to mount each as a
read-only volume in the appropriate subdirectory of a directory included in
<code>extension_path</code>. Thereafter, any new containers would simply have to mount
all the same extension image volumes to provide the same extensions to all
containers.</p>
 Postgres.app 
<p>To allow extension installation without invalidating the Postgres.app bundle
signature, the default configuration could prepend a well-known directory
outside the app bundle, such as <code>/Library/Application Support/Postgres</code>, to
<code>extension_path</code>. Users wishing to install new extensions would then need to
point the <code>EXTDIR</code> parameter to that location, e.g.,</p>
  <code>$ make install EXTDIR="/Library/Application Support/Postgres"`
</code>  <p>Or the app could get trickier, setting the <code>--extdir</code> value to that location
so that users don’t need to use <code>EXTDIR</code>. As long as <code>extension_path</code> includes
both the bundle’s own extension directory and this external directory,
Postgres will be able to find and load all extensions.</p>
 Extension Directory Examples 
<p>A core extension like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/citext.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: citext — a case-insensitive character string type">citext</a> would have a structure similar to:</p>
 <code>citext
├── citext.control
├── lib
│   ├── citext.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── citext
│       │   └── citext.bc
│       └── citext.index.bc
└── share
    ├── citext--1.0--1.1.sql
    ├── citext--1.1--1.2.sql
    ├── citext--1.2--1.3.sql
    ├── citext--1.3--1.4.sql
    ├── citext--1.4--1.5.sql
    ├── citext--1.4.sql
    └── citext--1.5--1.6.sql
</code> <p>The subdirectory for a pure SQL extension named “pair” in a directory named
“pair” that looks something like this:</p>
 <code>pair
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── pair.control
├── doc
│   ├── html
│   │   └── pair.html
│   └── pair.md
└── share
    ├── pair--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── pair--1.1.sql
</code> <p>A binary application like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_top/" title="PGXN: pg_top">pg_top</a> would live in the <code>pg_top</code> directory,
structured something like:</p>
 <code>pg_top
├── HISTORY.rst
├── INSTALL.rst
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── bin
│   └── pg_top
└── doc
    └── man
        └── man3
            └── pg_top.3
</code> <p>And a C extension like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver/" title="PGXN: semver">semver</a> would live in the semver directory and be
structured something like:</p>
 <code>semver
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── semver.control
├── doc
│   └── semver.md
├── lib
│   ├── semver.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── semver
│       │   └── semver.bc
│       └── semver.index.bc
└── share
    ├── semver--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── semver--1.1.sql
</code>  Phase Two: Preloading 
<p>The above-proposed <a>solution</a> does not allow shared modules
distributed with extensions to compatibly be loaded via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library
preloading</a>, because extension modules wil no longer live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Users can specify full paths, however. For example,
instead of:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>One could use the path to the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '/opt/postgres/extensions/pg_partman_bgw/lib/pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But users will likely find this pattern cumbersome, especially for extensions
with multiple shared modules. Perhaps some special syntax could be added to
specify a single extension module, such as:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '$extension_path::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But this overloads the semantics of <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> and the code
that processes it rather heavily, not to mention the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> command.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a follow up to the <a>solution</a> proposed above, this
RFC proposes additional changes to PostgreSQL.</p>
 Extension Preloading 
<p>Add new GUCs that complement <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library preloading</a>, but for extension
module preloading:</p>
 
 <code>shared_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>session_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>local_preload_extensions</code> 
 
<p>Each takes a list of extensions for which to preload shared modules. In
addition, another new GUC, <code>local_extensions</code>, will contain a list of
administrator-approved extensions users are allowed to include in
<code>local_preload_extensions</code>. This GUC complements <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCAL-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: local_preload_libraries"><code>local_preload_libraries</code></a>’s
use of a <code>plugins</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then modify the preloading code to also preload these files. For each
extension in a list, it would:</p>
 
 Search each path in <code>extension_path</code> for the extension. 
 When found, load all the shared libraries from <code>$extension/lib</code>. 
 
<p>For example, to load all shared modules in the <code>pg_partman</code> extension, set:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman'
</code>  <p>To load a single shared module from an extension, give its name after the
extension name and two colons. This example will load only the
<code>pg_partman_bgw</code> shared module from the <code>pg_partman</code> extension:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>This change requires a one-time change to existing preload configurations on
upgrade.</p>
 Future: Deprecate LOAD 
<p>For a future change, consider modifying <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> to support shared
module-only extensions. This would allow extensions with no SQL component,
such as <code>auto_explain</code>, to be handled like any other extension; it would live
under one of the directories in <code>extension_path</code> with a structure like this:</p>
 <code>auto_explain
├── auto_explain.control
└── lib
   ├── auto_explain.dylib
   └── bitcode
       ├── auto_explain
       │   └── auto_explain.bc
       └── auto_explain.index.bc
</code> <p>Note the <code>auto_explain.control</code> file. It would need a new parameter to
indicate that the extension includes no SQL files, so <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and
related commands wouldn’t try to find them.</p>
<p>With these changes, extensions could become the primary, recommended interface
for extending PostgreSQL. Perhaps the <code>LOAD</code> command could be deprecated, and
the <code>*_preload_libraries</code> GUCs along with it.</p>
 Compatibility Issues 
 
 The <code>module_pathname</code> control file variable would prefer the name of a
shared module. The code that replaces the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string in SQL
files would to strip out the <code>$libdir/</code> prefix, if present. 
 The behavior of loading dynamic modules that ship with extensions (i.e.,
the value of the <code>AS</code> part of <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>) would change to look for
a library name (with no directory part) in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the
extension directory. 
 The <code>directory</code> control file parameter and the <code>MODULEDIR</code> PGXS variable
would be deprecated and ignored. 
 <code>*_preload_libraries</code> would no longer be used to find extension modules
without full paths. Administrators would have to remove module names from
these GUCs and add the relevant extension names to the new
<code>*_preload_extensions</code> variables. To ease upgrades, we might consider
adding a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink shared modules into
<code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 <code>LOAD</code> would no longer be able to find shared modules included with
extensions, unless we add a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink
shared modules into <code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 The <code>EXTENSION</code> PGXS variable will no longer support multiple extension
names. 
 The change in extension installation locations must also be adopted by
projects that don’t use PGXS for installation, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>. Or perhaps
they could be modified to also use PGXS. Long term it might be useful to
replace the <code>Makefile</code>-based PGXS with another installation system,
perhaps a CLI. 
 
 Out of Scope 
<p>This RFC does not include or attempt to address the following issue:</p>
 
 How to manage third-party shared libraries. Making system dependencies
consistent in a OCI/Kubernetes environment or for non-system binary
packaging patterns presents its own challenges, though they’re not
specific to PostgreSQL or the patterns described here. Research is ongoing
into potential solutions, and will be addressed elsewhere.

<p>The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family’s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter. It was a remarkable documentary effort that solidified our memories of that year. But dad was aware of the tradeoff. A favorite joke became: “Q: How was your trip?” “A: I won’t know until the film is developed!” He realized that interposing a camera between himself and the people he encountered had altered the direct experience he and they would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>This weekend I heard <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/392-technology-culture">Christine Rosen’s</a> modern version of that critique in a discussion of her new book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1454717522">The extinction of experience: Being human in a disembodied world</a>. I listened to the podcast on a hike, my noise-canceling Airpods insulating me from the sounds of the creek trail and from the people walking along it.</p>
<p>It’s complicated. When hiking alone I greatly value the ability to listen to interesting people and ideas while exercising, breathing fresh air, and moving through the natural world. The experience is embodied in one sense, disembodied in another. Reading the same material while lying on the couch would be a different, and arguably more extreme, form of disembodiment. But when I passed a family of four, all walking along looking at their phones, that felt wrong. When people are together they should actually be together, right? You’ve doubtless felt the same when seeing people in this together-but-not-together state.</p>
<p>Lately Pete Buttigieg has been urging us to spend less time online, more time IRL having face-to-face conversations. I think that’s right. There’s no doubt that the decline of social capital described in Robert Putnam’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a> has accelerated in the 30 years since he wrote that book. America’s tragic polarization is a predictable outcome. Without the institutions and cultural traditions that once brought us together, face-to-face, in non-political ways, we’re all too vulnerable to being herded into competing online echo chambers that magnify our differences and erase our common humanity. </p>
<p>I won’t be abandoning my mediated and disembodied life online, but I do need to participate in it less and more critically, and prioritize my unmediated and embodied life IRL. The pendulum has swung too far away from the direct experience of shared reality, and that hasn’t been good for me nor for my country, </p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a secure web application using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a>. The web application implements the backend for frontend security architecture (BFF) and deploys both technical stacks as one web application. HTTP only secure cookies are used to persist the session. <a href="https://documentation.openiddict.com/">OpenIddict </a>is used as the identity provider and the token issuer.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-oidc-vuejs">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-oidc-vuejs</a></p>



 Overview 



<p>The solution is deployed as a single OpenID Connect confidential client using a separate OpenIddict identity provider. The OpenID Connect client authenticates using the code flow with PKCE and a secret or a certificate. The UI part of the solution is deployed as part of the server application. Secure HTTP only cookies are used to persist the session after a successful authentication. No security flows are implemented in the client part of the application. No sensitive data like tokens are exposed in the client browser. By removing the security from the client, the security is improved and the complexity is reduced.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup Vue.js application 



<p>The Vue.js UI is setup so that the default development environment is used like in any Vue.js standalone application. A reverse proxy is used to integrate the application into the secure backend development environment. The UI uses Vue.js 3 with Typescript and Vite. </p>



 HTTPS setup and Production build 



<p>The production build is used to add the application as a UI view in the server rendered application, in this case ASP.NET Core. I always use HTTPS in development, so that the errors are discovered early and a strong CSP can also be used. This is all setup in the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">vite</a> project file.</p>


  import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import fs from 'fs';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue()],
  server: {
    https: {
		key: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.key'),
		cert: fs.readFileSync('./certs/dev_localhost.pem'),
	},
    port: 4202,
    strictPort: true, // exit if port is in use
    hmr: {
      clientPort: 4202, 
    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    force: true,
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "../server/wwwroot",
    emptyOutDir: true
  },
})
  


<p></p>



 CSP setup 



<p>The CSP is setup to use nonces both in development and production. This will save time fixing CSP issues before you go live. Vue.js creates scripts and styles on a build or a npm dev (vite). The scripts require the nonce. The styles require a nonce in production. To add the server created nonce, the index.html file uses a meta tag in the header as well as the server rendered middleware parsing for scripts and styles. The nonce gets added and updated with a new value on every HTTP response. This can be used directly in the Vue.js code. When adding further script statically or dynamically, the nonce placeholder can be used. This gets updated dynamically in development and production environments.</p>


  &lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
	&lt;meta name="CSP_NONCE" content="**PLACEHOLDER_NONCE_SERVER**" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Vite + Vue + TS&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    /src/main.ts
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  


<p>The ASP.NET Core _host file is used to serve up the index.html and adds in the dynamic bits to the Vue.js application. The scripts and styles have a nonce applied in production and the scripts in the development environment. Added and replace the CSP nonce can be done in different ways and needs to match the Vue.js index.html. This can change, depending on the setup of the Vue.js index.html.</p>

    Response.Cookies.Append("XSRF-RequestToken", requestToken ?? "", new CookieOptions() { HttpOnly = false, IsEssential = true, Secure = true, SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict });
}

@Html.Raw(source)
  


 Anti-forgery protection 



<p>Cookies are used to store the session authentication. The authentication cookie is a HTTP only secure cookie only for its domain. Browser Same Site protection helps secure the session. Old browsers do not support Same Site and Anti-forgery protection is still required. You can add this protection in two ways. I use a CSRF anti-forgery cookie. You could also use custom headers with validation. The getCookie script gets the anti-forgery cookie which was created by the server. This cookie is not HTTP only because it needs to be read into the UI. </p>


  export const getCookie = (cookieName: string) =&gt; {
  const name = `${cookieName}=`;
  const decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie);
  const ca = decodedCookie.split(";");
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; ca.length; i += 1) {
    let c = ca[i];
    while (c.charAt(0) === " ") {
      c = c.substring(1);
    }
    if (c.indexOf(name) === 0) {
      return c.substring(name.length, c.length);
    }
  }
  return "";
};
  


<p>The Anti-forgery header is added to every API call which requires this. I use axios to request API data, and the header needs to be added to the axiosConfig. For the demo, I just implemented this directly the Vue js component. The component makes various API calls.</p>


  &lt;script setup lang="ts"&gt;
import ResultsDisplay from './ResultsDisplay.vue'
import axios from 'axios';
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { getCookie } from '../getCookie';

const isLoggedIn = ref&lt;boolean&gt;()
const currentUser = ref&lt;any&gt;()
const jsonResponse = ref&lt;any&gt;()

onMounted(() =&gt; {
  getUserProfile()
})

const axiosConfig = {
  headers:{
    'X-XSRF-TOKEN': getCookie('XSRF-RequestToken'),
  }
};

// request.headers.set('X-XSRF-TOKEN',  getCookie('XSRF-RequestToken'));

function getDirectApi() {
	axios.get(`${getCurrentHost()}/api/DirectApi`, axiosConfig)
		.then((response: any) =&gt; {
			jsonResponse.value =  response.data;
			return response.data;
		})
		.catch((error: any) =&gt; {
			alert(error);
		});
}

function getUserProfile() {
	axios.get(`${getCurrentHost()}/api/User`)
	.then((response: any) =&gt; {
		console.log(response);
		jsonResponse.value  =  response.data;
		if(response.data.isAuthenticated){
			isLoggedIn.value  = true;
			currentUser.value  = response.data.claims[0].value
		}

		return response.data;
	})
	.catch((error: any) =&gt; {
		alert(error);
	});
}

function getCurrentHost() {
	const host = window.location.host;
	const url = `${window.location.protocol}//${host}`;

	return url;

 Setup ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The ASP.NET Core project is setup to host the static html file from Vue.js and respond to all HTTP requests as defined using the APIs. The nonce is added to the index.html file. The standard ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect handler is used to authenticate the user and the application. The session is stored in a cookie. The <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package is used to add the security headers and the CSP.</p>

 Development environment 



<p>Developers require a professional development setup and should use the technical stacks like the creators of the technical stacks recommend. Default development environments is the aim and always the easiest to maintain. The Vue.js project uses a default vite environment or best practices as the Vue.js community recommends. The server part of the application must proxy all UI requests to the Vue.js development environment. I use Microsoft YARP reverse proxy to implement this. This is only required for development in this setup. Some flavors of the BFF use proxies in the production environments as well.</p>







<p></p>



 Testing and running 



<p>The appsettings.json MUST be updated with your OpenIddict server configuration values. If using a client secret, store this in the user secrets for development, or in a key vault when deployed to Azure.</p>


  "OpenIDConnectSettings": {
    "Authority": "https://localhost:44318",
    "ClientId": "oidc-pkce-confidential",
    "ClientSecret": "oidc-pkce-confidential_secret"
},
  


 Debugging 



<p>Start the Vue.js project from the&nbsp;ui&nbsp;folder</p>


  npm start
  


<p>Start the ASP.NET Core project from the&nbsp;server&nbsp;folder</p>


  dotnet run
  


<p>When the localhost of the server app is opened, you can authenticate and use.</p>



 Notes 



<p>I was not able to apply the nonce to the dev environment styles of the Vue.js part. This would be of great benefit as you can prevent insecure styles in development and not discover these problems after a deployment. In the production build, the nonce is applied correctly.</p>

  I finally deleted all my Twitter accounts, notably @theory. If you see that
username, it’s not me.

<p>I quit Twitter in November 2022, when it became clear that Phony Stark would
take control of the company. No regrets; I’ve been active <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> since
then, via <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, where I’ve enjoyed the Twitter ca. 2010 vibe.</p>
<p>But I hadn’t deleted my Tweets or my accounts until this week. The change was
finally triggered by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793" title="X sees largest user exodus since Musk takeover">latest announcement</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first
time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train
artificial intelligence, like the company’s generative AI service, Grok.
Currently, X users can go to the site’s settings and opt out.</p>

    </blockquote>
  
<p>I have no interest in feeding Grok or any other large language model. So this
week I deleted all my tweets and then my accounts. I tried to transfer my
personal username to a new, empty account, but in the second between changing
it and switching to another tab to take it, it was somehow acquired by an
account created in 2011 with no posts. Not sure how that worked. Pretty scummy.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, anyone using these usernames on Twitter are not me
anymore:</p>

<p>Heute vor einem Jahr <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/durchbruch-im-europaeischen-parlament-piraten-feiern-klare-absage-an-chatkontrolle-und-garantie-sicherer-verschluesselung/">haben wir im Ausschuss für bürgerliche Freiheiten, Justiz und Inneres (LIBE) des EU-Parlaments eine fraktionsübergreifende Position gegen anlasslose Chatkontrolle beschlossen</a>. Damit haben wir den wahnwitzigen Überwachungsplänen eine Absage erteilt, welche die von der Leyen-EU-Kommission vorgelegt hat.</p>



<p>Neben dem Europäischen Parlament müssen die EU-Regierungen im Rat eine Position zu dem Gesetzentwurf beschließen. Schon drei Mal wurde die notwendige Mehrheit dort verfehlt. Sowohl die spanische Ratspräsidentschaft im Oktober 2023 als auch der belgische Vorsitz im Juni 2024 haben die Abstimmung über die Chatkontrolle kurzfristig von der Tagesordnung des Rats der EU genommen, als sich ein Scheitern bei der Abstimmung abgezeichnet hat – ein Riesenerfolg der Zivilgesellschaft.</p>



<p>Die Europäische Kommission wird gerade neu gebildet. Bisher tat EU-Innenkommissarin Ylva Johansson (S&amp;D, Schweden) als Mutter der Chatkontrolle alles, um ihr Vorhaben durchzuprügeln. Nun soll Magnus Brunner (EVP, Österreich) auf sie im Amt folgen und das Projekt weiterführen. Er hat in seinem Anhörungsverfahren gegenüber dem Europäischen Parlament auf die Frage der Piratin <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/197549/MARKETA_GREGOROVA/home">Markéta Gregorová</a> schon signalisiert, <a href="https://hearings.elections.europa.eu/documents/brunner/brunner_writtenquestionsandanswers_en.pdf">dass er die Verhandlungen zur Chatkontrolle zum Abschluss bringen will</a>. Ein Bekenntnis zum Schutz vor flächendeckender Chatkontrolle oder Schutz sicherer Verschlüsselung kam ihm nicht über die Lippen. Das ist ein Fehler: die EU-Kommission muss sich endgültig von Massenüberwachung verabschieden. Die anlasslose Chatkontrolle muss vom Tisch!</p>



<p>Im Europaparlament habe ich mich als euer Abgeordneter der Piratenpartei Deutschland federführend in den Verhandlungen eingesetzt, um die Chatkontrolle zu verhindern und auch die Abgeordneten der anderen Fraktionen in unzähligen Beratungen davon überzeugt. Heute trägt Markéta Gregorová für die europäischen Piraten die Fackel der Digitalen Freiheitskämpfer*innen im Europäischen Parlament weiter und setzt sich dort gegen die Chatkontrolle ein.</p>



<p>Im Rat der EU konnten wir bisher nur dank des unermüdlichen Engagements und des lautstarken Protests der Zivilgesellschaft totalitäre flächendeckende Chatkontrollen verhindern. Möglich war das dank jeder Aktivistin und jedem Einzelnen, die sich telefonisch, per E-Mail oder per Brief immer wieder an Politik und Regierung gewendet haben. Danke für euren Einsatz! Wir müssen stark bleiben und auch bei jedem weiteren Anlauf gegen die extreme und weltweit einzigartige Bedrohung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und sicherer Verschlüsselung durch die Chatkontrolle kämpfen!</p>

<p>The entire digital identity ecosystem is missing out on the #BigOpportunity by not focusing on the right catalyst for the #massiveadoption of #digitalcredentials.<br>Morphing the chicken and egg mental model: If Hens are the Issuers, Roosters the Verifiers, and Eggs are the digital credentials, the prime objective needs to be increasing the demand for and consumption of Eggs by Holders …creating hundreds of thousands of ways that drive more Holders to consume more Eggs. Think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… are great examples of driving the demand for and consumption of more and more digital credentials [and DIDs] (eggs); and secondarily, the demand for hens and roosters (Issuers and Verifiers). The demand for eggs drives the production of hens; and in turn, the demand for roosters. Don’t mess with #MotherNature</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>DID subject<br>The entity identified by a DID and described by a DID document. Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing, digital thing, logical thing, etc.</p>

 A bold&nbsp;method&nbsp;is the model method or exemplar for the particular cluster (cell). 



 A method can be a exemplar for 1 or many clusters. 



 This list of DID method categories is just an example. A complete taxonomy will likely be a 2-3 level hierarchy. The parent categories for these examples might include: Live Things, Inanimate Things, Abstract Things, Digital Things, Business Things, etc. etc. 



 More than one exemplar per cluster is permitted.

<blockquote>
<p>In Sociocracy terminology, a mini-WG is called a&nbsp;circle. Each category of DID methods (cluster of DID Methods) would be managed by its own independent circle. A circle member can belong to more than 1 circle. Circles are&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to a parent circle for administrative purposes. The parent circle would correspond to the DID Method WG (co-chaired by Markus).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sociocracy combines consent decision-making, a decentralized system of authority and intentional processes to improve our decisions and processes over time into a governance system that supports effective and efficient process while increasing connection, listening and co-creation among members.</p>

  <p>Today, a post in my feed included a mention and its webfinger verification threw a WebFinger::BadRequest exception:</p>

<p>The activitypub actor document resided on mastodon.well.com but when a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/socialcg/CG-FINAL-apwf-20240608/#reverse-discovery">reverse discovery</a> was performed, the hostname of the subject in the webfinger response was well.com instead of mastodon.well.com.  Making a webfinger request to well.com for the mentioned user returned a 500 Internal Server Error so a WebFinger::BadRequest exception was thrown.  What was going on?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-webfinger/issues/28">an issue in the activitypub-webfinger</a> had the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looks like some are using this host-meta redirect to use a custom domain for actors which is different to the actual domain of the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is what was happening:</p>

  <code>curl https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/host-meta
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0"&gt;
  &lt;Link rel="lrdd" template="https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}"/&gt;
&lt;/XRD&gt;
</code> 
 

<p>A response in the issue notes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of host-meta as a “second layer of indirection” is something that mostly a holdover from the OStatus days, IIRC. Most projects that aren’t Mastodon or Pleroma will not check host-meta at all, and will instead always skip straight to the /.well-known/webfinger endpoint. I don’t think it makes sense to unnecessarily pressure everyone into adopting host-meta or supporting variable LRDD endpoints</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t argue with that so I just <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/10a8d622e022bc48521afd11e63fb3962fce71f4">handled the exception without setting the custom domain</a>.</p>

  I’ve made a RFC 9535 JSONPath JSONPath Go package, and compiled it into Wasm to
build an in-browser playground for it.

<p>I’ve written and release a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> JSONPath Go package,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a>. Why? For a personal project, I needed a simpler
JSONPath engine to complement to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/07/go-sqljson-path/" title="Introducing Go SQL/JSON Path and Playground">Go SQL/JSON Path</a> package, and quickly
found myself implementing most of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC</a>. So I decided do the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yes, yet another JSONPath package in Go. I really appreciate the idea of a
standard — plus its support for features not included in the <a href="https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/" title="Stefan Gössner: JSONPath - XPath for JSON">original

reference to the RFC on pkg.go.dev. Today <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=RFC+9535" title="pkg.go.dev search: RFC 9535">the search</a> shows one!</p>
 Example 
<p>Usage is straightforward; here’s a quick example (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/wmJvZdOl28D">Go playground</a>):</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
)

func main() {
	// Parse a jsonpath query.
	p, err := jsonpath.Parse(`$["name", "slogan"]`)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Select values from unmarshaled JSON input.
	json := map[string]any{
		"name":   "Kamala Harris",
		"title":  "Vice President of the United States",
		"home":   "California",
		"slogan": "We are not going back!",
	}
	items := p.Select(json)

	// Show the result.
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", items)
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>[]interface {}{"Kamala Harris", "We are not going back!"}
</code>   🛝 Playground 
<p>No need to write code to try it out, though. I’ve also written a <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">playground
webapp</a> to encourage experimentation and exploration of the syntax and
behavior of the package. The implementation follows the precedents set by the
<a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/">Go SQL/JSON Playground</a> and design of the <a href="https://serdejsonpath.lives">Rust JSONPath Playground</a>.
Moreover, thanks to <a href="https://tinygo.org/" title="TinyGo - A Go Compiler For Small Places">TinyGo</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a> file comes in at a mere 254K!</p>
<p>The webapp loads sample JSON from the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC</a>, and randomly rotates through a
few example JSONPath queries. Fill in your own and tap the “Permalink” button
to share links. The Playground is a stateless JavaScript/Wasm web
application: data persists only in permalink URLs.<a>1</a></p>

 Status 
<p>The root <code>jsonpath</code> package is stable and ready for use. Other packages remain
in flux, as I refactor and rejigger things in the coming weeks as part of the
aforementioned personal project. But for actual JSONPath execution and
querying, it should continue to work as-is for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>

violations and management’s inability to bargain in good faith. From the
<a href="https://wapo.st/3UBVSbs" title="New York Times Tech Guild goes on strike">Washington Post</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Represented by the NewsGuild of New York, the Tech Guild has been
negotiating its first contract with the company since 2022. Both sides have
accused the other side of bogging down contract talks, which have recently
focused on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/23/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike/" title="What happens if the NYT’s tech staff strikes on election night?">three key issues</a>: “just cause” job protections (which ensure
employees can’t be fired without reason and due process), remote work and
pay equity. Unit members voted overwhelmingly in September to authorize the
strike, saying the timing of the authorization — in the run-up to the
high-profile election period — was “no accident.”</p>

    </blockquote>
  
<p>I urge you to join me in supporting the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nyt-tech-strike-fund" title="gofundme: Support NYT Tech workers!">strike fund</a>, which will help more
vulnerable members to weather the strike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Guild asks supporters to refrain from interacting with
Cooking and Games, and to break your streaks. Times reporters Maggie Astor has
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">the details</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of this morning, the New York Times Tech Guild, which represents NYT tech
workers, is on strike.</p>
<p>Unless it’s resolved while today’s Wordle is still live, this streak is
gone.</p>
<p>NYT Games and Cooking are BEHIND THE PICKET LINE. Please don’t play or
engage with Games or Cooking content while the strike lasts!</p>
<p>News coverage is NOT behind the picket line. It’s okay to read and share
that, though the site and app may have problems.</p>

    </blockquote>
  
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">whole thread</a> for more information, which, as she says, “the
rules may not be what you think!”</p>

I have registered for an AI agent hackathon, <a href="https://www.tensorops.ai/aiagentsonlinehackathon">Agents Craft Hackathon</a>. I don’t plan to be competitive but I doubt that is the goal of most participants. I do want a good idea that makes a great example and is a pseudo-novel idea that implements an agent usage not in the <a href="https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents">GenAI_Agents Github repo</a>. Therein lies my problem; a unique and interesting use case and example. I’m inspiration-blocked. I know that I am letting the perfect be the enemy of the good or even of the enemy of the fun because there is a Discord channel with participant-created ideas for teams to work on. I want it simple yet inspired. I’m not inspired by any of the existing team projects; nothing against the projects as this is a me problem. I have a few more days to think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Maybe you should join the hackathon. Your idea might be inspiring.</p>

<p>This article demonstrates how to implement a downstream API protected by certificate authentication using Microsoft YARP reverse proxy in an ASP.NET Core web application. The application uses Angular for its UI and secures both the UI and the ASP.NET Core backend through a backend-for-frontend security architecture. The downstream API is secured with certificate authentication and deployed to an Azure App Service. The API requires a known client certificate for access.</p>



<p>Code <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular-downstream-cert-api">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular-downstream-cert-api</a></p>



 Setup 



<p>The application was built using the  following github repository: </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular">https://github.com/damienbod/bff-aspnetcore-angular</a></p>



<p>The web application is secured with an OpenID Connect confidential client using PKCE. The UI is built with Angular , while the backend is implemented using ASP.NET Core. The API is protected with certificate authentication. This application is deployed to an Azure App Service and requires the correct certificate for access. The server ensures that the correct certificate is used to access the API.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The YARP reverse proxy is setup in the start up of the ASP.NET Core application and the appsettings.json file. The client certificate required for the downstream API, is loaded into the project using the X509Certificate2 class. This could be loaded from the operating system, or Azure key vault or some other secure way. The demo loads this directly in an unsecure way.</p>



<p>The AddReverseProxy method adds the YARP definitions and the ConfigureHttpClient method is used to add the SslOptions containing the client certificate which is used for the Azure API calls. The MapReverseProxy is used to add the endpoints and reads the configuration from the app settings. The proxy is also used in development to load the Angular project. Depending on the UI packages, different setups are required.</p>


  var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(serverOptions =&gt;
{
    serverOptions.AddServerHeader = false;
});

var services = builder.Services;
var configuration = builder.Configuration;

var stsServer = configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"];

services.AddSecurityHeaderPolicies()
  .SetPolicySelector((PolicySelectorContext ctx) =&gt;
  {
      return SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
          builder.Environment.IsDevelopment(), stsServer);
  });

services.AddAntiforgery(options =&gt;
{
    options.HeaderName = "X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-X-XSRF-TOKEN";
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});

services.AddHttpClient();
services.AddOptions();

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
    configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);
    //options.Authority = configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"];
    //options.ClientId = configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:ClientId"];
    //options.ClientSecret = configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:ClientSecret"];

    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name"
    };
});

services.AddControllersWithViews(options =&gt;
    options.Filters.Add(new AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute()));

services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    //var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
    //    .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
    //    .Build();
    //options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ApiTokenCacheClient&gt;();

// Create an authorization policy used by YARP when forwarding requests
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt; options.AddPolicy("CookieAuthenticationPolicy", builder =&gt;
{
    builder.AddAuthenticationSchemes(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
    builder.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
}));

var cert = new X509Certificate2("client.pfx", "pfx-certificate-secret");

services.AddReverseProxy()
    .ConfigureHttpClient((context, handler) =&gt;
    {
        handler.SslOptions = new SslClientAuthenticationOptions
        {
            ClientCertificates = [cert]
        };
    })
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));
  


<p></p>



<p>The ReverseProxy settings adds the configuration which is almost standard like the documentation. The CookieAuthenticationPolicy is used to accept only authenticated requests. The YARP is setup differently for development and production.</p>

 Downstream API protected using certificate authentication 



<p>The downstream API uses certification authentication to protect the API. The API requires a certificate forwarding middleware in local development as well as allowing any certificate type including self signed certificates. When the application is deployed to an Azure App Service, the certificate forwarding middleware is not required. The API validates the thumbprint of the certificate and returns a 403 if the certificate authentication in ASP.NET Core fails. This is because the certificate is already validated before it reaches the application. It is really authorization.</p>

<p>When the application is started, the web application can use the downstream API protected using certificates.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works good and the downstream APIs can be protected in a secure way using certificates. Using this approach, it is very easy to increase security or implement the app-to-app security in a good way. Of course security is only as good as the weakest link. The Angular UI view calling to the API protected with cookies is now the weakest link, depending of course on how you secure the downstream APIs, but this should not be a problem to do correctly. </p>

<p>Last week I MCed the first Extension Ecosystem Summit EU and attended my first
at PGConf EU in Athens, Greece. Despite my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2007/03/five-things/#2-i-used-to-be-an-archaeologist" title="Five Things You Don't Know About Me">former career as an archaeologist</a>
— with a focus on Mediterranean cultures, no less! — this was my first
visit to Greece. My favorite moment was the evening after the Summit, when I
cut out of a networking shindig to walk to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaka" title="Wikipedia: Plaka">Pláka</a> and then circumnavigate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens" title="Wikipedia: Acropolis of Athens">Acropolis</a>. I mean just look at this place!</p>

<p>Highlight of the trip for sure. But the Summit and conference were terrific,
as well.</p>
 Extension Ecosystem Summit 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> kindly organized The Extension Ecosystem Summit EU, the
follow-up to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">PGConf.dev original</a>. While the Vancouver Summit focused on
developers, we tailored this iteration to users. I started the gathering with
a condensed version of my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/posette/#i-also-spoke" title="POSETTE 2024">POSETTE talk</a>, “State of the Postgres Extension
Ecosystem”, but updated with a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI — Demo">Trunk OCI Distribution</a> demo. Links:</p>

 <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/10/pgconf-extension-summit-eu/state-of-the-ecosystem-eu.key">Keynote</a> 
 
<p>We then moved into a lightning round of 10 minute introductions to a variety
of extensions:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyruss/">Jimmy Angelakos</a> showed off <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_statviz/" title="PGXN: pg_statviz">pg_statviz</a>, a “minimalist extension and
utility pair for time series analysis and visualization of PostgreSQL
internal statistics”. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hendel/">Adam Hendel</a> gave a brief history of <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pgmq/" title="PGXN: pgmq">pgmq</a>, is a “lightweight message
queue like AWS SQS and RSMQ, but on Postgres.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gulcinyildirim/">Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek</a> introduced <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx" title="GitHub: xataio/pgzx">pgzx</a>, “a library for developing
PostgreSQL extensions written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" title="Zig Programming Language">Zig</a>.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-blackwood-sewell/">James Sewell</a> talked about <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale" title="GitHub: timescale/pgvectorscale">pgvectorscale</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai" title="GitHub: timescale/pgai">pgai</a> for managing
machine training workloads on Postgres. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/decodableminion/">Alastair Turner</a> described <a href="https://github.com/percona/pg_tde" title="GitHub: percona/pg_tde">pg_tde</a>, an extension that provides
transparent data encryption for Postgres. 
 
<p>Quite the whirlwind! There followed open discussion, in which each maintainer
went to a corner to talk to attendees about contributing to their extensions.
Details to come in a more thorough writeup on the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/" title="Tembo’s Blog">Tembo blog</a>, but I personally
enjoyed some fascinating discussions about extension distribution challenges.</p>
 PGConf.eu 
<p>Following the Summit, I attended several thought-provoking and provocative
presentations at <a href="https://2024.pgconf.eu" title="PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2024">PGConf.eu</a>, which took place at the same hotel, conveniently
enough.</p>

 In the conference keynote, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-haysler-ssh/">Stacey Haysler</a> explained the <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5869/">The PostgreSQL
License Fee</a>. I’m pleased to say that my employer “pays” license fee! 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-freund/">Andres Freund</a> (yes, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1244174104" title="NPR: One engineer may have saved the world from a massive cyber attack">that one</a>) summarized <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5839/">NUMA vs PostgreSQL</a>,
covering some of the issues and opportunities for optimization of
PostgreSQL on servers using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access" title="Wikipedia: Non-uniform memory access">NUMA</a> multi-processor memory
architecture. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heikki-linnakangas-6b58bb203/">Heikki Linnakangas</a> offered an overview of <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5897/">The Wire Protocol</a>, that bit
of PostgreSQL technology that lets clients talk to PostgreSQL. 
 <a href="https://ophir.dev">Ophir Lojkine</a> and Thomas Guillemard <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5707/" title="Unearthing the Past with PostgreSQL: How Open Source is Revolutionizing Digital Archaeology">showed</a> how a pretty sweet
framework, <a href="https://sql.datapage.app/">SQLPage</a>, lets archaeologists like Thomas write complete web
applications in pure SQL, enabling rapid data entry while in the field. 
 <a href="https://github.com/tvondra">Tomas Vondra</a>’s <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5585/">Performance Archaeology</a> dug into the history of
PostgreSQL improvements, mapping their compounding returns over time. 
 <a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> (photo above) talked about <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5946/">Supporting extensions, but
really now</a>, making a strong case for the need to organize infrastructure
to support the broader extension ecosystem. 
 
<p>There were many more talks, but clearly I tend to be drawn to the most
technical, core-oriented topics. And also archaeology.</p>
 Museums 
<p>Speaking of which, I made time to visit two museums while in Athens. First up
was the <a href="https://www.namuseum.gr/en/">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</a>, where I was delighted to
explore the biggest collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" title="Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean Greece">Mycenaean</a> artifacts I’ve ever seen,
including massive collections from the excavations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann" title="Wikipedia: Heinrich Schliemann">Heinrich Schliemann</a>.
So much great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Wikipedia: Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> stuff here. I mean, just look at this absolute unit:</p>


	
			
		
			<p>From the museum description: “Fragment of a krater depicting a chariot with
two occupants. A male figure holding a staff walks in front of the chariot.
Much of the Mycenaean Pictorial Style pottery (14th-12th centuries BC) with
representations of humans, chariots, horses and bulls on large kraters, was
produced at Berbati in the Argolid and exported to Cyprus, where it was widely
imitated. Birds, fish, wild goats or imaginary creatures (i.e. sphinxes) occur
on other types of vessels, such as jugs and stirrup jars. Usually only
fragments of these vases survive in mainland Greece from settlement contexts.
In Cyprus, however, complete vases are preserved, placed as grave gifts in
tombs.”

<p>The animal decorations on Mycenaean and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)" title="Wikipedia: Akrotiri (prehistoric city)">Akrotiri</a> pottery is simply
delightful. I also enjoyed the Hellenistic stuff, and seeing the famed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" title="Wikipedia: Antikythera mechanism">Antikythera Mechanism</a> filled my nerd heart with joy. A good 3 hours poking
around; I’ll have to go back and spend a few days there sometime. Thanks to my
pal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-hunter-stanton/">Evan Stanton</a> for gamely wandering around this fantastic museum with me.</p>
<p>Immediately after the PGConf.eu closing session, I dashed off to the
<a href="https://theacropolismuseum.gr/en/">Acropolis Museum</a>, which stays open till 10 on Fridays. Built in 2009, this
modern concrete-and-glass building exhibits several millennia of artifacts and
sculpture exclusively excavated from the Acropolis or preserved from its
building façades. No photography allowed, alas, but I snapped this photo
looking out on the Acropolis from the top floor.</p>

from the Parthenon inside the museum reflect in the glass, as does, yes, your
humble photographer.

<p>I was struck by the beauty and effectiveness of the displays. It easily puts
the lie to the assertion that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles" title="Wikipedia: Elgin Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a> must remain in the British
Museum to protect them. I saw quite a few references to the stolen sculptures,
particularly empty spots and artfully sloppy casts from the originals, but the
building itself makes the strongest case that the marbles should be returned.</p>
<p>But even without them there remains a ton of beautiful sculpture to see.
Highly recommended!</p>
 Back to Work 
<p>Now that my sojourn in Athens has ended, I’m afraid I must return to work. I
mean, the event was work, too; I talked to a slew of people about a number of
projects in flight. More on those soon.</p>

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a86f141-0fa7-43a8-9cae-30570d4bbe72_1792x1024.heic">          </a> <p></p><p>There's a lot of fear mongering about the security of elections. I've wanted to discuss this for a while. I have several things in my background that have given me insight into how elections work. I was the CIO for the State of Utah. I was a member of the Lt Governor of Utah's voting equipment selection committee. And I've been involved in identity and security for several decades.</p><p>Let me give you the headline up front: committing election fraud in a way that changes the result is difficult, nearly impossible. Let's examine how elections are run and how fraud could happen to see why.</p><p>First a caveat: there is no single way that US elections are run. Elections in the US are quite decentralized. Each state has different election laws and in most cases the mechanics of running an election are given over to county clerks who must follow state law, but also have freedom to create their own workflows and processes within that law. The analysis that follows is generalized and likely more true of Utah, which I'm very familiar with, than other places. Still, I think the big ideas are largely the same everywhere.</p><p>The process of voting is divided into two parts: (1) voter registration and (2) voting. This is important because most people who make up scenarios to convince you that voting is insecure usually ignore voter registration. Registration requires that you provide an address. This is an important piece of information because if you're voting by mail, it's where the ballot will be mailed. If you're voting in person, you need to vote at a specific polling place depending on your address.</p><p>When you vote, you either mail back the ballot that was mailed to you at the address you provided or you go to your polling place and fill out a ballot (usually via a voting machine). In either case, the ballot presented to you depends on your address since the candidates listed on your ballot depend on your voting precinct. Also, as of 2024, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_identification_laws_by_state">35 states require voters to present identification</a> at the polling place in order to vote. Of those that don't, many require it for voters who are voting for the first time after their registration.</p><p>Now, let's examine voting fraud and how it might work. One important factor is scale. You need to commit fraud at a scale necessary to impact the outcome. For small elections (say a single state legislative race or a small school board election) you don't need to change a lot of votes to change the outcome in a tight race—hundreds of votes might do it. For larger elections, like the presidential election, scale is a significant issue. I'm going to focus on presidential elections since they are the most consequential. Less consequential elections are not likely to attract the kind of money and talent necessary to commit election fraud.</p><p>A second factor is stealth. You have to keep the fraud from being discovered so that it's not reversed. Proving consequential fraud would likely result in the election being challenged and rerun. You don't have to identify who did it, just prove that it was done. So election fraud is much more dependent on not being discovered than commercial transaction fraud where the loss is likely to only be recovered if the identity of the perpetrator is known.</p><p>The nature of presidential elections is greatly influenced by the electoral college system. You need to influence the votes in enough states to swing that state's electoral votes to the candidate you favor. You don't want to commit fraud where it's not needed because you'll waste money while increasing your chances of discovery. So, selecting the states where you want to commit fraud is critical. Each of those states will have different requirements, so you'll have to tailor your attack to each of them. Furthermore, you'll have to tailor your attack to each legislative precinct within the counties you determine are the most likely to impact the election.</p><p>There are a few ways to attack an election:</p>  <p>Sending your people to vote—for this to work, your fake voters have to have been registered and, in most cases, provide some form of ID. To register, they need a plausible address. The election office might not notice if one or two extra people with different last names are registered at a specific address, but they might if this is systematic or if an unreasonable number of people register at the same address. Remember that elections are run at the county level, so you have to assume that the election workers have a good understanding of the local environment. These fake voters now have to go to many different polling locations and cast a vote. They can't easily cast multiple ballots at the same polling location since the poll workers might remember them. So, you need lots of people going to lots of different polling locations.</p>  <p>Intercepting mail-in ballots—for this to work, you have to register at someone else's home address and then get to the mail before they do or steal their ballots after they've filled them in and change the vote. This requires lots of people. You can't do this remotely. It requires "boots on the ground" as the saying goes. Furthermore, those people are exposed since they're looking in mailboxes in neighborhoods where they don't live. Doable, but not very stealthy.</p>  <p>Paying people to vote—for this to work, you have to contact a lot of people, convince them to commit fraud, and then be satisfied with the fact that you'll never know if they voted for your candidate or not because ballots are secret. They could take your money and vote for whoever they want. Or just not vote at all unless you're supervising them, an activity that will call attention to you and your agents.</p>  <p>Replacing real ballots with fake ones—for this to work, you have to get your hands on real ballots for many different polling places (remember they're different because of overlapping jurisdictions), intercept the ballots somewhere in transit or on delivery, and replace the real ballots with ones that you've filled out for your candidate. This likely involves subverting county election workers. Not just one, but many. Again, the risk of discovery goes up with each contact.</p>  <p>Destroying ballots—for this to work, you need to destroy ballots that are for the candidate you don't want to win. You could simple destroy ballots without regard to how they're filled, but this won't assure you'll meet your goal. To be effective, you have to just destroy the ones for the other candidate and leave the ones for your candidate. Again, you will have to subvert election workers to get your hands on the ballots and determine who the ballot is for.</p>  <p>Changing the results after the ballots are counted—for this to work, you have to either hack the machines that record the vote or hack the machines that are tabulating the vote. Hacking the machines won't work if the machines keep a paper audit trail and it's used to audit results. Hacking the tabulators means getting access to those machines. Recall those are kept at the county level, so you have to hack many in different locations unless a single county can swing the election your way.</p>  <p>I hope all of this has at least given you a feel for the scale and scope of the problem. Pulling it off successfully without anyone knowing it happened is a difficult problem. Each method involves many people being let in on the secret—in some cases a lot of people. This isn't an operation that a small group of hackers can reliably pull off. Having lots of people involved increases the chances that you'll be discovered. The decentralized and distributed nature of how elections are run is a feature, and makes elections more secure and trustworthy.</p><p>On top of all this, election officials aren't stupid, lazy, or inept. Sure, you're going to find a few who are. But as a rule the elections officials I've interacted with at the state and county level are professionals who are attuned to these dangers and take active steps to protect against them. They are, as a rule, happy to talk about how they operate and will respond to polite requests for information about how they audit systems and the processes they have in place to protect the vote.</p><p>As an aside, do you know what's easier than committing election fraud? Using social media to convince people that election fraud is happening to reduce confidence in the election and sow discontent. Then you can use that discontent to challenge a legitimate election and maybe change the outcome if you don't like it. Ask yourself which is more likely.</p><p>Successfully changing the results of a presidential election isn't impossible. But the odds of doing so and not leaving any evidence—the perfect crime—are vanishingly small. I have confidence in the security of the US election system.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Voting from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: Draw a horizontal picture of a woman casting a ballot with a ballot box</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/is-voting-secure?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p></p>

AI generated crew image. Note that some folks are backwards.&nbsp;:-)<p>I continued my experimentation with CrewAI this weekend. To see the code, take a look at the following repo and path: <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/crewai_playground/tree/main/crewai_series">Starter CrewAI Series</a> and the day_04 folder specifically. In the day_04 package, I created a simple custom tool, one that uses <a href="https://tavily.com/">Tavily</a>. The two agent, two task package queries for news information on CrewAI and then processes that info to create a report (markdown) on the latest news about CrewAI. I learned a few things outside that CrewAI just raised $18 million&nbsp;(US).</p> How it&nbsp;Works <p>It uses decorators on the classes and functions. I love decorators. I always have. I filed a <a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0204340.html">patent</a> once that used decorators in C# as a part of a solution for business rule traceability. But back to CrewAI. You’ll see code snippets&nbsp;like:</p> @CrewBase<br>class Day04Crew():<br><br>@agent<br> def researcher(self) -&gt; Agent:<br><br>@task<br> def research_task(self) -&gt; Task: <p>While to define the agent behavior, you use some YAML like the&nbsp;below:</p> researcher:<br>  role: &gt;<br>    Senior Data Researcher on {topic}<br>  goal: &gt;<br>    Find recent most relevant news on {topic} and limit your response to {limit} results<br>  backstory: &gt;<br>    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest<br>    developments on {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant<br>    information and present it in a clear and concise manner. <p>To define the task you use YAML like the&nbsp;below:</p> research_task:<br>  description: &gt;<br>    Search news about {topic}<br>  expected_output: &gt;<br>    A list of news articles about {topic} with the title, url, and content<br>  agent: researcher <p>If I were to experiment deeper I’d try the research task description to be a more sophisticated prompt but this one returned decent&nbsp;results.</p><p>And that is largely it for a simple enough example. I was off to the races with the exception of some calls to actually run the&nbsp;agents.</p> What I&nbsp;Found <p>First off. I found that I need to do some discovery of the CrewAI capabilities for some increased logging or traceability. Even with agent verbosity turned on, it was too much of a black box for me. Maybe I didn’t look closely enough at the verbose output but it seemed a bit too superficial. I want to know what exactly was passed to the LLM, a timestamp, its response and that timestamp, which endpoints on the LLM, etc. I think some of that can be found using <a href="https://www.langtrace.ai/">LangTrace</a> or <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/agentops-observability">CrewAI AgentOps</a>. I’ll almost certainly try that&nbsp;soon.</p><p>I also found that one time it got stuck in what I assume was some sort of loop. I can’t be certain exactly where, as I didn’t have any real logging or traceability (black box). But it was running far too long on just the first agent and task. I had to cancel out and when I did and looked at my usage of Tavily it had bumped up 100 API calls for that run versus the expected of only 1. That was very disconcerting. All other runs with the unmodified code performed only the expected 1 API call to&nbsp;Tavily.</p><p>The<a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/crewai_playground/blob/main/crewai_series/day_04/src/report.md"> report output</a> was what I was hoping for, but that has more to do with the LLM and Tavily results than with&nbsp;CrewAI.</p><p>I did notice that each task can have only one agent. That makes sense, I think. I would like to try where an agent has multiple tasks and has to choose the appropriate task for its job and also a scenario where an agent might call a task multiple times with slightly different input to get a more nuanced or expanded context for its actions. I don’t currently have an example use case for the latter. Give me some time or recommend one below. In these scenarios, traceability becomes even more important, and limits on task calling or tool usage are probably&nbsp;needed.</p> Final Thoughts <p>CrewAI covered the simple use case I wanted to try though it left me desiring more visibility into what it was doing. The implementation in my limited use case was easy. It was slow, but I don’t know where it was slow, because I didn’t have any instrumentation to see where it was spending its time. It might have been in the LLM and/or Tavily. All in all, I plan to experiment more with a hierarchical structure and with some attempts into observability and traceability. I wish I could say more and provide greater depth than what you can probably easily and quickly discern from the documentation but for now this is what I have. The next question is will I try the same in L<a href="https://www.langchain.com/">angChain</a> to compare or will I dig deeper into CrewAI&nbsp;first.</p>

<p>It’s nice if you can share your screen with someone who has walked that path before you, but that’s often impossible or infeasible. LLMs synthesize what others have learned walking the path.

<p>I was recently experimenting with <a href="https://www.crewai.com/">CrewAI</a>, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&nbsp;this.</p><p>It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. This provides CrewAI with the ability to talk to a range of LLMs without needing to really do much in terms of handling&nbsp;it.</p> What Doesn’t Work and&nbsp;Why <p>The first thing I found is what doesn’t work. The LLM class in CrewAI allows for the instantiation of an LLM that can then be used by agents. Spinning up an LLM instance on a local Ollama hosted model can look like&nbsp;below.</p>  ollama_31_8b = LLM(<br>     model="ollama/llama3.1",<br>     base_url="http://localhost:11434"<br>    ) <p>This works just fine if hosting the LLM inside Ollama, but you get response exceptions if, instead, you try to host inside LMStudio at the same server&nbsp;port.</p> ERROR: LiteLLM call failed: litellm.APIConnectionError: 'response' <p>First, you notice that the base_url doesn’t have a “/v1” at the end which LMStudio uses in their server setup. If you fix that, thinking it might work, you’ll find that you likely get the same&nbsp;error.</p><p>Secondly, you may realize that the model property in your LLM instantiation uses a [PROVIDER]/[MODEL] format. I tried removing the provider portion to see what would happen. The results&nbsp;were:</p> llm.py-llm:161 - ERROR: LiteLLM call failed: litellm.BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT provided. <p>That’s a reasonable outcome.</p> What Does&nbsp;Work <p>Lastly, I remembered that LM Studio is using OpenAI endpoints.</p><p>A quick look at the <a href="https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/openai_compatible">LiteLLM docs</a> provided the answer I needed; set the provider as “openai”. This results in a final outcome&nbsp;of:</p> ollama_31_8b = LLM(model="openai/llama3.1", base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1") <p>Now, if you try running it with the agent using the LLM instantiated it will work. Below is example code of the LLM and agent creation where I had Llama 3.1:8b model hosted in LM Studio on port&nbsp;11434.</p> @CrewBase<br>class MyCrew():<br><br> llama_31_8b = LLM(<br>   model="openai/llama3.1",<br>   base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1"<br>  )<br> <br> @agent<br> def joke_generator(self) -&gt; Agent:<br>  return Agent(<br>   config=self.agents_config['joke_generator'],<br>   verbose=True,<br>   llm=self.llama_31_8b<br>  )  Note <p>Note that on LMStudio I had my server port set to 11434 versus the default of 1234. It made it easier as I switched back and forth between Ollama and LM Studio; I didn’t need to modify the port. 11434 is the default Ollama&nbsp;port.</p> When Might I Use&nbsp;This <p>When might I use this? If I am programming, probably rarely. I could instead host the model in Ollama. I’d use LM Studio if I want to host a model and chat with it. In that scenario, I’d probably be more likely to use Ollama with <a href="https://anythingllm.com/">AnythingLLM</a> which would also provide me with some Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. Nonetheless, it was an experiment and I proved, for myself, it could easily be&nbsp;done.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement security headers for an application supporting an API and a swagger UI created from a open API in .NET 9. The security headers are implemented using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget packages from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdlock/">Andrew Lock</a>.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi">https://github.com/damienbod/WebApiOpenApi</a></p>



<p>Deploying a web application which supports both an API and a UI have different levels of security requirements. The Swagger UI is created from an Open API specification and uses inline Javascript with no hashes or nonces which requires weak security definitions. The API has no UI and can use the maximum security header definitions. It can be locked down as much as possible against the typical web UI attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The API endpoints can be secured using a definition with strict security headers and a lot of browser features locked down.</p>


  public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitionsAPI
{
    private static HeaderPolicyCollection? policy;

    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
    {
        // Avoid building a new HeaderPolicyCollection on every request for performance reasons.
        // Where possible, cache and reuse HeaderPolicyCollection instances.
        if (policy != null) return policy;

        policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicyWithDefaultSecureDirectives();

        policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
        {
            builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
            builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
            builder.AddImgSrc().None();
            builder.AddFormAction().None();
            builder.AddFontSrc().None();
            builder.AddStyleSrc().None();
            builder.AddScriptSrc().None();
            builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
            builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
            builder.AddCustomDirective("require-trusted-types-for", "'script'");
        });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
        }

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p>The API calls would return the following headers in the HTTP response. The CSP blocks Javascript.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Swagger definition allows unsafe Javascript. This allows for XSS attacks and is a weak level of security. This is required due to the way the Swagger UI is created.</p>


  public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitionsSwagger
{
    private static HeaderPolicyCollection? policy;

    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev)
    {
        // Avoid building a new HeaderPolicyCollection on every request for performance reasons.
        // Where possible, cache and reuse HeaderPolicyCollection instances.
        if (policy != null) return policy;

        policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicyWithDefaultSecureDirectives();

        policy.AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
        {
            builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
            builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
            builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
            builder.AddFormAction().Self();
            builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
            builder.AddStyleSrc().Self().UnsafeInline();
            builder.AddScriptSrc().Self().UnsafeInline(); //.WithNonce();
            builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
            builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();
        });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
        }

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The HTTP response would look something like this:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The security headers are setup to always use the API swagger definitions except for the swagger routes. This is used in development. I still don’t deploy this to production, unless the Swagger UI is absolutely required. In production, all responses use the stricter security header definitions.</p>


  // Open up security restrictions to allow this to work
// Not recommended in production
var deploySwaggerUI = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;bool&gt;("DeploySwaggerUI");
var isDev = builder.Environment.IsDevelopment();

builder.Services.AddSecurityHeaderPolicies()
    .SetPolicySelector((PolicySelectorContext ctx) =&gt;
    {
        // sum is weak security headers due to Swagger UI deployment
        // should only use in development
        if (deploySwaggerUI) 
        {
            // Weakened security headers for Swagger UI
            if (ctx.HttpContext.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments("/swagger"))
            {               
                return SecurityHeadersDefinitionsSwagger.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(isDev);
            }

            // Strict security headers
            return SecurityHeadersDefinitionsAPI.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(isDev);
        }
        // Strict security headers for production
        else
        {
            return SecurityHeadersDefinitionsAPI.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(isDev);
        }
    });
  


<p></p>



<p>The security headers are added as middleware using the UseSecurityHeaders methods.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders();
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This setup works good and the correct headers for the API are used in both development with the Swagger UI or without the Swagger UI. No weaken headers are deployed to production. </p>

But let’s be real—Trinsic depends on this too, just as much as mine does. We’re both here, with skin in the game, and that's a good thing. I continue to work on figuring out how to make self-sovereign identity work at scale because I believe it's worth it. If I was not convinced of its value, I wouldn't be here debating it; I'd have moved on to easier, more profitable paths. That’s the commitment this industry requires—guts, patience, and a long-term perspective.</p><p>So let's set the stage clearly. This isn't just about egos or jobs; it's about a vision for the future of digital identity. And while you’ve pivoted, it's worth looking at the broader picture and challenging the notion that SSI is somehow "dead" just because it's hard. We’re not the first to face a daunting path—nor will we be the last.</p> The Market Isn't the Oracle You Think It Is <p>Your unwavering faith in the market's infallibility is touching. You proclaim, "The market is the objective reality," as if channeling the spirit of a laissez-faire economist at a startup retreat. But let's examine recent history.</p><p>Betamax was superior to VHS, but marketing muscle won the day. The QWERTY keyboard isn't ergonomic, yet it's entrenched due to historical happenstance. The invisible hand often leads us down paths of inefficiency and fragmentation, leaving a trail of superior but abandoned technologies in its wake.</p><p>Fragmentation and incompatible standards aren't signs of the market "choosing" the best option; they're about who can shout "MINE!" the loudest while elbowing competitors off the playground. Sometimes, it takes a guiding hand—a nudge from governments or standard bodies—to steer the market toward what's efficient and beneficial for all.</p> Pivoting Isn't Prophecy you can do better, hon<p>The leap from "We couldn't make it work" to "It can't work" is a logical chasm too wide to cross. Your pivot from SSI evangelist to skeptic, while understandable, isn't a revelation of universal truth.</p><p>This is akin to Friendster declaring social media a dead end, or Blockbuster declaring video streaming a passing fad. The inability to monetize a nascent technology doesn't negate its potential; it merely highlights the gap between visionary ideals and the brutal realities of running a startup. For example, certain decentralized identity projects have successfully implemented verifiable credentials in applications like educational certificates, employment verification, and gaining access to the financial system, demonstrating real-world utility and growing momentum. These efforts show that verifiable credentials are gaining traction in specific, focused use cases.</p><p>Let me be unequivocal: I commend you for having the guts to start a company, work hard for years, and continue to try to make it viable. That is nothing short of admirable. Your pivot might make sense for Trinsic, but it's hardly the canary in the coal mine for SSI.</p><p>SSI, like many transformative technologies before it, may simply be awaiting its "streaming moment" — that convergence of technological readiness, market understanding, and user demand that catapults it from interesting concept to indispensable tool.</p> The Power of Collective Standards <p>Dismissing government involvement as a mere "silver lining" is like calling the sun a "helpful light bulb." Let's not overlook crucial historical precedents.</p><p>The internet (ARPANET), GPS, and even time zone standardization were government initiatives. The metric system, USB, and Wi-Fi all benefited from coordinated efforts beyond market forces. These standards didn't become universal because the market willed them so, but because of coordination to prevent fragmentation.</p><p>It is important not to ignore this. Preventing the chaos of incompatible systems often requires patience and collaboration—yes, even more patience than the industry has shown to this point.</p> Scattered Seeds Grow Diverse Forests <p>Your lament that SSI's "heat map is too scattered" misses the point. This diversity isn't a bug—it's a feature. The applications sprouting in education, finance, healthcare, and agriculture worldwide are the seeds of a diverse forest, not a failed monoculture.</p><p>Yes, SSI's initial user experience may be challenging, but that's par for the course with transformative technologies. Remember when 2G networks made downloading a single image feel interminable? Or when dial-up internet's screeching was our daily soundtrack?</p><p>Every groundbreaking technology endures growing pains. Users adapt, technologists adapt, and the market adapts with them—especially when the endgame offers control, privacy, and empowerment.</p> Business Goals Aren't Universal Truths <p>There's a profound difference between "We couldn't make it work for our business" and "The technology is inherently flawed."</p><p>Your focus on immediate market adoption overlooks the long-term value of doing the right thing—the hard thing—the thing that maybe, honestly, is not suited for startups that need to show growth and profit now. Perhaps a successful SSI startup is better suited as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)?ref=decentralgabe.xyz">B-Corp</a>. </p><p>While market challenges are real, the problems that led us to SSI have only grown more severe. Data breaches are no longer news; they're an expectation. Surveillance Capitalism has entrenched itself deeper into the fabric of our digital lives, commodifying our every interaction. Government-issued digital identities, on the hardware of monopolistic tech giants, laced with privacy-eroding mandates, threatening to erode what little privacy we have left.</p><p>SSI isn't just a novel technology; it is our defense against these escalating digital threats.</p> Focused Implementation <p>While the post laments the scattered nature of SSI adoption, I see this differently. There is a clear answer to the diversity challenge: focus on specific, high-impact use cases. Our net is intentionally not cast wide.</p><p>We don't require credentials to be used across different domains from which they were issued. That's a potential bonus, not a requirement. It does not undermine the original goal of the technology; optionality is a strength. It leaves the door open for future cross-domain adoption without dependence on it for current success.</p><p>This focused strategy allows us to deliver value in targeted areas while building the infrastructure for broader adoption. It’s a pragmatic approach that addresses immediate needs while paving the way for SSI’s long-term vision. An iterative approach helps build confidence in the SSI ecosystem, one application at a time.</p><p>The success of SSI won't come from boiling the ocean. We’re laying the groundwork for future interoperability while delivering value today.</p> A Vision Beyond The Fiscal Calendar <p>While some may chase immediate market opportunities, many of us remain committed to SSI's promise. Transformational change isn't measured in fiscal quarters but in steady progress over years, many years. It demands fortitude, collaboration, and a willingness to look beyond short-term gains.</p><p>To the SSI community: Let this be our rallying cry. We're not just building a product; we're creating the foundation for human-centric digital identity. Let's continue to collaborate on improving user experience, pushing interoperability, and engaging governments and standards organizations. Every effort, no matter how small, contributes to a future where secure, privacy-respecting, self-sovereign digital identity is the norm.</p><p>The most compelling technological advances come from those who persevere when the path gets steep. The future of digital identity—one that isn't controlled solely by governments or tech monopolies—is counting on us.</p>credit: Dune<p>Should you find yourself at the next IIW, or the one after that, perhaps hosting a session titled "I Was Wrong About Being Wrong About SSI," feel free to invite us—we'll be there. We won't cry, clap, or hug you. We'll simply nod, in recognition that the most profound insights often come from pushing through challenges, not pivoting away from them.</p>

A presentation I gave at IIW38, in April&nbsp;2024.<p>At the Internet Identity Workshop 38, I announced my talk with a description something like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>Five years ago at this conference, Trinsic’s first product (our self-sovereign identity wallet app) was launched. Today, I’m hosting a session called “SSI didn’t work. Trinsic is pivoting.”</blockquote><p>I knew it was a provocative title — and I fully considered that apostatizing this publicly could result in a mob of opposition. But I was not prepared for what actually happened.</p>  Right after my announcement (and brief, surprised gasp from the crowd of ~350 people) one IIW veteran popped off his chair and clapped his way across the room to embrace&nbsp;me.  Right before my session, the CEOs of two separate identity companies asked to broadcast the talk online (one via livestream, another via live&nbsp;Tweet).  Right after my session during the closing circle (where the original crowd of ~350 reconvened), the cofounder of the conference wept as she thanked me. Another longtime identity veteran stood immediately after and claimed it was the most important session held at the event in the last 5&nbsp;years.  The next morning, a startup CEO called for memorializing a “Riley Session” as a new staple of the conference twice each year. More than a dozen people asked me to reprise my&nbsp;session.  <p>I say this all descriptively, not boastfully. Far from feeling proud, I actually felt humbled to have had the opportunity to contribute something evidently valuable to a community which has given me so much. (It was at an IIW in 2018 that I realized I wanted to build a career in this industry.) That is the context for this post — to share apparently-useful insights that hopefully will result in getting the world closer to using better digital ID technologies.</p><p>The spoiler for this article: I’m no longer betting on verifiable credentials taking off. I mean this literally — 99% of my net worth is <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a> stock, so the strategy I bet my company on is an objective revelation of my strongest convictions. While once central to Trinsic’s existence, our latest pivot demonstrates that I believe interoperable digital credentials won’t succeed in market anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Specifically, my prognostication is that digital identities will continue to be deployed and adopted, but that fragmentation, incompatibility, and bespoke implementations will continue to dominate the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now, I’ve been working on this problem for 7 years. Explaining how I landed on this conclusion requires expounding on years of the business equivalent of trench warfare. This post is a deep dive, not a summary. If you want a summary, I suggest dropping this post into your LLM of choice (I won’t be offended). I’ll do my best to be concise, but I also intend on being thorough. The structure of this post is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Assumptions</p><p>Brief History</p><p>Impossible Problems</p><p>Bull Case</p><p>End</p> Assumptions <p>Assumption #0: I’ve drunk the&nbsp;Kool-aid</p><p>As you read this post, your walls might go up. Especially if your salary depends on me being wrong. Just be aware of your biases and know that I am still Kool-aid drunk on the philosophy of self-sovereign identity. I want that future as much as anybody. But in my sincere pursuit to discover reality, I’ve learned some things that I hope others can benefit&nbsp;from.</p><p>Assumption #1: Terminology</p><p>I will use “verifiable credential” or “VC” in this post quite a bit. I’ll also use “self-sovereign identity” or “SSI” or “IDtech”. “Decentralized identity” or “DI” could be subbed in too for all I care. Fundamentally, I’m trying to communicate: A standard way to exchange trustworthy data in a user-centric/user-controlled way. But I’m intentionally avoiding being too pedantic, so don’t get overly caught up in semantics.</p><p>Assumption #2: The world is&nbsp;huge</p><p>The world is inconceivably big.</p><p>Consulting in SSI is a good way to make a living. But hand-to-hand combat is insufficient to get VCs adopted. The only way to scale something on the magnitude needed for SSI to work is a product with product/market fit. That, or regulatory obligation.</p><p>Imagine if companies needed Accenture to adopt artificial intelligence. Now consider how that differs from a world where any developer can pick up an API key from OpenAI and implement GPT4 in an afternoon. LLMs have product/market fit, SSI does&nbsp;not.</p><p>Assumption #3: The market is&nbsp;reality</p><p>Here’s how I think about startups &amp; new product development. The market is unknowable in its entirety. If it was known how to build a successful product (in our case, a widely-adopted SSI wallet or an adoptable VC format), it would have been done by now. To make progress at the cutting edge, you must do something desirable and different. Andy Radcliff calls this being “<a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/blog/venture-capital-economics/">non-consensus and&nbsp;right</a>”.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya">Chamath</a> describes a startup as an exercise in mentally modeling the “market” and building a product to fit that model. If your product is rejected, your model of the world is wrong and you need to iterate its form. If your product is adopted, your model of the world is&nbsp;right.</p><p>All this is to say, the market is the objective reality. It decides winners and losers. As I’ve sought to get product/market fit in this space, I seek to discover reality as impartially as I can. When I see evidence of something working, I pay attention; when I see evidence that something isn’t working, I try to absorb those data points&nbsp;too.</p><p>Assumption #4: The best technology gets&nbsp;adopted</p><p>The worth of software is its impact on humans. The most elegant, idealistic, best software is therefore worthless unless it’s adopted. Actually, if it’s not adopted, it’s not elegant, idealistic, or best — no consolation prizes. The market is the judge and if your product isn’t making an impact on people’s lives, it’s no better than a refrigerator on the&nbsp;moon.</p><p>Adoption isn’t just the most important thing, it’s the only thing. Thus, this is actually a tautology: by definition, what gets adopted is&nbsp;best.</p><p>Assumption #5: Don’t waste your&nbsp;time</p><p>I’ve thought a lot about the optimal point between discouraging and cautioning. Yes, I’ve tried a lot of things but it’s important to state that markets change. Maybe something is different now than when I tried it. I surely can’t turn over every stone. Running new or differentiated experiments in this market is probably fruitful–I don’t want to discourage innovation. But I do want it to shine a light on the graveyard that exists in this space and hopefully prevent people from doing things that are doomed to&nbsp;fail.</p> Brief history <p>I started my journey in identity in 2017 when I interviewed for a job at Sovrin Foundation. I started Trinsic with two cofounders in 2019 because of the relatively low adoption of Sovrin’s network. I thought if we made the technology dramatically easier to use, more companies would adopt&nbsp;SSI.</p>Me plus Tomislav &amp; Michael, my cofounders, launching our product at IIW in&nbsp;2019.<p>We built something good. Hundreds of developers were signing up every month and issuing verifiable credentials. One of those developers was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waynebuilds/">Wayne Chang</a> who, before cofounding Spruce, gave me the feedback that Trinsic was the best execution of any SSI product in the market. He asked something like:</p><blockquote>“With a product like this (where a developer can get value for free) you are probably either using this as lead gen for $250k consulting deals, or you’re just really betting on verifiable credentials blowing&nbsp;up.”</blockquote><p>I told him we were betting on VCs blowing&nbsp;up.</p><p>Our aim was to build a product that would accelerate VC adoption. In our view, if a customer needed consulting to succeed, it was a signal the product wasn’t good enough. (We did consult customers on how to succeed — but we treated this time as product discovery time, and incorporated the results immediately into the product roadmap.)</p><p>What happened is we acquired dozens of paying customers, but not enough were successful enough. We had roughly 1 breakaway <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-customer-stories/">customer story</a> per 500 companies that signed up. The rest were either startups that failed to get traction or large enterprise R&amp;D departments that never went to production.</p><p>In the meantime, the market shaped out in an undeniable way. Dozens of companies obtained product/market fit in the reusable identity space, none of which use the VC standard. Either none of the successful companies chose to use VCs, or none of companies that chose VCs succeeded (two statements of identical outcome but different presumed causation).</p>A slide I made in 5 mins immediately before my IIW38 presentation to make this&nbsp;point!<p>In fact one such company, which raised over $75m from top-tier venture capitalists to fuel its meteoric growth, said to me (paraphrasing):</p><blockquote>“The SSI people had a good idea. So we’re applying that idea to get customers while they’re wasting their time in working groups. You can think of us as proprietary SSI.”</blockquote><p>It’s been a few years since I was told that. I recently checked back in on them. They’re used by tens of millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Another reusable ID company used by several million end-users, which has raised 10s of millions, told me (paraphrasing):</p><blockquote>“We are building a monopoly. Our goal is to own the identity layer of the internet. It might not work, but if it does, we’re going to make a lot of&nbsp;money.”</blockquote><p>Both companies were started after 2019 (the year the VC data model became a W3C recommendation) and chose not to use standards.</p><p>This dynamic vexed me for months. Why was the market rewarding companies with inferior identity solutions?</p><p>It took me too long to conclude that SSI is the inferior identity solution. The market determines winners and losers, better and worse — and there are important reasons the market is rejecting verifiable credentials in favor of proprietary solutions.</p><p>After 4+ years of hypothesizing, experimenting, evaluating, and iterating, I found what I consider to be intractable problems that block adoption of verifiable credentials. I do not know the answers to these problems. If you’re building in the IDtech space, you should take these problems seriously because, in my view, these are the billion-dollar questions you’ll need to crack to have any meaningful success.</p> Impossible problems <p>Impossible problem #1: Interoperability is the premise, but doesn’t&nbsp;exist</p><p>Standards exist to enable compatibility. If interoperability isn’t important, simple alternatives to verifiable credentials exist (such as signing — or not signing — JSON). The ability to share data with an arbitrary 3rd-party in a standardized way (without bespoke integration or direct connection to issuing source) is the core purpose of VCs. But that doesn’t actually exist right&nbsp;now.</p><p>In other words, the reason for the existence of VCs is not&nbsp;present.</p><p>This is because interoperability at the application level requires technical interoperability of keys/signatures, public key resolution, exchange protocols, request/response formats, data models, semantics, and a host of underlying elements. (Not to mention nontechnical interoperability elements, like business models and trust frameworks.) Because a myriad of VC variants, exchange protocols, signature suites, etc. have emerged over the years, which must all line up to effectively interoperate, the only practical way to achieve interoperability with others is to use the same software.</p><p>Theoretically, if everyone in the industry agreed upon a single standard to use, interoperability would be present, and there would begin to be value to adopting VCs today — but there’s a problem: which standard should be adopted? and what if it’s the wrong&nbsp;one?</p><p>Prematurely standardizing is a risky endeavor. But in order to find out what kind of digital credential will have real product/market fit — and thus be adopted — the world needs to experiment, iterate, innovate, over trade-offs to discover what the market will&nbsp;adopt.</p><p>Do you see the problem? VCs need innovation, iteration, and experimentation to succeed. But they also need standardization, agreement, buy-in, and stagnation to have value. These two forces are directly opposed. I wrote about this dynamic more in a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">post</a> several years&nbsp;ago.</p>An image I made in 2022 for a post I wrote about the tension between interop &amp; innovation.<p>Standardization is essential for adoption. But adoption is essential for knowing what to standardize (there’s nothing worse than standardizing the wrong thing)! Prematurely standardizing before adoption is a classic “cart before the horse” scenario.</p><p>To be clear, none of this means that there is no reason to adopt VCs now — it means every reason to adopt VCs today is in anticipation of future value. Because today, verifiable credentials offer zero marginal value relative to simpler alternatives. To rationally adopt VCs, one must make a bet on the future. Some bold companies will be willing to take that very costly journey (like we did), but most will&nbsp;not.</p><p>Impossible problem #2: Initial UX is worse than&nbsp;baseline</p><p>Verifiable credentials are always a better UX than existing identity solutions at scale, but always a worse experience initially.</p><p>I had a mask-laden conversation with the late Vittorio Bertocci at the Internet Identity Workshop in 2021 where I was working to convince him of the merits of VCs as he advocated for federated approaches.</p><p>His point: VCs aren’t necessary to share data outside its original domain. Take, for example, Airbnb wanting to verify a digital driver’s license. Instead of using a VC, DMVs could become an IdP, and Airbnb could add a “verify with X driver’s license button” into their app. The tech exists&nbsp;today.</p><p>My point: Yes, but nobody does that today because it doesn’t work in person, doesn’t work offline, doesn’t work when presenting multiple credentials, doesn’t work when privacy needs to be preserved, etc. But most importantly, in this example Airbnb would need to add a “verify with X” button for all 50 states, which is a very bad UX — VCs would enable one universal verification button!</p><p>I’ve thought a lot about this interaction. While I like to think I helped nudge Vittorio a bit on the value VCs could provide, you’ll notice my points are basically only relevant at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>For a concrete example, take AI agents who need identity wallet capabilities. We ran a whole campaign about this at Trinsic and spoke to dozens of AI agent developers (see this <a href="https://trinsic.id/ai-agents/">landing page</a>, watch the demo video!). It’s obvious the problem exists in the long-term. As a user, it’s a pain to provision an agent access to all my accounts, info, etc. needed for it to accomplish real tasks for me. But in the near-term, 100% of the AI developers we talked to just chose to use OAuth to connect to sources where users’ data exists already (e.g.&nbsp;Google).</p><p>If a user already has a wallet with a bunch of useful credentials in it, obviously sharing those is a better UX than redoing the onboarding process that was required to obtain those credentials. But acquiring the wallet with credentials in the first place will always cause extra friction upfront, which businesses and users are very reluctant toward.</p><p>This problem is compounded because businesses don’t just adopt things that are a little bit better than alternatives. In order to switch behaviors or risk their careers on unproven technologies, new solutions need to be better enough to justify that extra investment. And unfortunately for VCs, for every initial use case I’m aware of, the experience is objectively worse.</p><p>I shared more insights from Vittorio&nbsp;<a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/how-vittorio-shaped-my-perspective-on-ssi-and-how-he-can-shape-yours-a51f62d173f2">here</a>.</p><p>Impossible problem #3: Heat map is too scattered</p><p>When I was raising money for Trinsic as a general-purpose verifiable credential platform, investors would often ask what the most prominent use case for verifiable credentials was — and more specifically, what the most common use case for Trinsic’s customers was. My answer&nbsp;sucked:</p><p>Our customers are building use cases in education, employment, financial services, healthcare, insurance, industrials, government, and agriculture. And&nbsp;more!</p><p>Once, in pursuit of a better answer to this question, we plotted the industries, geographies, and use cases of 100+ paying customers. The scatter plot was all over the place. Nothing stuck out prominently. It didn’t make sense to double down on a specific industry or use case because none dominated our demand. We didn’t even have geographic consistency — adoption existed from Myanmar to Peru to USA to&nbsp;Romania.</p><p>My cofounder Michael continuously sounded the alarm in my ear: in order for VCs to take off, a network effect needs to take hold. No network effect will exist if all adoption is completely scattered.</p><p>This problem doesn’t just affect Trinsic, it affects the entire VC space. Until pockets of adoption breed more adoption in a virtuous cycle, the rate of adoption will be capped to a linear value — and adoption to 1+ billion people requires exponential rates.</p><p>To drive this point home, I’ll cite an example from a packed room at a previous Internet Identity Workshop, circa 2020. In a room full of decentralized ID vendors, I asked for a raise of hands: “Who has ever heard of a verifiable credential being used for a purpose other than that for which it was issued?” (In other words, who has ever heard of a verifiable credential being used for the reason the VC standard was created.)</p><p>No hand went&nbsp;up.</p><p>I asked again in 2024. Still crickets.</p><p>Verifiable credentials won’t take off until this sort of thing is commonplace. This cross-context data sharing simply won’t happen until both sides of the exchange are interested in similar credentials, or are from a similar industry or geography. In other words, this won’t happen until the heat map of potential use cases lights up in a particular spot. But the current nature of the market is very scattered.</p> Bull case <p>This post outlines why I’m not betting on verifiable credentials taking off anytime soon. But if I had to articulate the bull case, there are two arguments here: government mandates and timing/direction of causality.</p><p>Governments</p><p>Governments represent the silver lining for verifiable credentials. While, in my view, the private sector lacks a viable adoption path for the reasons outlined above, governments have different incentives. Governments build utilities, and there is a good argument that interoperable digital ID is a government utility. Many governments in the West are investing in VCs, most notably eIDAS 2.0. Although even that is far from&nbsp;settled.</p><p>Government involvement is not limited to government-issued credentials. Virtually every private sector company in the verifiable credential world (except Trinsic, for what it’s worth) has been subsidized by governments funding their preferred VC standards (DHS funding different standards than the EU, for example). Various technologies through the years have succeeded due to government mandates or subsidies–nothing wrong with it inherently–but it is a telling&nbsp;aspect.</p><p>Governments compelling use of interoperable digital credentials represents the most likely success case for VCs I can think of. But that scenario exists in the medium-term, not the short-term.</p><p>Timing</p><p>The other argument says that verifiable credentials are simply too early. Many of the leading reusable ID ecosystems like IDme, Yoti, CLEAR, etc. were started and initially grew before the VC standard was finalized/stabilized. So one could argue these companies, if started today, could have had the same or greater success using verifiable credentials rather than a proprietary solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, recently companies like Incode, Footprint, Plaid, and many others launched “reusable ID” products and chose not to use VCs after extensive research. And have succeeded far beyond most SSI products. Which presents a difficult rebuttal to this argument.</p><p>One cannot rule out the possibility that companies can succeed betting on the VC standard. But it’s difficult to point to examples of VCs helping a business solve problems for customers (and thus make money) — and it’s trivial to point to dozens of examples of companies sinking millions of dollars into verifiable credential infrastructure (money which could have been spent acquiring customers). One hypothesis is that tinkerers are attracted to VCs while aggressive operators are less likely to experiment on new technologies or make speculative bets on the&nbsp;future.</p> End <p>I referenced Vittorio earlier, and I’ll cite him one last time here. In a blog post about his involvement in the CardSpace project at Microsoft, which is a spiritual ancestor of modern SSI, he&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven&nbsp;stance.”</blockquote><p>I’ve not changed my convictions on the future I want to live in. Nor has my resolve wavered in my desire to build that future. But the market has spoken. Prematurely standardizing a pre-product/market fit technology won’t work — no matter how badly zealous advocates of SSI want it to. That is why Trinsic is no longer a general-purpose verifiable credential infrastructure company.</p><p>While I don’t expect a universal standard for digital IDs will happen anytime soon, new digital IDs continue to roll out every day. These digital IDs are sometimes built with VCs, other times with mDLs, but usually in proprietary ways. Some are bound with biometrics, others with passkeys. Some are focused on solving a problem in a specific industry, others in a specific geography.</p><p>Today, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198674795444490241/">Trinsic Identity Acceptance Network</a> represents the future of Trinsic. Instead of helping companies create digital IDs (issue verifiable credentials or create wallets for users), we help businesses accept existing digital IDs. Our strategy is a bet on continued fragmentation of the ID landscape — a bet on no single standard winning&nbsp;out.</p><p>In fact, I’ve become convinced that Trinsic’s current strategy to help businesses accept digital credentials is actually a necessary stepping stone to a future world powered by interoperable digital credentials. We’re still ushering the world in that direction, just from a different angle.</p><p>Of course, I could be wrong, and I hope I am. My ears and eyes are wide open for new information. My only objective is to see reality as clearly as I can. If you have information you believe I’m missing, I’d love to hear from you and have a conversation. Sincerely! You can DM me on LinkedIn or Twitter, or shoot me an email riley@trinsic.id.</p><p>Thanks to Kim Hamilton Duffy, Gerald Glickman, Timothy Ruff, Eve Maler, James Monaghan, Dave Grantham, and Zachary Jones for giving feedback on a draft of this&nbsp;post.</p>

Compliments of FLUX&nbsp;schnell<p>This last week I spoke with two folks on AI intersection within their work and how their work intersects with one another. One was a CPO for a startup that is bringing AI into their life sciences products in a forefront way. The other was a compliance manager for a pharma company. The second happens to be my wife. For me, their work intersects. They both certainly got me thinking harder about AI agents. The first of the two was breaking down knowledge silos in organizations and I definitely saw a play for AI agents and the use of tools by those agents in their approach. The second needed some exuberant discussion on the potential of how AI can contribute to their organizational goals and needs; and without mansplaining, I was glad to help.&nbsp;:-) The conversations only reinforced in me where we are headed in AI adoption.</p><p>There were discussions on trend analysis, small language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and how AI agents and tools work to bring different knowledge repositories into a single interface with human consumable outputs, just to name a few topics. Surprisingly or not, a lot of these topics were not with the CPO but with the wife; putting the theory into practical examples. It was motivational to&nbsp;me.</p><p>I have been looking for good, practical, and real-world examples of AI agenic tools to work on as knowledge-expanding exercises; whether they work or, in the end, surface the immaturity of the technology. I don’t get especially motivated by the common and tired examples of financial analysis, LinkedIn scraping for recruiting, or travel booking scenarios that every agent example seems to rely on. These discussions were a step&nbsp;forward.</p><p>These topics reinforced with me that for AI and its agents — “its got&nbsp;legs”.</p>

<p>After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9635.html">RFC9635</a>! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/moving-on-from-oauth-2-629a00133ade">shortcomings of OAuth 2.0</a>, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/xyz-why-b855970fdd89">XYZ proposal</a> (and implementations) which eventually led to the formation of the GNAP working group along with a bunch of others. In particular, the work that Fabien Imbault, Yaron Sheffer, Leif Johannsen, and Aaron Parecki put into the documents and conversations in the working group over these&nbsp;years.</p><p>I’m really proud of what we’ve built in GNAP. One of the core tenets of GNAP was to look at the world of OAuth and surrounding technologies and figure out how we could do a lot of that better. It’s been great to see GNAP getting applied in a bunch of places over the web, from payments to key management, and especially in places where OAuth doesn’t reach as well. While OAuth remains deeply entrenched over the world, and likely will be for some time, the community has learned many things from GNAP. Alot of things that started in GNAP have been making their way back to the OAuth ecosystem in some&nbsp;form.</p><p>The most obvious of this is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">RFC9396: OAuth Rich Authorization Requests</a>. This replacement of OAuth’s scope parameter was a direct and intentional backport of what became GNAP’s resource access rights, which also acronyms to RAR. In the OAuth world, we don’t get some of the clean features of GNAP, like being able to substitute strings for objects as a shorthand, but a lot of the core enhancements are&nbsp;there.</p><p>We’re also seeing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-first-party-apps/">yet another intent registration addition to OAuth 2</a> (on top of the pushed authorization request, device grant type, and CIBA extensions), and this one mimics a lot of the flexibility of GNAP’s interaction system. It’s a more narrow use case in the OAuth specification, but it’s clear that the pattern that GNAP was built on is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html">RFC9421: HTTP Message Signatures</a>. This is work that started independently from GNAP but grew up around the same time, and GNAP utilizes HTTP Message Signatures as a core security function. I don’t think we’d have gotten the signing spec to be as robust as it is without some of the GNAP key proofing use cases driving the discussion.</p><p>And finally, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-resource-servers">GNAP Resource Servers document</a> has just passed IESG review and is on its own way to becoming an RFC as well. This document represents key abstractions in how and RS and AS relate to each other, and I hope we can continue to build this out and pull the best ideas out into the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The GNAP working group is shutting down now that its core work is done, but GNAP is far from over. I look forward to seeing it grow into its spaces, and serve as a beacon of how a delegation protocol can be engineered and&nbsp;built.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I drafted <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/5" title="pgxn/rfcs#5 Add RFC for JWS-signing PGXN releases">PGXN RFC–5 — Release Certification</a>, which
proposes to replace the simple inclusion of a SHA-1 hash digests in PGXN
release <code>META.json</code> files with a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html" title="JSON Web Signature (JWS)">JWS</a>-signed release payload. From the
introduction:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>This RFC therefore proposes to extend <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="pgxn/rfcs#3 PGXN Meta Spec v2">v2</a> distribution metadata with a
single additional property, <code>certs</code>, that contains one or more
certifications that attest to the authenticity or other characteristics of
a release on PGXN.</p>
<p>The <code>certs</code> value is an object that contains at least one property, <code>pgxn</code>,
which itself contains a PGXN-generated <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html" title="JSON Web Signature (JWS)">RFC 7515</a> JSON Web Signature in
the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-7.2" title="RFC 7515: JWS JSON Serialization">JWS JSON Serialization</a> format. The <code>pgxn</code> property will allow clients
not only to assemble the release URL and verify the downloaded file against
checksums, but also validate it against a public key provided by PGXN.</p>
<p>The design allows multiple signatures, certifications, or other
attestations, which in the future MAY allow authors or other entities to
sign releases with their own keys. The new format appends a structure such
as this to the distribution <code>META.json</code> file:</p>
  <code>{
  "certs": {
    "pgxn": {
      "payload": "eyJ1c2VyIjoidGhlb3J5IiwiZGF0ZSI6IjIwMjQtMDktMTNUMTc6MzI6NTVaIiwidXJpIjoiZGlzdC9wYWlyLzAuMS43L3BhaXItMC4xLjcuemlwIiwiZGlnZXN0cyI6eyJzaGE1MTIiOiJiMzUzYjVhODJiM2I1NGU5NWY0YTI4NTllN2EyYmQwNjQ4YWJjYjM1YTdjMzYxMmIxMjZjMmM3NTQzOGZjMmY4ZThlZTFmMTllNjFmMzBmYTU0ZDdiYjY0YmNmMjE3ZWQxMjY0NzIyYjQ5N2JjYjYxM2Y4MmQ3ODc1MTUxNWI2NyJ9fQ",
      "signature": "cC4hiUPoj9Eetdgtv3hF80EGrhuB__dzERat0XF9g2VtQgr9PJbu3XOiZj5RZmh7AAuHIm4Bh-rLIARNPvkSjtQBMHlb1L07Qe7K0GarZRmB_eSN9383LcOLn6_dO--xi12jzDwusC-eOkHWEsqtFZESc6BfI7noOPqvhJ1phCnvWh6IeYI2w9QOYEUipUTI8np6LbgGY9Fs98rqVt5AXLIhWkWywlVmtVrBp0igcN_IoypGlUPQGe77Rw"
    }
  }
}
</code>  
    </blockquote>
  
<p>Review and feedback would be very much appreciated, especially on the list of
unresolved questions toward the end.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/author/david-christensen">David Christensen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sjmiller609" title="GitHub: Steven Miller">Steven Miller</a> for the early reviews!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve released <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pgxn_meta/0.4.0" title="crates.io: pgxn_meta crate">pgxn_meta v0.4.0</a>, which adds support for this
format, as well as code to rewrite PGXN v1 release fields to the new format.
It doesn’t actually do signature verification, yet, as the server back end
hasn’t been updated with the pattern and PKI. But I expect to modify it in
response to feedback and get it implemented in early 2025.</p>

In this post I’ll pass along the obvious but well demonstrated lesson I gathered in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>It started with the prior mentioned post that referred to a prior post that it built upon. Following a link to that pre-requisite post, “<a href="https://www.metadocs.co/2024/04/05/create-a-langchain-app-with-multiple-vector-store-the-easy-way/">Create a Langchain app with multiple vector store the easy way</a>”, it in turn referenced an even earlier post as a pre-requisite. So down that rabbit hole I went. The earlier post was “<a href="https://www.metadocs.co/2024/03/26/deploy-a-rag-application-with-langchain-streamlit-and-openai-in-10-min/">Deploy a RAG app with Langchain in minutes</a>”. I read the earliest of the three posts and it was a very simple RAG application. I coded it up ensuring I understood each line along the way. Most notable was that it was splitting the text into chunks on “\n\n”. I hadn’t looked at the source document they were providing as a sample. It turns out it was a text file of a US State of the Union address with a twist. Each sentence was followed by “\n\n” (two line feed carriage returns); an interesting if unrealistic formatting. I have my own example PDF that I have been using for testing out various RAG implementations and how it handles a specific prompt, so I copied two paragraphs from the document that contains the context I was after and formatted it with a “\n\n” after each sentence. Normally, I have been extracting the text from the PDF as part of the code and then chunking usually with recursive character text splitting, but I didn’t want to change this program since I was going to build on it. When done the results actually returned what I was after, a list of the 10 principles of&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>For no apparent reason, I decided to edit the text file and format with a single “\n” after each paragraph. This should return the same results if I edited the text split to represent this. It didn’t. I was, and still am, perplexed by this. It makes no sense that a double line feed split should return any different results than a single line feed results under the circumstances. I plan to revisit this as I believe I must be wrong despite trying multiple times. What was most important in the process was that with the right chunking, as simple as it was, I got the desired results when prompted whereas in all my past experiences it had failed. There was a difference in that I was reading a text file versus using a PDF text extractor and that I was using only two paragraphs focused on the context I wanted versus 70 pages of an academic paper that is probably very hard to extract even if the proper area of context was two clean paragraphs of text within that PDF. The real lesson for me is showing how chunking is so important. I suspect the major differential in the success was in the chunk divisions. I won’t rule out the simpler PDF as a contributor.</p><p>Next, I plan to try a few things in this naive RAG implementation before I move on to the multi-vector store — a PDF creation of just the two paragraphs that contain the needed context and split on paragraphs (\n) to see how that comes out. I’ll try the two paragraphs in a PDF with text extracted and chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and separators=[“\n\n”, “\n”, “. “, “ “, “”] and a chunk size of 1000 and two different settings for overlap (0, and 200) as well as with SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction and then the default OpenAi embedding function. Let’s see how all those combinations work.</p><p>To recap, though I can’t explain why I got wildly different results depending on the parsing character used with the tex file format changed, I can suspect the simple chunking by sentence made a lot of difference. The other likely impacting result was clean simple text versus PDF-extracted text. I plan to experiment more and will report back the results. A take away for me, even if it was not entirely or even primarily the impactful element, was how important the chunking is for good&nbsp;results.</p>

This blog post shares some insights into how we built (and keep evolving) a secure, scalable, and reliable identity platform at DevRev. The decisions we made and the lessons we learned throughout this journey, we believe, would be equally applicable to most SaaS companies. I would like to acknowledge and thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akankshadeswal/">Akanksha Deswal</a>, and the DevRev identity team, who were part of this journey, and instrumental in figuring out what works best for&nbsp;us.</p><p>An identity platform serves as a secure bridge between users and the services they access — whether apps, APIs, or microservices — delivering a seamless and trustworthy way to manage, verify, and protect user identities in increasingly interconnected environments. While the expectations for an identity platform can vary depending on specific use cases, at DevRev, we primarily focused on the following core&nbsp;areas.</p>The expectations for an identity platform can vary depending on specific use cases; and at DevRev, we primarily focused on the above core&nbsp;areas.<p>The decision to buy or build components of an identity platform depends on several factors, such as business requirements (both functional and non-functional), cost at scale, available resources, in-house expertise, and more. We wanted to maintain complete control over our object model (organizations, users, groups, etc.) while delegating more generic identity capabilities to an external identity service (identity provider). Having control over the foundational object model is essential for innovation, and allowing a third party to dictate its structure or limitations can stifle growth and introduce significant risks.</p><p>A few years ago, I enjoyed reading Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century by Jeff Lawson. In the book, Jeff reframes the classic ‘build vs. buy’ debate into a more urgent choice: ‘build vs. die.’ As every company evolves into a software company, the true competitive advantage lies in the software they build. When software becomes the critical interface between our services and our customers, not building it to meet the exact needs means risking irrelevance — or worse,&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Building doesn’t always mean starting from scratch. We shouldn’t reinvent the wheel if existing solutions meet our needs. Instead, focus on developing what’s core to our business — the components that give us a competitive edge. Everything else, the foundational components that enable us to build our vision, can be sourced from the digital supply chain. I touched on this concept in the blog post, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>.</p><p>We had no interest in building identity federation standards like OpenID Connect or SAML, nor did we want to develop authentication protocols in-house. These are commodity features supported by almost all identity providers. However, we wanted to ensure the external identity service handling federation and authentication remained a ‘thin’ layer, separate from our business logic. This approach minimizes vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Vendor lock-in isn’t just about making it easy to switch providers — though that’s certainly part of it. More importantly, it’s about retaining the freedom to innovate independently, which was our primary focus. Within the DevRev platform, Janus serves as the identity service, managing the identity object model and interacting with the external identity provider during organization and user onboarding flows. For the rest of the DevRev platform components, the external identity provider remains a black box, only interacting with&nbsp;Janus.</p><p>Choosing the right identity provider requires a thorough and thoughtful evaluation. Our objective wasn’t to find an identity provider that perfectly matched the DevRev object model but rather to focus on its core constructs, their relationships, and the integration effort with the DevRev platform.</p><p>In the DevRev platform, each organization can choose its preferred authentication method. For example, one organization might opt for Google login, while another may use their identity provider via SAML. The external identity provider’s object model must support this flexible relationship between organizations and their connections. For instance, the connection to Google (social) is made using OpenID Connect, and ideally, we should be able to reuse that Google connection (or any other social connection) across multiple organizations.</p><p>This means the identity provider’s object model should allow connections to be defined independently of a specific organization and provide the ability to associate them with any org. During our evaluation, we encountered one identity provider that could only define a connection within the scope of an individual organization (or tenant), which led us to reject&nbsp;it.</p><p>Apart from key functional requirements for authentication and identity federation, we also worried about the scalability, availability, reliability, testability, compliance, and interoperability of the identity provider, and of course the cost at scale. We picked Auth0, mostly because of the lightweight organization model it had and it could meet our requirement to scale the number of organizations to 1 million. Most of the prominent identity providers do support almost all the key identity federation and authentication needs. Only in non-functional requirements and object relationships, you would find the differentiators.</p><p>In our hunt for an external identity provider, we mostly looked for a SaaS product. Going for a SaaS product gave us the freedom to focus on our core business problem, and delegate anything related to the external identity provider to the SaaS vendor. A key reason one would pick an on-prem product over a SaaS product is the freedom to do heavy customizations. Building heavy customization in the identity provider is something we wanted to avoid from day&nbsp;1.</p><p>Then again, I am not completely ruling out identity provider on-prem deployments. It would depend on the industry you are in and your business-specific needs. For example, highly regulated industries would pick an on-prem identity provider to keep all their customer data within their boundaries. I led the development of the open-source WSO2 Identity Server for almost 14 years, before joining DevRev, and saw many large-scale successful on-prem deployments.</p><p>When picking a SaaS identity provider, non-functional requirements play a key role. We have little control over the non-functional requirements, and even from the SaaS vendor’s point of view, they will find it hard to accommodate change requests related to non-functional requirements; as it could require core changes in their product. For example, Auth0 offers an availability of four 9’s. When you create a tenant in Auth0, it’s bound to one region, and internally they create a replica of that tenant in another availability zone. However, when the primary Auth0 region is down, we do not have the control to switch to the corresponding availability zone. It’s the Auth0 team that decides when to switch based on the severity of the incident. Auth0 also offers a private cloud deployment, but, its a costly&nbsp;option.</p><p>Another limitation we found in Auth0 (and of course in most of the other prominent SaaS identity providers as well) replication of data between regions. For example, when you pin your tenant to the Auth0 US-1 region, all the API calls from any region globally must be routed to the US-1 region. Due to this limitation, we’ve witnessed increased latency levels in login API calls (OpenID Connect) for the users connecting from Asia. This hurts the app load time and at the moment we are in the process of building a solution in-house to minimize the&nbsp;impact.</p><p>The DevRev platform is built with 250+ microservices running on Kubernetes. Janus is one of them. Each service has its CI/CD pipeline, which deploys each commit to main, to Prod after running end-to-end tests in Dev and QA. We’ve integrated Auth0 into the Janus integration tests. We have a dedicated Auth0 tenant for that, and in the CI/CD pipeline, we connect to Auth0 via the API to create organizations and users; and then associate users with organizations. Once the tests are complete, we run a clean-up task to remove the resources created in Auth0, as it has certain resource restrictions.</p><p>There was a time when the clean-up task failed to run and unfortunately went unnoticed. This filled up Auth0 resources and soon reached its limits. Auth0 has a limit on the size of the app metadata that can be associated with a user. We used the app metadata to associate the DevRev-generated organization identifier with an Auth0 user. Once we hit the limit, the Auth0 system became unstable, and none of the data in the test tenant could be accessed either via the UI or the API. This became a blocker for the prod promotion of the Janus service and all other services that relied on Janus for testing. As a quick workaround (while the Auth0 team was working on recovering the tenant), we had to spin up a new Auth0 tenant and use that in our tests. Usually, these limits enforced by Auth0 are way beyond our production needs, and we encountered this issue due to the failed clean-up task from our&nbsp;end.</p><p>Auth0 has a rate limit on its management API. During our tests, we used this management API to create organizations and users. Due to the nature of the tests, we started to hit the rate limits (even with proper retries) which resulted in some flaky tests. As a solution, to this and the resource limit issue we discussed before, we ended up mocking Auth0 in our integration tests, rather than directly hitting the Auth0 test&nbsp;tenant.</p><p>We follow GitOps at DevRev to automate and manage infrastructure and application deployments. Git is the single source of truth. This helps us to take any change via a review process and audit all changes. We followed the same model with Auth0, where appropriate. For example, we use Auth0 actions to inject the DevRev-generated org/user identifiers into the tokens it produces. The actions are Javascript code and we keep it in a Git repo and deploy to the Auth0 Prod tenant via Dev and QA. This helped us avoid any manual edits from the Auth0 management console, and keep all three environments consistent.</p><p>Currently, not all operations on Auth0 are fully managed through GitOps. For example, we still update certain settings, such as token lifetimes for applications, directly through the Auth0 management console. Although these are infrequent tasks, it’s essential to have a complete audit trail in production for every operation and change made. While Auth0 provides logs, they are only retained for a month. To ensure long-term visibility, we push Auth0 logs to Datadog and set up Slack alerts for specific cases. Additionally, we’re exploring the use of the Auth0 Terraform provider to automate and manage all Auth0 operations via&nbsp;GitOps.</p><p>Passwords are painful, not just from the user’s point of view but also from the product side. If an app has to support password-based login, it must also build the supporting infrastructure to recover passwords, rotate them periodically, implement strong second-factor authentication, and so on. From day one, we made a design decision to avoid passwords.</p><p>We use Auth0 as an identity bridge. The contract between the DevRev app and Auth0 is defined by OpenID Connect. Auth0 helps us connect multiple other identity providers via SAML and OpenID Connect to authenticate users. These identity providers are either the social identity providers or the enterprise identity providers owned by DevRev customers. Following the identity bridge pattern helped avoid storing user passwords, and also introducing a new identity provider or an authentication method requires no changes to the DevRev app. It can be done transparently.</p>This graph shows the growth of unique monthly active Dev users by connection type over the last 12 months. The growth in active users is healthy, with enterprise connections starting to dominate.<p>The identity bridge pattern effectively addresses the common challenges posed by the spaghetti-identity and identity-silos antipatterns. Spaghetti identity occurs when a SaaS application tries to establish direct, point-to-point integrations with multiple identity providers, leading to complex, tangled connections. On the other hand, identity silos arise when an application is limited to a single federation or authentication protocol, making it difficult and costly to introduce new protocols in the future. By adopting the identity bridge pattern, organizations can simplify integration and enable flexibility in supporting multiple protocols without the downsides of these antipatterns.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning how we leveraged the identity bridge pattern to overcome a limitation in Auth0. Auth0 supports passwordless authentication with email OTP; however, it cannot be used on its own with Auth0 organizations — only as a second factor. This limitation likely arises from Auth0’s architecture, as the organization model was introduced later. To overcome this and use email OTP as a passwordless method, we spun up another Auth0 instance without organizations and then federated to it from the primary Auth0 tenant (which has organizations enabled). While this approach works, it is far from ideal. We anticipate switching to native passwordless email OTP within our primary Auth0 tenant as soon as that feature becomes available.</p><p>Auth0 provides the latency numbers it introduces during the login operations; however, that does not reflect the latency the users experience at the edge. To address this concern, and also to have better visibility into the OpenID Connect login flow, we started routing all login calls to Auth0 via our CDN provider, which is Fastly. On the Fastly Compute@Edge platform, we run an edge gateway, which pushes all the API stats to Google BigQuery for further analysis. There we would know the latency at the edge corresponding to all the login operations. These latency numbers are very much closer to what the users experience. The following graph shows the p90 latency numbers in milliseconds for the last 31 days against a set of selected regions, for the Auth0 token endpoint.</p>p90 latency numbers in milliseconds for the last 31 days against a set of selected regions, for the Auth0 token&nbsp;endpoint<p>All DevRev applications utilize the OpenID Connect authorization code flow. The token endpoint, highlighted in the graph above, is called once during the initial app load and periodically thereafter for token refreshes. While the periodic refreshes happen asynchronously and do not affect the user experience, the latency of the initial token request during page load is more critical.</p><p>Two main factors contribute to this initial&nbsp;latency:</p>  Geographic latency — All users, regardless of location, connect to a centralized Auth0 instance in the US-East&nbsp;region.  Web-worker-based login flow — The DevRev web app, a single-page application (SPA), leverages this flow, which adds complexity and impacts performance during authentication.  <p>We opted for the web-worker-based login flow to enhance security by storing user tokens in browser memory more securely. However, web worker memory is scoped to a single browser tab, which means that even if a user has an active Auth0 session, opening a new tab requires calling both the authorize and token endpoints during the initial page load. Upon analyzing the stats, we found that 91.1% of the calls to the Auth0 authorize endpoint were from users who were already authenticated. To address this, we developed an edge-based solution targeting these 91.1% of users, aiming to reduce the latency at the edge to almost zero. As of this writing, this solution is being tested in our development and QA environments and will soon be available in production.</p>91.1% of the calls to the Auth0 authorize endpoint were from users who were already authenticated (page reloads). The users once logged in to the app, keep the login session. This graph shows the average number of active vs silent logins by weekday for the last 90 days. The edge-based solution we are working on will reduce the latency at the edge for the login calls for already authenticated users by almost&nbsp;100%.<p>In addition to publishing stats related to Auth0 API performance from the edge to Google BigQuery, we also send logs to Datadog. This allows us to trigger alerts in case of Auth0 failures and detect downtimes early. Moreover, this helps us identify which users and organizations are impacted during Auth0 outages — events that have occurred a few times in the past couple of&nbsp;years.</p><p>The contract between all the DevRev apps and the identity provider is based on OpenID Connect. However, we didn’t find the ID token to be particularly useful in the case of an SPA. An SPA is simply a “dumb” app or a public client, which means it cannot make any trustworthy decisions on its own. The access token is the key! (If you’re interested in learning more about the difference between the ID token and the access token, please check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sICt5aS7wzk">this</a>&nbsp;video.)</p><p>We use self-contained access tokens (JWTs), which include the user context with every request. These tokens have been widely adopted in the industry and were formalized as an IETF standard in 2021 (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068">RFC 9068</a>). While Auth0 has yet to support RFC 9068, this has had no impact on our use cases. In fact, for an SPA, using reference tokens (the other alternative to self-contained access tokens — also known as opaque access tokens) is not a viable option. Only the issuer of an opaque token can validate it, and it’s impractical for the gateway intercepting API requests to communicate with the issuer for token validation, for each&nbsp;request.</p><p>When using self-contained tokens, we also need to implement support for revocation. Unlike self-contained tokens, when a reference token is revoked, that request goes to the token issuer. The consumer of the token (such as a gateway) would be aware of the revocation because it communicates with the token issuer each time it validates a token. However, there’s no point in communicating with the issuer to revoke a self-contained token unless there’s a reliable way to propagate the revocation decision to all dependent systems. To address this, we introduced the auth-tokens.delete endpoint, allowing us to revoke access tokens upon user logout. We also maintain a cache of the revoked token IDs, with a TTL based on the token’s expiration.</p><p>Returning to the topic of the ID token, the DevRev app relies on the dev-users.self API to identify the user. Additionally, another reason we can't rely on the ID token for user identification is that Auth0 cannot embed the necessary user information into the ID token, as we store only a minimal set of user data in&nbsp;Auth0.</p><p>Most of the support queries we receive from our customers related to login are due to some kind of an issue with the OTP delivery. Even though the number of such queries is quite low (compared to the success cases), when it happens, it’s painful to the users and hurts the business. Most of the DevRev customers at the stage of evaluation use email OTP-based login and then later switch to login with their identity provider, with SAML or OpenID Connect. Apart from our direct customers, we also offer a support portal for our customers’ customers (who we call Rev users), which also offers login with email&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>Most email OTP-related issues arise from one of the following causes:</p>  The user’s email is added to the email provider’s global suppression list.  The OTP email is marked as&nbsp;spam.  The OTP email is rejected by the user’s mailbox due to internal domain restrictions, or other similar&nbsp;factors.  <p>Email service providers (ESPs) maintain global suppression lists to prevent sending emails to addresses that have previously bounced (due to invalid addresses) or opted out of receiving emails from certain senders. If a user’s email address is on such a list, the OTP email won’t be delivered. This can happen if the user’s email previously encountered delivery issues, such as soft or hard&nbsp;bounces.</p><p>Initially, we used SendGrid as our ESP for sending OTP emails as well as marketing emails. Although we used two separate SendGrid accounts for these purposes, SendGrid maintains a global suppression list shared across accounts when emails originate from the same domain — devrev.ai in our case. This meant that if a user unsubscribed from marketing emails, they were automatically added to the global suppression list, preventing them from receiving OTPs. In some cases, users didn’t even unsubscribe themselves; certain plugins handled it automatically.</p><p>This behavior was undesirable, as it significantly impacted OTP delivery. To address the issue, we switched to AWS SES for sending OTP emails, which reduced global suppression list-related problems by nearly&nbsp;90%.</p><p>We once encountered a particularly interesting issue related to email OTPs, and while it wasn’t a delivery problem, it’s worth mentioning. The user received the OTP email, but every time they tried entering the OTP, it failed. What made this case even more intriguing was that we discovered the OTP had already been attempted from a different IP address just before the user tried it. This explained why the OTP kept failing — the user was attempting to use an OTP that had already been&nbsp;used.</p><p>After further troubleshooting, we discovered the root cause. Along with the OTP in the email, we had also embedded an OTP link that allowed users to log in directly by clicking it. Although this link was commented out in the HTML template and not visible to the user, the organization this user belonged to had strict security protocols that automatically scanned and clicked on links embedded in incoming emails. This security bot didn’t distinguish between commented-out links and visible ones, so it clicked the hidden link, sending a request to the Auth0 server and invalidating the OTP before the user could use it. The issue was resolved by completely removing the commented-out OTP link from the email template.</p><p>Many email providers have spam filters that automatically classify certain emails as spam based on various criteria, such as the content of the email, sending frequency, or the sender’s reputation. If the OTP email is flagged as spam, it ends up in the user’s spam or junk folder, leading to the user not receiving it in their primary inbox. This could occur if the email provider deems the sender domain as suspicious or if the email contains certain keywords that trigger spam filters. After moving from SendGrid to AWS SES and then carefully designing the email template, we could get the number of spam emails almost down to&nbsp;0.</p><p>Every organization and user in the DevRev platform is assigned a unique, immutable, and persistent pseudonym known as a DON (DevRev Object Name). Every resource in the platform has its own DON. The format of a DON is: don:&lt;service&gt;:&lt;partition&gt;:(&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;)+, inspired by Amazon Resource Names&nbsp;(ARN).</p><p>For example, don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz is the DON of an organization. Here, identity refers to the service name, and dvrv-us-1 is the partition identifier, which indicates the organization’s location. For example, an organization in the us-east-1 region has dvrv-us-1 as its partition ID, while one in ap-south-1 has dvrv-in-1.</p><p>The type field of the DON defines the type of the object it is attached to. Every key entity within the DevRev platform is associated with an object, and all objects share a common ancestor known as the Atom object. For example, a devo object type represents a Dev organization, while devu represents a Dev user. A Dev organization is a company or team that uses the DevRev platform, and its members are referred to as Dev users. Customers of a Dev organization are called Rev users, who belong to Rev organizations (also known as workspaces). Both Rev organizations and Rev users operate within the scope of a Dev organization. For instance, the DON of a Rev organization would be: don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz:revo/pqr.</p><p>All identity objects in the DevRev platform follow a predefined schema, ensuring consistency and standardization across all organizations. This common schema facilitates smooth integration and uniformity across the platform. However, recognizing that different organizations may have unique requirements, we also provide the flexibility to extend the Dev user and Rev user objects with custom fields specific to a given Dev organization.</p><p>Customizability is essential for organizations that need to tailor their identity models to accommodate unique workflows, industry requirements, or specific customer data needs. For instance, a Dev organization might need to capture additional fields such as department codes, job roles, or region-specific preferences that go beyond the standard schema. Moreover, when importing Rev user objects from external systems like Salesforce or Zendesk, these objects may come with their own set of attributes. The ability to extend and adapt the schema allows organizations to seamlessly integrate and migrate from these external systems to the DevRev platform.</p><p>All personally identifiable information (PII) of DevRev users is stored exclusively in Janus, making it the single source of truth for PII. Other services in the platform reference users through their DONs. For example, when a client calls the works.get API to retrieve a work item, the request goes through the DevRev gateway, which makes a gRPC call to the corresponding service. The service returns the work item data, including the DONs of the users who created and are assigned to the&nbsp;item.</p>The DevRev platform is built with 250+ microservices running on Kubernetes. Fastly Compute@Edge serves as the entry point at the edge for all DevRev services. At the origin, the DevRev API gateway intercepts all incoming traffic. Once the gateway verifies the JWT accompanying an API request, it dispatches the request to the appropriate service.<p>Since raw user DONs are not user-friendly, the gateway resolves them into user details, such as display name, email, and full name, by querying Janus (<a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html">the API composition pattern</a>). These user summaries are cached in Redis to avoid repetitive calls to Janus (from the gateway), ensuring faster response times for future requests.</p><p>A DON attached to a user or an organization is an immutable identifier. It’s not just immutable, but also resolvable by its own — or embeds information in it. For example, we use the partition ID embedded into the organization DON to route requests to the corresponding region of the organization, in our <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/how-we-built-multi-regional-routing-at-the-edge-devrev-42059ddb9225">multi-regional routing implementation </a>built at the edge. Designing a system based on immutable identifiers needs to be done with care because the cost of a bad design decision is high. For example, we embed the Dev organization ID into the user DON, which means we cannot move this user to another Dev organization or a user cannot be part of multiple Dev organizations. This is a conscious decision we made to scope all the resources in the DevRev platform under a Dev organization.</p><p>However, we made a mistake in our Rev user implementation. The Rev user DON embeds both the Dev organization ID and the corresponding Rev organization ID. This means, a Rev user cannot switch Rev organizations, or cannot be part of multiple Rev organizations. This was not a requirement initially, but as we kept learning from our customers, we figured that it was a too restrictive constraint to limit a Rev user to one Rev organization. We made the Rev user scoped at the Dev organization level and removed the Rev organization ID from the DON. This was a painful&nbsp;change.</p><p>The Dev organization ID (don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz), which is embedded into a DON is not incremental. An incremental ID can expose sensitive information, such as the total number of organizations created over time. Malicious actors could exploit this to infer patterns about system growth or attempt ID enumeration attacks to access or manipulate unauthorized resources. Non-incremental IDs make it harder to guess or predict other organization IDs, improving security and reducing the risk of ID enumeration.</p><p>The randomly generated IDs provide global uniqueness, meaning IDs can be safely generated across distributed systems without the risk of collision. This allows for a more flexible, decentralized architecture where different systems or regions can generate IDs without coordinating with a central&nbsp;system.</p><p>We initially used a 48-bit random value as the Dev organization ID. Once base62 encoded, it becomes a string with either 8 or 9 characters. When we moved to the multi-regional deployment, we wanted to ensure the Dev organization ID is unique across all regions by adding a regional prefix, for example, “1” for us-east1. However, since the previously generated Dev organization IDs were already 8 or 9 characters long, this introduced a challenge. A new region could potentially generate an ID with the prefix that results in 9 characters, which could match an already generated ID from a different region, before the introduction of the regional prefix. To address this, we first ensured the base62-encoded 48-bit value was always 9 characters by adding padding, and then introduced a regional prefix on top of that, effectively making the Dev organization ID a fixed-length random string of 10 characters.</p><p>What does deleting a Dev organization mean? A Dev organization has many other resources linked to it within and outside the identity space (or Janus). Dev users, Rev users, workspaces, accounts, service accounts, system users, and preferences are all identity-related objects, while conversations, articles, tickets, and issues, for example, are objects outside the identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>This is a common problem in a distributed system. What we need is a cascade delete. Implementing a cascade delete in a distributed system requires careful consideration of consistency, availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Unlike a traditional monolithic system, where database constraints and relationships can directly enforce cascade deletes, distributed systems involve multiple services, databases, and possibly different regions, making the process more&nbsp;complex.</p><p>When a Dev organization is deleted, we mark it as soft-deleted. A soft delete marks a Dev organization as deleted without actually removing it from the database. This is, in general, useful to avoid cascading failures in case other services depend on the deleted entity. When a Dev organization is marked as deleted, it triggers a CDC (change data capture) event, and we have a dedicated service (garbage collection service), listening to these events and taking actions based on the type of the object being deleted and the dependent object&nbsp;types.</p><p>Once the garbage collection service picks the event to soft delete an organization, it spins up a temporal workflow, which will trigger the cascade delete of the dependent objects after a retention period. As you have figured out already this is a recursive process, and we only need to specify the first level of dependencies.</p><p>In general, there are two common saga patterns for cascade delete implementation, orchestration-based saga and choreography-based saga. In the orchestration-based saga pattern, a central coordinator service orchestrates the cascade delete by calling each service that manages dependent objects in a defined sequence. It ensures the cascade completes across all services or triggers compensating actions (e.g., undo the deletion) if a step fails. In the choreography-based saga pattern, each service listens for events and performs its part of the cascade delete, triggering further events to continue the process. We picked the orchestration-based saga pattern over the choreography-based saga.</p><p>At DevRev, we leverage a range of databases — including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and DynamoDB — each selected to address specific use cases. For all identity-related data managed by Janus and the STS (which we’ll discuss later in this blog), we rely on MongoDB. MongoDB is ideal for transactional (OLTP) workloads, excelling in scenarios that demand high write throughput and the ability to manage large volumes of concurrent transactions. Its built-in replication via replica sets provides automatic failover and data redundancy across multiple nodes, enhancing both reliability and fault tolerance. To ensure data consistency, we utilize the majority write concern and read from the primary node. Currently, we are focusing on improving read and write performance in this&nbsp;setup.</p><p>MongoDB also offers horizontal scaling through sharding, where each shard operates as a replica set. Data is distributed across shards using a shard key, which is a field (or combination of fields) that determines how MongoDB partitions and routes data. Although we currently operate with a replica set without sharding, we’ve designed each collection in the identity database with a Dev organization ID field that can serve as the shard key, allowing us to seamlessly enable sharding when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Unlike traditional relational databases, which require predefined schema structures, MongoDB’s document-oriented nature supports schema-less design. This flexibility has allowed us to rapidly develop and iterate on identity objects without the need to define a schema or handle migrations upfront.</p><p>Along with MongoDB we also use Google BigQuery, which is a fully managed, serverless, and highly scalable data warehouse designed for fast SQL-based queries and real-time analytics on large datasets. We are using the MongoDB Kafka connector to capture change data capture (CDC) events from MongoDB and push them to BigQuery. This also acts as an audit for all changes at the data&nbsp;level.</p><p>SCIM support had always been planned but was deprioritized due to other tasks. We’re excited that it is now an integral part of the DevRev identity platform. SCIM offers a standardized protocol that streamlines the exchange of identity information between identity providers and external applications, significantly reducing manual processes and minimizing errors. It ensures that user data is synchronized and consistent across all systems. Furthermore, SCIM enhances security by automating the revocation of user access when employees leave or change roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring proper access management.</p><p>DevRev provides a SCIM endpoint for provisioning users and groups from an organization’s identity provider. Initial testing was done using Okta as the identity provider, and the DevRev SCIM integration will soon be available on the Okta Integration Network. Following that, we plan to expand availability to Azure and Google platforms. As a DevRev platform customer, the DevRev organization has already implemented SCIM for integration with Okta, streamlining identity management within the organization.</p><p>The identity bridge pattern (which we discussed before) facilitates trust mediation between the identity provider trusted by the DevRev platform (Auth0) and external identity providers that authenticate users from DevRev organizations. This pattern is primarily focused on human identities. To bridge the human identity into the services, we’ve introduced a security token service (STS). The STS implementation is inspired by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">RFC 8693</a>. This adds another level of indirection in trust, and all DevRev services only need to trust the STS. You can read more about STS from this blog: <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/securing-north-south-and-east-west-traffic-devrev-2004b4397950">Securing north/south and east/west traffic @&nbsp;DevRev</a>.</p><p>STS is a key part of the DevRev identity architecture, which helps to make the identity provider a thin layer, which we discussed earlier in this blog. An Auth0 token tells us who the user is and does not embed any PII data other than the email address. However, when exchanging an Auth0 token for an STS-issued token, we have the flexibility to enrich the token with the data available in the DevRev platform.</p>The STS is capable of issuing tokens of different types. This graph shows the number of tokens issued by the STS for the last 30&nbsp;days.<p>The STS is capable of issuing tokens of different types. For example Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for Dev users, Application Access Tokens (AAT) for service accounts, Rev session tokens for Rev users, and so on. Each of these token types is bound to a set of processing rules. For example, while issuing a Rev session token, the STS talks to Janus, and just-in-time provisions the Rev user, if they do not exist in the system. Another example would be how we handle delegation workflows. When a snap-in wants to act on behalf of a Rev user, it authenticates with its AAT (which represents the snap-in service account) and requests a Rev session token. Also, the STS-issued tokens are used in the multi-regional setup to facilitate certain region-to-region interactions.</p><p>In this blog post, we highlighted key aspects of the DevRev identity platform and the lessons we’ve learned throughout its development. This is an ongoing effort, and as we continue to gain insights from our customers, we constantly discover new ways to enhance the platform and tackle exciting challenges in the identity and security landscape.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-lessons-learned-in-building-a-secure-scalable-and-reliable-identity-platform-devrev-df62e52e89ad">The lessons learned in building a secure, scalable, and reliable identity platform @ DevRev</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Part 1: The Trust Model of Open&nbsp;Badges <p>When the <a href="https://openbadges.org/about/history">Open Badges v 0.5</a> specification was first launched by the Mozilla Foundation in 2012, the intention was to recognize learning that happens at any time, anywhere, and any how. The trust of the badges was based on 1) the persistent hosting of the credential data and 2) the content of the credential in the context it was being evaluated (including evidence which was considered much more significantly in early open badges). While digital signatures were included in subsequent versions, the trust shifted to the badging platforms who would presumably check the identity of the issuers before they allowed them to use their platform.</p><p>The challenges with this have&nbsp;been:</p><p>1) assuming that the badges will always be available for the earner. Trust is based on the presumption that badging platforms persist and will continue a relationship with the issuer, ensuring that even if an earner’s email address has changed that they will still have access to their&nbsp;badges.</p><p>2) ensuring that once a badge has been awarded to an earner that its contents do not change. There is no assured permanence for web platforms. Databases can be altered purposely or accidentally. They can be hacked and some badging platforms allow their clients to change badge descriptions after they’ve been&nbsp;awarded.</p><p>With the most recent update of Open Badges, version 3.0, a new trust model has been adopted that makes it possible for earners&nbsp;to</p>  have access to their digital credentials for as long as they think they will need&nbsp;them,  decide which online identity they would like associated with their credentials,  know that their badges will be perceived as being trustworthy because they have been digitally signed by an identified issuer and can prove that their badge data has not changed since they claimed&nbsp;it.  <p><a href="https://www.1edtech.org/standards/open-badges">1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3)</a> is based on a standard developed and maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) </a>called <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The W3C was founded by the creator of the web, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee</a>, and is responsible for providing the standards <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">that make the web work</a>. VCs can be used to prove any claim online. OBv3 builds upon the VC standard with the purpose of proving claims made about educational achievements. These credentials have historically included badges and micro-credentials but can now also be used for degrees, certifications, and licenses. This means that earners could prove all of their achievements the same way across the web with convenience and security.</p><p>This blog post is Part 1 of a series of content explaining W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0.

<p>This article looks at the different setups when using App-to-App security with Microsoft Entra ID (OAuth client credentials). Microsoft Entra App registrations are used to configure the OAuth clients and resources. For each tenant, an Enterprise application is created for the client App registration when the consent is granted. The claims in the access token are validated as much as possible to prevent unauthorized clients from using the resource.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/GrpcAzureAppServiceAppAuth">https://github.com/damienbod/GrpcAzureAppServiceAppAuth</a></p>



 Use a single ME-ID App registration for client and resource 



<p>A single Microsoft Entra ID App registration can be used for both the client and the resource specification. The aud and the azp claims in the access token will have the same value in this setup. The roles claims are of no benefit. This could be considered a bad architecture because the ME-ID App registration is used for two separate intentions, the client requesting the access token and the resource providing the service. Deployment is simplified as only one App registration is required. The setup cannot be used for multiple clients.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The access token created for this setup will have the same value for the aud claim and the azp claim as the client and the resource are the same. Both of the claims should be validated to prevent other clients accessing the resource.</p>

}
  


<p>In the Azure portal, the Microsoft Entra ID App registration is configured to add an application App Role. This role is returned in the access token as shown above.. It is not required in this setup.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The access token can be validated using Microsoft.Identity.Web in a Web API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", validateAccessTokenPolicy =&gt;
    {
        // Validate id of application for which the token was created
        // In this case the CC client application 
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azp", "19893e32-3f4d-4c5a-b5ca-27891cf75666");

        // only allow tokens which used "Private key JWT Client authentication"
        // // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens
        // Indicates how the client was authenticated. For a public client, the value is "0". 
        // If client ID and client secret are used, the value is "1". 
        // If a client certificate was used for authentication, the value is "2".
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
    });
});
  


<p></p>



 Use separate ME-ID App registrations for client and resource 



<p>This architecture allows for separation of clients and is required if more than one client can use the resource. The different clients can be identified in the application using the azp claim or the oid claim. The aud claim has the resource value and must be validated. The separate clients allows you to distribute different client certificates or secrets for each client. Audit logs can also be per client. The application can also implement separate business logic or authorization based on the client_id, object ID. (azp or oid) </p>







<p></p>



<p>The aud claim returns the resource App registration client_id and the azp returns the client App registration client_id. As two App registrations are used, the claims have different values. The roles claim is also returned in the access token. The roles permission is required to setup the client and resource relationship in the portal, but not required for authorization, if the other claims are validated correctly. It must be validated that only the allowed client acquired the access token for the resource and not any application access token from the same tenant.</p>

}
  


<p>Claim values returned in the access token:</p>



 aud 



<p>This MUST be validated and has the client_id from the resource ME-ID App registration.</p>



 roles: SharedAppRoleForAppToAppClients 



<p>This can be used to validate the access token, if multiple clients can be used to access the resource. This is not required, if the aud is validated. When using OAuth client credentials and an App-to-App client (no delegated user), the default scope is used to access the resource and all roles from the App registration are included in the access token.</p>



 azp 



<p>The azp can be used to lock down the resource to intended clients. This is different for each client. If you validate this, only the allowed clients can use the resource.</p>



 tid 



<p>The tid claim can be used to validate the tenant which requested the resource. It is important to validate this when using multi-tenant App registrations, if the resource is not for “All” Microsoft tenants. Only allow the tenants intended for the resource.</p>



 oid 



<p>The oid claim is the Microsoft Entra ID Enterprise application object ID created for the client App registration. If you are using only a single client and validate the OID, then you can prevent other Enterprise applications using the resource.</p>



 Application implementation in ASP.NET Core 



<p>The resource can be implemented using Microsoft.Identity.Web, if it is an ASP.NET Core Web API application.</p>


  // Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApi(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("ValidateAccessTokenPolicy", validateAccessTokenPolicy =&gt;
    {
        // Validate id of application for which the token was created
        // In this case the CC client application 
        // Works with multi-tenant App registrations
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azp", builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"]!);

        // Value of Azure App registration where role is defined (resource)
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("aud", builder.Configuration["AzureAd:Audience"]!);

        // Single tenant Enterprise application object ID
        // Only validate if locking down to a single Enterprise application.
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("oid", builder.Configuration["AzureAd:Oid"]!);

        // only allow tokens which used "Private key JWT Client authentication"
        // https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens
        // Indicates how the client was authenticated. For a public client, the value is "0". 
        // If client ID and client secret are used, the value is "1". 
        // If a client certificate was used for authentication, the value is "2".
        validateAccessTokenPolicy.RequireClaim("azpacr", "1");
    });
});
  


<p></p>



<p>The application configuration would look like this with your tenant ids.</p>


    "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "damienbodhotmail.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "7ff95b15-dc21-4ba6-bc92-824856578fc1",
    "ClientId": "912584f0-442c-41e3-87b3-3232edd82940",
    // aud claim in the access token, Azure App registration client ID
    "Audience": "1a03257f-18a2-4cfa-81c1-d3cfaba6b09e",
    "Oid": "eb11b352-b9cc-489b-9e50-5eae9ee92e09"
  },
  


<p></p>



 Is the App Role required? 



<p>In no setup, is the App role required in the application implementation as the aud claim can be used to validate the resource. As the default scope is used, all roles in the resource App registration are included in the access token.</p>



<p>The role is required to add a permission in the client ME-ID App registration for a separate App registration resource specification. The role is required in the Microsoft Entra ID portal, if you have different clients App registrations and resources App registrations.</p>



 Multi client, Multiple resources 



<p>In more complex architectures, the solution might have multiple services. A single client can used multiple resources.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Azure App roles are required to assign the resources to the clients. The application requesting the access token for the resource must specify the default scope of the Microsoft Entra App registration resource. This means that in Microsoft Entra ID, a separate access token is used for each resource. A client can request an access token for any resource where the role has been assigned. In the resource implementation, i.e. the API access token validation, the App roles can be used to authorize the request. The aud claim can also be used and the roles are not required.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>If you are using multiple clients, separate the client and the resource specifications. If you only have a single client for an API, then you can just deploy the single Azure App registration for both client and resource. If you are a purist and require that the App registrations match the implementations and are architectural correct, use only one App registration for each application, one the client and one for the resource. If requirements are changed, you can always split this later without complication. Less is more.</p>

I was aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geysers">The Geysers</a>, a geothermal field about 35 miles north of my home in Santa Rosa, but I never gave it much thought until my first bike ride through the area. Then I learned a number of interesting things.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/4378663444"></a></p>
<p>
It’s the world’s largest geothermal field, producing more than 700 megawatts.</p>
<p>
It accounts for 20% of California’s renewable energy.</p>
<p>
The naturally-occurring steam was used up almost 30 years ago, and steam is now recharged by pumping in 11 million gallons of sewage effluent daily, through a 42-mile pipeline, from the Santa Rosa plain.</p>
<p>
That daily recharge is implicated in the region’s frequent small earthquakes. (But nobody seems too worried about that, and maybe it’s a good thing? Many small better than one big?)</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/geysers-geothermal-newsom-sonoma-clean-power/">article</a> in today’s paper reports that <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1359">AB-1359</a>, signed last week by governor Gavin Newsom, paves the way for new geothermal development in the region that could add 600 megawatts of geothermal production. </p>
<p>
How much electric power is that? I like to use WolframAlpha for quick and rough comparisons.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So, 2/3 of a nuke plant. 4/5 of a coal-fired power plant. These kinds of comparisons help me contextualize so many quantitative aspects of our lives. They’re the primary reason I visit WolframAlpha. I wish journalists would use it for that purpose.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled to report that the <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications have now been published as ISO/IEC standards.  They are:</p>

<p>I submitted the OpenID Connect specifications for publication by ISO as <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#PAS">Publicly Available Specifications (PAS)</a> for the OpenID Foundation in December 2023.  Following the ISO approval vote, they are now published.  This should foster even broader adoption of OpenID Connect by enabling deployments in jurisdictions around the world that have legal requirements to use specifications from standards bodies recognized by international treaties, of which ISO is one.</p>
<p>Before submitting the specifications, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a> diligently worked through the process of applying <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2454">errata corrections</a> to the specifications, so that the ISO versions would have all known corrections incorporated.</p>
<p>Having successfully gone through the ISO PAS submission process once, the OpenID Foundation now plans to submit additional families of final specifications for publication by ISO.  These include the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html">FAPI 1.0</a> specifications, and once they’re final, the <a href="https://openid.net/public-review-proposed-final-openid-connect-for-identity-assurance/">eKYC-IDA</a> specifications and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0</a> specifications.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who helped us achieve this significant accomplishment!</p>

In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2024/07/28/how-and-why-to-write-letters-to-voters/">How and why to write letters to voters</a> I discussed <a href="https://votefwd.org">Vote Forward</a>, my favorite way for those of us who aren’t in swing states to reach out to voters in swing states. The site works really well for adopting batches of voters, and downloading packets of form letters. As I close in on 1000 letters, though, I’m finding it isn’t great for tracking progress at scale. Here’s how my dashboard page looks.

<p>
With 50 bundles in play, many of which are farmed out to friends and neighbors who are helping with the project, it’s become cumbersome to keep track of which bundles are prepped (ready to mail) or not. Here is the checklist I needed to see.</p>
 VoteForward Dashboard Report

mmorg: 1-UNPREPPED
r23Pp: 2-UNPREPPED
v9Kbo: 3-UNPREPPED
wLMPw: 4-UNPREPPED
24L4o: 5-PREPPED

5rQmV: 7-PREPPED
...
YV4dL: 48-PREPPED
zKjne: 49-PREPPED
ZrKJz: 50-PREPPED
 
<p>
If you’re in the same boat, here’s a piece of code you can use to make your own checklist. It’s gnarly, if you aren’t a programmer I advise you not even to look at it, just copy it, and then paste it into your browser to have it open a new window with your report.</p>

    newWindow.document.close();
  }, 2000);  // Adjust delay as needed
})();
 

<p></p>
<p>
Here are instructions for Chrome/Edge, Safari, and Firefox. You might need to tell your browser to allow the popup window in which it writes the report. </p>
 
 Chrome/Edge: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Windows/Linux: Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + J</code>. 
 Mac: Press <code>Cmd + Option + J</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 Firefox: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Windows/Linux: Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + K</code>. 
 Mac: Press <code>Cmd + Option + K</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 Safari: 
 
 Open the VoteForward dashboard in your browser. 
 Enable the developer console (if it’s not already enabled):
 
 Go to Safari &gt; Preferences. 
 Click the Advanced tab. 
 Check “Show Develop menu in menu bar” at the bottom. 
 
 
 Open the developer console:
 
 Press <code>Cmd + Option + C</code>. 
 
 
 Paste the code into the console. 
 Press <code>Enter</code> to run the code. 
 
 
<p>
It would be nice to have this as a built-in feature of the site but, as we come down to the wire, this may be a helpful workaround. </p>
<p>
Thanks, again, to the Vote Forward team for all you do! It’s a great way to encourage voter turnout.</p>

                .Authentication(new BasicAuthentication(configuration["ElasticsearchUserName"]!,
                    configuration["ElasticsearchPassword"]!));

            _client = new ElasticsearchClient(settings);
        }
    }

    public ElasticsearchClient GetClient()
    {
        if (_client != null)
        {
            return _client;
        }

        throw new Exception("Elasticsearch client not initialized");
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create Index with mapping 



<p>The index cannot be created by adding a document because the mapping is created incorrectly using the default settings. The mapping can be created for the defined index using the Mappings extension from the  Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch Nuget package. This was added to the client project in the Aspire.Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch package. The mapping is really simple and probably not complete for a production index, some keyword optimizations are required. The detailsCoordinates field is defined as  a GeoPointProperty. </p>


  var mapping = await _client.Indices.CreateAsync&lt;MapDetail&gt;(IndexName, c =&gt; c
   .Mappings(map =&gt; map
       .Properties(
           new Properties&lt;MapDetail&gt;()
           {
                { "details", new TextProperty() },
                { "detailsCoordinates", new GeoPointProperty() },
                { "detailsType", new TextProperty() },
                { "id", new TextProperty() },
                { "information", new TextProperty() },
                { "name", new TextProperty() }
           }
       )
   )
);
  


<p>The created mapping can be validated using the “IndexName”/_mapping GET request. This returns the definitions as a Json response.</p>



<p><a href="https://localhost:9200/mapdetails/_mapping">https://localhost:9200/mapdetails/_mapping</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>Documents can be added to the Elasticsearch index using the IndexAsync method.</p>


  response = await _client.IndexAsync(dotNetGroup, IndexName, "1");
  


<p></p>



 Search Query 



<p>A Geo-distance query is used to find the distance from the selected location to the different Geo points in the index. This using latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>


  public async Task&lt;List&lt;MapDetail&gt;&gt; SearchForClosestAsync(
	uint maxDistanceInMeter, 
	double centerLatitude, 
	double centerLongitude)
{
    // Bern	Lat 46.94792, Long 7.44461
    if (maxDistanceInMeter == 0)
    {
        maxDistanceInMeter = 1000000;
    }
    var searchRequest = new SearchRequest(IndexName)
    {
        Query = new GeoDistanceQuery
        {
            DistanceType = GeoDistanceType.Plane,
            Field = "detailsCoordinates",
            Distance = $"{maxDistanceInMeter}m",
            Location = GeoLocation.LatitudeLongitude(
				new LatLonGeoLocation
				{
					Lat = centerLatitude,
					Lon = centerLongitude
				})
        },
        Sort = BuildGeoDistanceSort(centerLatitude, centerLongitude)
    };

    searchRequest.ErrorTrace = true;

    _logger.LogInformation("SearchForClosestAsync: {SearchBody}", 
		searchRequest);

    var searchResponse = await _client
		.SearchAsync&lt;MapDetail&gt;(searchRequest);


    return searchResponse.Documents.ToList();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The found results are returned sorted using the Geo-distance sort. This puts the location with the smallest distance first. This is used for the map display.</p>


  private static List&lt;SortOptions&gt; BuildGeoDistanceSort(
	double centerLatitude, 
	double centerLongitude)
{
    var sorts = new List&lt;SortOptions&gt;();

    var sort = SortOptions.GeoDistance(
        new GeoDistanceSort
        {
            Field = new Field("detailsCoordinates"),
            Location = new List&lt;GeoLocation&gt;
            {
                GeoLocation.LatitudeLongitude(
					new LatLonGeoLocation
					{
						Lat = centerLatitude,
						Lon = centerLongitude
					})
            },
            Order = SortOrder.Asc,
            Unit = DistanceUnit.Meters
        }
    );

    sorts.Add(sort);

    return sorts;
}
  


<p></p>



 Display using Leaflet.js 



<p>The ASP.NET Core displays the locations and the results of the search in a Leafletjs map component. The location closest to the center location is displayed differently. You can click around the map and test the different searches. The data used for this display is powered using the Geo-distance query.</p>







<p></p>



 Testing 



<p>The applications can be started using the .NET Aspire host project. One is run as a container, the other is a project. The docker container requires a Desktop docker installation on the host operating system. When the applications started, the containers need to boot up first. An optimization would remove this boot up.</p>







 Notes 



<p>Using Elasticsearch, it is very simple to create fairly complex search requests for your web applications. With a bit of experience complex reports, queries can be implemented as well. You can also use Elasticsearch aggregations to group and organize results for data analysis tools, reports. .NET Aspire makes it easy to develop locally and use HTTPS everywhere.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/pgconf-future-ecosystem/" title="PGConf.dev 2024">PGConf.dev report</a> a couple days ago, I mentioned that a few actionable
items came out of the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a> unconference session. One
was the need to document the heretofore unofficial policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Wikipedia: API">API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a>
stability between major and, especially, minor versions of Postgres.</p>
<p>A frequent topic at the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit and Mini-Summits</a> and a number of
PCConf sessions has been concern regarding compatibility changes between minor
releases of Postgres. At <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/">Mini Summit Five</a>, for example, Yurii Rashkovskii
presented a few examples of such changes, leading him to conclude, along with
several others in the community, that C API-using extensions can only be used
when built against the minor release with which they’re used.</p>
<p>In the Unconference session, core committers reported that such changes are
carefully made, and rarely, if ever, affect extensions compiled for different
minor releases of the same major version. Furthermore, they carefully make
such changes to avoid compatibility issues. In <a href="https://x.com/petervgeoghegan/status/1785720228237717627" title="Peter Geoghegan on Twitter: You must be referring to my commit 714780dc…">the case Yurii
found</a>, for example, a field was added to a struct’s padding,
without affecting the ordering of other fields, thus minimizing the risk of
runtime failures.</p>
<p>It became clear that, although the committers follow a policy — and read new
committers into it via patch review — it’s not documented anywhere. The
result has been a bunch of sturm und drang amongst extension developer unsure
what level of compatibility to depend on and what changes to expect.</p>
<p>The week after the conference, I started a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing to
document the committer policy. Following some discussion and review of
potential ABI breaks in minor releases, the consensus seemed to be that the
committers strive to avoid such breaks, that they’re quite uncommon in minor
releases, and that most of the reported issues were due to using more obscure
APIs.</p>
<p>As a result, we started drafting a policy, and after a few iterations, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> pulled things together from the perspective of a core team member,
reframed as “Server API and ABI Guidance”. I converted it into a <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">patch</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) to add it to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: C-Language Functions">C Language docs</a>. A key statement on minor
releases:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, extension code that compiles and works with a minor release
should also compile and work with any other minor release of the same major
version, past or future.</p>

    </blockquote>
  
<p>I hope this document clarifies things. Even if it’s not as strict as some
might hope, it at least documents the project approach to compatibility, so we
have a better idea what to expect when using the C APIs. If you see gaps, or
you have additional questions, please respond to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> — or
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a> (I’ll propagate comments to hackers).</p>
