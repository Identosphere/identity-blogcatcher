<p>GitHub's new social preview images are generated by a Node.js script that fetches data from their GraphQL API, generates an HTML version of the card and then grabs a PNG snapshot of it using Puppeteer. It takes an average of 280ms to serve an image and generates around 2 million unique images a day. Interestingly, they found that bumping the available RAM from 512MB up to 513MB had a big effect on performance, because Chromium detects devices on 512MB or less and switches some processes from parallel to sequential.</p>

<p>So I ordered one of these yesterday…</p>
<p>…and got a notice that said,</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was to my building in Manhattan.</p>
<p>I’m on the third floor, so I went down to the front, and saw it wasn’t there. Since the chance that an Amazon package sitting in front of a Manhattan building’s front door will not be stolen is above zero, I wanted to know if I should be worried. So I went to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/contact-us/">Amazon’s Contact Us page</a> and got this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, after I clicked on the big yellow button, a dialog ensued :</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 Hi! It’s Amazon’s messaging assistant again. 
</blockquote>
 
 
<blockquote>

 Is this what you need help with?

<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 Sorry to hear that. Tell me a little more about what happened. 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 
 
 Package never arrived 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 
<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 OK, looks like the delivery status may have been updated too soon. 
 
 
 
 
 The good news is it should arrive soon. Give us until end of day Wednesday, Jun 23. 
 
 
 
 
 Really appreciate your patience with this. Is there anything else I can help with? 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 
 
 No, that’s all 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 
<p>Messaging Assistant | Customer Service</p>
 
 Thanks for choosing Amazon. I’m here to help whenever you have an issue. 
 
<p>12:50 PM</p>
 
 Messaging Assistant has left. Thanks for contacting Amazon! 
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of thing has happened before; not just with Amazon, and not just here. In fact, it has happened enough times for me to wonder whether there is a method to the madness.</p>
<p>I mean, is “the delivery status may have been updated too soon” an occurrence that’s common for a reason? Also, might that reason be technical, human, neither or both?</p>
<p>To be fair, this is not a big deal. Progress is how the miraculous becomes mundane, and this is a good example of it the mundane miraculous at work. “No sooner said than shipped” is the new norm. So are conversations with robots.</p>
<p>I’d love it if one could give me answers below, but that feature isn’t working right now. So feel free to tweet yours or something. Thanks!</p>

 Common Delegation Patterns in the Verifiable Credential Ecosystem 

<p>It’s commonly understood that verifiable credentials are a useful data model for expressing provenance and authority of data. In other words, they’re great for solving the “who says what” problem in a digital ecosystem. However, did you know that there are three ways in which you can utilize VCs and DIDs to enable delegation and attenuated delegation for more complex scenarios? In this blog post, I’ll cover the three patterns you can use with examples to help you figure out some of the more advanced capabilities of the VC data model. See below for more details!</p>

 Delegation without attenuation by using DID Documents 

<p>As an example, let’s say we have the two following DID Documents:</p>

<p>Alice’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:alice",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:alice",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
        },
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": [
        "did:example:alice#aliceKey1",
        "did:example:bob#bobKey1"
    ]
}
</code>   

<p>Bob’s DID Document:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:example:bob",
    "verificationMethod": [
        {
            "id": "did:example:bob#bobKey1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:example:bob",
            "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
        }
    ],
    "assertionMethod": ["did:example:bob#bobKey1"]
}
</code>   

<p>In this example we can see that Alice has the capability to delegate to Bob the ability for him to assert on her behalf.
In the case of the following VC, bob could then create a valid verifiable presentation based on the following verifiable
credential that was delegated to him:</p>

   <code>{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "id": "http://example.gov/credentials/3732",
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "UniversityDegreeCredential"],
    "issuer": {
        "id": "did:example:issuer"
    },
    "issuanceDate": "2020-03-10T04:24:12.164Z",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:example:alice",
        "degree": {
            "type": "BachelorDegree",
            "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
        }
    },
    "proof": {
        "type": "JsonWebSignature2020",
        "created": "2020-03-21T17:51:48Z",
        "verificationMethod": "did:example:issuer#credentialIssuanceKey",
        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "jws": "eyJiNjQiOmZhbHNlLCJjcml0IjpbImI2NCJdLCJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9..OPxskX37SK0FhmYygDk-S4csY_gNhCUgSOAaXFXDTZx86CmI5nU9xkqtLWg-f4cqkigKDdMVdtIqWAvaYx2JBA"
    }
}
</code>

        "https://example.com/credentials/latest"

            "credentialSubject": {

    }
}
</code>   

<p>This effectively is a method to allow Alice to add bob’s public key to her did document and giving him a copy of the verifiable credential to delegate him to act on her behalf. However, because this pattern relies on Alice granting Bob full authority to perform any action on her behalf, it lacks attenuation, but does have delegation.</p>

 Delegation by VCs 

<p>Additionally, there’s a well documented case to be able to establish attenuation using just VCs. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> for more details on this pattern.</p>

 Attenuated Delegation by VCs 

<p>Further, by combining the pattern described in <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#subject-passes-a-verifiable-credential-to-someone-else">Section Appendix C.5</a> and combining it with the usage of a selective disclosure scheme like BBS signatures, we can enable an attenuated delegation pattern.</p>

<p>This is done via modifying the type of proof used to sign the credential and then utilizing the selective disclosure to limit the data. Using the following original verifiable credential:</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>So there’s a few different take aways from this that should be highlighted. First and foremost VCs and DIDs have some really interesting capabilities that enable delegation and attenuated delegation. However, it’s not always advantageous and requires through understanding of the use case that’s trying to be built with DIDs and VCs and whether or not delegation needs to be enabled or disabled. Finally, it should be noted that while VCs are capable of being used for authorization systems, it’s generally not a good idea to do so. This is because the complexity (based on the number of checks) of the authorization system is quite high and the semantics have not been designed in a way that align well with most authorization systems. If you’re looking for these capabilities, I would recommend you look to the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">ZCAP-LD data model</a> which is designed especially for this. And if you’re still confused and would like some help please reach out and I can see how I can help.</p>

  <p>Summary:      The self-sovereign internet underscores a tension between those who desire perfect oversight of society and those who desire perfect privacy. In this post, I explore a method for conditional legibility of private communications.</p>



<p>
    In <a href="https://blockchain.tno.nl/blog/self-sovereign-communication/">Self-Sovereign Communication</a>, Oskar Van Deventer, discusses the communications layer enabled by DIDs. This is the same layer that I've labeled the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<p>
    Oskar lays out nine requirements for self-sovereign communications (emphasis added):
</p>

 
     The communication channel shall be usable for machine-readable issuer-holder-verifier interactions . 
     The communication channel shall be protected against eavesdropping, impersonation, message modification and repudiation. 
     Parties shall be able to digitally find each other and to establish a communication channel. 
     The communication channel between counterparties shall be persistent. 
     The communication channel shall be intrinsically symmetrical. 
     The communication channel shall not unnecessarily disclose information between counterparties or to third parties. 
     The communication channel shall be unilaterally closable. 
     The communication channel shall not depend on third parties more than needed. 
     The communication channel shall enable compliance with legal requirements, like legal intercept. 
 

<p>I was pleased to see these principles laid out clearly because many of them are often discussed (including by me) as properties of DIDComm, without the precision Oskar imposes.</p>
<p>The last, as Oskar concedes, is likely to be the most controversial. Indeed, when I read it my first reaction was to start arguing. If complying with legal requirements means creating backdoors to DIDComm, I'd oppose it.</p>
<p>The problem with backdoors for complying with legal requirements is that now developers and cloud operators are left with the task of determining who the good guys are. The whole point of decentralized communication systems is to avoid the kind of centralized, single-point-of-failure that backdoors imply.</p>

<a></a>
 Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/a-call-for-reciprocal-negotiated-accountability/">Reciprocal Negotiated Accountability</a>, Daniel Hardman proposes an alternative to backdoors.
</p>

<p>Daniel's idea is to combine two capabilities to create a decentralized system for enabling accountability.</p>
<p>The first is digital watermarks and data terms of service. The watermark is a cryptographically signed addition to the original document that states the terms behind the sharing. For example, a sales agreement could include data sharing terms that state the recipient may not disclose named aspects of the document except under legal subpoena.</p>
<p>The second is provisional anonymity where identifying information is encrypted and the encrypted packaged is shared with the recipient. The keys to decrypt the identifying information are shared with a third party under escrow with legal requirements that the keys only be reveled to the recipient under specific conditions.</p>
<p>Daniel combines these into a decentralized system of opt-in agreements between parties that are tailored to the context and circumstances of the specific communications channel and data sharing. The legal agreement defines the requirements that must be met for access.</p>
<p>Daniel calls this "reciprocal negotiated accountability" because both parties negotiate an agreement about how shared data will be treated.</p>
<p>Daniel's solution won't make those who wish for unfettered access to communications channels happy. But it represents an alternative to backdoors that solves many of the problems backdoors present while protecting privacy for legitimate uses–as negotiated by the parties sharing data.</p>

  <p>Summary: I'm attended the Hyperledger Global Forum this last week–all virtual. I spoke on DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet. If you're not up to speed with DIDComm and how it creates a secure overlay network on TCP/IP, you should be. I consider it one of the most important things to come out of the SSI movement.</p>


DIDs and DID-based Communication or DIDComm form the second layer of the SSI stack, providing a secure communications layer for the exchange of identity information via verifiable credentials. But, because of it's flexibility and the ability to define protocols on top of DIDComm messaging, it promises to be as important as the identity layer it enables. 

<a></a>
 Autonomic Identifiers 

<p>
    The foundation of the self-sovereign internet is built on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">autonomic identifiers</a>. I'm going to speak about Peer DIDs here, but KERI and other systems provide autonomic identifiers that serve just as well.
</p>

<p>
    Identity systems provide the means to remember, recognize, and rely on other parties in a relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered.
</p>

<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller (e.g. Alice) who, by virtue of knowing the authentication factors (e.g. password, key fob, cryptographic key), can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claim it by logging in).
</p>


	<a></a>
	Bindings between Alice, a Peer DID, and the public key it points to. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In an autonomic identity architecture, the controller, Alice, generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with others to create relationships. Alice uses her private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means for Alice to cryptographically respond to challenges so she can prove she controls the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for Alice to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier.
</p>

<p>
    Any entity can create and establish control over an identifier in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can create as many Peer DIDs as she needs, each pointing to a public key that Alice controls. Alice can rotate the keys underneath the Peer DID anytime without impacting the identifier or her ability to prove she controls it. She keeps track of these key events in a key event log. The key event log is a chain of signed change records that can be cryptographically verified. Alice can use it to prove the provenance of her control of the identifier from its inception to the present.
</p>

<a></a>
 Peer DID Exchange  

<p>
    Alice can exchange Peer DIDs with Bob to create a relationship. Because DIDs are associated with public keys, the exchange ensures that Alice and Bob have each other's public keys. They share key event logs (using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a>) for each identifier. If either updates the keys associated with the DID, the other is informed of change.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob exchange Peer DIDs to create a relationship (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Having exchanged DIDs, Alice and Bob can now exchange signed and encrypted messages with each other using DIDComm. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm is a messaging protocol</a> that rides on top of this Peer DID relationship.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob use DIDComm to exchange messages (click to enlarge)




<p>
    Alice and Bob are using digital wallets to store the keys (and manage their key event logs). The DIDComm messages are being exchanged using software agents that understand the DIDComm messaging protocol and use the keys in the wallet.
</p>

<p>
    Alice can have DID-based relationships with multiple people, organizations, and even things. Each relationship includes a secure DIDComm-based messaging capability.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Some of Alice's Relationships (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This network of DID-based relationships forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm messaging has several important properties that, taken together, provide a generative, secure network overlay for the Internet.
</p>

 
     Secure - DID-based relationships are mutually authenticating. 
     Private - messages can be encrypted. 
     Interoperable - messages can be exchanged between any agents that support the DIDComm protocol. 
     Transport-agnostic - DIDComm does not rely on any specific network technology–it is as happy on Bluetooth as on TCP/IP or anything else. 
     Extensible - DIDComm is designed to support other protocols riding on top of its general secure messaging infrastructure.

<p>
    The extensibility of DIDComm is one of its most powerful features because it makes DIDComm generative–just like the Internet itself.
</p>
<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries project has a collection of RFCs</a> that describe protocols for DIDComm messaging. While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm:
</p>

 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">Connecting with others</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Requesting and issuing credentials</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Proving things using credentials</a> 
 

<p>
    Dozens, even hundreds, of other protocols are possible.
</p>

<p>
    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm. One of the Aries RFCs is sample protocol definition of a protocol for playing TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging.
</p>

<p>
    The TicTacToe protocol defines types of messages that are allowed, the game state, and what messages are allowed in each game state. I recommend it as a way to understand DIDComm protocols since it's familiar and easy to understand. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol for picos</a>, which act as DIDComm agents.

 Generativity 

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zittrain wrote a compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf"></a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>

<blockquote>Generativity denotes a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.
     From <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf">The Generative Internet</a><br>Referenced 2021-06-14T13:41:18-0600
     </blockquote>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a> use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Generativity is a function of a technology's capacity for leverage across a range of tasks, adaptability to a range of different tasks, ease of mastery, and accessibility.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I have <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">made the case elsewhere that the self-sovereign internet meets Zittrain's criteria for generativity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors with the ability to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet enables adaptation of DIDComm messaging to any circumstance.
</p>

<p>
    I am bullish on the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/01/generative_identity.shtml">possibilities for verifiable credentials</a> to allow people to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, addresses the problems of social inclusion, and support economic equality to everyone around the globe. With all that, I believe the possibilities for the self-sovereign internet are even larger, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow. DIDComm may turn out to be the most important part of self-sovereign identity.

e-mail but my primary e-mail account was hacked, and now the attacker controls my
Facebook account and I don’t. Maybe Google decided to disable my account, and given
that there is no appeals process, that’s the end of me and my e-mail. The end

hacked and won’t get locked out: it’s a bit like being a really unimportant guest
living in a fancy hotel on a short-term lease. They can kick me out any time, and
keep all my furniture and other possessions, no questions asked. Thank you, I
prefer my very own home, where nobody can kick me out, or at least renter
protection laws, which don’t exist online.</p>

Illustration: Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>This article explains what a wallet is, how it works and how you can use it for managing your digital identity. While there are also wallets for institutions, this article only focuses on wallets for end users. The article also takes into consideration the revised eIDAS regulation including the ‘European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet’.</p> An Introduction <p>A digital wallet is a key management application, which provides a user with a graphical interface to store, manage and secure digital keys. These keys can be used to sign transactions, statements, credentials, documents or&nbsp;claims.</p><p>A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.</p> A digital identity wallet based on self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. <p>Not all wallets are the same! A wallet is a piece of technology, which can be implemented in different ways. While it can leverage decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and verified credentials, it doesn’t necessarily need to follow the principles of SSI. There are cloud wallets, which are hosted and provided by a third party. A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>A digital identity wallet, which follows the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of SSI </a>enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to&nbsp;it.</p> The core functions of an SSI&nbsp;wallet <p>Please note that the described characteristics below are not universally valid for all (SSI) wallets. It’s rather a desired&nbsp;status.</p>Interactions in an SSI ecosystem, picture by Adrian Doerk from&nbsp;Lissi.<p>Establish trusted relationships with third parties:<br>The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control. Hence it is not hosted by a third party. This in turn enables you the portability of communication channels. Meaning if you switch from one wallet to another you can use the communication channels, which you already created without the reliance on any third-party platform.</p><p>Store, organise and present verified data:<br>The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request. Users are also able to verify the identity of the other party, effectively establishing a trusted relationship, which can be leveraged to share and receive information within a defined trust framework such as the eIDAS regulation. This trust might be based on an electronic seal or similar trust mechanisms. However, this might not be the case for all contacts.</p><p>The information exchanged can be verified, but can also be self-attested or just proof a certain threshold without revealing the exact information like your age when proofing you are 18 or&nbsp;older.</p><p>A transparent history of shared data:<br>Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. A framework for the integration of detailed consent forms is currently under development.</p> Self-custody: With great control comes great responsibility <p>These digital wallets run locally as an application on the device of the user. From a technical perspective, these wallets are similar to self-custody wallets for cryptocurrencies. Similar to these wallets the user has the responsibility to do a&nbsp;backup.</p><p>Identification, authentication and authorization:<br>Before diving deeper into the core functions of a digital wallet we need to understand the differences between the three words above. The questions are from the perspective of the verifier or&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Identification answers the question: “Who is I’m talking to?”<br>Authentication answers the question: “Is it you (whom I’ve identified already) again?”<br>Authorization answers the question: “What rights do I want to grant&nbsp;you?”</p><p>The wallet can enable a variety of additional functions and thus serves as a central point for the user to manage and access services. For example, the wallet can be used to replace traditional authentication methods such as passwords with a single sign-on (SSO) functionality. Furthermore, existing standards such as the OpenID Connect protocol can also be connected to enable communication with existing infrastructure. Hence, once widespread adopted the wallet will completely replace passwords for you and enable you to identify and authenticate yourself, identity third-parties as well as authorise third-parties to use your data according to your permissions.</p> The European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet Illustration: European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet<p>The main regulation within the European Union, which addresses the topic of identification (among other topics) is the regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market better known as eIDAS regulation. The regulation just went through a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity">major revision and now includes several aspects regarding self-sovereign identities</a> in its draft version. It also includes the aspect of a European Digital Identity Wallet, which “is a product and service that allows the user to store identity data, credentials and attributes linked to her/his identity, to provide them to relying parties on request and to use them for authentication, online and offline, for a service in accordance with Article 6a; and to create qualified electronic signatures and&nbsp;seals”.</p><p>In the following, the European Digital Identity Wallet is referred to as “EU Wallet” for simplicity.</p> Functions of the EU&nbsp;Wallet: <p>It should technically enable the selective disclosure of attributes to relying parties. Member States should also reach an agreement on common elements of a business model and fee structure of the EU Wallets. The EU Wallet will furthermore enable citizens to create qualified electronic signatures that can facilitate political participation among other functions.</p> EU Wallets shall enable the user&nbsp;to:   securely request and obtain, store, select, combine and share, in a manner that is transparent to and traceable by the user, the necessary legal personal identification data and electronic attestation of attributes to authenticate online and offline to use online public and private services;  sign statements or contracts utilising qualified electronic signatures (QES)  have full control of the EU Wallet. The issuer of the EU Wallet shall not collect information about the use of the EU Wallet which are not necessary for the provision of the EU Wallet&nbsp;service.  use it free of charge (natural persons).  access the wallet for persons with disabilities.   The EU Wallets shall provide a common interface:   to qualified and non-qualified trust service providers issuing qualified and non-qualified electronic attestations of attributes.  for relying parties to request and validate personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes.  for the presentation to relying parties of personal identification data, electronic attestation of attributes or other data such as credentials, in local mode not requiring internet access for the&nbsp;wallet.   Furthermore, the EU Wallets need&nbsp;to:   ensure that trust service providers of qualified attestations of attributes cannot receive any information about the use of these attributes.  meet the requirements in regards to assurance level “high”, in particular as applied to the requirements for identity proofing and verification, and electronic identification means management and authentication.  provide a mechanism to ensure that the relying party is able to authenticate the user and to receive electronic attestations of attributes;  ensure that the personal identification data uniquely and persistently represent the natural or legal person is associated with&nbsp;it.   An EU Wallet shall be&nbsp;issued: <p>(a) by a Member State;<br>(b) under a mandate from a Member State;<br>(c) independently but recognised by a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>The draft regulation requires Member States to issue a EU Wallet under a notified eID scheme to common technical standards following a compulsory compliance assessment and voluntary certification within the European cybersecurity certification framework, as established by the Cybersecurity Act.</p><p>Service providers should communicate their intent to rely on the EU Wallets to the Member States. Relying on the level of assurance “high”, the EU Wallets should benefit from the potential offered by tamper-proof solutions such as secure elements.</p><p>The conformity of EU Wallets should be certified by accredited public or private sector bodies designated by Member States. Certification should in particular rely on the relevant European cybersecurity certifications schemes. The EU Wallet Trust Mark’ means an indication in a simple, recognisable and clear manner that a EU Wallet has been issued in accordance with this Regulation.</p><p>The Commission shall establish, publish and maintain a list of certified European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Where are heading? A personal&nbsp;opinion:   A wallet acts as a central point to manage interactions in a digital world. It will be the standard for identity management and be ubiquitous in everyday&nbsp;life.  Technology is moving fast. While standardisation is taking quite a while, institutions and governments have recognised the need for innovation in this area to secure data sovereignty and not be dependent on a foreign oligopoly of companies with irresponsible business practices.  Dozens of use-cases from different industries are explored in parallel and will be available in the upcoming&nbsp;months.  Over time digital wallets for pure identity management and financial applications (e.g. cryptocurrencies) are likely to&nbsp;merge.  The draft of the revised eIDAS regulation of the European Union is the most comprehensive and ambitious step towards SSI internationally.  While the exact implementation and technical specifications of the EU Wallets are still to be determined, their compulsory issuance for the EU Member States as well as the compulsory acceptance for big platform providers will have a tremendous international impact.  Key management is an issue, which still needs to be solved. This means, the user also has the responsibility of having a secure backup solution to restore the wallet in case of lost&nbsp;access.

  <p>The new <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> command can import CSV and JSON data directly into an in-memory SQLite database, combine and query it using SQL and output the results as CSV, JSON or various other formats of plain text tables.</p>
 sqlite-utils memory 
<p>The new feature is part of <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v3-10">sqlite-utils 3.10</a>, which I released this morning.</p>
<p>I've recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUjd0rkc678">this video</a> demonstrating the new feature - with full accompanying notes below.</p>



<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> already offers a mechanism for importing CSV and JSON data into a SQLite database file, in the form of the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-inserting-data">sqlite-utils insert</a> command. Processing data with this involves two steps: first import it into a <code>temp.db</code> file, then use <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#running-sql-queries">sqlite-utils query</a> to run queries and output the results.</p>
<p>Using SQL to re-shape data is really useful - since <code>sqlite-utils</code> can output in multiple different formats, I frequently find myself loading in a CSV file and exporting it back out as JSON, or vice-versa.</p>
<p>This week I realized that I had most of the pieces in place to reduce this to a single step. The new <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> command (<a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-memory">full documentation here</a>) operates against a temporary, in-memory SQLite database. It can import data, execute SQL and output the result in a one-liner, without needing any temporary database files along the way.</p>
<p>Here's an example. My <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep">Dogsheep</a> GitHub organization has a number of repositories. GitHub make those available via an authentication-optional API endpoint at <a href="https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos">https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos</a> - which returns JSON that looks like this (simplified):</p>
  [
  {
    "id": 197431109,
    "name": "dogsheep-beta",
    "full_name": "dogsheep/dogsheep-beta",
    "size": 61,
    "stargazers_count": 79,
    "watchers_count": 79,
    "forks": 0,
    "open_issues": 11
  },
  {
    "id": 256834907,
    "name": "dogsheep-photos",
    "full_name": "dogsheep/dogsheep-photos",
    "size": 64,
    "stargazers_count": 116,
    "watchers_count": 116,
    "forks": 5,
    "open_issues": 18
  }
]  
<p>With <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> we can see the 3 most popular repos by number of stars like this:</p>
 <code>$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos' \
  | sqlite-utils memory - '
      select full_name, forks_count, stargazers_count as stars
      from stdin order by stars desc limit 3
    ' -t
full_name                     forks_count    stars
--------------------------  -------------  -------
dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite             12      225
dogsheep/github-to-sqlite              14      139
dogsheep/dogsheep-photos                5      116
</code> 
<p>We're using <code>curl</code> to fetch the JSON and pipe it into <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> - the <code>-</code> means "read from standard input". Then we pass the following SQL query:</p>
  select full_name, forks_count, stargazers_count as stars
from stdin order by stars desc limit 3  
<p><code>stdin</code> is the temporary table created for the data piped in to the tool. The query selects three of the JSON properties, renames <code>stargazers_count</code> to <code>stars</code>, sorts by stars and return the first three.</p>
<p>The <code>-t</code> option here means "output as a formatted table" - without that option we get JSON:</p>
 <code>$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos' \
  | sqlite-utils memory - '
      select full_name, forks_count, stargazers_count as stars
      from stdin order by stars desc limit 3
    '  
[{"full_name": "dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite", "forks_count": 12, "stars": 225},
 {"full_name": "dogsheep/github-to-sqlite", "forks_count": 14, "stars": 139},
 {"full_name": "dogsheep/dogsheep-photos", "forks_count": 5, "stars": 116}]
</code> 
<p>Or we can use <code>--csv</code> to get back CSV:</p>
 <code>$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos' \
  | sqlite-utils memory - '
      select full_name, forks_count, stargazers_count as stars
      from stdin order by stars desc limit 3
    ' --csv
full_name,forks_count,stars
dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite,12,225
dogsheep/github-to-sqlite,14,139
dogsheep/dogsheep-photos,5,116
</code> 
<p>The <code>-t</code> option supports a number of different formats, specified using <code>--fmt</code>. If I wanted to generate a LaTeX table of the top reos by stars I could do this:</p>
 <code>$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos' \
  | sqlite-utils memory - '
      select full_name, forks_count, stargazers_count as stars
      from stdin order by stars desc limit 3
    ' -t --fmt=latex
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\hline
 full\_name                  &amp;   forks\_count &amp;   stars \\
\hline
 dogsheep/twitter-to-sqlite &amp;            12 &amp;     225 \\
 dogsheep/github-to-sqlite  &amp;            14 &amp;     139 \\
 dogsheep/dogsheep-photos   &amp;             5 &amp;     116 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
</code> 
<p>We can run aggregate queries too - let's add up the total size and total number of stars across all of those repositories:</p>
 <code>$ curl -s 'https://api.github.com/users/dogsheep/repos' \
| sqlite-utils memory - '
    select sum(size), sum(stargazers_count) from stdin
' -t
  sum(size)    sum(stargazers_count)
-----------  -----------------------
        843                      934
</code> 
<p>(I believe size here is measured in kilobytes: the GitHub API documentation isn't clear on this point.)</p>
 Joining across different files 
<p>All of these examples have worked with JSON data piped into the tool - but you can also pass one or more files, of different formats, in a way that lets you execute joins against them.</p>
<p>As an example, let's combine two sources of data.</p>
<p>The New York Times publish a <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv">us-states.csv</a> file with Covid cases and deaths by state over time.</p>
<p>The CDC have an <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_data">undocumented JSON endpoint</a> (which I've been <a href="https://github.com/simonw/cdc-vaccination-history">archiving here</a>) tracking the progress of vaccination across different states.</p>
<p>We're going to run a join from that CSV data to that JSON data, and output a table of results.</p>
<p>First, we need to download the files. The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_data">CDC JSON data</a> isn't quite in the right shape for our purposes:</p>
  {
  "runid": 2023,
  "vaccination_data": [
    {
      "Date": "2021-06-19",
      "Location": "US",
      "ShortName": "USA",
      ...  
<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> expects a flat JSON array of objects - we can use <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to re-shape the data like so:</p>
 <code>$ curl https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_data \
  | jq .vaccination_data &gt; vaccination_data.json
</code> 
<p>The New York Times data is good as is:</p>
 <code>$ wget 'https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/us-states.csv'
</code> 
<p>Now that we have the data locally, we can run a join to combine it using the following command:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils memory us-states.csv vaccination_data.json "
  select
    max(t1.date),
    t1.state,
    t1.cases,
    t1.deaths,
    t2.Census2019,
    t2.Dist_Per_100K
  from
    t1
      join t2 on t1.state = replace(t2.LongName, 'New York State', 'New York')
  group by
    t1.state
  order by
    Dist_Per_100K desc
" -t
max(t1.date)    state                       cases    deaths    Census2019    Dist_Per_100K

</code> 
<p>I'm using automatically created numeric aliases <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> for the files here, but I can also use their full table names <code>"us-states"</code> (quotes needed due to the hyphen) and <code>vaccination_data</code> instead.</p>
<p>The <code>replace()</code> operation there is needed because the <code>vaccination_data.json</code> file calls New York "New York State" while the <code>us-states.csv</code> file just calls it "New York".</p>
<p>The <code>max(t1.date)</code> and <code>group by t1.state</code> is <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/draft/lang_select.html#bareagg">a useful SQLite</a> trick: if you perform a <code>group by</code> and then ask for the <code>max()</code> of a value, the other columns returned from that table will be the columns for the row that contains that maximum value.</p>
<p>This demo is a bit of a stretch - once I reach this level of complexity I'm more likely to load the files into a SQLite database file on disk and open them up in <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> - but it's a fun example of a more complex join in action.</p>
 Also in sqlite-utils 3.10 
<p>The <code>sqlite-utils memory</code> command has another new trick up its sleeve: it automatically detects which columns in a CSV or TSV file contain integer or float values and creates the corresponding in-memory SQLite table with the correct types. This ensures <code>max()</code> and <code>sum()</code> and <code>order by</code> work in a predictable manner, without accidentally sorting <code>1</code> as higher than <code>11</code>.</p>
<p>I didn't want to break backwards compatibility for existing users of the <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> command so I've added type detection there as a new option, <code>--detect-types</code> or <code>-d</code> for short:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils insert my.db us_states us-states.csv --csv -d

  Since I’m&nbsp;done with fighting in the red ocean of the surveillance-dominated Web, I’ve decided, while busy working in the blue ocean (on what for now we’re calling i-commerce), to bring back, in this blog, some of the hundreds of things I’ve written over the last 30+ years.

<p>Since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/10/26/blue/">done </a>with fighting in the <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/what-are-red-blue-oceans/">red ocean</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance-dominated</a> Web, I’ve decided, while busy <a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">working</a> in the blue ocean (on what for now we’re calling <a href="https://customercommons.org/the-dawn-of-i-commerce/">i-commerce</a>), to bring back, in this blog, some of the hundreds of things I’ve written over the last 30+ years. I’m calling it the Redux series. To qualify, these should still ring true today, or at least provide some history. This early one is still on the Web, <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/buzzstory.html">here</a> at <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser.com</a>. I’ve made only two small edits, regarding dates. (And thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denisecaruso">Denise Caruso</a> for reminding me that this thing started out on paper, very long ago.)</p>
 
<p><a href="http://buzzphraser.com/"></a></p>
<p>The original <a href="http://buzzphraser.com/">BuzzPhraser</a> was created in 1990, or perhaps earlier, as a spreadsheet, then a HyperCard stack; and it quickly became one of the most-downloaded files on AOL and Compuserve. For years after that it languished, mostly because I didn’t want to re-write the software. But when the Web came along, I knew I had to find a way to re-create it. The means didn’t find that end, however, until&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thedance.net/">Charles Roth</a>&nbsp;grabbed the buzzwords by their serifs and made it happen, using a bit of clever Javascript. Once you start having fun with the new BuzzPhraser, I’m sure you’ll thank him as much as I do.</p>
<p>The story that follows was written for the original BuzzPhraser. I thought it would be fun to publish it unchanged.</p>
<p>—Doc, sometime in the late ’90s</p>
<p>BuzzPhrases are built with TechnoLatin, a non-language that replaces plain English nouns with vague but precise-sounding substitutes.&nbsp; In TechnoLatin, a disk drive is a “data management solution.”&nbsp; A network is a “workgroup productivity platform.”&nbsp; A phone is a “telecommunications device”.</p>
<p>The virtue of TechnoLatin is that it describes just about anything technical.&nbsp; The vice of TechnoLatin is that it really doesn’t mean anything.&nbsp; This is because TechnoLatin is comprised of words that are either meaningless or have been reduced to that state by frequent use.&nbsp; Like the blank tiles in Scrabble, you can put them anywhere, but they have no value.&nbsp; The real value of TechnoLatin is that it&nbsp;sounds&nbsp;precise while what it says is vague as air.&nbsp; And as easily inflated.</p>
<p>Thanks to TechnoLatin, today’s technology companies no longer make chips, boards, computers, monitors or printers.&nbsp; They don’t even make products.&nbsp; Today everybody makes “solutions” that are described as “interoperable,” “committed,” “architected,” “seamless” or whatever.&nbsp; While these words sound specific, they describe almost nothing.&nbsp; But where they fail as description they succeed as camouflage: they conceal meaning, vanish into surroundings and tend to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Take the most over-used word in TechnoLatin today: solution.&nbsp; What the hell does “solution” really mean?&nbsp; Well, if you lift the camouflage, you see it usually means “product.”&nbsp; Try this: every time you run across “solution” in a technology context, substitute “product.”&nbsp; Note that the two are completely interchangeable.&nbsp; The difference is, “product” actually means something, while “solution” does not.&nbsp; In fact, the popularity of “solution” owes to its lack of specificity.&nbsp; While it presumably suggests the relief of some “problem,” it really serves only to distance what it labels from the most frightening risk of specificity: the clarity of actual limits.</p>
<p>The fact is, most vendors of technology products don’t like to admit that their creations are limited in any way.&nbsp; Surely, a new spreadsheet — the labor of many nerd/years — is something&nbsp;more&nbsp;than “just a spreadsheet.”&nbsp; But what?&nbsp; Lacking an available noun, it’s easy to build a suitable substitute with TechnoLatin.&nbsp; Call it an “executive information matrix.”&nbsp; Or a “productivity enhancement engine.”&nbsp; In all seriousness, many companies spend months at this exercise.&nbsp; Or even years.&nbsp; It’s incredible.</p>
<p>There is also a narcotic appeal to buzzphrasing in TechnoLatin.&nbsp; It makes the abuser feel as if he or she is really saying something, while in fact the practice only mystifies the listener or reader.&nbsp; And since buzzphrasing is so popular, it gives the abuser a soothing sense of conformity, like teenagers get when they speak slang.&nbsp; But, like slang, TechnoLatin feels better than it looks.&nbsp; In truth, it looks suspicious.&nbsp; And with good reason.&nbsp; TechnoLatin often does not mean what it says, because the elaborate buzzphrases it builds are still only approximations.</p>
<p>But who cares? Buzzphrasing is epidemic.&nbsp; You can’t get away from it.&nbsp; Everybody does it.&nbsp; There is one nice thing about Everybody, however: they’re a big market.</p>
<p>So, after studying this disease for many years, I decided, like any self-respecting doctor, to profit from the problem.&nbsp; And, like any self-respecting Silicon Valley entrepreneur, I decided to do this with a new product for which there was absolutely no proven need, in complete faith that people would buy it.&nbsp; Such is the nature of marketing in the technology business.</p>
<p>But, lacking the investment capital required to generate demand where none exists, I decided on a more generous approach: to give it away, in hope that even if I failed to halt the epidemic, at least I could get people to talk about it.</p>
<p>With this altruistic but slightly commercial goal in mind, I joined farces with Ray Miller of Turtlelips Services to create a product that would encourage and support the narcotic practice of buzzphrasing.&nbsp; Being the brilliant programmer he is, Ray hacked it into a stack in less time than it took for me to write this prose.&nbsp; And now here it is, free as flu, catching on all over the damn place.</p>
<p>What made BuzzPhraser possible as a product is that the practice of buzzphrasing actually has rules.&nbsp; Like English, TechnoLatin is built around nouns.&nbsp; It has adjectives to modify those nouns.&nbsp; And adverbs to modify the adjectives.&nbsp; It also has a class of nouns that modify other nouns — we call them “adnouns.”&nbsp; And it has a nice assortment of hyphenated prefixes and suffixes (such as “multi-” and “-driven”) that we call “hyphixes.”</p>
<p>Since the TechnoLatin lexicon is filled with meaningless words in all those categories, the words that comprise TechnoLatin buzzphrases can be assembled in just about any number or order, held together as if by velcro.&nbsp; These are the rules:</p>
 
 adverbs modify adjectives 
 adjectives modify adnouns, nouns or each other 
 adnouns modify nouns or other adnouns 
 nouns are modified by adnouns or adjectives 
 prefixes modify all adjectives 
 suffixes qualify all adnouns 
 
<p>Here is a diagram that shows how the rules work:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with English, there are many exceptions.&nbsp; But, as with programming, we don’t make any.&nbsp; So cope with it.</p>
<p>With one adverb, one adjective, two adnouns, a noun and a prefix, you get “backwardly architected hyper-intelligent analysis inference leader.”&nbsp; With an adjective and two nouns, you get “interactive leverage module.”&nbsp; Put together buzzphrases of almost any shape and length:</p>
 
 “Breakthrough-capable technology market” 
 “Primarily distinguished optional contingency philosophy control power environment” 
 “Executive inference server” 
 “Evidently complete key business manipulation capacity method” 
 “Incrementally intelligent workgroup process topology vendor” 
 
<p>The amazing thing is that all of these sound, as we say in TechnoLatin, “virtually credible.”&nbsp; And one nice thing about the computer business is — thanks largely to the brain-softening results of prolonged TechnoLatin abuse — “virtually credible” is exactly what it means in plain English: close enough.</p>
<p>BuzzPhraser makes “close enough” easy to reach by substituting guesswork for thinking.&nbsp; Just keep hitting the button until the right buzzphrase comes along.&nbsp; Then use that buzzphrase in faith that at least it sounds like you know what you’re saying.&nbsp; And hey, in this business, isn’t that virtually credible?</p>

  <p><a href="https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/multi-region-databases/">Multi-region PostgreSQL on Fly</a></p>
<p>Really interesting piece of architectural design from Fly here. Fly can run your application (as a Docker container run using Firecracker) in multiple regions around the world, and they've now quietly added PostgreSQL multi-region support. The way it works is that all-but-one region can have a read-only replica, and requests sent to application servers can perform read-only queries against their local region's replica. If a request needs to execute a SQL update your application code can return a "fly-replay: region=scl" HTTP header and the Fly CDN will transparently replay the request against the region containing the leader database. This also means you can implement tricks like setting a 10s expiring cookie every time the user performs a write, such that their requests in the next 10s will go straight to the leader and avoid them experiencing any replication lag that hasn't caught up with their latest update.</p>

 This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the CCPA in California
and the CDPA in Virginia.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now. 
 Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:

<p>This past week, the Colorado legislature passed the “Colorado Privacy Act”,
which makes Colorado the 3rd US state with modern privacy legislation,
following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA in California</a>
and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">CDPA in Virginia</a>.
It will start going into effect about 24 months from now.</p>
<p>Its provisions are similar to California’s and Virginia’s, except for
this one, which goes substantially further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A CONTROLLER THAT PROCESSES PERSONAL DATA FOR PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING
OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA SHALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT
OUT OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING THE CONSUMER FOR
PURPOSES OF TARGETED ADVERTISING OR THE SALE OF PERSONAL DATA …
BY CONTROLLERS THROUGH A USER-SELECTED UNIVERSAL OPT-OUT MECHANISM THAT
MEETS THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> – or
something very much like it – is back in Colorado, and ignoring the setting,
like companies did widely when Do Not Track was created, is not an option any more.
The technical details will need to be figured out between now and when this
provision goes into effect, which two and a half years away. So plenty of
time to get this right.</p>
<p>Progress! Which US state is next? The IAPP has a
<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/State_Comp_Privacy_Law.pdf">great chart</a> showing
the state of privacy legislation in states around the US.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_rer.pdf">full text</a>
of the Colorado bill.</p>

<p>While upgrading the <code>?_trace=1</code> debug mechanism to work with streaming CSV files (in order to fix a nasty <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1349">CSV performance issue</a>) I spotted a severe XSS security hole. I fixed this in 0.57 and also pushed out a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-56-1">0.56.1 release</a> with the same fix, to cover users who weren't ready to test and upgrade the larger changes in the minor point release.</p>
<p>GitHub have a neat mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g">documenting security vulnerabilities</a> which helps alert other repositories that are relying on a piece of software. They also offer a tool for requesting a CVE - I used this, and a couple of days later GitHub's security team reviewed and issued <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32670">CVE-2021-32670</a> (and <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32670">in NIST</a>) - Datasette's first entry in the CVE database!</p>
<p>I don't believe anyone found this hole before me, so it's unlikely to have been exploited in the wild in the past, but if you use Datasette with an authentication plugin sach as <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a> or deploy on a domain that also hosts other authenticated web applications you should upgrade urgently.</p>
<p>Security aside, my favourite features in the 0.57 release are:</p>
 
 If you try to execute a SQL query containing a syntax error, Datasette will re-display your query rather than expecting you to click the "back" button - <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++%5Bfoo%5D">demo here</a>. This is a huge usability improvement that's been far too long coming. 
 You can now use <code>?_col=</code> and <code>?_nocol=</code> parameters to select which columns are displayed for a table, either by URL hacking or using new "Hide this column" / "Show all columns" cog menu options. These selections also affect JSON and CSV output. 
 Facet results now have a <code>...</code> more link which links to the <code>?_facet_size=max</code> version of the page, showing up to 1,000 results - so you can finally facet across al U.S states or all world countries without being truncated at 30. <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants?_facet_size=max">Here's a demo</a>. 
 
<p>I also released a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-57-1">0.57.1</a> bug fix and a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.58a0">0.58a0 alpha</a> previewing a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1371">small improvement</a> to the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-menu-links">menu_links()</a>, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-table-actions">table_actions()</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-database-actions">database_actions()</a> plugin hooks. I've decided to start releasing plugin hook changes as alphas as early as possible, since it makes it easier for people (including myself) to try them out in plugins.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.8 and 3.9 
<p>Two minor releases each with two new features.</p>
<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-8">sqlite-utils 3.8</a> introduces a <code>sqlite-utils indexes my.db</code> command-line tool for viewing the indexes in a database, and a new Python library <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-introspection-xindexes">table.xindexes</a> introspection property which returns more details than the existing <code>table.indexes</code> - I decided to implement a new property rather than break backwards compatibility for existing code using <code>table.indexes</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-9">sqlite-utils 3.9</a> introduces a <code>sqlite-utils schema my.db</code> command and accompanying <code>db.schema</code> property that exposes the SQL schema of the entire database - as opposed to <code>table.schema</code> which just returns the schema for one specific table.</p>
 django-sql-dashboard 0.16 
<p>The first new feature contributed to this package by another developer: Atul Varma upgraded the description on saved dashboards <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/releases/tag/0.16">to render as Markdown</a>, which makes sense since Markdown is packaged with Django SQL Dashboard already - as seen in this <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/sql/django-group-permissions-markdown">delightfully gnarly query</a> which dynamically constructs a Markdown summary of all of the groups and permissions configured for a Django application.</p>
 db-to-sqlite 1.4 
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/tools/db-to-sqlite">db-to-sqlite</a> is my command-line tool for importing data from any SQLAlchemy-supported relational database into a SQLite database. It's a quick and easy way to load data into a format that can be handled by Datasette.</p>
<p>The last release was <a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite/releases/tag/1.3">nearly a year ago</a>. I dropped into the project to wrap up a pull request from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite/pull/29">six months ago</a> and ended up migrating CI from Travis to GitHub Actions and fixing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/db-to-sqlite/releases/tag/1.4">a few other long-standing bugs and feature requests</a> too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jeremy Dormitzer for implementing the new <code>--postgres-schema</code> feature, and sorry it took so long to land in a release!</p>
 And the others 
 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-passwords/releases/tag/0.4.1">datasette-auth-passwords</a> simply bumps the Datasette dependency to 0.56.1 or later, to ensure it isn't run against an older insecure Datasette version. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs/releases/tag/0.6.1">datasette-upload-csvs</a> fixes <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs/issues/19">a bug</a> where this plugin broke against Datasette versions newer than 0.54. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/xml-analyser/releases/tag/1.1">xml-analyser 1.1</a> added support for reading from standard input, e.g. <code>cat x.xml | xml-analyzer -</code> - I wanted this for some XML exploration I was doing, then I added <a href="https://github.com/simonw/xml-analyser/issues/4">some sorting improvements</a> in this and in a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/xml-analyser/releases/tag/1.2">1.2</a> follow-up release. 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-placekey">datasette-placekey</a> is a tiny new plugin which adds SQL functions for working with <a href="https://www.placekey.io/">placekeys</a> - a way of encoding addresses which looks like this: <code>222-222@63s-spp-nbk</code>. The plugin provides SQL functions including <code>geo_to_placekey(latitude, longitude)</code> and <code>placekey_to_geo()</code> and <code>placekey_to_h3()</code>. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-mask-columns/releases/tag/0.2.1">datasette-mask-columns 0.2.1</a> simply removes a stale pinned version of Datasette.

<p>In the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">W3C VC-EDU</a> call on June 7, 2021 we discussed <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> asserted as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). This call began the public discussion of Open Badges as Native VCs (potentially as Open Badges 3.0) to inform the IMS Open Badges Working Group. Why are we discussing this? Why does it matter? How will it work? Feedback from folks in the community have suggested that it would be helpful to answer these questions first from a conceptual standpoint. In a later post, we can outline what the structural changes could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Open Badges are digital credentials that can recognize learning, achievements, and even memberships. They look like an image, but inside the image are metadata properties (it works much like how digital photos have metadata properties that explain the data of the photo, location, etc. so that when the photo is uploaded, applications understand the data). The metadata describes why the badge was issued, when, the recipient (typically an email address), the description and criteria of the achievement, and, critically, how this digital credential can be verified.</p><p>The verification of an Open Badge is dependent on the Issuer of the badge. It can be done in one of two&nbsp;ways:</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">Hosted Verification</a> — One of the metadata properties of an Open Badges is the assertion id which is a URL that hosts the metadata in a&nbsp;.json file. If that URL can’t be found, then the badge is not verifiable  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">Signed Verification</a> — An Issuer can digitally sign the metadata of a badge. This uses cryptography to ensure that the badge data has not changed and that the issuer was the entity that issued the badge. The public key used to sign the badge must be traceable back to the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Primarily, Open Badges platforms are issuing hosted badges. This means the verifying party is dependent on the issuer to host the data. Also, the issuer has some ability to track when the badge data has been accessed and potentially by who (or at least by IP address).</p><p>For 99% of the badges that have been issued to date, this is fine. In fact, badges are often shared via web pages that attractively display the image and data (not by the&nbsp;.json files that contain the data or the baked image with the data inside). So while Open Badges are both human readable and machine readable, the human readable approach is what is used most often. Signed badges are closer to Verifiable Credentials because they also rely on cryptographic proof.</p><p>Neither of these approaches give learners control of their data and this is the overall conceptual shift between Open Badges 2.0 and Open Badges as Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials, like signed Open Badges, are signed by the issuer and verified cryptographically. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can be used to identify the issuer and recipient (using DIDs in Open Badges 2.0 has been prototyped). Also, Verifiable Credentials have a concept called “Presentations” which can be digitally signed by the recipient to prove that they are the recipient of the verifiable credential(s) being presented. All in all, this means that the issuer is verified and also the recipient.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials can be displayed, shared, and presented from wallet applications that are web, mobile, or desktop based (most are mobile right now). Recipients can present one or more of their credentials to verifying third-parties who can verify the credentials without depending on the issuers and consume the data. Not only can the participant manage which credentials are being verified, they can control what aspects of their data are being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>For example, a student’s digital wallet may contain a digital passport, an Open Badge representing a completed course, and an Open Badge representing a student ID (all as Verifiable Credentials). A relying third-party, such as a potential employer seeking to fill an internship role, may need to verify that a student is over 18, has completed a course on communication, and is a current student. The employer’s website application can ask the student to provide this discrete information using their wallet and the student can do this without revealing any of the other information in those credentials like their date of birth, address, photo, or even the name of the school they attend. And all of this information can be verified without contacting the issuers of those credentials. Open Badges 2.0 can’t do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials put learners in the center of a trust triangle with issuers and verifiers. They also add an additional layer of verification for the recipients. Open Badges can take advantage of this, be the first education-focused digital credential spec to promote personal protection of and access to data, and be part of the growing ecosystem that is exchanging Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the human readable aspect of Open Badges would not change in a VC version. Issuers can still display web pages for the issued badges and allow recipients to share their badges online from those pages. The difference being that those web pages would not be reliant on for machine verification or consumption.</p><p>Join us for this continuing discussion in the next VC-EDU call this coming Monday June 14 (and most Mondays) at 8am PDT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST / 5pm CEST.

<p>This article shows how integration tests could be implemented for an ASP.NET Core application which uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/">EF Core</a> and Azure <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/">Cosmos</a>. The database tests can be run locally or in an Azure DevOps build using the Azure Cosmos emulator. <a href="https://xunit.net/">XUnit </a>is used to implement the tests.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEfCoreCosmosTesting</a></p>



<p>EF Core is used to the access Azure Cosmos database. An EF Core DbContext was created to access Cosmos. This is like any EF Core context, with the DBSet definitions as required. Some Cosmos specific definitions are added using the OnModelCreating method. See the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/cosmos/#cosmos-specific-model-customization">Cosmos-specific model customization</a> for more details.</p>


   public class CosmosContext : DbContext
    {
        public CosmosContext(DbContextOptions&lt;CosmosContext&gt; options) 
          : base(options) { }

        public DbSet&lt;MyData&gt; MyData { get; set; }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.HasDefaultContainer("MyDataStore");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .ToContainer("MyDataItems");

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .HasPartitionKey(o =&gt; o.PartitionKey);

            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;MyData&gt;()
                .Property(d =&gt; d.ETag)
                .IsETagConcurrency();
        }
    }
  


<p>The MyData class is is used to model the Cosmos documents. This has a PartitionKey and also an ETag which can be used for the Optimistic concurrency validation.</p>


  public class MyData
{
	public string Id { get; set; }
	public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Description { get; set; }
	public string ETag { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MyDataService service class is used to access the context and implement some query logic as required. I like to keep this simple and not separate the specification of the queries from the the business or the Linq statements. This reduces the amount of code and keeps the data access, business simple and makes it easy to adapt.</p>


  public class MyDataService
{
	private CosmosContext _cosmosContext;

	public MyDataService(CosmosContext cosmosContext)
	{
		_cosmosContext = cosmosContext;
	}

	public void EnsureCreated()
	{
		_cosmosContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
	}

	public async Task CreateAsync(MyData myData)
	{
		await _cosmosContext.MyData.AddAsync(myData);
		await _cosmosContext.SaveChangesAsync(false);
	}

	public async Task&lt;MyData&gt; Get(string id)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData.FirstAsync(d =&gt; d.Id == id);
	}

	public async Task&lt;IList&lt;MyData&gt;&gt; NameContains(string name)
	{
		return await _cosmosContext.MyData
			.Where(d =&gt; d.Name.Contains(name)).ToListAsync();
	}
}
  


<p>The ConfigureServices method adds the services required to use EF Core and Cosmos DB. The services are used in a Razor page application, but this could be any web application, ASP.NET Core API or ASP.NET Core Blazor.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddDbContext&lt;CosmosContext&gt;(options =&gt;
            {
                options.UseCosmos(
                   "AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081/;AccountKey=C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==",
                    databaseName: "MyDataDb"
               );
            });

            services.AddScoped&lt;MyDataService&gt;();
            services.AddRazorPages();
        }
  


<p>The service needs to be tested. Instead of mocking away the database or using separate specifications classes as parameters, the service can be tested as one using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator">Azure Cosmos emulator</a> and EF Core. We used the framework tools to test our code. An EF Core in-memory database could also be used instead of the Azure Cosmos emulator. We use the emulator for these tests. </p>



<p></p>



<p>The tests are setup to add the services to the IoC and build these. The code can be run and asserted as required. To start locally in dev, the Azure Cosmos emulator needs to be started first.</p>

        public Task DisposeAsync()
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
}

  


<p>The integration tests can be run in the Azure DevOps CI. I used a yaml file to test this and added this to my Azure DevOps build. This was a little bit tricky to setup because I did not easily find any working docs. The Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Emulator is installed and started using Powershell. Then the tests can be run. </p>

<p>Note: Cosmos db emulator is pre-installed on the  windows-latest vm hosted image on Azure DevOps .

<p>You can add the yaml pipeline to your Azure DevOps build and it will run like the triggers are defined or the Azure DevOps policies.</p>







<p>This works good, but you have to be careful in preparing the tests and running in parallel. Implementing the tests like this means you have less code in your application and you can still fully test all your code. A disadvantage with this approach is that the tests take longer to run compared to unit tests without the emulator.</p>

<p>A simple technology invented by Bell Labs over 20 years ago (and widely used today) could have prevented the Colonial Pipeline attack.</p> <p></p> <p>In 1880, the French government awarded Alexander Graham Bell roughly the equivalent of $300K as a prize for inventing the telephone. He used the award to fund the research laboratory that became colloquially known as Bell Labs. If you’re not familiar with Bell Labs, you should be. In the 140+ years that followed, researchers at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>invented radio astronomy, transistors, lasers, solar cells, information theory, and UNIX, just to name a few of the many accomplishments. Among the many prestigious <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/about/awards/">awards</a>granted to Bell Labs researchers are nine Nobel prizes and twenty-two IEEE Medals of Honor.</p> <p>In 1998, I joined <a href="https://about.att.com/sites/labs_research">AT&amp;T Labs</a>, which was a research group that the company retained when they spun out most of Bell Labs to Lucent Technologies in 1996. I was a Web Application developer; one of the least technical roles in the Labs. If I ever thought for a moment that I knew technology, I was quickly humbled when I built an app that tracked the Labs' actually importantprojects. The experience of working in the Labs stuck with me in the form of humility and curiosity. I accepted that I may never be the foremost expert in any given technology and I assumed the mindset of a forever student. Even today, I constantly question what I think I know because there are always holes in my knowledge or perspectives that I haven’t seen.</p> <p>1998 was the same year that researchers at AT&amp;T Labs were issued a patent (filed in 1995)  for what became known in our industry as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). As a Product Manager at a tech firm, I don’t review patents for legal reasons. But I recently saw an excerpt of the abstract for the AT&amp;T patent and there was one line that I found entertaining: “A preferred method of alerting the customer and receiving a confirmation to authorize the transaction back from the customer is illustratively afforded by conventional two-way pagers.” Not much has changed in 23 years. Pagers have been largely replaced by SMS but text messaging through the telecom provider’s network remains one of the most popular delivery mechanisms for MFA (despite some <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">potential security flaws</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I have no personal insight into AT&amp;T’s motivations at the time, but I read Kevin Mitnick’s book a few years ago (<a href="https://www.mitnicksecurity.com/ghost-in-the-wires">Ghost in the Wires</a>) and can’t help but wonder if AT&amp;T was at the forefront of developing security technologies because they were such a target of hackers for so many years. I also reached out to Steve Greenspan, one of the inventors named in the patent to get his thoughts on the project. He noted:<br></p><p>"Two-way pagers had just come out (1994-1995), and our cybersecurity  friends were debating whether quantum computing would undermine  password-based security. The goal was to explore business applications for  two-way pagers and to put humans in-the-loop for secure access." <br></p><p>Quantum computing is a a pretty interesting business driver for MFA, especially in the mid-1990's. The concern is even more relevant today as we inch closer to quantum compute becoming a practical reality. Today's authentication systems should store password data in non-reversible hashes (theoretically preventing the quantum threat), but it's clear that credentials are being stolen all the time (often via large databases that are just left unprotected) and MFA remains a top solution to mitigate the damage. Steve and team were clearly on the right track when they dreamed up out-of-band authentication and deserve some credit and recognition for the foresight.<br></p>You may be wondering how this relates to the pipeline attack that led to fuel shortages across the U.S. East Coast. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">reported</a>that the Colonial Pipeline, which is the largest fuel pipeline in the country, was taken down by a single compromised password. That should never happen given the variety of tools available to limit and control access, starting with MFA – a relatively simple solution that would likely have prevented the attack. The entry point to the system was a Virtual Private Network (VPN) account. If you’re using a VPN and expose anything sensitive inside the VPN, you should implement strong authentication that includes at least two authentication factors (something you know, something you have, something you are). These are widely available technologies that are very effective against lost or stolen credentials.    <p>Of course, authentication isn’t the end of the story. Today’s widely distributed and highly dynamic environments require multiple layers of security. We all know how popular email and phishing attacks have become. It only takes one person inside a network to open an email, click a link, or logon to a phishing site to give an adversary a foothold in the network. We have to assume that will happen and build layers of strong security between any one user and the potential targets.</p>   <p>To illustrate the point, here’s a quick example:</p>   <p>Grocery stores who sell small, high-value items have traditionally struggled with theft. (Ask me over a beer sometime about how I helped take down a recurring thief when I worked at a grocery store.) If the only answer was to authenticate users (check ID) on the way into the store, it wouldn't be enough. Once inside, someone can still pocket items and walk out without paying. If you walk into a grocery store today, you’ll see cameras in the healthcare aisle where small, expensive medications line the shelves. But that’s not enough either. Each item is also locked in an anti-theft device that’s removed at the register. And some items are found in a locked cabinet that requires employee assistance. Theft still happens, but each layer reduces the risk. Our IT environments are much more complicated in terms of the various pathways to theft and our responses to reduce risk typically require more than a few layers of security.</p>   <p>Sensitive data should only be stored in a secure area of the network with access controls and Least Privilege enforcement. Access should be limited to specific hosts or networks. Data should be encrypted (inside the file when possible - so if the file is stolen, the data is still unusable). There should be strong authentication to get into the network and monitoring of all activity. There should be alerts on unusual behavior and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to evaluate the sensitivity of data moving across the network. The environment should be scanned regularly for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. And on and on. Any one of these security mechanisms alone is not enough. This multi-layered approach to security is critical in developing a strong security posture that minimizes risk.</p>   <p>We could argue about where to start or which security controls are most important. But, it seems like a no-brainer to implement MFA for employees accessing corporate data and applications. Microsoft, who deals with 300 million fraudulent sign-in attempts daily <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/">concluded</a>that “MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.”That sounds about right. While targeted attacks have increased in prevalence, most attacks are not targeted at specific companies or individuals. Most start with automated scripting or broad-scale phishing attacks that span across potentially thousands of companies and/or millions of people at the same time. When a foothold is found (a script finds a vulnerability or an open port, a user enters credentials into the phishing site, etc.), the attack begins. Implementing a few simple security technologies like automated vulnerability scanning and MFA can prevent most attacks before they begin. Even if a sophisticated phishing attack succeeds despite MFA, the credentials will not be very useful beyond the initial session (which should be limited in scope by other controls).</p>   <p>No single technology will solve all cybersecurity problems. But, implementing MFA is low-cost, easy-to-implement, and highly effective. It may even make life easier for end-users. Password requirements can be loosened because there’s less risk associated with cracked passwords. And there are numerous implementations of passwordless authentication that, while they may not always meet the strict definition of MFA, provide similar (sometimes higher) levels of security as MFA without requiring a password. Combined with context-aware adaptive security (that verifies device, network, location, time-of-day, etc.), these passwordless authentication options may provide the right level of balance between security and user experience. At this point, this isn’t scare tactics or FUD. Attacks on National infrastructure or other high-profile targets can impact the lives of millions with a single execute command. MFA is an easy layer to add to improve security and it’s commonly included with authentication solutions, so there’s really no excuse. It’s time to get it done.</p>

<p>We lost my mother, Deborah Monas, on Sunday evening. I was giving her a head rub; my sister Hannah held her hands; my dad Oscar and her brother Steve were at her&nbsp;feet.</p><p>How is this possible? The world doesn’t feel&nbsp;real.</p><p>When I was a small child, we used to pull out the sofabed in our postgraduate student flat <a href="https://medium.com/doctor-who/sofabeds-snuggling-and-the-blinovitch-limitation-effect-4a1a7dcfb196">and watch Doctor Who together under a blanket</a>. What I would give for a TARDIS now: a way to correct the fabric of time and space. Clearly something is badly wrong with&nbsp;it.</p><p>I want to have something perfect to say, some beautiful encapsulation of who she was, but the truth is that nothing could be perfect enough. There’s no way to write a biography that isn’t an imperfect model. Nothing can adequately describe my beautiful mother: her overwhelming kindness, her sense of justice, her irreverence for tradition and institutions, the love that our house was always, always filled&nbsp;with.</p><p>I’ve written a lot about her health in this space. She had dyskeratosis congenita, which first expressed itself as pulmonary fibrosis. She fought it hard. When she began to use supplementary oxygen, my sister and I moved to California to be closer. The double lung transplant she received at UCSF gave us almost an extra decade of time with her, and it was a privilege to be by her side, with my dad and my sister, on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>She loved reading, and both Hannah and I got to share those experiences with her. Hannah read to Ma for years: books by authors like Wade Davis, Octavia Butler, and Tommy Orange. Ma and I shared book recommendations; this year we read Caste and The Nickel Boys, among others. Even as it became harder to read in print, she picked up audiobooks, and kept going, recording what she’d read in a notebook she kept by her&nbsp;bed.</p><p>Years ago, we were gifted a Sunfish sailing boat by our family friend Pammy Biscoe. The two of them had sailed on it when they were much younger. Now it became her and my thing: she was happiest out on Waquoit Bay, our striped sails catching the wind just right. She called it a Whoosh. I’ll remember her in an infinity of ways, in an infinity of moments, but being out on the water with her, watching her smile as we picked up speed, is one I’ll treasure the&nbsp;most.</p><p>When my parents met, in Berkeley in the 1970s, she worked to fight for affirmative action and tenants’ rights. Her belief and support for progressive causes was an anchor throughout her life. We discovered this week that she had quietly made over 178 progressive donations last year alone, without any of us really knowing. A list of some of the causes she consistently supported follows at the end of this post; in lieu of flowers, we’re asking people to contribute if they have the&nbsp;means.</p><p>I want to honor her by furthering what she put into the world. The loving, non-conformist, irreverent, equity-minded spirit that she embodied.</p><p>As she lay in her hospital bed, we read Ma messages from people who loved her throughout her life. One, from Hannah’s friend Anita Hurrell, particularly sums up our collective childhood, and the sensibility I want to take forward in my own life, inspired by my mother. I’ll end by sharing it here, with kind permission.</p><p>Dearest Deb,</p><p>One time you drove us in the van to the seaside and we ate sandwiches with cucumber in them and I thought they tasted delicious and I felt this strong sense of deep content sitting with Hannah in the back listening to her singing and humming for the whole journey. I have no idea where we went, and in my head it was nowhere in England, but rather part of the big-hearted, loving, funny, relaxed, non-conformist world of your family in my childhood — full of your laughter and your enormous kindness. Sitting on the bench in your house in Marston I recall a moment of feeling complete certainty that your pirozhki were the yummiest food that had ever been made. Staying in Wheatley when my mum and dad had gone away we ate popcorn and I felt safe even though at the time I had lost Blue Bear. I remember calling you my second mummy. I’m not sure I was always a very nice kid and was probably very ungrateful then, but now I wish I could convey how I revere you, Oscar, Ben and Hannah in my thoughts and how lucky I feel to keep your example with me. I look back and see how talented Hannah already was then when we were so little and she could just sing and sing and draw in a magic way, how cool she was (her doll Manuela had beautiful black wild curly hair while I chose Charlotte with twee clothes and ridiculous ringlets), what a true feminist you were, how much of parenting you seemed to do much better than we do these days, how generous and homemade and fun and kind the world you and Oscar made&nbsp;was.</p><p>You are an asset to the universe. I will always love you very&nbsp;much.</p><p>Anita</p><p>Causes Ma consistently supported:</p><p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> — <a href="https://action.aclu.org/give/now">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> — <a href="http://www.weareplannedparenthoodaction.org/">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/">Progressive Turnout Project</a> — <a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/donate">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/naral-pro-choice-america-2">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://314action.org/">314 Action Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/314af_website">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.turnoutpac.org/stop-republicans/">Stop Republicans</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_srg_fr_homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://traindemocrats.org/">National Democratic Training Committee</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/webdonation">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://endcitizensunited.org/">End Citizens United</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/eculavaf">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kqed.org/">KQED Public Media</a> — <a href="https://donate.kqed.org/donatetoday">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://squadvictoryfund.com/">The Squad Victory Fund</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/squad-victory">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.boldpac.com/">BOLD Democrats PAC</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/bold-homepage">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nationalbailout.org/">National Bail Out</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/freeblackmamas">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://philarballo.com/">Phil Arballo for Congress (CA-22)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/arballo-for-congress-1">donate</a></p><p><a href="https://scottsifton.com/home/">Scott Sifton for Senate (MO)</a> — <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/blu-sift-21q1-web">donate</a></p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://werd.io/2021/ma-1">https://werd.io</a> on June 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

      <p>Whilst our ongoing agile iteration into information beings is never-ending, there are the first 100 days. But what to focus on? Well, that rose-tinted period of conflicting optimisation is what <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/">&lt;/Hello, CDO!&gt; </a>is all about. Maintaining sanity when all else has been lost to untested data assumptions is a different problem entirely.</p><p>On Day zero of being a #CDO, you have to be ready and prepared as a translator, interpreter and go-between. Yes, the essential “translation” of business needs into information requires identifying the appropriate data, the relevant analysis, and the correct interpretations, but that is not what I am talking about. There is a different translation to the appropriately modelled, described and analysed, data that offers the language to enable siloed departments in organisations to talk to each other.</p><p>The CDO must have translation skills to help other executives talk about what data means to them and that each party leaves with a common understanding. Exceptional executives can ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>By example,</p>  Data in the language of the finance department has to do with how to position data revenue and costs in the activities in the finance team use. Getting the budget spent on data, algorithms and analysis into the proper R&amp;D tax claim, the capitalisation table and the correct allocation for depreciation take times. How and when should data revenue be recognised? How should the margin for data be calculated? It has nothing to do with what the data does. Understanding what KPI’s the CFO is tasked with and how you can help them be achieved makes for an excellent working relationship. If The CFO is tasked with improving the balance sheet, how you capitalise spending is critical.  Data in the language of the legal department is a focus on the contractual and regulatory obligations. Understanding what the General Council is responsible for is critical, as it has nothing to do with the value data creates for the organisation. If you want certain protections for data, data use and data sharing, working with the legal team to craft holistic on and offline terms that spread across all contracts is critical.  Data in the language of the marketing team can be about privacy persevering data sharing and trust, leading to additional brand value. Sitting down with the senior leadership team in marketing to understand their KPI and BSC can help you translate data into what they need to achieve their goals. It has nothing to do with the value of the data; how they use data is a different issue. However, the CDO must be on top of conflicts that arise with sales targets driven by incentives, KPI’s opt-in demands and contractual boundaries.  <p>Being the translator, interpreter and go-between form you like a bridge, but as already articulated, it means&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo/day-0-as-the-cdo-you-are-now-the-new-corporate-punch-bag-1cddc7713c87">you are also the new corporate punchbag.</a></p>  Note to the CEO  <p>The CDO must have translation skill to help your executives speak with other disciplines about data and enable each party to leave with a common understanding. All CDOs will find the language to translate business context into data-enabled initiatives and ensure that key concepts from one domain or department are appropriately translated into language and concepts in the other domain.</p><p>We focus on the skills to “translate business needs” into data and information needs during interviews and the recruitment cycle. This additional translator, interpreter and go-between skill in this article are the built-in skills for exceptional CDO’s. However, if there is someone already in the team with this strength, it is not essential, but it does create a better working culture. Should you need these skills, they must be proven to you before you offer the job, it is not one to learn on the job.</p>

  <p>Summary:      How does a functioning credential ecosystem get started? This post looks at MemberPass, the credit union credential ecosystem and explores the strategies credit unions are using to gain broader adoption.</p>


<p>My work in self-sovereign identity began with credit unions. It was March of 2016 and I was having a conversation with Timothy Ruff and Jason Law of <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> about how difficult it would be to get a multi-sided verifiable credential market going. Timothy's response was "You've got to come to Denver next week!" I showed up at a hotel ballroom in Denver to find almost 100 executives from credit unions all across the US clamoring (no, really) for verifiable credentials. I was hooked.
</p>

<p>Over five years later, with a few fits and starts, credit unions are deploying credential-based identification systems for their members. To date, seven credit unions have issued credentials to over 22,000 members or about 2% of the eligible membership of those same credit unions.
</p>

<p>Why do credit unions care? One word: fraud. Or maybe two: fraud reduction.
</p>

<a></a>
 It's All About Authentication 

<p>Credit unions and their members face the threat of fraud on all sides. And credit unions employ lots of tools to fight it. But ultimately, the problem comes down to the member and credit union authenticating each other. The problem is that doing this securely annoys people.
</p>

<p>None of us like to spend a minute–or more–answering security questions at the start of a customer service call. And <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber">SMS-based multi-factor authentication is becoming increasingly fraught</a>. Is that text you just got warning you about fraudulent charges on your credit card really from the credit union? It's hard to tell.
</p>

<p>Early on, a few intrepid people in the credit union industry recognized that self-sovereign identity (SSI) offered a way out of this mess. Credit unions are often small and band together to form credit union service organizations (CUSOs) that provide them the services they can't build on their own. They formed a CUSO called CULedger (later renamed <a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a>) to make that vision a reality. Bonifii offers an SSI-based solution for credit unions called <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>

<p>MemberPass allows credit unions to offer their members a verifiable credential that they can use to prove their member number to the credit union. Initially, the <a href="https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_MAINNET/domain/54177">MemberPass credential schema</a> is fairly simple, containing only the following attributes:
</p>

 
     CredentialDescription 
     CredentialId 
     MemberSince 
     MemberNumber 
     CredentialName 
     Institution 
 

<p>Of course, credentials could be much more complicated than this, but this simple schema is sufficient for a member to prove they are in possession of a credential for a specific member number. Members use the MemberPass wallet to connect to the credit union and hold the MemberPass credential.
</p>

<p>MemberPass relies on Bonifii's partner Evernym for technical services. Credit unions integrate their back office applications with the MemberPass platform at Bonifii which relies on cloud services provided by Evernym.
</p>

<a></a>
 Growing Adoption 

<p>While much of the response to fraud is reactive, MemberPass is proactive. Credit unions work to get members using MemberPass as an active measure to prevent fraud. As I said earlier, to date, seven credit unions have issued credentials to over 22,000 members or about 2% of the eligible membership of those same credit unions. Julie Esser, Bonifii's SVP of Client Engagement expects the number of credit unions using MemberPass to more than double in 2021 and the number of eligible members to jump by almost an order of magnitude.
</p>

<p>Increasing the number of credit unions using MemberPass is the first segment in the adoption journey. MemberPass is already integrated with some of the back office platforms that credit unions use, easing the journey. Bonifii is also working with third party integrators to ensure they're technically ready to do the integrations for the rest.
</p>

<p>The second segment of the adoption journey is increasing the percentage of members enrolled from the current 2% to 5% and then 10% over the next year. To do that, Bonifii works with credit unions to train frontline staff in the <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/memberpass-enrollment/">enrollment process</a>. Early enrollments are happening in the branch. But enrollment can also happen on the phone. The phone enrollment process takes 3-5 minutes. The member receives the MemberPass credential while they're on the phone so the call center agent can help with any problems.
</p>

<p>First Education Credit Union's President, Jim Yates, <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2306-first-education-fcu-levels-the-playing-field-launching-memberpass-digital-id-technology">says</a> that most new members are signing up. Signing up the larger body of existing members will likely require a move to self-enrollment since many never come into a branch. Self-enrollment is possible within the authenticated context of the credit union's web site. If the member chooses to enroll, they'll be directed to download the MemberPass app and then scan a QR code. This establishes a <a>secure DIDComm connection</a>. The credit union can then make the MemberPass credential offer. UNIFY Financial Credit Union allows self-enrollment now their online banking application.
</p>

<p>Once a member is enrolled, the credential can be used in-person at the branch, in the drive-thru lane (with or without interactive teller machines), on the phone, or online. This is not only more secure, but often more convenient as well. For example, someone going through the drive-thru lane can authenticate without passing plastic credentials back and forth. Logging in no longer involves receiving a text and then typing in the code. And calling into the call center no longer requires answering a series of questions of questionable value.
</p>

<p>Instead, a push notification on the member's phone asks them to verify they're the one transacting with the teller, call-center employee, or web site. The member clicks "accept" and they're done. Behind the scenes, this is a proof request made through the already established DID connection. By clicking "accept", the member is responding to the request and proving attributes from their MemberPass verifiable credential.
</p>

<p>And it's a win for the credit unions too. Desert Financial's EVP Ron Amstutz <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2273-why-desert-financial-launched-digital-id-verification-tool-memberpass">says</a> it's an important step in reducing fraud. Desert Financial knows they're talking to a member and the member knows they're talking to Desert Financial. Desert Financial is initially recruiting members for the program who call into the call center frequently since that's a big pain point.
</p>

<p>Zach Eychaner from 4Front Credit Union <a href="https://www.cubroadcast.com/episodes/2295-why-4front-credit-union-launched-digital-id-solution-memberpass">says</a> the call center is the first focus for them as well. They are able to shave 30-40 seconds off of each call. With 20,000 calls a year, that time adds up.
</p>

<a></a>
 The Road Ahead 

<p>The MemberPass credential with its limited set of attributes is just a start. The future could include using MemberPass at an ATM or to open account at another credit union. Bonifii's Esser says "Once they get used to MemberPass, members will expect to use it everywhere."
</p>

<p>Here are a few things that credit unions could do to make more use of credentials and SSI:
</p>

 
     As we've seen, the current MemberPass schema is very simple–it doesn't even include the members name. A schema with more information in it–information that's been validated by the credit union–would make it usable outside the narrow use case of authenticating the member to the credit union and offer more value to members. 

     Credit unions could offer a pre-approval credential for loans that the member could hold and then use when they were ready for a loan. 

     Bonifii could issue a credential for KYC use at credit unions, banks, and in other financial transactions. 

     Shared branching is a hot topic in the credit union industry right now. Twenty-three thousand branches looks like a mega bank. But the identity fraud problems are even harder to solve across credit unions. MemberPass can help make shared branching a reality. 

     Employers and employee groups historically make up the foundation of credit unions. Credit unions could partner with employers to create a credential ecosystem. 

     The DIDComm connection is a secure messaging system. Credit unions can use this secure channel for sending notifications to members, or for customer service. 
 

<p>
    The lessons from MemberPass and the credit union industry are important for anyone launching a credential effort:
</p>

 
     Pay attention to the process and tailor it to your industry. Fraud reduction is the focus. Credit unions are evolving their enrollment process and targeting the parts of the process where they can get the most leverage. 

     Start simple. MemberPass is a simple credential but it serves an important purpose: reliably authenticating the member to reduce fraud. 

     Plan for the future, but don't get distracted. There are a thousand use cases for credentials in financial services. Get some early wins with your simple "MVVC", minimum viable verifiable credential, before you move on to the rest. 

     Stay the course. Building a credential ecosystem is more about human factors than technology. In the words of Julie Esser "The technology is baked." But that's just the start. The MemberPass ecosystem is complicated by regulation, scale, and a decentralized collection of players, each with their own problems and goals. Building an ecosystem in this environment isn't easy, but it's where the reward is. 
 

<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic caused credit union branches to close and call center volume skyrocketed and drive-thru lanes were crowded. As a result, fraud also increased. This created a heightened awareness of the importance of digital identity across the credit union industry. But while the pandemic might have pushed things along, many in the credit union industry had already concluded that self-sovereign identity was an answer that was not only flexible, interoperable, and secure, but also one that was aligned with the values of the member-owned cooperatives that make up the credit union industry.

However, it is invitation-only, and many will sacrifice more than they realise in terms of ethics, morals and beliefs to be at the table and remain part of it. When thinking about data, bias and decision making, the incentive to join and incentives when in the club is a critically important driver. This unsaid shadowy hierarchy creates outcomes we did not plan for as some will jeopardise judgment and trust to be rewarded.&nbsp; I would not align to this one either, and it was self-evident that you can only become a partner in a big firm when you have a big mortgage, depending on a big salary. The significant debt and dependence on salary provide leverage.&nbsp; The humour in “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister">Yes Minister</a>”, the 1980’s BBC&nbsp; political satire sitcom, exposed much of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter?&nbsp; We increasingly talk to the equality and diversity (race, gender and neuro) agendas at the board and in the senior leadership team, but it is increasingly evident that there is an inner circle, which means we are not making smarter or better decisions.&nbsp; The targets for transparency and equality are just that, a target.&nbsp; (says the white over 50 male!)</p><p>I appreciate that it is difficult to separate the two dependent and co-joined aspects of the hierarchy. One aspect represents power and control, which is realised in terms of budget, size, scope, authority, and political dominance. The second is how and where important decisions sit, but those who lobby may be outside of the insights that data now provides for complex decision making.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The separate but parallel structures have worked for a long time as the consequences of long term decisions and intergenerational outcomes were not rewarded or measured. ESG, climate and the brutality of our assault on our environment, coupled with data, means this is all changing, but those who gave everything to join the inner circle have an incentive to maintain the status quo for as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>What ghosts are in the system that means decisions we make, with the best intentions, do not create the outcomes we desire</p><p>Take a moment to reflect.&nbsp; Are there separate hierarchies in your experience, or are they the same thing? It matters today more than ever before as we now have to make long term decisions against the backdrop of our systems of short term incentives and rewards.&nbsp; The inner ring becomes blind to a structure that always gives the feel of power as their short term decisions are highly rewarded through immediate incentives, which means being in the club is valuable for the few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This viewpoint is looking at these two hierarchies (formal and informal) but positioning where either can be in the shadow of the other. Why am I writing this because we appear to find short term incentive-driven decisions easy but struggle to make long term judgment?&nbsp; I do not doubt the integrity of leaders who want to make better long term decisions using data and be better ancestors but get frustrated that it does not work.&nbsp; There are likely ghosts from the old decision making and lobby hierarchy in our current heuristics that create outcomes that were not planned.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The term “Shadow Hierarchy” is used in management textbooks to describe the difference between a formal published and public structure and the one that actually has power and decision making.&nbsp; Googling “The Shadow of Hierarchy” will lead you to the 2008 paper from Adrianne Heuritier and Dirk Lehmkuhl, which was part of an EU funded project looking at “<a href="http://www.eu-newgov.org/">new models of governance</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Our past is not easy to face up to.&nbsp; <p>There appears to be a much longer story that starts when decisions, power and control were all united.&nbsp; Over the past 5000 years, we have become increasingly short term focused and separated the decision-making process for the long term from power and control based on the science of management incentive and short term goals. There is no doubt that the structure of economics, along with other biases, come to play.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we have created data technology on top of complex relational dependencies that means signals that should become noise through the layers of analysis, in fact, become significant distracting “interruptions” at the board. Whilst in the old system, noise and signals were hidden by the informal lobby that prevented more thoughtful long term decision making based on data, today they (signals and noise) create paralysis at all levels in structures as everyone knows everything.</p><p>Should the head of a religious movement be leading planning for the next 100 years or focussing on if the budget is spent according to the plan this quarter?&nbsp; Should our political leaders face the daily news headlines and respond or ensure we are equipped to face a global pandemic? &nbsp; Should the head of state be allowed to focus on sustainability, climate and global concerns or defending their grandchildren’s choices? What makes noise and news dominate interruptions.&nbsp; In a joined power and decision hierarchy structure a long time ago, a few individuals could make those decisions and choices, and lobby worked.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works. Indeed lobby has also failed as it has become increasingly linked to short term reward and incentives.</p><p>The figure below captures this concept on a two-axis chart of scale and impact.&nbsp; The bottom right being an idea, it has no scale and little impact.&nbsp; The top right is big government, global businesses, global NGO’s and charities, global religion and large scale movements. &nbsp; On the journey from the idea to scale, we either transition from our ability to make long term decisions to focus on a quarter by quarter reporting justifying the delta between actual and plan *or* hold onto inter-generational consequences. Risk, funding, capital and markets have a significant impact on the loss of that long term thinking, as the rewards for the players become aligned to short term incentives. Whilst the long term hierarchies become corrupted, the shadow hierarchy of lobby gives way to a different incentive and power game.&nbsp; Impact and scale create the same problems irrespective of the organisation; short-termism can be recognised and rewarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Joseph, as in the Bible story and multicoloured dream coat fame aka the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. It is one of the earlier written examples of man’s capability for longer-term planning.&nbsp; It was a 14-year cycle, so not long term; however, 7 years of abundance followed by 7 of famine. Grow, harvest, store and distribute later. 4,000 years on and a 14-year strategic planning cycle looks massive but still short compared to the famed 100 years plus China and Japanese plans. I may have rose-tinted glasses that we were once better at long-range forecasting, but this is a good piece from three world-leading experts “<a href="https://theconversation.com/is-humanity-doomed-because-we-cant-plan-for-the-long-term-three-experts-discuss-137943">is humanity, in fact, unable to successfully plan for the long-term future?</a>” &nbsp; In the context of our currently limiting systems - yes.&nbsp; We have to break the system. I smell revolution.</p> Complexity of relationships <p>No doubt, a small part of the issue with our inability to long-range plan is the management of the complexity in relationships.&nbsp; The web of collaborative relationships that we need to consider only ever gets more strained, detailed, involved, dependant, and unbalanced, as each party align to their incentives and rewards.&nbsp; Critically, the unbalanced nature of the relationship means it is increasingly difficult to predict outcomes and reactions. (search:&nbsp; emergent complex systems). Our commercial framing is explored in the figure below.</p><p></p><p>The shareholder has a dependency on the board to make a decision that supports their funding of the capital. In contrast, the directors are accountable and responsible for their decisions, including unlimited liability. Everyone now has a voice that can affect choices and actions.&nbsp; The Director/ regulator/ ecosystem axis is dominated by who has the accountability and responsibilities, which are different for each stakeholder in an ecosystem and are often driving in different directions because of Balanced ScoreCards (BSC), KPI’s, incentives and being in the club.&nbsp; OKR (objective and key results) are no better, and the difference between built vs operate is a false one for the long term.&nbsp; Building the wrong thing can be rewarded very well in OKR land.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing around the model, there is a remarkably fluid relationship between the executive teams’ and the board, where the board depends on the exec team. Still, the exec team is accountable to the board.&nbsp; (The level of fluid varies by nation and company law.) The relationships between and with the customer are particularly misunderstood, but ultimately the law says the directors are held accountable. Each of the roles in the chain of relationships from shareholders to the executive team required individuals capable of dealing with complex judgement.&nbsp; However, this assumes that the first part of this viewpoint is null.&nbsp; Let’s expand.&nbsp;</p><p>We face three connected issues but not mutually exclusive because they are a team or part of an ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some individuals in positions of influence and power are part of the club or want to be in the club and therefore have incentives to be in the club and stay in the club.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with being in the club incentives.</p>  <p>Some individuals have reached influence and power but cannot grasp the new mental models and skills for complex judgment.&nbsp; Their judgement and actions are aligned with their experience.</p>  <p>Some individuals can understand the complexity and seek to explain and justify decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Taking this thinking and plotting this on skills/ ability vs decision environment.</p><p></p><p>The diagram above shows a decreasing number of skilled individuals who can cope with complexity. This is because the training system is about effectiveness and efficiency and not about determining if you are doing the right thing (efficacy).&nbsp; Many arrive at senior roles and find they have to shift their mindsets; some do, and some don’t, but they both now have decision capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we know that systems that create inequality, insecurity, and unsustainable practices are not easily transformed.&nbsp; Think of our government and economy. We have a system where 95% of the world live meal by meal, day by day, week by week or month by month.&nbsp; An additional 4.99% can survive for 6 to 8 months on the available cash and funds. Less than 0.01% (80 Million) of the world’s population can plan for more than a year.&nbsp; When you have those few in power and lobby, will they ever need to vote for change?&nbsp; Worth following and reading Umair Haque; I love this <a href="https://eand.co/our-societies-are-failing-because-their-economies-are-broken-72bb3d378351">essay</a> “How the Economy is Designed to Keep You Poor and Powerless.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/the-laws-of-1-how-far-before-you-reach-a-revolution-49bbace4049b">The laws of 1% explore outcomes if we change everything by + or - 1% and what it means to human behaviours.</a></p> What do “ghosts in the system” look like?&nbsp; <p>Imagine you are at the fairground, and there is one of the stalls where you get to throw something to win a prize.&nbsp; In the UK, we have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_shy">Coconut Shy</a>. &nbsp; You pay to get three balls or bags, stand behind the line and throw them one at a time at your coconut of choice.&nbsp; Knock a coconut off, and you win it.&nbsp; A simple game of skill (apparently).&nbsp; However, when there is a ghost in the system, it is not so simple. You line up your ball on coconut number one (it is the biggest one) and throw it with all your skill.&nbsp; As the ball approaches, the coconut moves and your ball sails past. You line up ball 2, aiming again at the largest coconut (the biggest prize); this time, you miss, but coconut number 4 wobbles.&nbsp; Your last chance on this budget.&nbsp; Lining up coconut number one for the last time, you hit it, but it does not fall off, but coconut number 6 does, the smallest one. &nbsp; The ghosts win. &nbsp; Your decisions and outcome was coconut number 1; you got number 6.&nbsp; It was not your lack of skill; coconut number 1 is glued on. Different motivations and rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> The ghosts make signals and noise.&nbsp; <p>This viewpoint started from hierarchy, and I want to return to thinking about the two hierarchies, one of decision and one of power and unpack the issues that the abundance of data has created for us.&nbsp; The diagram below sits with the idea that there is a natural order of decision making and power.&nbsp; The movement from the bottom to the peak is a move in the decision time horizon.&nbsp; Overlaid on this model is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity">VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)</a> situations. VUCA came from preparing/ training the solder who would have to face a situation where they had to decide.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy is worth a paragraph to unpack, as the context of VUCA is situational.&nbsp; Front line workers are trained to be reactive. They know how to act based not on scenario but based on the situation (police, army, emergency, fire, medical, call centre, customer-facing representatives).&nbsp; How they react is one of the rules, heuristics and repeated numerous times.&nbsp; As the NIKE brand says - “just do it”, which is what you can do when you have trained to do the same thing for 10,000 hours - you don’t have to think it is a reaction.&nbsp; Above this line is the management who ensure the environment the workers have has the lowest possible risk.&nbsp; Above them is management, who think about “how do we adapt to new situations and threats?” Above them is the strategy layer, which considers “what skills do we need for the next five years, where are the gaps, and how do we access the skills.” &nbsp; For most companies, this takes us to the CEO.&nbsp; However, in public operations, there are two more layers. The transformational one is thinking about the infrastructure for the next twenty years and, finally, the policymakers.&nbsp; The policy leadership should be thinking 50 years hence and considering what policy we will need to form and how. Even at this simple layering, we can see that global leaders from presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state struggle to plan for 5 years yet are tasked with 50.&nbsp; We are not 10 x better; we have created a system 10 times worse.&nbsp;</p><p>What we should be witnessing is that one layers signal is another layers noise.&nbsp; Each layer takes all the signal from below that becomes their noise but detects new signals that they work to.&nbsp; An upward flow - not downward instruction.&nbsp; As the figure below shows, each layer has to apply different skills to find the signals needed to do their role.&nbsp; Interestingly, the lowest layers have the most operations discretion as they are exposed to the highest operational risks.&nbsp; Most diversity is welcome, but not from those who cannot do the same thing every time.&nbsp; Innovation may not be your friend in the depths.&nbsp; The strategy layer has peak decision discretion. Innovation is critical, and so is all diversity is critical. At the pinnacle is policy discretion, where is the least personal risk and whilst diversity is essential but so is adherence to a north star and single vision - so less diversity might help.&nbsp; Diversity is about situational improvement in decision making for better outcomes.&nbsp; Ouch.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not what we are witnessing right now - the above is theoretical rubbish.&nbsp; What we are feeling is summed up in the diagram below.&nbsp; There is are signals from the bottom, creating signals at the top, every layer adding more signals and noise.&nbsp; VUCA has gone from situational layers to the entire organisation, where everyone is reacting to everything.&nbsp; The ghosts of old processes and previous decisions are no longer limited to a layer, but everyone owns everything and has to react and understand. To repeat a previous line.&nbsp; Today our hierarchies,&nbsp; analogous to decision making,&nbsp; have become paralysed, confused and ineffective as the volume of data and signals mixed with noise has risen to a level where our ability to know what is the right thing to do is broken. Currently, we have not transitioned to something that works.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The observation took time, but the question for us all is, do we believe it, and if so, what can we do?&nbsp; Do you believe it should be reflected on within the context of being in the club and how much you have already compromised on?&nbsp; Our Millenials are not in the club and will not compromise, ask them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Our stability has vanished, and our tools have broken. <p>Even to a casual observer, we live in turbulent times, which is seen through an increase in VUCA. The difficultly facing boards who carry responsibility for their decisions cannot be overstated.&nbsp; We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.&nbsp; The diagram below brings out some of the tensions and conflicts being faced as we struggle to determine what we are optimising for.&nbsp; The two-axis are communication (said and unsaid) and status (know and unknown).&nbsp; The unsaid is that which is not written or spoken and assumed, often to avoid more conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have to deal with the ghosts of the past, the voice of the present and the spirits of the future.</p><p>Top right (said and known) This is the day to day operational aspects of the board and senior leadership team. There are two camps (supporter and action owner) at the board with 10 people involved in decision making. The focus is on management, KPI’s BSC and reporting.&nbsp; There are known status with data, and everyone is able and capable of engagement in the topics. We are married to this quadrant as it is easy and pays the remuneration, and we are incentivised to focus on it.&nbsp; This quadrant has traditionally depended on stability, but with VUCA disrupting that and the volume to signal and noise - we have to spend all our time here as that is all we have time for.</p><p></p><p>The bottom right is said and unknown.&nbsp; In this situation, everyone has a view about the unknown resulting in 10 camps (personal opinions and experience) with the 10 people.&nbsp; However, communication tends to be frank and honest. We go to this quadrant every now and again but quickly withdraw to safer grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The known and unsaid, top left.&nbsp; The unsaid here are the assumptions that we all make about everyone else in the room and their viewpoints.&nbsp; This time there is are 100 camps as we all assume about what everyone else thinks about everyone as there is no communication.&nbsp; The principal reasons not to communicate is conflict, dominance and leadership style.&nbsp; We are trapped by the debt we have (mortgage, credit, school fees, lifestyle, divorce) and need the salary; therefore, there is a degree of control.&nbsp; We try to avoid this quadrant but every now and then, we end up there because of other stress, pressures and the need for a diversion or win a political game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom left, the unknown and unsaid.&nbsp; The ecosystem has a voice, the partners of the directors have a voice, everyone has a voice, and many, due to previous flights and allegiances, are in several camps at the same time.&nbsp; The crux is that we are human and bring our differences, but it is very messy because it is unknown and unsaid. But this quadrant represents the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity we are currently facing, and we don’t have the tools to deal with it. We have a preference based on skills, experience and incentives to focus on the top right.&nbsp;</p> Our processes and methods enable only certain decisions <p>One critical aspect of being in a leadership capacity is to question and determine how our processes and methods guide and frame certain decisions, which means we have to unpack legacy and find the ghosts in the system.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:</p>  <p>Previous incentives and power games created decisions that created processes, methods and rules; they are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided. It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear. It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time. It is worth asking questions about legacy when you are new to a company and then verifying them over time as we become blind to the tools that mould us.</p><p>I am focused on this because I want to determine how I can make smarter/ better decisions with data. For that, I need a data decision framework.&nbsp; Therefore I tend to ask what one thing do we as a leadership team want from our data? The response varies but include:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided. A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”&nbsp; This fits into the know/ unsaid in the previous matrix. The top left, the one we avoid opening up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions.&nbsp; Or we can write, “the ghost of previous decisions will guide our current decisions”.&nbsp; Importantly, our data, which we trust, is only the representation of the past, which means our tools fail.</p><p>Therefore, as a leadership team, we have to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? Without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform — this is the technology debt question. The CIO or newly created #CDO role has to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CIO/CDO struggles with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require. The data leadership team inherit and are now accountable for previous ghosts and decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us” is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.</p><p>As we have separate decisions, power and now data, perhaps we should reflect on these questions as a leadership team.</p>  <p>What do we want to become, and what tools and data will help us?</p>  <p>What tools do we use, and what will they enable us to become?</p>  <p>What is the minimum viable data set required to give the best value?</p>  <p>Do our tools and data trap us?</p>  <p>Is the work of data to “detect and measure” or to “enables change and transform?”&nbsp;</p> <br>

Taking lifestyle or experience down by 1% per day gets more challenging and more complex, and you will likely die earlier, but death is not facing you (black line).&nbsp; We all die, but lack of water means it happens now, lack of food means it happens soon, lack of lifestyle means life could have been longer (black line).&nbsp; Leaving purple as the optimal.</p><p></p><p>When reducing water by 1%, you reach a point very quickly where revolution is worth it as there is nothing to lose. &nbsp; When reducing food by 1%, you reach a point slowly where revolution is worth it as there is less to lose.

  <p>This week I learned a whole bunch about using Docker to emulate different architectures, released sqlite-utils 3.7 and made a ton of progress towards the almost-ready-to-ship Datasette 0.57.</p>
 Development environments on the Mac M1 
<p>We added another full-time developer to the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/vaccinateca/">VIAL project</a> this week, which came with a new requirement: we needed our development environment to work on an M1 Mac.</p>
<p>"Can't be that hard", I thought.</p>
<p>After several rounds of attempted fixes, I decided I needed an M1 for myself. I ended up hiring an M1 Mac Mini <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">from MacStadium</a>, and dove into the horror show that is getting a relatively straight-forward Django app with a small but crucial number of C dependencies (most notably <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1200">psycopg2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5742">cryptography</a>) running in a Docker container on an M1 machine.</p>
<p>Having almost beaten all of the dependencies into shape, I hit a <code>free(): invalid pointer</code> error. With no idea how to even start debugging that, I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/running-docker-on-remote-m1">wrote up what I had learned so far</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1397334821785935877">declared defeat on Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the possibly-good news is that you can emulate aarch64-linux on other platforms Docker runs on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... <a href="https://twitter.com/nevali/status/1397337272580775939">said Mo McRoberts</a>. And it turns out you can!</p>
<p>The short version: I'm using Docker Compose, and it turned out all I had to do was add <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> to my <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and Docker built and ran my container under that architecture, using <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> as an emulation layer. And just like that, everything on the M1 started working!</p>
<p>Performance isn't brilliant, but it works. In the longer run it would be great to get the whole environment running on the native architecture for the M1, but it's great to have found an escape hatch.</p>
 More QEMU: testing Datasette on different architectures 
<p>Blair Drummond <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1319">contributed a patch for Datasette</a> that enables building the official Datasette Docker container across multiple architectures, using the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-setup-buildx">Docker buildx mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>It successfully builds and publishes images, which is cool... but what's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1344">a good way to test them</a>?</p>
<p>Again, the <code>--platform</code> option to Docker holds the key. Here's a one-liner that runs the Datasette image built for <code>linux/s390x</code> on my laptop, via an emulation layer:</p>
 <code>% docker run --platform linux/s390x \
  -v `pwd`:/mnt -p 8001:8001 \
  datasetteproject/datasette:0.57a1 datasette -p 8001 -h 0.0.0.0
</code> 
<p>And here's a recipe that confirms the platform by outputting the result of Python's <code>platform.uname()</code> function:</p>
 <code>% docker run -it --platform linux/s390x -v `pwd`:/mnt \
  -p 8001:8001 datasetteproject/datasette:0.57a1 \
  python -c 'import platform; print(platform.uname())'

uname_result(
  system='Linux',
  node='d14916ca91df',
  release='4.19.121-linuxkit',
  version='#1 SMP Thu Jan 21 15:36:34 UTC 2021',
  machine='s390x'
)
</code> 
<p>Ideally I'd like to run the full Datasette test suite inside the container. That requires some extra dependencies, plus mounting the Datasette root folder (complete with tests) inside the container. Here's a hacky way to do that:</p>
 <code>docker run -it -v `pwd`:/mnt --platform linux/amd64 \
  datasetteproject/datasette:0.57a1 bash -c '
    pip install "pytest&gt;=5.2.2,&lt;6.3.0" \
      "pytest-xdist&gt;=2.2.1,&lt;2.3" \
      "pytest-asyncio&gt;=0.10,&lt;0.16" \
      "beautifulsoup4&gt;=4.8.1,&lt;4.10.0" \
      "black==21.5b1" \
      "pytest-timeout&gt;=1.4.2,&lt;1.5" \
      "trustme&gt;=0.7,&lt;0.8" \
    &amp;&amp; cd /mnt &amp;&amp; pytest'
</code> 
<p>Before I release 0.57 I want to use this trick to make sure I'm only building official Docker containers for platforms on which the test suite passes.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.7 
<p>This was an absolutely classic case of <a href="https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">yak shaving</a>. I noticed that exporting CSV data from <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties">covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties</a> - now with 1,378,190 rows - was running really slowly.</p>
<p>That page is sorted by date, descending - and Datasette large exports work using keyset pagination, which means they execute 1,300 SQL queries (1000 rows per query) ordered by date, descending with a filter and a limit.</p>
<p>There was an index on <code>date</code> but it was in ascending order. SQLite also supports descending order indexes, and a micro-benchmark suggested that this could speed things up - each query could take 10ms instead of ~200ms.</p>
<p>So I needed to teach <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> to create <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-create-index">descending order indexes</a>. And then since I had a bunch of functionality accumulated since version 3.6 back in February, I cleaned those up, fixed <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/250">an additional bug</a> and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-7">shipped a 3.7 release</a>.</p>
<p>Then when I applied the fix to my <code>covid-19</code> project it made almost no difference to the performance at all! It turned out I had been shaving entirely the wrong yak.</p>
<p>The real problem was that each page of results was unneccessarily calculating facets, suggested facets and a full table count - potentially a thousand times when returning a million streaming rows. Which leads me to...</p>
 Progress towards Datasette 0.57 
<p>This was the yak I needed to shave all along. Some highlights from the past 8 days:</p>
 
 I landed <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/615">?col= and ?_nocol=</a> - you can now select exactly which columns you would like to see on the table page (and in the CSV and JSON exports). 
 A new <code>?_facet_size=max</code> option (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1337">#1337</a>), which is now linked to from the … shown at the bottom of a truncated list of facet results. This is particularly useful for things like lists of states - 50 gets truncated to 30, but the new link lets you see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/fivethirtyeight/antiquities-act%2Factions_under_antiquities_act?_facet=states&amp;_facet=current_agency&amp;_facet=pres_or_congress&amp;_facet_size=max">all 50 in one place</a>. 
 You can now opt-out of both facets and table counts with the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1350">?_nofacet=1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1353">?_nocount=1</a> options - both of which are used to greatly speed up large CSV exports. 
 And a fix for an issue <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/619">first opened in November 2019</a> - if your SQL query throws an error, Datasette now shows you the error in context with the SQL query so you can edit it without having to hit "back" to recover it! This may seem like a small thing but it was a surprisingly fiddly fix - I'm so glad to finally have it done though. 
 
<p>I hope to release 0.57 final later this week. In the meantime some of the above is available in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.57a1">0.57a1 alpha</a>.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Interaction patterns in SSI differ from what we see in a traditional IAM system that is performing authentication and authorization. This post discussed three different authentication and authorization patterns and then shows how they are all specializations of the general verifiable credential exchange pattern.</p>

<p>
    Last year, I wrote about how <a>digital relationships are operationalized</a> in response to a <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">post from Doc Searls about SSI wallets</a>. The wallet (and the agent it is paired with) is a key player in SSI workflows. A recent exchange with the good folks at <a href="https://techvisionresearch.com/">TechVision Research</a> made me realize that I hadn't ever written about the patterns that an SSI wallet uses to realize operational digital relationships. Today I'm going to take a stab at three simple authentication and authorization patterns in SSI to show the interactions necessary to accomplish these foundational workflows. Finally, I'll show how all three are just specializations of the standard verifiable credential exchange pattern.
</p>

<a></a>
 DID Authentication Pattern 

<p>
    The simplest authentication pattern uses <a>decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as autonomic identifiers</a> to establish a peer relationship. Because of their mutual authentication capabilities, DID relationships can be used for authentication.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Simple DID Authn Interaction Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This pattern has two parties:
</p>
 
     Alice has an SSI wallet on her mobile phone. 
     Bravo Corp has an enterprise wallet tied to an IAM system that is protecting some resource. 
 

<p>
    The interaction pattern has the following steps:
</p>
 
     Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). This means that they each generate a Peer DID and send it to the other, along with the associated public key. These <a>identifiers are self-certifying</a> and each party can use the information associated with the DID to authenticate the other. 
     Alice tries to access the protected resource (red arrow). The request is intermediated by Bravo's IAM system. As part of this request, Alice makes her DID known. There are a number of sub-scenarios for the different ways this may happen. For example, she could scan a QR code or enter an associated human-readable identifier. 
     The IAM system, working in concert with Bravo's enterprise wallet, issues a <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introduction-did-auth-markus-sabadello-webinar-10/">DID Auth challenge</a> to Alice's wallet through her phone. 
     Alice is notified by her wallet of the challenge and approves the response from her wallet to Bravo. 
     Bravo verifies Alice's response. 
 

<p>
    A few things to note about this interaction:
</p>
 
     Because Alice and Bravo are using Peer DIDs, no ledger is involved in the authentication. In a Peer DID relationship, both parties keep the other informed of relevant key events (e.g. key rotation) and store that information in a cryptographic key event log. 
     Any authorization would have to be done based on information the IAM system has from another source. For example, if the Peer DID relationship were established within a different authenticated context, Alice could have been assigned a group for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">RBAC</a> or other attributes could have been associated with Alice's DID within Bravo's IAM system. 
     The interaction pattern shown here is leaves out a number of details. Markus Sabadello identifies ten different variations of this pattern in his talk <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introduction-did-auth-markus-sabadello-webinar-10/">Introduction to DID Auth for SSI</a>. 
 

<a></a>
 Single-Party Credential Authorization Pattern 

<p>
    While the DID Authn pattern is simple, it is not as flexible as we need in some situations. For more complicated scenarios, we can use verifiable credentials. The first scenario we'll consider is where the same organization is issuing and verifying the credential.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Single-Party Credential-Based Authn Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The parties in this scenario are the same: Alice and Bravo Corp.
</p>

<p>
    The interaction pattern proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
 Since Bravo Corp will be issuing a credential, they write a Public DID and credential definition to the ledger. They might also write a schema and revocation registry, if necessary. 
 Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). Note that the DID that Bravo uses for this relationship is not the public DID created in (1), instead Bravo creates a Peer DID especially for the relationship with Alice. 
 Bravo issues a credential to Alice (green arrow). The nature, content, and context of this credential issuance depend on Bravo and Alice's specific needs. Bravo is the credential issuer and Alice is the credential holder. 
 Alice tries to access a protected resource (red arrow). The request is intermediated by Bravo's IAM system. Like the DID Authn pattern, the IAM system is working in concert with an enterprise wallet. 
 Bravo is using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control">policy-based access control</a> (PBAC) system that relies on knowing attributes about Alice. The IAM system makes a credential request to Alice that asks for specific attributes based on the attributes needed by the policy for the resource Alice is accessing. 
 Alice sees the request and authorizes her wallet to issue a proof of attributes based on the credential she holds. The response contains only the attributes that Bravo needs, not the entire credential to minimize the information that is shared. 
 The PBAC system uses the attributes in the proof presentation to authorize Alice's access. 
 

<p>
    A few things to note:
</p>
 
 Bravo does not need to access the ledger to verify the credential since they already know the information necessary to perform the validation since it's their credential. Even so, Bravo writes the public DID and credential definition to the ledger so that Alice can present the credential to others who can verify it, supporting use cases beyond Bravo's. 
 Using a credential held by Alice to validate her authority to access the protected resource is more flexible for Bravo, and potentially more reliable, than a centralized attribute store. Rather than building a central attribute store and linking every system in the enterprise to it, each system can stand alone from the central store and make decisions based on the policies in place for that system. 
     Astute readers will read the last bullet and think "but don't they all have to be linked to the same digital wallet to take advantage of the Peer DID relationship?" The answer is "no." Each service can have its own Peer DID relationship with Alice, verify the attributes from the credential, and know it's Alice. The only thing they need to know is the public DID their organization uses and the credential definition for the credential. 
 

<a></a>
 Multi-Party Credential Authorization Pattern  

<p>
    We can extend the single-party pattern, to include multiple parties. In this pattern, one entity, Bravo Corp, is issuing credentials, but another entity, Certiphi Corp, is verifying the credential and using its attributes to authorize Alice's access to a resource.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Multi-Party Credential-Based Authn Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The interaction proceeds as follows:
</p>
 
 Since Bravo Corp is issuing a credential, they write a Public DID and credential definition to the ledger. Again, they might also write a schema and revocation registry, if needed. 
 Alice and Bravo establish a Peer DID relationship (blue arrow). 
 Bravo issues a credential to Alice (green arrow). 
 Alice and Certiphi establish a Peer DID relationship. 
 Alice tries to access the protected resource (red arrow) at Certiphi. The request is intermediated by Certiphi's IAM system. 
 Certiphi is using a policy-based access control system so, the IAM system makes a credential request to Alice that asks for the specific attributes needed by the policy for access to the resource. 
 Alice sees the request and authorizes her wallet to issue a proof of attributes based on the credentials she holds. The wallet automatically chooses the credential from Bravo since it has the attributes needed to satisfy Certiphi's request. 
 Certiphi cryptographically validates the <a>fidelity</a> of the proof to ensure it's from Bravo, is about Alice, hasn't been tampered with, and hasn't been revoked. They might also need to validate the <a>provenance of the attributes</a> in the proof. Certiphi is the credential verifier in this pattern. 
 The PBAC system uses the attributes in the proof presentation to authorize Alice's access. 
 

<p>A few things to note:
</p>
 
 The DID relationship Alice and Certiphi create in (4) could be ephemeral, it needn't be permanent unless the parties need it to be. 
 There is no direct connection or link between Bravo Corp and Certiphi Corp. They needn't have any pre-existing business or technical relationship. Certiphi needn't connect to a Bravo Corp API. 
 The primary difference between the single-party and multi-party patterns is step (8), checking the fidelity and provenance of the credential. The fidelity can be done automatically using cryptography. Determining provenance is not a trivial thing since it involves Certiphi determining they can trust attributes attested by Bravo. This is a governance issue, not a technical one. 
     The governance issue could be simple or complex. Perhaps Bravo is known to Certiphi (e.g., a local business next to a large university). Certiphi might ask Bravo to prove things about itself using credentials issued to Bravo by someone Certiphi already trusts (e.g., the government). Bravo and Certiphi might already be part of some established governance framework (e.g., a university accreditation organization). 
 

<a></a>
 Generalized Trustworthy Data Transfer Pattern 

<p>
    Authentication and authorization are table stakes for any identity interaction. The general data transfer pattern moves beyond simple authentication and authorization patterns to using identity data in workflows.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Credential-Based Data Transfer Pattern (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this pattern, all of the interactions are identical to the pattern for multi-party authorization in the last section with a few exceptions:
</p>
 
     Alice is accessing a web service that needs data to proceed in (5) rather than a protected resource. 
     The web service uses the data from the proof presentment as part of its workflow (e.g. fill out a form). 
 

<p>
    We can view all of the previous patterns as specializations of this pattern:
</p>
 
     The Peer DID relationship provides a mutually authenticated communications channel in every case that can always be used to know that you're talking to the entity with whom the relationship was originally established–the core requirement for any authentication. 
     Transferring attributes using verifiable credentials for PBAC is just a special case of transferring attribute data in a trustworthy manner. The difference is the end-use of the attributes: the PBAC system or some other service. 
     There's no need for the data transferred in the general pattern to come from a single credential. In fact, the service can ask for attributes without knowing what credentials Alice holds. Alice's wallet will match the requested attributes to the credentials Alice holds. Alice can choose which credentials to use for specific attributes (e.g. date of birth) if she wants. 
     While the figure shows Alice accessing a web service, this can be further <a>generalized beyond the web</a>. Any data transfer for an online workflow can happen using verifiable credentials. 
     While this pattern involves Alice and two organizations, there's <a>no reason why people can't be credential issuers and verifiers</a>. Indeed, any party in these diagrams could play any of the roles. 
 

<p>
    Viewing traditional IAM functions like authentication and authorization as special purpose data transfers broadens SSI significantly beyond what we have traditionally seen as "digital identity." The <a>uses for verifiable credentials are vast</a> and include many things we may not think of as "credentials". While this expanded view of digital identity may make some uncomfortable, I think it is perfectly aligned with my belief that <a>we build identity systems to manage relationships, not identities</a>. Every relationship is unique. Flexible, trustworthy digital credentials serve that uniqueness and introduce the means of moving digital identity beyond just authentication and authorization.

<p>I used a Lisp variant in my first programming job, so I have some appreciation for the “code as data” power of that language. Nowadays I’m building an analytics system that combines Postgres and two of its procedural languages, pl/pgsql and pl/python, with a sense-making tool called <a href="https://metabase.com">Metabase</a> that’s written in a Lisp variant called <a href="https://clojure.org">Clojure</a>.</p>
<p>In Postgres I’m able to wrap SQL queries in functions; they compose with other functions that do things like cache results in materialized views and aggregate subgroups. It all feels very dynamic and functional, which are two of Clojure’s main calling cards, so this makes me wonder about Clojure as another Postgres procedural language.</p>
<p>For the pl/python functions in my system, “code as data” looks like building SQL statements that swap variables into SQL templates and combine them. This string-building approach is an anti-pattern for Clojure folk. They don’t want to work with fragments of SQL text, they want to work with Clojure maps. Here’s an example from <a href="https://github.com/musab/honeysql">Honey SQL</a>, the library that Metabase uses to build SQL texts from structured data.</p>
<p><code>(def sqlmap {:select [:a :b :c]<br>
:from   [:foo]<br>
:where  [:= :f.a "baz"]})<br>
</code></p>
<p>This seems like an important power to be able to wield in the hybrid programming environment that Postgres provides. I can imagine making very good use of it.</p>
<p>But I know very little yet about Clojure. Is this really an idea worth exploring? How else would it differ from what I’m now able to do in Python? To learn more about Clojure I’ve been watching talks by its creator, Rich Hickey. Most are tech-heavy but one of them isn’t like the others. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock-driven development</a> he lays out a process for creative problem solving that coordinates the waking mind (at the computer doing critical thinking and analysis) with the background mind (on the hammock doing abstraction, analogy, and synthesis). The coordination is explicit: You use the waking mind to feed work to the background mind which is “the solver of most non-trivial problems”; you weight your inputs to the background mind in order to influence their priority in its thinking.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve done that kind of thing implicitly from time to time, but never in such an intentional way. So, is Clojure-in-Postgres worth exploring? Perhaps by writing this I’ll prime my background mind and will receive more clarity in the morning.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/">Peak Paradox</a> is a framework to help you reclaim clarity and control as we believe that if you cannot see the paradox, you have been framed and are in a model where someone else is in control.&nbsp; When you can see the paradox in the data, information, recommendation or decision, you will have improved your clarity.&nbsp; This is a guide <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/explaining-the-model">on how to apply the framework to unlock business models, concepts and complexity</a>.</p><p>Most aspects of everyday business and life can be questioned within the boundaries of the Peak Paradox Framework.&nbsp; I have been exploring that we tend to go out of bounds for a while but find it is too hard to stay there for long. Movement outside of the boundary tends to be a transitional state.&nbsp; The thick red line illustrates the usual boundaries in the figure below.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/plotting-how-to-make-better-decisions">This post explored how to make better decisions using the framework</a> and laid down the idea that some decisions can occur off-piste, outside of the normal boundaries. It presented the reason why we need to minimise shared decision making, find followers and create shared passion if we want to make a difference.&nbsp; Indeed it is no longer about enemies in the camp but about identifying those who share the belief. We must have diversity and not about diversification away from the shared belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I explored the concept that we are <a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">transitioning from Physical beings to Information beings</a>.&nbsp; The article proposed that our existing models for oversight and governance are breaking and that we need to think about addressing this emerging gap.&nbsp; In an earlier post, I explained that many <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/hello-world">models take us to the boundaries</a> in the Peak Paradox framework, such as cults, politics, beliefs and religion.&nbsp; This post presents the thinking that the economic model of monopoly and political activity of war are outside the framework and a transitional state.&nbsp;</p> As physical beings&nbsp; <p>In the figure below, war and monopoly are outside the boundary between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; War is nasty, inhumane, and complex, but it serves as a tool to acquire more land with a historical lens. Control of land gave you access to resources, people and materials.&nbsp; The more land and more resources you had access to, in straightforward terms, enabled a few to realise their Peak Individual Purpose (become more sovereign) and for others to realise Peak Work Purpose through growth.&nbsp;</p><p>A more modern version of war is the economics of monopoly, duopoly, or cartel, where a few seek to control resources for their personal gain, enabling them to achieve Peak Individual Purpose through their companies having control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Both war and monopoly have become increasingly regulated over time. We have created, as humans, complex rules of engagement, governance and oversight.&nbsp; In part to ensure control and power does not fall to one person in a democracy, to protect the vulnerable and to respect life.&nbsp; If they work or not is another story.&nbsp;</p><p></p> As information beings <p>It is not that physical has or will vanish; we will co-exist as both physical and informational. Our physical being is still very much here, but we live in an emergent digital/ data augmented world.&nbsp; War has become cyberwarfare and monopoly of land, and people have become the monopoly of data that indirectly controls people and land, often through an instrument such as debt.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The question being asked is, “have we changed more than just the nature of war and monopoly as we expand from physical beings to information beings?”&nbsp; Our rules, methods, insights and policy work for us as physical beings, but do the same systems and structures work in an information age.&nbsp; Is the paradox that we have to deal with the same outcomes from war and monopolies (control and power), but there is a shift.&nbsp; What is this shift? &nbsp; Yes, some cybercrime and cyber warfare is a replication of the historical war framing, insomuch that an individual, cause or nation wants to use data/ digital as a method of control.&nbsp; But this is just the natural advancement of physical beings adapting to new technology. Gunpowder is another example.&nbsp; However, information being cyberwar is a fight or rage against the machine trying to bring about a better life for everyone and expose injustice - this is different. Past freedom fighters against oppression look similar.&nbsp; A monopoly of data is different to a monopoly of physical resources because <a href="https://opengovernance.net/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">data is data</a>.&nbsp; Data is, by its nature, non-rivalrous and non-excludable. This simple fact is that you cannot declare ownership of data (though many people try); you cannot control it; you lose nothing when you copy it. It is why data is data. &nbsp; Data can bring about better health care; data can bring about better education; data can bring transparency, and data can bring equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://opengovernance.net/what-occurs-when-physical-beings-transition-to-information-beings-146ea9dcbca3">An AI can make better decisions,</a> if we knew what this is, without the bias of human politics. However, it is far too easy to keep our physical being lens on everything as we like it, we are used to it, our systems are aligned to it, and we can ignore or rubbish the emergence and augmentation of data in our decision methodology.&nbsp; A critical point beginning that what we had as oversight and controls for war and monopoly worked for physical beings. The same systems break as informational beings because there is a shift in purpose and even outcomes. What is hard to comprehend is that this is not a transition; it is the emergence of information beings and that both will co-exist. We need to keep adapting our physical rules but need new thinking for informational beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What does the Peak Paradox framework highlight about this situation? There is an assumption that we are aligned (what type of being are we or both) and how we understand if there is alignment in the team.&nbsp; Because this is hard and subtle, we prefer to assume and make jumps because curiosity and questioning expose ghosts in our thinking and the system;&nbsp; like conflict, tension and power. We don't like facing up to these as they are hard and reflective. The Peak Paradox framework will surface the ghosts and determine if there is an alignment or a delta in the team, project, mission or purpose.&nbsp; If we are only physical beings in our views, we will ignore digital and data and the coming information being. &nbsp; If we are information beings, we see that the controls don’t work, and we are free to exploit an emergent space.&nbsp; The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.</p><p>The current data monopoly holders don’t look like monopolies through the lens of physical beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>War and monopoly exist in both the physical and data/ digital/ information world. Still, we cannot apply the same system of the physical world controls developed over generations to the digital/ data/ information world - it is not they break it is they don’t work. &nbsp; The system of control fails because the purpose for which war and monopoly exist is the same and has created a new space.&nbsp; We use the exact same words, but the meaning has changed.&nbsp; Why is monopoly different in a data/ digital information world? Because it looks competitive, data is movable, and users have a choice.&nbsp; Why is war in a data/ digital information world different - because the outcome is not about control.&nbsp; However, the physical still exists, which can confuse and create paradoxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>On the top left is a photo taken with my trusty old (also much used and abused) <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-5d-mark-iii">Canon 5D Mark III</a>. On the top right is one taken by a borrowed new <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/slrs/sony_a7riii">Sony a7Riii</a>. Below both are cropped close-ups of detail. The scene is in a room illuminated by incandescent track lighting. It is not an art shot, though it does contain photo art by our good friend <a href="https://mariancrostic.com/">Marian Crostic</a>, whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a7r">Sony a7R</a>&nbsp;she is kindly remanding to my custody tomorrow. (Her main camera is now an a7Riii like the borrowed one I used here.)</p>
<p>Both photos were shot with Canon and Sony’s best 24-105 f4 zoom lenses, at the 105mm end. Both were also set to automatic, meaning the camera chooses all the settings. In both cases the camera chose ISO 3200 at f4. The only difference was shutter speed: 1/125 sec on the Canon and 1/160 sec on the Sony. While 3200 is not the prettiest ISO, I wanted to compare both cameras indoors under less than ideal lighting, because that’s typical of situations where I shoot a lot of people.</p>
<p>One difference between these cameras is the pixel density of the sensor: the Canon’s shot is 5760 x 3840 pixels, while the Sony’s is 7952 x 5304. While that difference accounts for some of the higher detail in the Sony’s shot, it’s clear to me that the Sony lens is simply sharper, as <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/">Ken Rockwell</a>&nbsp;kinda promised in <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">this glowing review</a>. (Also, to be fair, the Canon lens has had a&nbsp;lot of use.)</p>
<p>All the images above are screen shots of RAW versions of the photos (.CR2 for the Canon and .ARW for the Sony). Though I don’t have the time or patience to show differences in the .JPG versions of these photos, it’s clear to me that the Canon’s JPGs look less artifacted by compression. The obvious artifacts in the Sony shots have me thinking I may only shoot RAW with the a7R, though I’ll need to test it out first.</p>
<p>The main difference overall, at least in this setting, is in the warmth of the color. There the Canon has a huge advantage. I could say it’s also because the Sony is slightly less exposed (by the higher shutter speed); but I noticed the same difference in test shots I took outdoors as well, under both overcast and sunlit skies, and at ISO 100. The Canon seems warmer, though the Sony has far more detail one can pull out of shadows.</p>
<p>I should add that neither camera got the color of the wall (a creamy white) right in these photos, with the Canon leaning hot and the Sony leaning cool.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just thought I’d share that much before I pick up the a7R, and start using it to shoot stuff in New York, where I’m headed Wednesday night after more than a year away.</p>

<p>This article shows how Zero Knowledge Proofs ZKP verifiable credentials can be used to verify a persons vaccination data implemented in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a>. The ZKP BBS+ verifiable credentials are issued and stored on a digital wallet using a Self-Issued Identity Provider (SIOP) and Open ID Connect. The data can then be used to verify if the holder has the required credentials, but only the required data is used and returned to the verification application. The holder of the data who owns the wallet can consent or not consent to allow the verification application to see and use the vaccination data. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used to implement the identity provider.</p>

<p>What are Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials </p>



<p>Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials allows you to selectively disclose claims from a verifiable credential without disclosing all of the information of the verifiable credential. It also makes it possible to verify data without having to share the sensitive data required to verify something. In this post, we will just selectively request part of the data from a verifiable credential. This would make it possible to implement business flows without having to share or copy the sensitive data.</p>



<p>Setup ZKP Vaccination Data Issue and Verify</p>



<p>The demo application implements a covid vaccination data process. A number of components, applications are required to implement these flows. The idea is that when a person is vaccinated, the authority responsible for this could add the vaccination data to the persons identity. In this demo, that would be added to the Auth0 service which can be accessed in the id_token claims. The vaccination data organization can use the credentials issuer application to create a DID credential issuer using ZKP verifiable credentials. The end user can use a digital wallet to add his or his credentials using the SIOP flow which gets the claims from the IDP and adds the data to the digital wallet.  The verification application would have to create a presentation template defining the claims which are required to use to verify. Once created, a new verification request can be created and used to verify the vaccination data from the user. The user would scan the presented QR Code from the verifier application and display a verify in the digital wallet. Once consented, the data is returned to the verifier application using an API. The data can be processed and the UI is updated with a verified result or not. The blockchain ledger is abstracted away and used indirectly through MATTR which has APIs for the Self sovereign identity specifications. </p>







<p>Issuing Zero Knowledge Proof enabled credentials</p>



<p>The VaccineCredentialsIssuer ASP.NET Core application is used to create the credential issuer and present this as a QR Code for the user to add vaccination Zero Knowledge Proofs verifiable credentials. The flow implemented is very similar to the flow used in the previous blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/03/create-an-oidc-credential-issuer-with-mattr-and-asp-net-core/">Create an OIDC credential Issuer with MATTR and ASP.NET Core</a> . A DID is created to use a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials. </p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
	/// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
	/// 
	/// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
	/// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public string keyType { get; set; } = "bls12381g2";
}
  


<p>The DID is used to create a credential issuer for the ZKP credentials. The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer method takes the DID created with the bls12381g2 key and creates the OIDC credential issuer.</p>

        }
  


<p>The data is displayed as a QR Code in a ASP.NET Core Razor page application. This can be scanned and the credentials will be added to your digital wallet, if the Open ID Connect server has the claims for the identity required by this issuer.</p>







<p>Auth0 is used to add the identity data for the claims. An Auth0 pipeline rule was created and used to add these claims to the id_tokens.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://damianbod-sandbox.vii.mattr.global/';

    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
  
    context.idToken[namespace + 'family_name'] = user.user_metadata.family_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'given_name'] = user.user_metadata.given_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'medicinal_product_code'] = user.user_metadata.medicinal_product_code;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'total_number_of_doses'] = user.user_metadata.total_number_of_doses;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'vaccination_date'] = user.user_metadata.vaccination_date;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'country_of_vaccination'] = user.user_metadata.country_of_vaccination;
  
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>The data needs to be added to each user in Auth0. If using this in a real application, a UI could be created and used to add the specific data for each user. The credential issuer is tightly coupled through the data with the IDP. So each credential issuer which creates verifiable credentials would require it’s own identity provider and full access to update the profiles. The IDP contains the business data required to issuer the credentials. Auth0 might not be a good choice for this, maybe something like IdentityServer or Openiddict would be a better choice because you could implement custom UIs with ASP.NET Core Identity and the complete UIs for the credential issuing flows.</p>



<p>When the credential issuer is scanned by the digital wallet, the user logs into the OIDC server and gets the data for the ZKP verifiable credentials. In a MATTR wallet, this is displayed with the Privacy enhancing credential information.</p>







<p>Verifying the credentials</p>



<p>Before the ZKP credentials can be verified, a presentation template is created to define the required credentials to verify. The DID ID from the credential issuer is used to find the DID in the ledger. The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method creates the template using the QueryByFrame so that the exact claims can be defined. The context must use the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/context/v1</a> namespace to use the ZKP BBS+ credentials in MATTR. The type must be VerifiableCredential.</p>

		}

		var error = await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The VaccanationDataCredentialSubject class defines the specific claims to use for the verification.</p>


  public class VaccanationDataCredentialSubject
{
	[Newtonsoft.Json.JsonProperty("@explicit", Required = Newtonsoft.Json.Required.Always)]
	public bool Explicit { get; set; }

}
  


<p>Verifying is very similar to the blog <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/05/10/present-and-verify-verifiable-credentials-in-asp-net-core-using-decentralized-identities-and-mattr/">Present and Verify Verifiable Credentials in ASP.NET Core using Decentralized Identities and MATTR</a>. A new DID of type ed25519 is used to invoke a verify request and also sign the request. The verifying flow in the application presents a QR Code using the redirectURL technic because the signed request is too long to present as a QR Code. This request returns a 302 with the full jws. </p>







<p>The application needs to be started using a public domain because the digital wallet will request back to the API with the data. I use ngrok to test locally. The verifier application can be started and the verify process is started by clicking the verify button which displays the QR Code to verify. </p>



<p>Start the application and start ngrok </p>


  ngrok http http://localhost:5000
  


<p>The QR Code can be scanned to verify.</p>







<p>In the digital wallet, the verification request for the vaccination data can be viewed and if ok sent. The digital wallet displays the data which is disclosed and the data which is not. When the user clicks send, the data is validated and the API from the verifier application is called.</p>







<p>When the Verify application receives the callback from the digital wallet, the data is validated and the challenge ID is used to notify the user of a successful verification. The data is saved to a database and ASP.NET Core SignalR is used to update the UI. When the message from SignalR is sent, the user is redirected to the success page using the challenge ID and the data is displayed with the success image.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>Now we have a full create, holder, verify process implemented for Zero Knowledge Proof verifiable credentials using covid vaccination data. OIDC is used to authenticate and create the claims used for the credentials. The OIDC connect server or identity provider is tightly coupled to the credential issuer because business uses the data from the id_token. When using SIOP, I would use ASP.NET Core Identity and either OpenIddict of Identityserver4 to implement this as part of the credential issuer. You need full control of the claims so using Auth0, Azure AD or Azure B2C would probably be a bad choice here. You could federate then to one of these from the credential issuer to use the profiles as required. Each vaccinated user would also require a user account. ZKP verifiable credentials makes it possible to support user privacy better and mix claims easier from different credentials. Another problem with this solution is the vendor lockdown. This is a problem with any self sovereign solution at the moment. Even though, the specifications are all standard, unless you want to implement this completely yourself, you would choose a vendor specific implementation which locks you down to a specific wallet or with specific features only. Interop does not seem to work at the moment. This is a problem with all security solutions at present not just SSI, all software producers, security services use security reasoning as an excuse to try to force you into lockdown into their specific product. You can see this with most of the existing OIDC solutions and services. Typical quotes for this are “You can use any OIDC client, but we recommend our OIDC client…” SSI will open possibilities for new security solutions and it will be very interesting to see how application security develops in the next five years. </p>

<p>My post yesterday saw action on <a href="https://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> (as I write this, it’s at #2) and on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1398765786714361859">from Don Marti</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/acfou/status/1399029656444092419">Augustine Fou</a>, et. al.), and in thoughtful blog posts by John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/30/searls-apple-att">in Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/">Nick Heer</a> <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/searls-apple-privacy/">in Pixel Envy</a>. All pushed back on at least some of what I said. Here are some excerpts, with my responses. First, John:</p>
<blockquote><p>Doc Searls:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s what’s misleading about this message:&nbsp;Felix would have had none of those trackers following him if he had gone into Settings → Privacy → Tracking, and pushed the switch to off&nbsp;[…].</p>
<p>Key fact:&nbsp;it is defaulted to on. Meaning Apple is not fully serious about privacy. If Apple was fully serious, your iPhone would be set to not allow tracking in the first place. All those trackers would come pre-vaporized.</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the criticism Apple has faced from the ad tech industry over this feature, it’s fun to see criticism that Apple isn’t going far enough. But I don’t think Searls’s critique here is fair. Permission to allow tracking is&nbsp;not&nbsp;on by default — what is on by default is permission for the app to&nbsp;ask. Searls makes that clear, I know, but it feels like he’s arguing as though apps can track you by default, and they can’t.</p>
<p>But I don’t think Searls’s critique here is fair. Permission to allow tracking is not on by default — what is on by default is permission for the app to ask. Searls makes that clear, I know, but it feels like he’s arguing as though apps can track you by default, and they can’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not arguing that. But let’s dig down a bit on all this.</p>
<p>What Apple has here is a system for asking in both directions (apps asking to track, and users asking apps not to track). I think this is weird and unclear, while simply disallowing tracking globally would be clear. So would a setting that simply turns off all apps’ ability to track. But that’s not what we have.</p>
<p>Or maybe we do.</p>
<p>To review… in&nbsp;Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking, is a single OFF/ON switch for “Allow Ads to Request to Track.” It is by default set to ON. (I called AppleCare to be sure about this. The guy I spoke to said yes, it is.) Below that setting is a bit of explanatory text with a “Learn more” link that goes to this long column of text one swipes down four times (at least on my phone) to read:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Okay, now look in the fifth paragraph (three up from where you’re reading now). There it says that by turning the setting to OFF, “all apps…will be blocked from accessing the device’s Advertising Identifier.” Maybe I’m reading this wrong, but it seems plain to me that this will at least pre-vaporize trackers vectored on the device identifier (technically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_for_Advertisers">IDFA: ID For Advertisers</a>).</p>
<p>After explaining why he thinks the default setting to ON is the better choice, and why he likes it that way (e.g. he can see what apps want to track, surprisingly few do, and he knows which they are), John says this about the IDFA:</p>
<blockquote><p>IDFA was well-intentioned, but I think in hindsight Apple realizes it was naive to think the surveillance ad industry could be trusted with anything.</p>
<blockquote><p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet, “Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does&nbsp;asking&nbsp;an app not to track mean it&nbsp;won’t?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is Apple being honest. Apple can block apps from accessing the IDFA identifier, but there’s nothing Apple can do to&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;that apps won’t come up with their own device fingerprinting schemes to track users behind their backs. Using “Don’t Allow Tracking” or some such label instead of “Ask App Not to Track” would create the false impression that Apple can block any and all forms of tracking. It’s like a restaurant with a no smoking policy. That doesn’t mean you won’t go into the restroom and find a patron sneaking a smoke. I think if Apple catches applications circumventing “Ask App Not to Track” with custom schemes, they’ll take punitive action, just like a restaurant might ask a patron to leave if they catch them smoking in the restroom — but they can’t guarantee it won’t happen. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G05nEgsXgoI">Joanna Stern asked Craig Federighi about this in their interview a few weeks ago</a>, and Federighi answered honestly.)</p>
<p>If Apple could give you a button that&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;an app couldn’t track you, they would, and they’d label it appropriately. But they can’t so they don’t, and they won’t exaggerate what they&nbsp;can&nbsp;do.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Twitter Don Marti <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1398765786714361859">writes</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately it probably has to be “ask app not to track” because some apps will figure out ways around the policy (like all mobile app store policies). Probably better not to give people a false sense of security if they are suspicious of an app</p></blockquote>
<p>—and then points to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/p-g-worked-with-china-trade-group-on-tech-to-sidestep-apple-privacy-rules-11617902840">P&amp;G Worked With China Trade Group on Tech to Sidestep Apple Privacy Rules</a>, subtitled “One of world’s largest ad buyers spent years building marketing machine reliant on digital user data, putting it at odds with iPhone maker’s privacy moves” in The Wall Street Journal. In it is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>P&amp;G marketing chief Marc Pritchard has advocated for a universal way to track users across platforms, including those run by Facebook and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, that protects privacy while also giving marketers information to better hone their messages.</p>
<p>Frustrated with what it saw as tech companies’ lack of transparency, P&amp;G began building its own consumer database several years ago, seeking to generate detailed intelligence on consumer behavior without relying on data gathered by Facebook, Google and other platforms. The information is a combination of anonymous consumer IDs culled from devices and personal information that customers share willingly. The company said in 2019 that it had amassed 1.5 billion consumer identifications world-wide.</p>
<p>China, where Facebook and Google have a limited presence, is P&amp;G’s most sophisticated market for using that database. The company funnels 80% of its digital-ad buying there through “programmatic ads” that let it target people with the highest propensity to buy without presenting them with irrelevant or excessive ads, P&amp;G Chief Executive Officer David Taylor said at a conference last year.</p>
<p>“We are reinventing brand building, from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology,” he said. “This is driving growth while delivering savings and efficiencies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to that, I <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1399028948063834112">tweeted</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Won’t app makers find ways to work around the no tracking ask, regardless of whether it’s a global or a one-at-a-time setting? That seems to be what the<br>
@WSJ is saying about&nbsp; @ProcterGamble ‘s work with #<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAID_(technology)">CAID</a> device fingerprinting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarti/status/1399054402938236930">replied</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes. Some app developers will figure out a way to track you that doesn’t get caught by the App Store review. Apple can’t promise a complete “stop this app from tracking me” feature because sometimes it will be one of those apps that’s breaking the rules</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Augustine Fou <a href="https://twitter.com/acfou/status/1399029656444092419">replied</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>of course, MANY ad tech companies have been working on fingerprinting for years, as a work around to browsers (like Firefox) allowing users to delete cookies many years ago. Fingerprinting is even more pernicious because it is on server-side and out of control of user entirely</p></blockquote>
<p>That last point is why I’ve long argued that we have a very basic problem with the client server model itself: that it all but guarantees a feudal system in which clients are serfs and site operators (and Big Tech in general) are their lords and masters. Though my original metaphor for client-server (which I have been told was originally a euphemism for slave-master) was calf-cow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s more on that one,&nbsp;plus some other metaphors as well:</p>

 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/14/poison/">How the cookie poisoned the Web</a> (2021) 
 
<p>I’ll pick up that thread after visiting <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/searls-apple-privacy/">what Nick says</a> about fingerprinting:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are countless ways that devices can be fingerprinted, and the mandated use of IDFA instead of those surreptitious methods makes it harder for ad tech companies to be sneaky. It has long been possible to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imore.com/how-limit-ad-tracking-iphone-and-ipad">turn off IDFA</a>&nbsp;or reset the identifier. If it did not exist, ad tech companies would find other ways of individual tracking without users’ knowledge, consent, or control.</p>
<blockquote><p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet, “Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does asking an app not to track mean it&nbsp;won’t?</p>
<p>History has an answer for those questions.</p>
<p>Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>? Invented in the dawn of tracking, back in the late ’00s, it’s still a setting in every one of our browsers. But it too is just an ask — and ignored by nearly every website on Earth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like Do Not Track, App Tracking Transparency is a request — verified as much as Apple can by App Review — to&nbsp;<a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/tracking-transparency-federighi/">avoid false certainty</a>. Tracking is a pernicious reality of every internet-connected technology. It is ludicrous to think that any company could singlehandedly find and disable all forms of fingerprinting in all apps, or to guarantee that users will not be tracked.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. This too is a problem with the feudal system that the Web + app world has become, and Nick is right to point it out. He continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that bugs me is that Searls knows all of this. He’s&nbsp;Doc Searls; he has an extraordinary&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">thirteen year history</a>&nbsp;of writing about this stuff. So I am not entirely sure why he is making arguments like the ones above that, with knowledge of his understanding of this space, begin to feel disingenuous. I have been thinking about this since I read this article last night and I have not come to a satisfactory realistic conclusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a realistic conclusion (or at least the one that’s in my head right now): I was mistaken to assume that Apple has more control here than it really does, and it’s right for all these guys (Nick, John, Augustine, Don and others) to point that out. Hey, I gave in to wishful thinking and unconscious ad hominem argumentation. Mea bozo. I sit corrected.</p>
<p>He continues,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is a big, giant, powerful company — but it is only one company that operates within the realities of legal and technical domains. We cannot engineer our way out of the anti-privacy ad tech mess. The only solution is regulatory. That will not guarantee that bad actors do not exist, but it could create penalties for, say, Google when it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/unredacted-google-lawsuit-docs-detail-efforts-to-collect-user-location-2021-5">ignores users’ choices</a>&nbsp;or Dr.&nbsp;B when it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/24/1025281/covid-vaccine-waitlist-dr-b-collected-data-from-millions/">warehouses medical data</a>&nbsp;for unspecified future purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve had the GDPR and the CCPA in enforceable forms for awhile now, and the main result, for us mere “data subjects” (GDPR) and “consumers” (CCPA) is a far worse collection of experiences in using the Web.</p>
<p>At this point my faith in regulation (which I celebrated, at least in the GDPR case, when it went into force) is less than zero. So is my faith in tech, within the existing system.</p>
<p>So I’m moving on, and working on a new approach, outside the whole feudal system, which I describe in <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/05/05/a-new-way/">A New Way</a>. It’s truly new and small, but I think it can be huge: much bigger than the existing system, simply because we on the demand side will have better ways of informing supply (are you listening, Mark Pritchard?) than even the best surveillance systems can guess at.</p>

<p>This piece has had a lot of very smart push-back (and forward, but mostly back). I respond to it in <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/30/apple-vs-or-plus-adtech-part-ii/">Part II, here</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen it yet, watch Apple’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w4qPUSG17Y">Privacy on iPhone | tracked ad</a>. In it a guy named Felix (that’s him, above) goes from a coffee shop to a waiting room somewhere, accumulating a vast herd of hangers-on along the way. The herd represents trackers in his phone, all crowding his personal space while gathering private information about him. The <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/mind-your-own-business-delta-5-apple-ad-privacy-1234979172/#!">sound track</a> is “Mind Your Own Business,” by Delta 5. <a href="https://genius.com/Delta-5-mind-your-own-business-lyrics">Lyrics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can I have a taste of your ice cream?<br>
Can I lick the crumbs from your table?<br>
Can I interfere in your crisis?</p>
<p>No, mind your own business<br>
No, mind your own business</p>
<p>Can you hear those people behind me?<br>
Looking at your feelings inside me<br>
Listen to the distance between us</p>
<p>Why don’t you mind your own business?<br>
Why don’t you mind your own business?</p>
<p>Can you hear those people behind me?<br>
Looking at your feelings inside me<br>
Listen to the distance between us</p>
<p>Why don’t you mind your own business?<br>
Why don’t you mind your own business?</p></blockquote>
<p>The ad says this when Felix checks his phone from the crowded room filled with people spying on his life:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, when he presses “Ask App Not to Track,” all the hangers-on go pop and turn to dust—</p>
<p></p>
<p>Followed by</p>
<p></p>
<p>Except that she gets popped too:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meaning he doesn’t want any one of those trackers in his life.</p>
<p>The final image is the one at the top.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s misleading about this message: Felix would have had none of those trackers following him if he had gone into Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking, and pushed the switch to off, like I’ve done here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key fact:&nbsp;it is defaulted to on. Meaning Apple is not fully serious about privacy. If Apple was fully serious, your iPhone would be set to not allow tracking in the first place. All those trackers would come pre-vaporized. And Apple never would have given every iPhone an IDFA—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_for_Advertisers">ID For Advertisers</a>—in the first place. (And never mind that they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/apple-forcing-developers-to-ditch-unique-device-ids/">created IDFA back in 2013</a> partly to wean advertisers from tracking and targeting phones’ UDIDs (unique device IDs).</p>
<p>Defaulting the master Tracking setting to ON means Felix has to tap “Ask App Not To Track” for every single one of those hangers-on. Meaning that one click won’t vaporize all those apps at once. Just one at a time. This too is misleading as well as unserious.</p>
<p>And why “ask” an app not to track? Why not “tell”? Or, better yet,&nbsp;“Prevent Tracking By This App”? Does asking an app not to track mean it won’t?</p>
<p>History has an answer for those questions.</p>
<p>Remember&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>? Invented in the dawn of tracking, back in the late ’00s, it’s still a setting in every one of our browsers. But it too is just an ask—and ignored by nearly every website on Earth.</p>
<p>Here is how the setting looks, buried deep on Google’s Chrome:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s hardly worth bothering to turn that on (it’s defaulted to off), because it became clear long ago that Do Not Track was utterly defeated by the adtech biz and its dependents in online publishing. The standard itself was morphed to meaninglessness at the W3C, where by the end (in 2019) it got re-branded “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/">Tracking Preference Expression</a>.” (As if any of us has a preference for tracking other than to make it not happen or go away.)</p>
<p>By the way, thanks to adtech’s defeat of Do Not Track in 2014, people took matters into their own hands, by installing ad and tracking blockers en masse, turning ad blocking, an option that had been laying around since 2004, into <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;by 2015.</p>
<p>And now we have one large company, Apple, making big and (somewhat, as we see above) bold moves toward respecting personal privacy. That’s good as far as it goes. But how far is that, exactly? To see how far, here are some questions:</p>
 
 Will “asking” apps not to track on an iPhone actually make an app not track? 
 How will one be able to tell? 
 What auditing and accounting mechanisms are in place—on your phone, on the apps’ side, or at Apple? 
 
<p>As for people’s responses to Apple’s new setting, <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">here are some numbers</a>&nbsp;for a three-week time frame: April 26 to May 16. They come from <a href="https://www.verizonmedia.com/our-brands/flurry">FLURRY</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.verizonmedia.com/">Verizon Media</a>, which is an adtech company. I’ll summarize:</p>
 
 For “Worldwide daily op-in rate after iOS 14.5 launch across all apps,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among uses who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 11% and rose to 15%. 
 The “U.S. Daily opt-in rate after iOS launch across all apps,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among users who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 2% and rose to 6%. 
 The “Worldwide daily opt-in rate across apps that have displayed the prompt,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who allow app tracking among users who have chosen to either allow or deny tracking” started at 31% and went down to 24%. 
 The “Worldwide daily share of mobile app users with ‘restricted’ app tracking” (that’s where somebody goes into Settings—&gt;Privacy—&gt;Tracking and switches off “Allow Apps to Request to Track”), expressed as “% of mobile active app users who cannot be tracked by default and don’t have a choice to select a tracking option” started and stayed within a point of 5% . 
 And the “U.S. daily share of mobile app users with ‘restricted’ app tracking,” expressed as “% of mobile active app users who cannot be tracked by default and don’t have a choice to select a tracking option” started at 4% and ended at 3%, with some dips to 2%. 
 
<p>Clearly tracking isn’t popular, but those first two numbers should cause concern for those who want tracking to stay unpopular. The adtech business is relentless in advocacy of tracking, constantly pitching stories about how essential tracking-based “relevant,” “personalized” and “interest-based” advertising is—for you, and for the “free” Web and Internet.</p>
<p>It is also essential to note that Apple does advertising as well. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music">Here’s Benedict Evans</a> on a slope for Apple that is slippery in several ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple has built up its own ad system on the iPhone, which records, tracks and targets users and serves them ads, but does this on the device itself rather than on the cloud, and only its own apps and services. Apple tracks lots of different aspects of your behaviour and uses that data to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts and serve you ads that are targeted to your interests, in the App Store, Stocks and News apps. You can read Apple’s description of that <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205223">here</a> – Apple is tracking a lot of user data, but nothing leaves your phone. Your phone is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything.</p>
<p>This is conceptually pretty similar to Google’s proposed <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc">FLoC</a>, in which your Chrome web browser uses the web pages you visit to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts without your browsing history itself leaving your device. Publishers (and hence advertisers) can ask Chrome for a cohort and serve you an appropriate ad rather than tracking and targeting you yourself. Your browser is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything -except for that anonymous cohort.</p>
<p>Google, obviously, wants FLoC to be a generalised system used by third-party publishers and advertisers. At the moment, Apple runs its own cohort tracking, publishing and advertising as a sealed system. It has begun selling <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/uk/help/advanced/0071-book-search-tab-campaigns/">targeted ads</a> inside the App Store (at precisely the moment that it crippled third party app install ads with IDFA), but it isn’t offering this tracking and targeting to anyone else. Unlike FLoC, an advertiser, web page or app can’t ask what cohort your iPhone has put you in – only Apple’s apps can do that, including the app store.</p>
<p>So, the obvious, cynical theory is that Apple decided to cripple third-party app install ads just at the point that it was poised to launch its own, and to weaken the broader smartphone ad model so that companies would be driven towards in-app purchase instead. (The even more cynical theory would be that Apple expects to lose a big chunk of App Store commission as a result of lawsuits and so plans to replace this with app install ads. I don’t actually believe this – amongst other things I think Apple believes it will win its Epic and Spotify cases.)</p>
<p>Much more interesting, though, is what happens if Apple opens up its cohort tracking and targeting, and says that apps, or Safari, can now serve anonymous, targeted, private ads without the publisher or developer knowing the targeting data. It could create an API to serve those ads in Safari and in apps, without the publisher knowing what the cohort was or even without knowing what the ad was. What if Apple offered that, and described it as a truly ‘private, personalised’ ad model, on a platform with at least 60% of US mobile traffic, and over a billion global users?…</p>
<p>Apple has a tendency to build up strategic assets in discrete blocks and small parts of products, and then combine them into one. It’s been planning to shift the Mac to its own silicon for close to a decade, and added biometrics to its products before adding Apple Pay and then a credit card. Now it has Apple Pay and ‘Sign in with Apple’ as new building blocks on the web, that might be combined into other things. It seems pretty obvious that Privacy is another of those building blocks, deployed step by step in lots of different places. Privacy has been good business for Apple, and advertising is a bigger business than all of those.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of which is why I’ve lately been thinking that privacy is a losing battle on the Web. And that we need to start <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2021/05/05/a-new-way/">building a byway</a> around the whole mess: one where demand can signal supply about&nbsp;exactly what it wants, rather than having demand constantly being spied on and guessed at by adtech’s creepy machinery.</p>

  <p>Summary:      X.509 certificates have been around for 40 years and have proven to be a trustworthy means of exchanging data. So, what are the differences between X.509 ceritificates and SSI? And what are the advantages of each?</p>



<p>
    I sometimes talk to people who ask "Why do we need SSI? What's wrong with X.509 certificates?" Here's some thoughts. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> is a standard that defines the format for public key certificates. Public key certificates can be used to tie a public key to other information. The most common use, by far, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS/SSL</a>, the basis for trust in HTTPS, the protocol that secures the Web. In TLS,  the certificate binds a public key to a domain name (and perhaps other information).
</p>

<p>
    The first challenge for many people is determining whether X.509 certificates are more like <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials</a> or <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">DIDDocs</a>. This is understandable since X.509 combines the functions of these two separate SSI standards. X.509 certificates themselves are like DIDDocs in that they bind information to a public key. But the hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI) of X.509 is meant to attest to the veracity of the the X.509 certificate. And X.509 extensions allow other information to be included. So, X.509 certificates also bind the public key (as an identifier) to real-world attributes. DIDDocs don't have anything like PKI. Rather SSI uses verifiable credentials to assert information about a decentralized identifier in a trustworthy way.
</p>

<p>
    Another important difference between X.509 certificates and DIDDocs is that the primary purpose of the DIDDoc is to bind the public key in the DIDDoc to a decentralized identifier, or DID, whereas X.509 certificates can bind the public key to a subject name and other information like a domain name. Extensions to the certificate allow it to also bind the public key to other information. The important distinction is that the DID is required and represents a unique name for the DIDDoc.  A DID must have some means of resolving to the DIDDoc1. The DID provides a level of indirection to the public key. Consequently, the public key associated with a DID can be rotated without changing the DID and so it can be used as a permanent identifier. I won't get into the details around how this is done securely, but you can read far more detail at <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> if you're curious. 
</p>

<p>
    The veracity of an X.509 certificate is usually determined from the strictly hierarchical public key infrastructure (PKI). For example, when you visit a web site, your browser uses the X.509 certificate from the web site to establish a secure connection. If you click on the lock, you'll see information about that certificate. The web site's certificate was signed by some organization that is attesting to the information in the certificate. You can use the certificate of the signing organization to know its public key to do the check. But how do you know that certificate is valid? It's signed using the private key whose public key is in yet another certification, and so on. Eventually this has to stop and it does when you get to a certificate that was stored in browser when it was built. <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA Browser Forum</a> is the organization that determines what certificates are worthy to be inside browsers. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Showing the Certificate Hierarchy in Brave (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In contrast, the veracity of the DID and associated DIDDoc is ascertained by a heterarchical method. The DID and DIDDoc are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-asserted and self-certifying</a>. You can use cryptographic means to determine that the binding asserted in the DIDDoc has not been tampered with, but the DID infrastructure itself does nothing to tell you who or what the DID is bound to in a verifiable way. For that, we use verifiable credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose the DID in question is one Alice generated to give to Bravo Corp, her mortgage processor. Bravo knows nothing about the DID they've received except that it's bound, in the associated DIDDoc, with a specific public key (and possibly an endpoint of some kind). They ask Alice to prove things about herself as part of the mortgage application process and over time learn quite a bit. Alice proves her name and date of birth using a verifiable credential representing her driver's license. She proves her income using a verifiable credential from her employer, and her banking information using a verifiable credential from her bank. The information in each of these verifiable credentials is attested by its issuer: the DMV, the employer, and the bank.  Bravo's reasons for trusting these organization are up to Bravo:
</p>
 
     The may be well known. 
     Bravo may have a prior relationship with them. 
     Bravo might ask them to prove things about themselves (using verifiable credentials, of course). 
     Or they may belong to a trust framework that Bravo can use access publicly.  
 

<p>
    Furthermore, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)2 allow Alice to combine the attributes in these various credentials (and others) in a way that only discloses what Bravo is asking for and nothing more. And her digital wallet was able to do this for her automatically without Alice having to pick and choose the various attributes from various credentials herself. The proof shows that the information from these three credentials is all bound to the person who controls the DID that Alice gave to Bravo. The proof also shows that these credentials have not been revoked. 
</p>

<p>
    You can imagine Alice having X.509 certificates from the DMV, her employer, and her bank that attest these same things (through X.509 extensions). She would also have a personal certificate with her public key that she used to anchor each of these other certificates. The X.509 certificates are not linked in any way other than Alice's public key. She has to use the same public key in all of them so they can be correlated. She uses her personal certificate to prove she's in control of the public key she provides to the DMV, employer, and bank. If she changes her public key, so has to get new certificates. This is a good example of the dual nature of X.509 certificates. Alice's personal certificate looks like a DIDDoc, but the certificates with extensions look like verifiable credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    There's no easy way for Alice to restrict what attributes she shares when she shares these certificates. She has to share the entire certificate. Bravo would trust these certificates in the same way your browser does, by following the chain to some smallish set of trusted certificate authorities fo each kind of certificate (driver's license, employer, or bank). Bravo would also check certificate revocation lists for each certificate to ensure they're still valid.
</p>

<p>
    The advantage of X.509 certificates is that the technology, processes, and governance behind them are well-known and understood. No small thing.  The public key infrastructure is well developed with a long history of securely communicating trustworthy public keys. DIDs and verifiable credentials are relatively new. Although standards, open source code, and multiple vendors exist, they are unproven compared to X.509. 
</p>

<p>
    So, why do something new? DIDs, DIDDocs, and verifiable credentials have several advantages over X.509 certificates:
</p>
 
     DIDs are more secure. DIDs allow public keys to be rotated in a trustworthy manner. Consequently, Alice can rotate the key underlying the DID at will without having to get new credentials. The identifier lives as long as Alice needs it to. Alice won't be tempted to hold onto a potentially comprimised key because she's worried about the inconvenience. 
     SSI uses the right tools for each part of the process. The SSI architecture cleanly separates providing an identifier for Alice from proving things about Alice. The binding between the DID and its associated public key can be verified cryptographically without relying on a hierarchical chain of authorities. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">fidelity</a> of the credential exchange can be verified cryptographically using information in a public credential registry (often a ledger of some sort). This separation allows the methods and tools to be crafted to the needs of each kind of document. 
     
     Verifiable credentials minimize information disclosure. Sharing only what's necessary protects Alice's privacy. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnbNtjsKb4k&amp;t=1705s">Webinar on ZKP-oriented Credentials</a> from Daniel Hardman is an excellent, approachable tutorial on the many benefits of ZKPs for credential exchange. 
     SSI data sharing UX is safer. ZKPs provide convenience for Alice saving her time, and reducing the chance of her oversharing through human error (i.e. they are safer from a privacy perspective).  
     SSI has a consistent UX. SSI wallets and agents provide a good user experience for managing relationships, storing credentials, and responding to proof requests. As far as I know, X.509 certificate wallets do not exist as such, so they would need to be developed to provide a comparable user experience.  
     Verifiable credentials provide better interoperability. Alice is able to use multiple credentials from different issuers and prove things to many verifiers because of standards, not just for data formats, but also protocols for issuace and presentment. I know of no standards for how X.509 credentials can be used to prove the kind of information in the mortgage example in an interoperable way. They have been around for over 40 years and yet they are almost exclusively used for TLS and nothing else.  
 

<p>
    The high-level goals of X.509 certificates are similar to those of DIDs and verifiable credentials. But DIDs and verifiable credentials represent an innovation that takes learnings from 40 years of experience and new developments in cryptography into account to provide a better, more flexible solution to the problem of exchanging data in a trustworthy way. SSI in the form of DIDs and verifiable credentials promise a global, interoperable data exchange metasystem that is cryptographically sound with an excellent user experience. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     The resolution need not be global or public. For Peer DIDs, the resolution is local. 
     Note that not all credential exchange methods use ZKPs. They should.

<p>Working group members (and others!) are encouraged to provide feedback on the draft soon before we start the foundation-wide review.  We will probably decide next week to progress the draft to foundation-wide review.  In particular, there’s been interest recently in both Entity Statements and Automatic Registration among those working on Self-Issued OpenID Provider extensions.  Reviews of those features would be particularly welcome.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Natural anonymity comes from our ability to recognize others without the aid of an external identity system. Online interactions will only be able to mirror life-like anonymity when we can use decentralized identity systems that don't force all interactions to be under the purview of centralized, administrative identity systems.</p>



<p>
    Doc Searls published a piece last week entitled <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/05/14/poison/">"How the Cookie Poisoned the Web"</a>. Doc points to various privacy ills of Web 2.0 and in each instance says "Blame the cookie." Doc's larger point is that the web started out as a peer-to-peer publishing system that was wholly decentralized and gave everyone equal voice.
</p>

<p>
    Doc continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
    But gradually a poison disabled personal agency. That poison was the cookie.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Very few web sites in the early web had identity systems. For the peer-to-peer sharing of documents and discovery via embedded links, none were needed. HTTP, the foundational protocol of the web is stateless, meaning the HTTP server does not know whether any two requests are related to each other.
</p>

<p>
    Stateless is fine for document sharing and linking using hypertext. But it makes building a shopping cart really hard. Back in the mid-90's figuring out how to build a functional shopping cart was on everyone's mind, mine included. I was the cofounder and CTO of an early ecommerce site, imall.com. Without changing HTTP, the most promising strategy was to include a correlation identifier in all the links generated by the site, so we'd know who was making the request. But this was buggy and caused lots of customer support issues.
</p>

<p>
    A correlation identifier is a unique string that can be used to link requests. Ultimately, the the HTTP community added a correlation identifier called a "cookie" (which took its name from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_cookie">correlation identifier used in unix</a>). HTTP cookies are generated by the server and stored on the browser. Whenever the browser makes a request to the server, it sends back the cookie, allowing the server to correlate all requests from that browser.
</p>

<p>
    That all sounds innocuous enough and in theory, it is. But the devil is in the details. If I'm shopping on imall.com, I want the site to keep track of me because that provides utility and convenience. But it turns out that most web pages are not a single chunk of HTML that the server sends down. They have lots of other things, like javascript files and images, embedded in them too. These other things don't have to be from the same server. Each of those servers can set a cookie as well. And since they know where they were linked from, they can correlate activity across multiple websites.
</p>

<p>
    This is how (simple) ad tracking works. When you see an ad on web site A, it's being served from a server owned by an ad company that web site A has an agreement with. The ad server plants a cookie in your browser. Now you visit web site B that also includes ads from the same ad server. Your browser dutifully reports the ad server cookie back to the ad server along with the information that the ad was on web site B. The company running the ad server now knows you were on web site A and web site B (along with lots of other metadata). Rather than correlating requests on a single web site, they are using cookies to correlate your activity across the web.
</p>

<p>
    This is the poison Doc is talking about. The web cookie, as designed, goes well beyond correlating activity on a single web site for purposes of creating some utility like a shopping cart or a chat server. The web cookie allows correlating activities of people across the web. And it doesn't stop with your browsing history. The ad company starts knowing other things about you (because the web sites you visit tell them) and soon they can develop a comprehensive dossier.
</p>

<a></a>
 Like-Like Anonymity and the Administrative Internet 

<p>
    In real life, we often interact with others—both people and institutions—with relative anonymity. For example, if I go the store and buy a coke with cash there is no exchange of identity information necessary. Even if I use a credit card it's rarely the case that the entire transaction happens under the administrative authority of the identity system inherent in the credit card. Only the financial part of the transaction takes place in that identity system. This is true of most interactions in real life.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, in the digital world, very few meaningful transactions are done outside of some administrative identity system. There are several reasons why identity is so important in the digital world:
</p>

 
     
        Continuity—While web sessions can be pseudonymous, as we've seen, they are often correlated across multiple independent sessions and devices using an authenticated correlation identifier. This allows, for example, the customer to have a shopping cart that not only persists across time but also on different devices.
     
     
        Convenience—So long as the customer is authenticating, we might as well further store additional information like addresses and credit card numbers for their convenience, to extend the shopping example. Storing these allows the customer to complete transactions without having to enter the same information over and over.
     
     
        Trust—There are some actions that should only be taken by certain people, or people in certain roles, or with specific attributes. Once a shopping site has stored my credit card, for example, I ought to be the only one who can use it. Identity systems provide authentication mechanisms as the means of knowing who is at the other end of the wire so that we know what actions they're allowed to take. This places identifiers in context so they can be trusted.
     
     
        Surveillance—Unfortunately, identity systems also provide the means of tracking individuals across transactions for purposes of gathering data about them. This data gathering may be innocuous or nefarious, but there is no doubt that it is enabled by identity systems in use on the internet.
     
 

<p>
    In real life, we do without identity systems for most things. You don't have to identify yourself to the movie theater to watch a movie or log into some system to sit in a restaurant and have a private conversation with friends. In real life, we act as embodied, independent agents. Our physical presence and the laws of physics have a lot to do with our ability to function with workable anonymity across many domains.
</p>


<p>
    So, how did we get surveillance and it's attendant affects on natural anonymity as an unintended, but oft-exploited feature of administrative digital identity systems? Precisely because they are administrative.
</p>

<a></a>
 Legibility 

<p>
    Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. James C. Scott's seminal book, Seeing Like a State, nicely analyzes legibility and its unintended consequences. Venkatesh Rao has a <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">great summary</a> if you'd like the TL;DR.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed by James C. Scott</a> <p>In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not—and cannot—be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Identity systems make people legible in order to offer continuity, convenience, and trust. But, as we've seen, that legibility also allows surveillance. In some respects, this is the trade off we always get with administrative systems. By creating legibility, administrative systems threaten privacy.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems are centralized. They are owned. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in.
</p>

<p>
    Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction and people pay the price of the interpretive work necessary to figure out how it functions.
</p>

<a></a>
 Real Life is Decentralized 

<p>
    On the other hand, in real life we interact as peers. We do interact with administrative systems of various sorts, but no one would describe that as real life. When I go to a store, I don't think about shopping within their administrative system. Rather, I walk in, look at stuff, talk to people, put things in a cart, and check out. The administrative system is there, but it's for governing the store, not the customers.
</p>
<p>
    We can't have online interactions that feel like real life until we redecentralize the internet. The internet started out decentralized. The early web was decentralized. But the need for continuity, convenience, and trust led more and more interactions to happen within someone's administrative system.
</p>

<p>
    Most online administrative systems make themselves as unobtrusive as they can. But there's no getting around the fact that every move we make is within a system that knows who we are and monitors what we're doing. In real life, I don't rely on the administrative system of the restaurant to identify the people I'm having dinner with. The restaurant doesn't need to check our IDs or surveil us in order to create an environment where we can talk and enjoy a meal together.
</p>

<p>
    The good news is that we're finally developing the tools necessary to create decentralized online experiences. What if you could interact with your friends online on the basis of an identity that they bring to you directly—one that you could recognize and trust? You wouldn't need Facebook or WhatsApp to identify and track your friends for you.
</p>

<p>
    Decentralized identity is the foundation for a decentralized web—a web that flexibly supports the kind of ad hoc interactions people have with each other all the time in real life. Until we do, we'll never get an online world that mirrors real life and its natural anonymity.
</p>

     <br><p>Day zero of being a #CDO is probably not the best day to ask difficult questions; however, sometimes, there is no better day.&nbsp; The first question to ask the executive leadership team as you walk around being introduced might be: “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation, want our data to drive, deliver or provide?”</p><p>You might want to wait to ask this question and first determine what tools are being used. This will frame what outcomes and decisions are being supported.&nbsp; The question and answers allow you to determine if there is an alignment or gap between “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide?”&nbsp; and what will happen anyway because of tools, processes and legacy.&nbsp; One critical aspect of being a #CDO is determining how our processes and methods only enable certain decisions to be made, but we have to unpack legacy.</p><p>Legacy within this framing is threefold. Decisions. Decisions. Decisions. These are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created processes, methods and rules which were created by previous incentives and power games; and are now ghosts in the systems. These decisions were taken so long ago that no one knows why, how or when it was decided.&nbsp; It is the way we do it; it is our IP, our brand.</p>  <p>Decisions that created “information and technology debt” included embedded and baked-in systems, hidden, and no-longer supported code, and automation based on tools and data biased when created.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Decisions that created noise in the hierarchy to lose or filter signals that someone did not want to hear.&nbsp; It was the creation of layers, reports, practices, structural regulation and unchallenged assumptions.</p>  <p>Unpacking legacy questions will take time, and you will not be ready on Day-0. Therefore any responses you get have to be framed within such understanding when it arrives.&nbsp; It is worth asking the question and then verifying before becoming blind to the tools that mould you.&nbsp;</p><p>“What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? &nbsp;Well, it could be:</p>  <p>Evidence-based, actionable insights</p>  <p>What should we automate?</p>  <p>How do we know we are doing the right thing?</p>  <p>Where are there efficiencies to be gained?</p>  <p>What do customers really want?</p>  <p>How to manipulate customers to increase margin and revenues?</p>  <p>Where are risks that we cannot see?</p>  <p>What is being hidden that we cannot see?</p>  <p>If you look at this list in the context of what tools and decisions already frame the response, are these what we are looking for data to answer or are we looking to data to affirm/ justify what we have already decided.&nbsp; A different response that no one will say “to justify what we are already doing!”</p><p>Data has bias because of previous decisions. Therefore, a #CDO has to find non-data tools to check what decisions from the past are biasing the current data, processes and tools. We cannot usefully answer the question we have set ourselves “What is the one thing that we, as a team and organisation what our data to drive, deliver or provide? without understanding the situation.</p><p>The CTO knows that they have to build a new platform when the bug list, new feature development and maintenance costs are bigger and will take more time than developing a new platform - this is the technology debt question.&nbsp; As the #CDO, you have to understand what is your information debt. The CTO will struggle as there is no clear path from policy to code. Similarly, the CDO, we struggle with no clear path from policy (what one thing) to better data for the decisions we require.&nbsp; You inherit and are now accountable for previous decisions, which constrain what is now possible as the biased tool has created what we have. The costs of collecting, labelling, holding, sorting and creating training data continually increase, creating a more significant gap and misalignment in values and expectations from data.</p><p>“We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and then our tools shape us”&nbsp; is often mistakenly attributed to Marshall McLuhan (as in the image above) and called McLuhan Law. The quote was actually written by Father John Culkin, SJ, a Professor of Communication at Fordham University in New York and friend of McLuhan. Such is the problem with data.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the opening question is the wrong one?

<p>ZmartZone has implemented OAuth 2.0 Resource Server functionality in Apache/NGINX modules so these components can be used as a reverse proxy in front of APIs or other backends. In such a setup the backend does not have to deal with security but outsources it to a proxy sitting in front of it in a similar way that TLS termination is often offloaded to a load-balancer.</p>



<p>Most of the OAuth 2.0 deployments today use so-called bearer access tokens that are easy to deploy and use. This type of access token is not bound to the Client presenting the token which means that an attacker intercepting an access token can just use that token to get access to the resources/APIs/services as if it were the Client. So called Proof-of-Possession semantics for access tokens prevent that type of attack and present a more secure setup but such a system is typically harder to implement, deploy and maintain. </p>



<p>A relative simple variant of Proof-of-Possession for access tokens is specified in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>. This  specification leverages a (possibly self-signed) certificate held by the Client to bind an access token cryptographically to the private key associated with that certificate.</p>



<p>This specification is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/liboauth2/releases/tag/v1.4.1">liboauth2 1.4.1</a> which is used in the Apache module <a href="https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_oauth2/releases/tag/v3.2.1">mod_oauth2 3.2.1</a>. This means that you can now require and verify OAuth 2.0 certificate bound access tokens for your API in a very simple way that is easy to deploy. All it takes is an Apache server in front of your API, configured with something like:</p>



<p><code>AuthType oauth2<br>OAuth2TokenVerify jwk "{\"kty\":\"RSA\",\"kid\":\"one\",\"use\":\"sig\",\"n\":\"...\",\"e\":\"AQAB\" }" type=mtls&amp;mtls.policy=optional<br>SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca</code></p>

   I've been somewhat distracted from Datasette for the past couple of months, thanks to my work on VIAL and the accompanying open source project django-sql-dashboard. This week I scraped back some time to work on Datasette. 
 ?_facet_size=100

  <p>I've been somewhat distracted from Datasette for the past couple of months, thanks to my work <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/vaccinateca/">on VIAL</a> and the accompanying open source project <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/May/10/django-sql-dashboard/">django-sql-dashboard</a>. This week I scraped back some time to work on Datasette.</p>
 ?_facet_size=100 
<p>This was <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1332">a feature suggestion</a> by Marjorie Roswell. Datasette defaults to showing a maximum of 30 results for a requested facet, which can be inconvenient if you are faceting on something like U.S. states where you'd ideally like to see all 50 at once.</p>
<p>You can customize this with the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/settings.html#setting-default-facet-size">default_facet_size</a> setting, but now you can also customize it for a specific page using the new <code>?_facet_size=100</code> query string parameter. You can request up to <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/settings.html#max-returned-rows">max_returned_rows</a> results, which defaults to 1000.</p>
<p>You can try this feature out, along with a bunch of dependency upgrades and a minor bug fix, in the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.57a0">0.57a0 alpha release</a>.</p>
 apt-get install now works in the Docker container 
<p>The <code>datasetteproj/datasette</code> Docker container had a bug in it where it was not possible to use <code>apt-get install</code> to add extra packages to containers that used it as a base - a problem if you want to use a plugin such as <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-ripgrep">datasette-ripgrep</a> which depends on <code>ripgrep</code> being available.</p>
<p>Brandon Roberts <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1320">pointed this out</a> along with a suggested fix, which I've adopted and will become available after the next non-alpha Datasette release.</p>
 Show/hide columns 
<p>I'm developing this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1339">in a branch</a> at the moment, but I'm finally getting close to a fix for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/615">issue #615</a> (opened in November 2019) that will let the Datasette table view show and hide specific columns, using new <code>?_col=</code> and <code>?_nocol=</code> query string arguments. Here's an animated demo of my work so far:</p>

     <br><p>You are standing in front of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_characters#Deep_Thought">Deep Thought</a>, as in the AI in HitchHicker Guide to the Galaxy.&nbsp; You are tasked with asking the famous question.&nbsp; “What is the answer to the world, the universe and everything?”&nbsp; In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams">Douglas Adams</a> original work, Deep Thought responds by saying, “it will take some time”; before coming back sometime later with the answer “42.”&nbsp; However, this is when data was a statistic, and we were “physical beings” who had not considered what experience would emerge as data became dynamic and we transitioned to “information beings.”</p><p>In our new context as informational beings, Deep Thought would not just take our question, go off to think about it but would respond.&nbsp; Deep Thought would do what we do and ask for clarification and to check the understanding of the question. I can imagine Deep Thought asking, “I just wanta check what you mean by ‘the answer to the world the universe and everything’ and do you want a brave answer, comfortable, or courageous answer?&nbsp; I can do a kind, generous or safe one too? What type of answer do you want?”</p><p>This is the problem we are facing.&nbsp; The questions that we have learnt for governance and oversight over millennia were fabulous to determine who decides, and who decides who decides in a physical world. It was where a human was held responsible and accountable.&nbsp; The issue of oversight becomes very differnt when we have automation and machines/ AI make decisions for us, how do we know who decides?&nbsp; Our questions will not cut it. &nbsp;</p><p>When we apply our old governance, old oversight, old accountable models and old frameworks to new problems, it feels like there is a disconnect and there is a level of dysfunctionality as the old model was not designed for the new problems.&nbsp; There is a forward capability; insomuch that old problems can be addressed better on the new systems, but the old systems cannot help solve or answer new questions.&nbsp; There is a backwards capability issue (not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>), just like you cannot run the latest software on the early computers.&nbsp;</p><p>We appear to be right now lost (which the media portrays as division or civilisation collapse creating divides to gain clicks and generate revenue). In reality, we are transitioning from "Physical"&nbsp; to "Information" beings.&nbsp; I take comfort that the best minds at MIT cannot decide either:&nbsp; Atoms to Bits OR&nbsp; Bits to Atoms. We know if MIT is wrestling, then we are in a transition.</p><p>The transition to information beings is reaching a chasm or hurdle, as the old model, which we depended on for governance and oversight, is at the edge of its limits.&nbsp; Data can perfectly tell us how effective and efficient everything is, including the deviance to plan, but data could not tell us if the plan was right or if we are doing the right thing, efficacy.&nbsp; We depended on the oversight model of humans for this.&nbsp; The former, efficiency, is easy, the latter being really quite tricky as it is so contextual to the moment in time and values/ principles we currently hold.&nbsp; Data can tell us from where we came, our models based on said data can suggest where we will go, but as yet, we cannot determine if we should. As an adventurer, I tend to do it anyway, ignoring should, because it is there, and my scars are evidence that it does not always work out well.&nbsp;</p><p>The data, models, algorithms, ML and AI we have now created are capable of informing us if it is the right thing to do, but how do we know?</p><p>Writing things down, TV, Radio, Social media, books, screens, and printing created threats to established power structures that the old system of control adapted to embrace the new technology over time. However, I believe that the current oversight, governance, compliance and regulatory controls, which are based on the last 5000 years of adaption as physical beings, which are not bad in truth, CANNOT adapt to the next evolution from physical to information. Indeed our infrastructure gave rise to data, which is creating us as information beings.&nbsp; Our current models of helping us determine if we are doing the right thing fall apart as we evolve to become information beings because of a shift in power and control. Our current oversight was not designed for autonomous decision-making by a non-human, and whilst the old methods have adopted too many situations, this move to information beings appears, right now, to break the capabilities of current governance.&nbsp;</p><p>We feel the gap when we read the news but don’t as yet have the language or words to describe it. &nbsp; We deny and hide from this reality by focussing on back to normal growth and trying to create new models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance follows change; it does not lead to a change. Governance and oversight help set up stability when we arrive at a new place. It is a flywheel for path dependency until someone breaks the axel. We are lucky to be alive now, seeing and witnessing this transition and can apply our minds to support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>as physical beings over generations, we learn that&nbsp;</p>  <p>power and control matter</p>  <p>monopoly and scale in a vertical matter</p>  <p>accountable and responsible limited to the very narrow works, and we can ignore any wider consequences&nbsp;</p>  <p>relationships have limited context</p>  <p>values and principles change slowly, allowing for rules to create an impression of stability</p>  <p>governance and oversight work to determine if we are doing the right thing by slowing decision time, filtering noise and hierarchy to create signals</p>  <br><p>as informational beings, we have not quite worked out the new game, however;</p>  <p>information and data must have attestation and rights as they matter</p>  <p>real-time learning models with computational power really matters</p>  <p>dependent and inter-dependence ecosystems ensure consequences matter</p>  <p>commons and the quality of the human experience on earth matter</p>  <p>collective and individual accountability and responsibility enable oversight in real-time</p>  <br><p>I believe we feel lost and vulnerable as we are starting to see that our lack of diversity, biased education, retention of power and control mechanisms, along with oversight and governance, worked for some of us some of the time as physical beings.&nbsp; However, they are not suitable when we arrive at "information beings," wanting everything to work for most people most of the time. Utopia is still a dream.&nbsp; We are at the start of a journey, and right now, we lack language, words, stories, rhetoric, meaning, models, structures, frameworks and a north star.&nbsp;</p><p>We know that growth fuels increasing salaries which is a mechanism for control by creating more debt, as you can borrow more.&nbsp; Growth hides and maintains the lie about change for longer. It is the flywheel. Increasing lifestyles create more people who have to remain aligned,&nbsp; the balance of sufficient salary to have enough debt that you remain conformist and will do as needed.&nbsp; Data means we can now pick up signals from employees about who is a conformist because of debt/ trapped.&nbsp; They are the easiest to corrupt, will be the weak link in the security chain, allows someone to control or exert undue influence - keep the model and the belief.&nbsp; The wheels are coming off, and the axels are breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What happens when AI (who is not paid) and is not aligned to the power plays makes decisions for the best outcome.&nbsp; How will you control the AI, like we use salary for humans?</p><p>Such interesting times</p> <br>

This new information definitely adds value to any required reactive decision. The identification of what the actual object is through increased resolution has an incremental value but not as much as knowing it is there and what direction at what speed but such information can lead to a better decision but suddenly there is an economics of cost compared to the incremental improvement in outcome.&nbsp; Knowing what type of bird by species or what plane by manufacturer, does add cost and size of data set but it does not add any value in terms of the decision requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, current data scientists, enthusiasts and idealists are asking you to store vast quantities of data from your customer and eco-system in the hope that at some point the algorithms and AI technology will give you new rich and deep insights, such as the equivalent resolution of what rivet types are used in construction for the inbound missile for Radar. We have to question when even though technically possible,&nbsp; does the resolution stop adding value?</p><p>The more data you collect the better the decisions you will be able to make in the future is a lie that is driving boards to take on the cost for data and data risk that is beyond their scope of any calculatable return.&nbsp; “Collect all the data and store it as you don’t know what we might discover” is hope and choice, it is not a rational business decision. The hope is wrapped up in a power pitch that our competitive advantage will be the discovery and ability to perform magical acts of mind manipulation which will supercharge sales through the control of customers. Or is it fear that everyone else will have this and we will have no future, FOMO of the big data promise.&nbsp;</p><p>Investing in the future is a fantastic idea when collecting moon or martian dust and storing it until we improve our science tools and instruments but for a company right now this is a lie. &nbsp; We are collecting and storing data in the hope that an algorithm will be able to mine more value than the cost of collecting, storing and algorithm development.&nbsp; Right now there is little evidence from all the work done that using data to change behaviour works at scale.&nbsp; This is a real cost today for “hope,” which the CFO has not found an ethical way to put on a balance sheet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have been sold a vision the more data we have the better decisions and insights we will have. Any data scientist or statistician will confirm that resolution of a decision or insight will not substantially improve beyond a certain data set size.&nbsp; You are not keeping and storing data for better decision making and insight today, just in the hope for new insights tomorrow. But the COO, CIO, CDO or CTO who is empire-building and determine that size equates to power within your culture are dependent on fear, uncertainty and doubt and insufficiently skilled directors to be able to challenge this. The tech looks like magic and every consulting company sees this as a revenue stream and write reports to support this view.</p><p>As a sceptic of the big data story, this article nicely aligns with your affinity and belief.&nbsp; You see that your next action is the stop the ever-increasing data spend and focus on traditional business.&nbsp; Whilst difficult to understand data is the right answer to business problems.&nbsp; The takeaway should be to question: Where is the diminishing return for data for your organisation?&nbsp; How do you know the data is good? How do you know the analysis is good. How do you know if what you are doing is the right thing to do? How do you incentive the right actions?</p><p>Data is not the problem, too much data will not create the return we hope for based on the cost we have, but we have to remain focussed that data is essential. How do we make data work for most of the people most of the time and not a few people on the odd occasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement an Angular single page application with an ASP.NET Core API and secured using the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and OAuth JWT Bearer tokens to protect the API. The identity provider is implemented using Auth0. The flow uses refresh tokens to renew the SPA session and the revocation endpoint is used to clean up the refresh tokens on logout. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Auth0AngularAspNetCoreApi">https://github.com/damienbod/Auth0AngularAspNetCoreApi</a></p>



<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solutions consists of three parts, an ASP.NET Core API which would provide the data in a secure way, an Angular application which would use the data and the Auth0 service which is used as the identity provider. Both applications are registered in Auth0 and the refresh tokens are configured for the SPA. The API can be used from the SPA application. </p>







<p>Angular SPA Code flow PKCE with refresh tokens</p>



<p>The Angular Open ID Connect client is implemented using the npm package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-auth-oidc-client">angular-auth-oidc-client</a>. The Auth0 client requires two special configurations to use an API. The audience is added as a custom parameter in the authorize request so that the required API can be used. The customParamsRefreshToken is used to add the scope parameter to the refresh request which is required by Auth0. The rest is standard Open ID Connect settings used for code flow using PKCE and refresh tokens.</p>


  import { APP_INITIALIZER, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthModule, LogLevel, OidcConfigService } from 'angular-auth-oidc-client';

export function configureAuth(oidcConfigService: OidcConfigService) {
  return () =&gt;
    oidcConfigService.withConfig({
      stsServer: 'https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com',
      redirectUrl: window.location.origin,
      postLogoutRedirectUri: window.location.origin,
      clientId: 'Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU',
      scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
      responseType: 'code',
      silentRenew: true,
      useRefreshToken: true,
      logLevel: LogLevel.Debug,
      customParams: {
        audience: 'https://auth0-api-spa', // API app in Auth0
      },
      customParamsRefreshToken: {
        scope: 'openid profile offline_access auth0-user-api-spa',
      },
    });
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [AuthModule.forRoot()],
  providers: [
    OidcConfigService,
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: configureAuth,
      deps: [OidcConfigService],
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
  exports: [AuthModule],
})
export class AuthConfigModule {}

  


<p>An AuthInterceptor class is used to add the access token to the API requests to the secure APIs which use the access token. It is important that the access token is only sent to the intended API and not every outgoing HTTP request.</p>


  import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  private secureRoutes = ['https://localhost:44390'];

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  intercept(
    request: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;,
    next: HttpHandler
  ) {
    if (!this.secureRoutes.find((x) =&gt; request.url.startsWith(x))) {
      return next.handle(request);
    }

    const token = this.authService.token;

    if (!token) {
      return next.handle(request);
    }

    request = request.clone({
      headers: request.headers.set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token),
    });

    return next.handle(request);
  }
}

  


<p>ASP.NET Core API OAuth</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core API allows requests from the calling SPA application. CORS is enabled for the application. The AddAuthentication method is used to add JWT bearer token security and the policies are added to verify the access token. The UseAuthentication method is used to add the security middleware.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...
	
	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;

	// only needed for browser clients
	services.AddCors(options =&gt;
	{
		options.AddPolicy("AllowAllOrigins",
			builder =&gt;
			{
				builder
					.AllowCredentials()
					.WithOrigins(
						"https://localhost:4204")
					.SetIsOriginAllowedToAllowWildcardSubdomains()
					.AllowAnyHeader()
					.AllowAnyMethod();
			});
	});

	services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
	{
		options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
		options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
	{
		options.Authority = "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
		options.Audience = "https://auth0-api-spa";
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

	services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
	{
		policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "Ujh5oSBAFr1BuilgkZPcMWEgnuREgrwU");
		});
	});

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...
	
	app.UseCors("AllowAllOrigins");

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}

  


<p>The UserApiScopeHandler class implements the AuthorizationHandler to require the UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement which is used as the policy.</p>


  public class UserApiScopeHandler : AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement&gt;
{

	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var scopeClaim = context.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scope");

		if (scopeClaim != null)
		{
			var scopes = scopeClaim.Value.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
			if (scopes.Any(t =&gt; t == "auth0-user-api-spa"))
			{
				context.Succeed(requirement);
			}
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
  


<p>The UserOneController class uses the policy which validates the access token and the claims from the token.</p>


  [SwaggerTag("User access token protected using Auth0")]
[Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// returns data id the correct Auth0 access token is used.
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	/// &lt;returns&gt;protected data&lt;/returns&gt;
	[HttpGet]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK)]
	[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status401Unauthorized)]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; { "user one data" };
	}
}
  


<p>Problems, notes, Improvements</p>



<p>Auth0 supports the revocation endpoint which is really good and so the refresh token can be revoked when the Angular application is logged out. This is really a MUST I think if using refresh tokens in the browser. It is not possible to revoke the access tokens so these remain valid after the SPA app logs out. You could reduce the lifespan of the access tokens which would improve this a bit. Auth0 does not support reference tokens and introspection which I would always use if using SPA authentication. Introspection could be supported by using a different identity provider. Using refresh token rotation is really important when using refresh tokens in the browser, this should also be configured.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Using Auth0 with an SPA means you cannot fully logout. The tokens are also stored somewhere in the browser, but at least the refresh token can be revoked which is really important. To improve security, you could switch to a BFF architecture and remove the tokens from the browser. Then it would also be possible to fully logout. The BFF also allows for client authentication and other security features which are not possible with an SPA. </p>

<p>What does it mean when perhaps hundreds of thousands of one’s photos appear in articles, essays and posts all over the Web?</p>
<p>It means they’re useful. That’s why I posted the originals in the first place, and licensed them to require only attribution. Because of that, I can at least guess at how many have been put to use.</p>
<p>For one example subject, take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium">Lithium</a>, a metal in the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">periodic table</a>. Lithium is making news these days, because it’s both scarce and required for the batteries of electric and hybrid vehicles. At issue especially is how and where lithium is extracted from the Earth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ivan-penn">Ivan Penn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/eric-lipton">Eric Lipton</a>&nbsp;put it in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/business/lithium-mining-race.html">The Lithium Gold Rush: Inside the Race to Power Electric Vehicles</a>&nbsp;(6 May in&nbsp;The&nbsp;New York Times), extraction “might not be very green.”</p>
<p>But it is blue. Or turquoise. Or aqua. Or whatever colors you see in the photo above.</p>
<p>I took that shot on a 2010 flight over Nevada. Looking out the window, it’s hard to miss lakes of bright colors on the desert floor, looking like stained glass windows into the Earth. I didn’t know at the time that the puddles were lithium, but I did know they’d be useful when I published them, along with whatever information a little bit of research would reveal about them. After I did the research, I put 17 photos in an album on Flickr titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157624562767729">Lithium Mines in Nevada</a>&nbsp;and added the same set to another album called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157629660046603">Mines and Mining</a>, which is now 329 photos long.</p>
<p>Also on that flight, which produced&nbsp;130 photos now in an album called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157629091465504">2010_08_06 rno-phx-bos</a>, other topics of interest are the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4881533317/in/album-72157629091465504/">Shoshone Mountains</a>, Yucca Lake and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Flat">Yucca Flat</a> (with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4921763915/in/album-72157629091465504/">“subsidence craters”</a> over underground nuclear bomb explosions), the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4882143224/in/album-72157629091465504/">Nevada Test Site</a>, (where hundreds of atomic bomb tests took place, among other interesting things,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4881536563/in/album-72157629091465504/">“Doom Town” on Frenchman Lake</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4882145526/in/album-72157629091465504/">Broom Lake in Area 51</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/6222858140/in/album-72157629091465504/">Creech Air Force Base</a> (from which military drones are remotely controlled), <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4888331077/in/album-72157629091465504/">Grand Canyon</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/4891118610/in/album-72157629091465504/">Buffalo at night</a>.&nbsp;None of the photos of mine at those links (all in Wikipedia) are especially artistic. In fact most of them make me cringe today, because I hadn’t yet mastered Photoshop when I posted them in the first place. Back then I shot only .jpgs, rather than RAW photos, which means I can’t go back do much to improve them. But all are useful, especially to writers and publications covering the topic of lithium mining. For example, my photos of those lithium lakes appear in—</p>

<p>And those are just a few of the many subjects I’ve shot, posted and annotated to make them useful to the world. Which is why I’m guessing the number of photos actually being used is in the hundreds of thousands by now.</p>
<p>I have placed none of those photos in any of those places. I just put them up where they can easily be found and put to use. For example, when I shot&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thedford,_Nebraska">Thedford, Nebraska</a>, I knew somebody would find the photo and put it in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Shots like these are a small percentage of all the photos I’ve taken over many decades. In fact, most of my photography is of people and scenes, not stuff like you find in the links above.</p>
<p>But apparently my main calling as a photographer is to push useful photos to the edge of the public domain, and to describe and tag them in ways that make them easy for researchers and journalists to find and use. And so far that has been a very successful strategy.</p>
<p>Addendum:::</p>
<p>So I have a camera question for the fellow photographers out there.</p>
<p>My main camera is a 2012-vintage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D_Mark_III">Canon 5D Mark III</a>&nbsp;, which replaced a 2005-vintage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_5D">Canon 5D</a>&nbsp;(source of the lithium lake shots), which replaced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_30D">Canon 30D</a>&nbsp;of the same generation, and a Nikon Coolpix before that. All of these are retired or beat up now. Being um, resource constrained, every camera and lens I’ve used in this millennium I’ve either rented or bought used.</p>
<p>Now, out of great kindness, an old friend is giving me a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_%CE%B17">Sony a7</a>R that has been idle since she replaced it with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_%CE%B17R_III">Sony a7Riii</a>. I’ve played with her newer Sony, and really like how much lighter mirrorless full-frames can be. (And the a7R is lighter than the a7Riii.) The question now is what kind of lens I want to start with here, given that my budget is $0 (though I will spend more than that). <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sony+lens+24-105+f4">The Sony equivalent</a> of the lens I use most, a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/standard-zoom/ef-24-105mm-f-4l-is-usm">Canon 24-105 f4 L</a>, runs &gt;$1000, even used.</p>
<p>I suppose I could get non-Sony lenses for less, but … I’m not sure that’s the way to go. I’m kinda tempted to get a telephoto zoom or prime for the Sony and keep using the Canon for everything else. But then I’m carrying two cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>But I just looked at <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">Ken Rockwell’s take on the&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/sony/lenses/24-105mm-f4.htm">Sony 24-105mm f/4<br>
FE G OSS Full-Frame E-Mount</a>, which appears to outperform the Canon equivalent (two links back) so maybe I’ll find a bullet to bite, and spend the grand.</p>
<p>[25 May…] And I did that. The lens just arrived. Now I just need to match it up with a7R, which will probably happen next Tuesday. I trust you’ll see some results soon after that.</p>

  <p>Summary:      This post features three fantastic books from three great, but quite different, authors on the subject of Big Tech, surveillance capitalism, and what's to be done about it.</p>


<p>
    I recently read Shoshana Zuboff's book on surveillance capitalism. Not only is the book thought provoking, but Zuboff's writing verges on the poetic at times, making it a delightful read. In her opening chapter she asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?"
</p>

<p>
    This question is perhaps one of the most important of our age. More and more of <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">our lives are being intermediated by digital systems</a>. And yet those systems are not ours, but rather belong to the companies that provide them. And our experience on them is predicated on the goals, desires, and needs of those companies, not ours. I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">call these systems "administrative"</a> because they are built to administer our experience in a particular domain for the administrator's specific purposes.
</p>


<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B01N2QEZE2/windleyofente-20">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power by 
    Shoshana Zuboff</a> <p>The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behavior. In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.</p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Zuboff makes a number of compelling arguments about why surveillance capitalism represents a significant threat to humanity's future. An overarching conclusion is that by putting everyone inside their administrative systems to make our lives legible to their surveillance, these companies become tyrants.
</p>

<blockquote>
    [T]yranny is the obliteration of politics. It is founded on its own strain of radical indifference in which every person, except the tyrant, is understood as an organism among organisms in an equivalency of Other-Ones.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Contrary to what many might believe, the obliteration of politics is not a good thing. As we discovered a few issues ago (see <a>Legitimacy and Decentralized Systems</a>), politics is how decentralized, democratic systems achieve legitimacy and coherence. Getting rid of politics requires putting everyone and everything in the centralized administrative system of the surveillance capitalist—making them subject to the dictates of the tyrant who has radical indifference to their autonomy, individuality, and humanity.
</p>

<p>
    Zuboff's statement echos David Graeber's discussion of bureaucracy in The Utopia of Rules. Bureaucratic interactions are simple and predictable. But they are soulless. They are transactional and cannot provide the basis for authentic digital relationships (see <a>Authentic Digital Relationships</a> ).
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00MKZ0QZ2/windleyofente-20">The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy by David Graeber</a> <p>Where does the desire for endless rules, regulations, and bureaucracy come from? How did we come to spend so much of our time filling out forms? And is it really a cipher for state violence? To answer these questions, the anthropologist David Graeber—one of our most important and provocative thinkers—traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today, and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice...though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealing—even romantic—about bureaucracy. </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Living our lives inside the administrative systems of Big Tech is akin to living your life inside an amusement park. Not altogether unpleasant, but a far cry from authentic. Stippled with moments of joy, but devoid of real happiness and freedom. Treated identically and transactionally despite pretensions to personalization.
</p>

<p>
    In How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism, Cory Doctorow argues that while Zuboff's observations are not incorrect, her conclusions about what constitutes surveillance capitalism's real dangers are mistaken. Where Zuboff sees companies who are getting better and better at predicting and controlling our actions, Doctorow sees companies selling the power to persuade, poorly. The real harm is the surveillance, not mind control.
</p>

<blockquote> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08V8Q938Q/windleyofente-20">How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism by Cory Doctorow</a> <p>For years, we've been hearing about the ills of surveillance capitalism --- the business of extracting, collecting, and selling vast reams of user data that exploded with the rise of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. But what if everything we've been hearing is wrong? What if surveillance capitalism is not some rogue capitalism or a wrong turn taken by some misguided corporations? What if the system is working exactly as intended—and the only hope of restoring an open web is to take the fight directly to the system itself? </p><p></p></blockquote>

<p>
    Zuboff's conclusion that surveillance capitalism is a new "rogue" form of capitalism leaves us with little recourse but to regulate the ills that surveillance capitalists bring about. Not unreasonably, Zuboff's prescription for this predicament is to protect, trust, and utilize democratic processes—to collectively push back. To not let our cynicism dissuade us or cause us to lose hope.
</p>

<p>
    But, merely regulating a big monopoly only further entrenches it, locking the world into the status quo. If we want to destroy surveillance capitalism, Cory argues, we have to break it up and decentralize, making "big tech small again." Ultimately, the choice is to fix Big Tech or fix the internet. Cory argues for the second and I'm on board.
</p>

<p>
    Fixing the internet is hard, but not impossible. Cory references Lawrence Lessig, saying "our lives are regulated by four forces: law (what's legal), code (what's technologically possible), norms (what's socially acceptable), and markets (what's profitable)." We can bring all four to bear on this problem.
</p>

<p>
    Antitrust, post Reagan, has lost its teeth and come to focus only on consumer harm instead of other anti-competitive behaviors like buying up large rivals and new competitors. If the problem with "Big Tech" is that it is "big" then restructuring antitrust laws to break up large tech companies is a critical tool.
</p>

<p>
    Many will fear that breaking up big tech will diminish the fruits of the digital world we've come to enjoy, and even rely on. Centralization, they will say, is the only way to safely and efficiently build messaging platforms, app stores, social networks, and other features of Web 2.0 that we've come to enjoy.
</p>

<p>
    This is where Lessig's other three forces come into play. As <a>I've written, in numerous ways</a>, the means exist to decentralize most of the centralized Web 2.0 platforms (i.e. it's "technologically possible" in Lessig's words). The internet itself and more recent decentralized networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum show that large, decentralized systems can achieve legitimacy to accomplish global goals.
</p>

<p>
    Beyond tech, I have hope that norms are changing. People are more aware and wary of the dangers of surveillance and the need for better online privacy. Collecting data is becoming less socially acceptable. Security breeches affect more and more people, waking them up to the problem of companies collecting and holding large caches of personal data. And competitors to big tech with decentralized solutions are always emerging. A little antitrust help could be what it takes to make them viable.
</p>

<p>
    There's no single act that's going to change the way things work now. Getting Congress to act on antitrust requires a big shift in norms. Changing norms requires new technical possibilities, new applications, and, frankly, more privacy problems. Change is predicated on a web of interrelated actions that we must iterate over.
</p>

<p>
    Returning to Zuboff's opening question: "Can the digital future be our home?" Fixing Big Tech just leaves us where we're at, with slightly fewer problems. It's a dead end road that doesn't lead to a digital home. But fixing the internet, redecentralizing it, promises a future where we can live authentic digital lives that compliment our physical lives. I choose to fight for that future.

  <p>Summary:      How does a functioning credential ecosystem get started? This post goes deep on Manny Nijjar’s work to create a program for using digital staff passports in the sprawling UK NHS bureaucracy.</p>

<p>
    Dr Manny Nijjar is an infectious disease doctor with Whipps Cross Hospital in the UK. He’s also an innovator who quickly saw how verifiable credentials could be applied to health care. I first met Manny at the launch of Sovrin Foundation in London in September 2016. He’s been working to bring this vision to life with his company Truu, ever since.
</p>


    
	SSI For Healthcare: Lessons from the NHS Frontline


<p>
    In this video, Manny discusses why he became interested in digital credentials. He also speaks to the influence medical ethics has had on his journey. In 2015, he was training to become an infectious disease specialist. Manny was the most senior clinician on site in the evenings, in charge of about 500 beds.
</p>

<p>
    Manny kept getting called by, and about, a temporary agency doctor every night. Manny and other medical staff had questions about this doctor’s skills, qualifications, and the decisions he was making. But there were shortages and the hospital needed to fill the gap. Manny was so discouraged by seeing an unqualified physician slip through the cracks, that he was about to quit his career, but instead he determined to do something about it.
</p>

<p>
    Serendipitously, Manny came across self-sovereign identity (SSI) at the same time and, as I said, spoke at the launch of Sovrin Foundation. Over the next several years, Manny and his partners worked to create an SSI solution that the National Health Service in the UK could use to instantly verify the identity and skills of temporary and permanent clinical staff. There were three primary problems that this solves:
</p>
 
     Patient Safety - Verifying the identity and skills of temporary and permanent clinical staff. 
     Burden on Clinical Staff - Admin time for repeated identity and pre-employment checks. 
     Organizational Risk and Operational Inefficiencies - Failure of manual checks. Time and cost to onboard healthcare staff. 
 

<p>
    Manny’s first thought had been to use a traditional, administrative scheme using usernames and passwords. But he saw the problems with that. He realized a digital credential was a better answer. And his journey into self-sovereign identity commenced.
</p>

	Manny's paper credentials (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Over the past five years, Manny and his team at Truu have worked with clinicians, various parts of the NHS, employers, HR departments, and <a href="https://www.medecho.com/what-is-a-locum-agency/">locum agencies</a> to understand their needs and build a solution that fits.
</p>

<p>
    In 2019, Truu conducted a pilot with the NHS where the General Medical Council (GMC) issued “license to practice” credentials to SSI wallets controlled by medical staff. Medical staff could present that credential to Blackpool Teaching Hospitals. The hospital, in turn, issued a “sign in” credential to the staff member who could then use it to log into clinical systems at the hospital.
</p>

	Digital Credentials for People and Organizations (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic increased the pressure on the NHS, making the need to easily move staff between facilities acute. Truu worked with NHS to use this critical moment to shift to digital credentials and to do it in the right way. Truu’s early work, including the pilot, positioned the idea so that it could be quickly adopted when it was needed most. Digital credentialing in healthcare simplifies onboarding for providers, enables the secure expansion of telehealth services, and enhances information exchange—providing a path to interoperability for healthcare data.
</p>

<p>
    The National Health Service in the UK has a <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">program to issue staff passports to medical personnel</a>, confirming their qualifications and ability to work. NHS staff passports are based on verifiable credentials. Eighty-four NHS organizations are participating to date.
</p>


	<a></a>

<p>
    The work that Manny, his team at Truu, and <a href="https://www.truu.id/">partners</a> like <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> have done has already had a big impact. The UK Department of Health and Social Care recognized the importance of the program, promising to expand the use of staff passports in their Busting Bureaucracy report. They said:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>NHSE/I, NHSX and HEE are working to provide multiple staff groups with access to digital staff passports in line with People Plan commitments to improve workforce agility and to support staff training and development.</p>
     
         Junior doctors, who frequently rotate to different healthcare providers, are being prioritized and the ambition is that they will have access to staff passports in 2021/22. The passports will hold digital credentials representing their skills, competencies and occupational health checks. 
         Other target groups include specialists such as maternity and stroke care staff who often need to be rapidly deployed to a neighboring hospital or care home. The use of digital staff passports will save agency fees and release time for care. 
     
</blockquote>

<p>
    Medical staff passports are catching on in the UK where they are solving real problems that ultimately impact patient care, staff fatigue, and patient access and privacy. The journey hasn’t been short, but the NHS Staff Passport program is illustrative of a successful credential ecosystem.

  <p>Matching locations for Vaccinate The States, fun with GeoJSON and more improvements to Django SQL Dashboard.</p>
 Velma 
<p>I described <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Apr/26/vaccinate-the-states/">a few weeks ago</a> part of the process we've been using to build <a href="https://www.vaccinatethestates.com/">Vaccinate The States</a> - a map of every COVID vaccine location in the USA (now at just over 70,000 markers and counting).</p>
<p>Short version: we have scrapers and data ingesters for a whole bunch of different sources (see the <a href="https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vaccine-feed-ingest">vaccine-feed-ingest</a> repository).</p>
<p>Part of the challenge here is how to deal with duplicates - with multiple sources of data, chances are high that the same location will show up in more than on of our input feeds.</p>
<p>So in the past weeks we've been building a new tool code-named Velma to help handle this. It shows our volunteers a freshly scraped location and asks them to either match it to one of our existing locations (based on automated suggestions) or use it to create a brand new location in our database.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I've been working exclusively on the backend APIs for Velma: APIs that return new scraped data and accept and process the human matching decisions from our volunteers.</p>
<p>This week we've been expanding Velma to also cover merging potential duplicate locations within our existing corpus, so I've been building out the APIs for that effort as well.</p>
<p>I've also been working on new export code for making our entire set of locations available to partners and interested outside developers. We hope to launch that fully in the next few days.</p>
 geojson-to-sqlite 
<p>One of the export formats we are working with is GeoJSON. I have a tool called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/geojson-to-sqlite">geojson-to-sqlite</a> which I released last year: this week I released an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/geojson-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.3">updated version</a> with the ability to create SpatiaLite indexes and a <code>--nl</code> option for consuming newline-delimited GeoJSON, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/geojson-to-sqlite/pull/13">contributed by Chris Amico</a>.</p>
<p>I've also been experimenting with SpatiaLite's KNN mechanism using <code>geojson-to-sqlite</code> to load in data - here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/spatialite/knn">a TIL</a> showing how to use those tools together.</p>
 Django SQL Dashboard 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/May/10/django-sql-dashboard/">released the first non-alpha version</a> of this last week and it's started to gain some traction: I've heard from a few people who are trying it out on their projects and it seems to work, so that's good!</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/releases/tag/0.14">version 0.14</a> yesterday with a bunch of fixes based on feedback from users, plus a security fix that closes a hole where users without the <code>execute_sql</code> permission but with access to the Django Admin could modify the SQL in saved dashboards and hence execute their own custom queries.</p>
<p>I also made a bunch of improvements to the documentation, including adding screenshots and demo links <a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/en/latest/widgets.html">to the widgets page</a>.</p>

<p>This article shows how to secure and use different APIs in an ASP.NET Core API which support OAuth access tokens from multiple identity providers. Access tokens from Azure AD and from Auth0 can be be used to access data from the service. Each API only supports a specific token from the specific identity provider. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the access token authorization for the Azure AD tokens and the default authorization is used to support the Auth0 access tokens.</p>



<p>Code:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel">https://github.com/damienbod/SeparatingApisPerSecurityLevel</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/04/19/securing-multiple-auth0-apis-in-asp-net-core-using-oauth-bearer-tokens/">Securing multiple Auth0 APIs in ASP.NET Core using OAuth Bearer&nbsp;tokens</a>  Securing OAuth Bearer tokens from multiple Identity Providers in an ASP.NET Core API  



<p>Setup</p>



<p>An API ASP.NET Core application is created to implement the multiple APIs and accept access tokens created by Auth0 and Azure AD. The access tokens need to be validated and should only work for the intended purpose for which the access token was created. The Azure AD API is used by an ASP.NET Core Razor page application which requests an user access token with the correct scope to access the API. Two Azure AD App registrations are used to define the Azure AD setup. The Auth0 application is implemented using a Blazor server hosted application and accesses the two Auth0 APIs, See the pervious post for details.</p>







<p>To support the multiple identity providers, multiple schemes are used. The Auth0 APIs use the default scheme definition for JWT Bearer tokens and the Azure AD uses a custom named scheme. It does not matter which scheme is used for which as long as the correct scheme is defined on the controller securing the API. The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication method takes the scheme and the configuration name as a optional parameter. The Azure AD configuration is defined like any standard Azure AD API in ASP.NET Core.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// Adds Microsoft Identity platform (AAD v2.0) 
	// support to protect this Api
	services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
		Configuration, "AzureAd", "myADscheme");

	// Auth0 API configuration=&gt; default scheme
	services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
	{
		options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
		options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
	{
		options.Authority = "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
		options.Audience = "https://auth0-api1";
	});

	services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

	// authorization definitions for the multiple Auth0 tokens
	services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
	{
		policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "AScjLo16UadTQRIt2Zm1xLHVaEaE1feA");
		});

		policies.AddPolicy("p-service-api-auth0", p =&gt;
		{
			// Validate id of application for which the token was created
			p.RequireClaim("azp", "naWWz6gdxtbQ68Hd2oAehABmmGM9m1zJ");
			p.RequireClaim("gty", "client-credentials");
		});
	});

	services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
	{
		var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
			.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
			.Build();
		options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
	});
}
  


<p>The Configure method uses the UseAuthentication method to add the middleware for the APIs.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, 
	IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The AzureADUserOneController class is used to implement the API for the Azure AD access tokens. The AuthorizeForScopes attribute from Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to validate the Azure AD App registration access token and define the scheme required for the validation. The scope name must match the Azure App registration definition.</p>


  using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace MyApi.Controllers
{
    [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = new string[] { "api://72286b8d-5010-4632-9cea-e69e565a5517/user_impersonation" }, 
        AuthenticationScheme = "myADscheme")]
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class AzureADUserOneController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; _logger;

        public AzureADUserOneController(ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
        {
            return new List&lt;string&gt; { "AzureADUser one data" };
        }
    }
}

  


<p>The UserOneController implements the Auth0 user access token API. Since the default scheme is used, no scheme definition is required. The authorization policy is used to secure the API which validates the scope and the claims for this API.</p>


  using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

namespace MyApi.Controllers
{
    [Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; _logger;

        public UserOneController(ILogger&lt;UserOneController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
        {
            return new List&lt;string&gt; { "user one data" };
        }
    }
}

  


<p>When the API application is started the APIs can be used and a swagger UI implemented using Swashbuckle was created to display the different APIs. Each API will only work with the correct access token. The different UIs can use the APIs and data is returned.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you have to consent to terms required by the websites of the world, rather than the other way around? Or why you have no record of what you have accepted or agreed to?</p>
<p>Blame the cookie.</p>
<p>Have you wondered why you have no more privacy on the Web than what other parties grant you (<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-your-privacy-hands-others-alone-you-dont-have-any">which is none at all</a>), and that you can only opt in or out of choices that others provide—while the only controls you have over your privacy are to skulk around like a criminal (thank you, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jxdwIkFdj8">Edward Snowden and Russell Brand</a>, for that analogy) or to stay offline completely?</p>
<p>Blame the cookie.</p>
<p>And have you paused to wonder why Europe’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>&nbsp;regards you as a mere “data subject” while assuming that the only parties qualified to be “data controllers” and “data processors” are the sites and services of the world, leaving you with little more agency than those sites and services allow, or provide you?</p>
<p>Blame the cookie.</p>
<p>Or why California’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>&nbsp;regards you as a mere “consumer” (not a producer, much less a complete human being), and only gives you the right to ask the sites and services of the world to give back data they have gathered about you, or not to “sell” that personal data, whatever the hell that means?</p>
<p>Blame the cookie.</p>
<p>There are more examples, but you get the point: this situation has become so established that it’s hard to imagine any other way for the Web to operate.</p>
<p>Now here’s another point:&nbsp;it didn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web that Tim Berners-Lee invented didn’t have cookies. It also didn’t have websites. It had pages one could publish or read, at any distance across the Internet.</p>
<p>This original Web was simple and peer-to-peer. It was meant to be&nbsp;personal as well, meaning an individual could publish with a server or read with a browser. One could also write pages easily with an HTML editor, which was also easy to invent and deploy.</p>
<p>It should help to recall that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server#:~:text=The%20Apache%20HTTP%20Server%2C%20colloquially%20called%20Apache%20%28,the%20auspices%20of%20the%20Apache%20Software%20Foundation%20.">Apache</a> Web server, which has published most of the world’s Web pages across most the time the Web has been around, was meant originally to work as a personal server. That’s because the original design assumption was that anyone, from individuals to large enterprises, could have a server of their own, and publish whatever they wanted on it. The same went for people reading pages on the Web.</p>
<p>Back in the 90s my own website,&nbsp;<a href="http://searls.com">searls.com</a>, ran on a box under my desk. It could do that because, even though my connection was just dial-up speed, it was on full time over its own static IP address, which I easily rented from my ISP. In fact, that I had sixteen of those addresses, so I could operate another server in my office for storing and transferring articles and columns I wrote to&nbsp;<a href="http://linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a>. Every night a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> utility would push what I wrote to the magazine itself. Both servers ran Apache. And none of this was especially geeky. (I’m not a programmer and the only code I know is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse</a>.)</p>
<p>My point here is that the Web back then was still peer-to-peer and welcoming to individuals who wished to operate at full agency. It even stayed that way through the Age of Blogs in the early ’00s.</p>
<p>But gradually a poison disabled personal agency. That poison was the cookie.</p>
<p>Technically a cookie is a token—a string of text—left by one computer program with another, to help the two remember each other. These are used for many purposes in computing.</p>
<p>But computing for the Web got a special kind of cookie called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">HTTP cookie</a>. This, Wikipedia says (at that link)</p>
<blockquote><p>…is a small piece of&nbsp;<a title="Data (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">data</a>&nbsp;stored on the&nbsp;<a title="User (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)">user</a>‘s computer by the&nbsp;<a title="Web browser" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<a title="Browsing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing">browsing</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a title="Website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a>. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember&nbsp;<a title="Program state" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_state">stateful</a>&nbsp;information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an&nbsp;<a title="Online shopping" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping">online store</a>) or to record the user’s browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons,&nbsp;<a title="Access control" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control">logging in</a>, or recording which&nbsp;<a title="Web browsing history" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsing_history">pages were visited in the past</a>). They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into&nbsp;<a title="Form (HTML)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_(HTML)">form fields</a>, such as names, addresses,&nbsp;<a title="Password" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">passwords</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Payment card number" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number">payment card numbers</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Cookies perform essential functions in the modern&nbsp;<a title="World Wide Web" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">web</a>. Perhaps most importantly,&nbsp;authentication cookies&nbsp;are the most common method used by&nbsp;<a title="Web server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a>&nbsp;to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which&nbsp;<a title="Account verification" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Account_verification">account</a>&nbsp;they are logged in with.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, however, was not the original idea, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Montulli">Lou Montulli</a>&nbsp;came up with in 1994. Lou’s idea was just for a server to remember the last&nbsp;state&nbsp;of a browser’s interaction with it. But that one move—a server putting a cookie inside every visiting browser—crossed a privacy threshold: a personal boundary that should have been clear from the start but was not.</p>
<p>Once that boundary was crossed, and the number and variety of cookies increased, a snowball started rolling, and whatever chance we had to protect our privacy behind that boundary, was lost.</p>
<p>Today that snowball is so large that nearly all&nbsp;personal agency on the Web happens within the separate silos of every website, and compromised by whatever countless cookies and other tracking methods are used to keep track of, and to follow, the individual.</p>
<p>This is why most of the great stuff you can do on the Web is by grace of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, WordPress and countless others, including those third parties.</p>
<p>Bruce Schneier calls this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/feudal_sec.html">a feudal system</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of us have pledged our allegiance to Google: We have Gmail accounts, we use Google Calendar and Google Docs, and we have Android phones. Others have pledged allegiance to Apple: We have Macintosh laptops, iPhones, and iPads; and we let iCloud automatically synchronize and back up everything. Still others of us let Microsoft do it all. Or we buy our music and e-books from Amazon, which keeps records of what we own and allows downloading to a Kindle, computer, or phone. Some of us have pretty much abandoned e-mail altogether … for Facebook.</p>
<p>These vendors are becoming our feudal lords, and we are becoming their vassals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce wrote that in 2012, about the time we invested hope in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was designed as a polite request one could turn on in a browser, and servers could obey.</p>
<p>Alas, the tracking-based online advertising business and its dependents in publishing dismissed Do Not Track with contempt.</p>
<p>Starting in 2013, we serfs fought back, by the hundreds of millions, blocking ads and tracking:&nbsp;<a href="http://j.mp/bcott">the biggest boycott in world history</a>. This, however, did nothing to stop what&nbsp;<a href="http://shoshanazuboff.com/">Shoshana Zuboff</a>&nbsp;calls&nbsp;<a href="https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/shoshana-zuboff/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/9781610395694/">Surveillance Capitalism</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/BrettFrischmann">Brett Frischmann</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://eselinger.org/">Evan Selinger</a>&nbsp;call&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Re-Engineering-Humanity-Brett-Frischmann/dp/1107147093/">Re-engineering Humanity</a>.</p>
<p>Today our poisoned minds can hardly imagine having native capacities of our own that can operate at scale across all the world’s websites and services. To have that ability would also be at odds with the methods and imperatives of personally targeted advertising, which requires cookies and other tracking methods. One of those imperatives is making money: $Trillions of it.</p>
<p>The business itself (aka&nbsp;adtech)&nbsp;is extremely complex and deeply corrupt: filled with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2020/08/14/my-review-of-ad-fraud-detection-technology-companies/">fraud</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/human-formerly-white-ops-together-with-newly-formed-human-collective-and-industry-leaders-google-roku-announces-discovery-and-disruption-of-pareto-ctv-botnet-1030331049">botnets</a> and <a href="https://mediatrust.com/blog/millions-users-affected-third-party-digital-malware-attack">malware</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/augustinefou/2021/05/02/you-cant-show-the-murky-programmatic-supply-chain-in-a-waterfall-chart/?sh=1fc96de518c6">Most of the money spent on adtech also goes to intermediaries</a> and not to the media you (as they like to say) consume. It’s a freaking fecosystem, and&nbsp;every participant’s dependence on it is extreme.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="https://www.vizio.com/en/shop/tv">Vizio TVs</a>. As Samuel Axon puts it in Ars Technica,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/vizio-tv-buyers-are-becoming-the-product-vizio-sells-not-just-its-customers/">Vizio TV buyers are becoming the product Vizio sells, not just its customers Vizio’s ads, streaming, and data business grew 133 percent year over year</a>.</p>
<p>Without cookies and the cookie-like trackers by which Vizio and its third parties can target customers directly, that business wouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>As a measure of how far this poisoning has gone, dig this:&nbsp;<a href="https://fouanalytics.com/">FouAnalytics</a>‘ <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/">PageXray</a> <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/arstechnica.com%2Fgadgets%2F2021%2F05%2Fvizio-tv-buyers-are-becoming-the-product-vizio-sells-not-just-its-customers">says</a>&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ars Technica story above comes to your browser with all this spyware you don’t ask for or expect when you click on that link:</p>
<blockquote>
 Adserver Requests:&nbsp;786 
 Tracking Requests:&nbsp;532 
 Other Requests:&nbsp;112 
</blockquote>
<p>I’m also betting that nobody reporting for a <a href="https://www.condenast.com/">Condé Nast</a> publication will touch that third rail, which I have been <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">challenging journalists to do</a>&nbsp;in 139 posts, essays, columns and articles, starting in 2008.</p>
<p>(Please prove me wrong,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/vizio-tv-buyers-are-becoming-the-product-vizio-sells-not-just-its-customers/">@SamuelAxon</a>—or any reporter other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad_Manjoo">Farhad Manjoo</a>, who so far is the only journalist from a major publication I know to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">bitten the robotic hand that feeds them</a>. I also note that the hand in his case is The New York Times‘, and that it has <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/nytimes.com">backed off a great deal</a> in the amount of tracking it does. Hats off for that.)</p>
<p>At this stage of the Web’s moral devolution, it is nearly impossible to think outside the cookie-based fecosystem. If it was, we would get back the agency we lost, and the regulations we’re writing would respect and encourage that agency as well.</p>
<p>But that’s not happening, in spite of all the positive privacy moves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://brave.com/learn/best-private-browser/">Brave</a>, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/04/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection-2-0-blocking-redirect-trackers-by-default/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/why-its-tough-to-get-help-opting-out-of-data-sharing/">Consumer Reports</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy">EFF</a> and others are making.</p>
<p>My hat’s off to all of them, but let’s face it: the poisoning is too far advanced. After fighting it for more than 22 years (dating from publishing <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> in 1999), I’m moving on.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;<a href="https://customercommons.org/a-new-way/">here</a>.</p>

 My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco. 

 Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message

<p>My mother Betty passed away Friday night and her service is Saturday at 2pm at the Kingwood Funeral Home.  This is one of my favorite pictures of her with her mother and my brother David in downtown San Francisco.</p>

<p>Growing up, I always remember that there was a set of golf clubs in the garage but it seemed like they were never used.  Luckily, this week, I listened to a Christmas audio message from 1971 that my parents had sent to my grandparents.  My mom said that the day before, Baxter had taken her to the golf course at Heather Farm and they golfed nine holes.  She said on the first hole, she amused several bystanders trying to get out of the sand trap and they decided to quit keeping score from there.  She said she learned golf was not her sport and would find something else.  She did find tennis.  I was glad to play that sport with her and the family.</p>

    Async functions require an event loop to run. Flask, as a WSGI application, uses one worker to handle one request/response cycle.

<p>The Net Uptime Monitor</p>



<p><br>What it does…</p>



<p><br>Is your internet connection unreliable? You’ve probably called your internet provider’s support line and maybe they were able to help you, maybe they even sent out a tech to look at it. But all too often the response is “Well, it’s working fine now!”</p>



<p><br>The Net Uptime Monitor alerts you to failures in your internet connection and documents the exact time and length of those failures. This failure log will help your provider troubleshoot the problem – after it helps you convince them it’s not your imagination! Net Uptime Monitor is designed to be as simple as possible and accomplish this one purpose accurately and thoroughly with the least effort from you.</p>



<p><br>How it works…</p>



<p><br>Net Uptime Monitor (NUM) uses the “Ping” command to test the response from three public servers operated by Google, Level 3, and OpenDNS. (See “What’s a Ping?” below for an explanation.) Each server is pinged in turn at an interval that you can set – normally five seconds. By default, NUM waits 200 milliseconds (2/10 of a second) for the server to respond – at least 3 times as long as a typical broadband internet connection should take.</p>



<p><br>NUM pings one server at a time; if the server responds, NUM waits the test interval, then pings the next server. If the server doesn’t respond, NUM immediately tries the next server, then the next. If any of the servers respond, then your connection must be working. Only when all three servers fail to respond does NUM determine that your connection is down.</p>



<p><br>By using three servers, NUM ensures that the problem isn’t just with the server or with some connection on the way to that server, or that the server isn’t momentarily slow or congested.</p>



<p><br>NUM can detect failures as short as a couple of seconds in length, but you can decide how long a failure must be before it really counts. A very short failure of a second or so is not likely to affect your use of the net and isn’t of any real concern. You can set how long a failure must be before NUM alerts you to it and records the failure in its failure log.</p>



<p><br>Connection is up, no previous failures…</p>



<p>Connection is down, one previous failure…</p>



<p>The display shows the names and IP addresses of each server. The indicator “light” flashes yellow when the ping is sent and shows green for a successful response. The response time of the last ping is shown. When the response time exceeds the time set for “Wait for Ping Response”, the indicator turns red to show no response from that server.</p>



<p><br>If your connection fails, the current fail length is displayed in red. When the length of the failure exceeds your setting for “Log Failure If Longer Than”, NUM plays an alert sound and writes the failure information into its log.</p>



<p><br>The display also shows the monitored time (how long the monitor has been running), the time since the last logged failure (up time), the start time and length of the last logged failure, and the total count of logged failures since NUM was started. The current settings for the test interval and the minimum failure length to be logged are shown at the bottom of the display.</p>



<p><br>Click the minimize button on the NUM window to hide the display. NUM disappears into your system tray in the “notifications area”. The NUM icon is shown in the notification – you can hover over the icon to see the current time since the last failure (“Up Time”) or click the icon to restore the display. In the Settings, you can choose to have a “failure alert” sound play, and/or have the NUM window “pop up”, if a connection failure longer than your minimum setting occurs.</p>



<p><br>The Log</p>



<p><br>NUM keeps a log of results in a text file. You can view the current log at any time by clicking the “View Log” button. The log is displayed in a separate window. NUM will continue to update the log even while you are viewing it.<br>Because the log is a plain text file, you can open it outside of the NUM program. It will open in Notepad or your default text editor, so you can easily edit or print the log.</p>



<p><br>The log records the start and end time of the monitoring and each failure start time and length. A summary shows the total monitoring time, failure count, total down time, percentage of down time, and the minimum, maximum, and average failure lengths. Here’s an example:</p>



<p>Net Uptime Monitor Failure Log (NetUptimeMonitor.com)<br>Licensed to Example User</p>



<p>=======================================</p>



<p>8/17/2015 8:44:28 AM Log Start</p>



<p>Failure Start Length<br>8/17/2015 1:44:25 PM 0:00:44<br>8/17/2015 1:49:53 PM 0:00:36</p>



<p>8/17/2015 1:52:39 PM 0:01:59</p>



<p>8/18/2015 12:13:17 AM Log End<br>Monitor Duration 15:28:46<br>Failure Summary:<br>Count 3<br>Total Downtime 0:03:20<br>% Downtime 0.36<br>Minimum Length 0:00:36<br>Maximum Length 0:01:59</p>



<p>Average Length 0:01:06</p>



<p>The example shows date and time in US English format; your log will use the format for your region.<br>The log files are saved in a folder of your choice; the default is your Documents folder. You can choose a different folder in the Settings.</p>



<p><br>Also in the Settings, there are two options for the log file:<br>1) New File Each Run<br>A new file is created each time NUM starts. Each log file is named with the date and time NUM was started so that they will appear in your directory in chronological order. The file name is in the form of “NetUptime 20110805 134243.txt”. In this example, the date is August 10, 2015 – 20150810 – and the time is 1:42:43 PM – 134243.<br>2) Add to Existing File<br>Each new log is added to the same single file. The file name is always NetUptime.txt. As long as that file exists in the folder where you have chosen to save the log file, NUM will keep adding to it. If the file doesn’t exist, i.e. it’s been deleted, moved, or renamed, NUM will start a new file.</p>



<p><br>The Settings</p>



<p>Click the “Change Settings” button on the NUM display to open the Settings window. There are several settings available:</p>



<p><br>Startup Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Start when Windows Starts? – Check the box and NUM will automatically start when your computer starts. Uncheck the box and you can start NUM when you want by clicking its desktop icon. The default on installation is checked – NUM starts automatically.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – Check the box and NUM will be minimized in the system tray automatically when it starts. The default on installation is unchecked – NUM starts with the main form displayed.<br>Test Settings…<br>· Test Interval – how many seconds between ping tests when the servers are responding. Five seconds is the default. It is possible that NUM will miss a failure that is shorter than the time between tests, so if your connection has very frequent failures of just a few seconds you might choose a shorter test interval. If you don’t have many failures, you may want to test less often. Most connection problems result in less frequent but longer failures, so five seconds is a good choice for most users.<br>· Wait for Ping Response – the length of time NUM waits for a response after sending a ping. The default setting of 200 milliseconds is recommended for normal situations. If you have a slower internet connection, such as a dialup or mobile connection, or are in a remote area where response is typically slow, you can set the wait time for up to 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds). To help you find the best setting for your situation, set the wait time to 1500 milliseconds and observe the ping response times NUM displays when your connection is working normally. Set the wait time to about 1.5 times the typical ping response times you see for efficient detection of outages.<br>· Change Target Servers – click to open the Target Servers window.</p>



<p>You can edit the IP Address and Name of any of the three servers. Click the Test button to try that server, verifying that it responds and checking the response time.</p>



<p><br>The default target servers (Google, Level 3, OpenDNS) were selected for their performance and very high reliability. You should only use a different server if you find that one of these servers does not respond reliably in your particular situation. Click “Restore Defaults” to reset the Target Servers to their original values. Changes to the Target Servers take effect the next time the program starts.</p>



<p><br>Alert and Log Settings…</p>



<p><br>· Pop Up on Failure? – Check the box and the NUM form will pop up from the system tray when there is a failure. Uncheck the box and NUM will continue to log and alert but it will stay minimized during a failure. The default on installation is checked – if NUM is minimized to the system tray, the main NUM form will be displayed when a failure is logged.<br>· Alert and Log Failure If Longer Than – the minimum failure length that will be counted, both for the log and the alert of a failure. Five seconds is the default setting.<br>· Log File Location – the folder where the logs will be stored. Click the “Select Folder” button to browse to the folder you want. The log for the current run of NUM is already started, so a change in this setting will not take effect until the next time you run NUM.<br>· Log File Option – New File Each Run (the default) or Add to Existing File. See previous section “The Log” for a more detailed explanation.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – choose the sound NUM makes when a failure is counted. The sound plays when you choose its button so you can preview each one. Choose “None” to silence the alert. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system. The default on installation is the “Short” sound.<br>· Play Reconnect Sound – NUM can play a sound when your internet reconnects after a failure. Choose “None” to silence the reconnect sound. Choose “Custom” and click the Select File button to use any .WAV sound file on your system.</p>



<p><br>Combine Settings for “Invisible” Operation</p>



<p><br>NUM can do its job without showing itself or alerting the user to its operation in any way. Choose these settings:<br>· Start when Windows Starts? – checked.<br>· Start Minimized in Tray? – checked.<br>· Pop Up On Failure – unchecked.<br>· Choose Failure Alert Sound – None.<br>· Choose Reconnect Sound – None.<br>With this combination of settings, the user need never be aware of NUM. This is useful in a support situation where you are installing NUM on a computer you aren’t personally using.</p>



<p><br>What’s a Ping?</p>



<p><br>“Ping” is a command available on all kinds of computers that tests whether another computer on the network will respond to your computer. It’s named after the sound of submarine sonar systems – they send out a “ping” sound which bounces off their target and they listen for that echo, locating their target. The internet “ping” works in a similar way. You name your target, an internet server, and “ping” it. The ping command and response looks like this (in a DOS command window):</p>



<p><br>C:\ ping google.com</p>



<p>Pinging google.com [74.125.224.84] with 32 bytes of data:<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=30ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54<br>Reply from 74.125.224.84: bytes=32 time=31ms TTL=54</p>



<p>Ping statistics for 74.125.224.84:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),<br>Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:<br>Minimum = 30ms, Maximum = 31ms, Average = 30ms</p>



<p>A ping command actually generates four requests and the server replies four times. Each response is timed in thousandths of a second (ms = milliseconds). Here we see that the server at google.com responded in about 31/1000 or 3/100 of a second. The internet is fast! – when everything’s working.</p>



<p><br>Licensing</p>



<p><br>A license for Net Uptime Monitor removes the time limits from the trial version and lets you use the full program on one computer. To purchase a license or register your license, just click “Trial Version – Click to Register or Purchase License” at the bottom of the NUM main form. If you have your license, enter the License Key code you’ve received and click Register. If you need a license, click Purchase a License to visit our web site and make your purchase.<br>If you have already registered your copy of NUM, your name and email are shown on the main form. Click the License Info button to see your license key.</p>



<p><br>Moving to a New Computer or Installing a New Operating System</p>



<p><br>You must unregister your license before you replace your computer or install a new version of Windows. This will make your license key available again to use on your new system. Just click License Info, click Print This Form to make sure you’ll have the license key, then click Unregister License. The program will go back to Trial mode. You can then reuse your license key to register NUM on any computer.</p>

  <p>Summary:      I’ve been a beekeeper for many years. I love the honey, but I love watching the bees even more. They are a fascinating example of a natural, decentralized system.</p>


<p>
    I installed a package of bees in a hive over the weekend. You buy bees in packages that contain 15-20 thousand bees and a queen. The queen is in a cage so she is easy to find. Queens give off a pheromone that attracts the other bees in the hive. The queen is the secret to creating legitimacy for the hive (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/04/legitimacy_and_decentralized_systems.shtml">Legitimacy and Decentralized Systems</a> for more on legitimacy). If the queen is in the new hive, chances are the other bees will see it as their legitimate home and stick around.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Queen in a cage (click to enlarge)


<p>
    I placed queen cage in the hive using a rubber band to fix the cage on one of the frames that the bees make honeycomb on. I replaced the cork in the cage with a candy stopper. The bees eat through the candy over the course of a few days and free the queen. Hopefully, by that time, the hive is established and the bees stick around.
</p>

<p>
    After placing the queen cage in the hive, you just dump the bees out on top of the frames. I love this part because thousands of bees are flying everywhere trying to make sense of what just happened. But over the course of an hour or two, the hive coalesces on the queen and most of the bees are inside, getting adjusted to their new home.
</p>

	  <a></a>
	  About an hour after the bees get their new home, they're out on the porch, fanning and taking orientation flights. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Besides providing a basis for hive legitimacy, the queen is also the sole reproductive individual, responsible for laying every egg that will be raised in the hive. This is a big job. During the summer, she will lay about 2000 eggs per day and the hive will swell to multiple tens of thousands of bees. But beyond this, the queen’s role is limited. She doesn’t direct the actions of the members of the hive. No one does.
</p>

<a></a>
 Thermoregulation 
<p>
    So, how does the hive function without central direction? Thermoregulation provides an example. Despite the fact that bees themselves are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeothermy">homeothermic</a>, the hive is. The bees manage to keep the hive at 93-94°F (34°C) regardless of the outside air temperature.
</p>

<p>
    How do the bees do that? The straightforward answer is that some bees go to the entrance of the hive and fan air to increase circulation when the internal temperature gets too high. When it gets too low, bees cluster in the center and generate heat by shivering.
</p>

<p>
    The more interesting question is “how do the bees know to do that?” All the bees have similar genetic programming (algorithmic governance). But the tasks that they’re inclined to do depend on their age. The youngest workers clean cells, then move onto nursing functions, mortuary activities, guarding the hive, and finally, in the last weeks of their lives, to foraging for water, nectar, and pollen.
</p>

<p>
    Bees have a genetic threshold for carrying out these tasks. The threshold changes as they age. A young bee has a very high threshold for foraging that decreases over her life. Further, these thresholds vary by <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patriline">patriline</a> (even though every bee in the hive has the same mother, there are many fathers), providing diversity.
</p>

<p>
    So as the temperature in the hive climbs, a few bees go down to the hive entrance and fan. As it gets hotter, even more bees will take up the task, depending on their internal threshold. Their genetic programming, combined with the diversity in their thresholds, promotes an even response to temperature swings that could damage the hive. You can read more about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/08/decentralized_systems_thermoregulation_in_bee_hives.shtml">hive thermoregulation in an earlier blog post</a> I wrote on the topic.
</p>

<a></a>
 Swarming and Protecting Against Byzantine Failure 

<p>
    An even more interesting phenomenon is how bees decide to swarm. Because the hive is a super organism, the queen’s efforts to reproduce don’t result in a new hive unless there’s a swarm. Swarming is how new hives are created.
</p>

<p>
    Bees swarm in response to stresses like insufficient food supply, too little space, and so on. But no one really knows how a hive decides it’s time to swarm. In preparation for a swarm, the hive starts to raise new queens. Whether an egg grows into a worker, drone, or queen is determined by how the larva is fed by nurse bees. At some point the bees collectively determine to swarm and the queen produces a pheromone that broadcasts that decision.
</p>

<p>
    The swarm consists of the current queen (and her powerful pheromones), some of the worker bees, and a portion of the honey stores. The swarm leaves the hive and the remaining bees raise the new queen and carry on. The swarm flies a short distance and settles down on some convenient structure to decide where to make their permanent home. Again the swarm centers on the queen. This is where the fun starts.
</p>

<p>
    Thomas Seeley of Cornell has been studying swarms for his entire career. In the following video he describes how bees use collective decision making to choose their new home.
</p>

<p>
    There are several interesting features in this process. First, Seeley has determined that bees don’t just make a good decision, but the best possible decision. I think that’s amazing. Several hundred bees leave the swarm to search for a new home and participate in a debate to choose one of the available sites and settle on the best choice.
</p>

<p>
    This is a process that is potentially subject to byzantine failure. Not that the bees are malicious, in fact they’re programmed to accurately represent their findings. But they can report faulty information based on their judgment of the suitability of a candidate site. The use of reputation signals for sites and voting by multiple inspectors allows the bees avoid bad decisions even in the face of false signals.
</p>

<p>
    The process is further protected from error because bees are programmed to only advertise sites they’ve actually visited. Again, they don’t have the ability to be malicious. Each bee advertising a potential site has done the work of flying to the site and inspecting it. As bees signal their excitement for that site in a waggle dance, even more bees will fly out to it, perform an inspection, and return to advertise their findings. I don’t know if I’d characterize this as proof of work, but it does ensure that votes are based on real information. Once a quorum of bees in the swarm reach consensus about a particular site, the swarm departs and takes up residence in their new home.
</p>

<blockquote>
     <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0046A9M68/windleyofente-20">Honeybee Democracy by Thomas D. Seeley</a> 
    <p>Honeybees make decisions collectively--and democratically. Every year, faced with the life-or-death problem of choosing and traveling to a new home, honeybees stake everything on a process that includes collective fact-finding, vigorous debate, and consensus building. In fact, as world-renowned animal behaviorist Thomas Seeley reveals, these incredible insects have much to teach us when it comes to collective wisdom and effective decision making. </p>
    <p>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
    You may not be thrilled if a swarm determines the best new home is in your attic, but you can be thrilled with the knowledge that ten thousand decentralized bees with sophisticated algorithmic programming achieved consensus and ranked it #1.
</p>

<p>
    The hive is a super organism with its intelligence spread out among its tens of thousands of members. Life and death decisions are made on a daily basis in a completely decentralized fashion. Besides thermoregulation of the hive and finding a new home, the bees in a hive autonomously make millions of other decentralized decisions every day that result in the hive not only surviving but thriving in hostile conditions. I find that remarkable.

The global pandemic has accelerated our adoption and transformation, and we are in a better place than March 2020. However, sticking with oil, we know that the extraction process has downsides, including carbon release, messy, and difficulty locating economic wells. &nbsp; Amongst data’s most significant downsides are legal liabilities, noise and the wrong data.&nbsp;</p><p>I can easily hide data’s downsides through dashboards.&nbsp; Our dashboards are based on trickle-down KPI and objectives from our strategic plan.&nbsp; We hand out <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-SMART-Goals">SMART</a> objectives, but such objectives fundamentally assume that we are and continue to do the right thing.&nbsp; We gather data and post-analysis present it as trending graphs or red, amber, green dashboards, aiming for everything to be going in the right direction or green.&nbsp; Green only means we have no negative variance between our plan and the actual. Organisationally we are incentivised to achieve green at any unknown cost or consequence.&nbsp; Trending analysis can always be generated through the selection of data to fit the story.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, we are using data to measure, analyse and inform. We have better control of variance across our entire operations and ecosystem than at any previous point in our history. We increasingly have to depend on dashboards to manage the complicated and complex, remain informed, and determine where our energies should be focussed.&nbsp; Without a doubt, this should remain and continue to be improved, but we are already on a diminishing return with the data we collect due to the increase in noise over signal and should aim to cull than add.&nbsp;</p><p>As an agenda item; should we introduce the colour BLUE into our reporting, trends, and dashboards to reduce reporting and data?&nbsp; The traditional traffic lights remain the same; blue is not replacing any of them; it can become the one that allows us to know we are doing the right thing and not just doing the wrong thing that is in the plan in the most efficient and effective way (can be green or red).</p><p>As a team, we have to feed our sense of enquiry, and our existing data gathering, analysis, and reporting do not value the complexity we are faced with. More data does not solve complexity. Data has allowed us to evolve from finance data as the most critical decision-making source to become more sensitive.&nbsp; Whilst we have far more data, it is still narrow, and we should consider how we prepare for the next evolution, which will not be more of the same data.&nbsp; Following on from customer data and the start in ESG, the next data set we are being mandated to report on is <a href="https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2020/11/05/the-sec-just-mandated-human-capital-disclosure-what-does-this-mean-for-you/">Human Capital.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Human capital reporting opens up our ability to sense what our employees and ecosystem are sensing, seeing and implying; helping us to determine, using technologies such as sentiment analysis, if we are doing the right thing. Where are issues that are not on the dashboard are occurring? What, as yet, unidentified tensions and conflicts are created by our current trickle-down objective/ incentive system? However, as you can imagine, big brother, privacy, and trust are foundational issues we need to discuss front up before this next evolutionary step hits us.&nbsp; This next phase of our data journey means we will find it harder to hide in the selection of data for trends and dashboards or just seek the right trend or green. This is more data, but different data and it will fill a gap in our knowledge,&nbsp; meaning we will be better informed about complex decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to present for 15 minutes on this topic and host a 45-minute debate with your approval.</p><p>Your CDO</p> <br>

   I've released the first non-alpha version of Django SQL Dashboard, which provides an interface for running arbitrary read-only SQL queries directly against a PostgreSQL database, protected by the Django authentication scheme. It can also be used to create saved dashboards that can be published or shared internally.

  <p>I've released the first non-alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard">Django SQL Dashboard</a>, which provides an interface for running arbitrary read-only SQL queries directly against a PostgreSQL database, protected by the Django authentication scheme. It can also be used to create saved dashboards that can be published or shared internally.</p>
<p>I started building this tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/14/weeknotes/">back in March</a> as part of my work to port VaccinateCA away from Airtable <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Apr/12/porting-vaccinateca-to-django/">to a custom Django backend</a>. One of the  strengths of Airtable is that it allows ad-hoc data exploration and reporting, and I wanted to provide an alternative to that for the new Django backend.</p>
<p>I also wanted to try out some new ideas for <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>, which doesn't (yet) work with PostgreSQL.</p>
 First, a demo 
<p>I recorded this three minute video demo introducing the software, using my blog's database as an example.</p>



<p>In the video I run the following SQL queries to explore the many-to-many table that maps tags to my blog entries:</p>
  select * from blog_entry_tags;  
<p>The table starts out looking like this - not particularly interesting:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then I run this query to join it against the <code>blog_tag</code> table and get the details of each tag:</p>
  select * from blog_entry_tags
join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id  
<p></p>
<p>This is a bit more useful. I then click on the "count" link at the top of that "tag" column. This constructs a SQL query for me that uses a <code>count(*)</code> and <code>group by</code> to return a count of each value in that column:</p>
  select "tag", count(*) as n from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results group by "tag" order by n desc  
<p></p>
<p>Then I demonstrate some of the default widget visualizations that come with Django SQL Dashboard. If I rewrite the query to return columns called <code>bar_label</code> and <code>bar_quantity</code> the tool will render the results as a bar chart:</p>
  select "tag" as bar_label, count(*) as bar_quantity from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results
group by "tag" order by bar_quantity desc  
<p></p>
<p>Next, I demonstrate a similar trick that instead produces a word cloud by aliasing the columns to <code>wordcloud_word</code> and <code>wordcloud_count</code>:</p>
  select "tag" as wordcloud_word, count(*) as wordcloud_count from (
  select * from blog_entry_tags
  join blog_tag on blog_tag.id = blog_entry_tags.tag_id
) as results
group by "tag" order by wordcloud_count desc  
<p></p>
<p>Finally, I show how that query can be turned into a saved dashboard and made available to the public. Here's the saved dashboard I created in the video:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/tag-cloud/">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/tag-cloud/</a></p>
<p>This illustrates a key idea underlying both Django SQL dashboard and Datasette: a complete application can be defined as a SQL query!</p>
<p>Much of the work we do as web application developers can be boiled down to constructing a SQL query and hooking it up to output to a web page. If you can safely execute SQL queries from page query strings this means you can build custom applications that exist entirely as bookmarkable URLs.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/24/drawing-shapes-spatialite/">draw-a-shape-on-a-map application</a> for searching mini parks in California from a few months ago is another example of this pattern in action.</p>
 Custom widgets 
<p>Building new custom widgets for this tool is extremely easy - hence the word cloud widget which I actually built specially for this demo. All you need to provide is a single Django template file.</p>
<p>If your widget is going to respond to returned columns <code>wordcloud_word</code> and <code>wordcloud_count</code> the name of that template is those columns, sorted alphabetically and joined with hyphens:</p>
<p><code>wordcloud_count-wordcloud_word.html</code></p>
<p>Place that in a <code>django_sql_dashboard/widgets</code> template directory and the new widget will be ready to use. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/django-sql-dashboard/blob/0.13/django_sql_dashboard/templates/django_sql_dashboard/widgets/wordcloud_count-wordcloud_word.html">full implementation</a> of the word cloud widget.</p>
 Named parameter support 
<p>This is a feature I lifted <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#named-parameters">directly from Datasette</a>. You can construct SQL queries that look like this:</p>
  select * from blog_entry where id = %(id)s  
<p>This uses psycopg2 syntax for named parameters. The value will be correctly quoted and escaped, so this is a useful tool for avoiding SQL injection attacks.</p>
<p>Djang SQL Dashboard spots these parameters and turns them into form fields. Here's what that looks like in the interface:</p>
<p></p>
<p>These forms submit using GET, so the result can be bookmarked. Here's a saved dashboard you can use to retrieve the details of any of my blog entries by their numeric ID:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/blog-entry-by-id/?id=7991">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/blog-entry-by-id/?id=7991</a></p>
<p>You can include multiple SQL parameters on a single dashboard, and any form parameters will be made available to all of those queries.</p>
<p>This means you can build dashboards that run multiple queries against the same arguments. Imagine for example you want to build a report about a specific user's activity across multiple tables - you can accept their user ID as a parameter, then display the output of multiple queries (including custom visualizations) that each refer to that parameter.</p>
 Export through copy and paste 
<p>I love copy and paste as a mechanism for exporting data from a system. Django SQL Dashboard embraces this in a couple of ways:</p>
 
 Results from SQL queries can be copied out as TSV from an expandable textarea below the table - up to 1,000 rows. I like this format because you can paste it directly into Google Sheets or Excel to get the data correctly split into cells. 
 Any time JSON is returned as a value from PostgreSQL, a "copy to clipboard" icon is shown next to the JSON. I use this a lot: both for JSON stored in PostgreSQL as well as the output from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-aggregate.html">JSON aggregation functions</a>. 
 
 Export all query results as CSV/TSV 
<p>This comes up a lot at Vaccinate CA: we do a lot of data analysis where we need to work with other tools or send data to partners, and having a way to export the full set of results for a query (rather than truncating at the first thousand to avoid crashing the user's browser) was a frequent need. - Django SQL Dashboard provides this option using a combination of Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/#django.http.StreamingHttpResponse">streaming HTTP response</a> mechanism and PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#server-side-cursors">server-side cursors</a> to efficiently stream large amounts of data without running out of resources.</p>
 A complex example: searching code examples across my blog 
<p>I decided to see how far I could push PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>I often include code in my blog entries - examples that are wrapped in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag. Within that tag I sometimes apply syntax highlighting (a bunch of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements).</p>
<p>It turns out I've included code snippets in 134 different blog entries:</p>
  select count(*) from blog_entry where body ~ '&lt;pre&gt;.*&lt;pre&gt;'  
<p>Can I use regular expressions in PostgreSQL to extract just the code examples, clean them up (removing those spans, reversing HTML entity encoding) and then provide simple search across the text of those examples, all in one query?</p>
<p>It turns out I can!</p>
<p>Here's a saved dashboard you can use to execute searches against just the contents of those <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags across every entry on my blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/code-examples/?search=select">https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/code-examples/?search=select</a></p>
  with results_stripped as (
  select id, title,
    replace(replace(replace(replace(replace(regexp_replace(
      (regexp_matches(body, '&lt;pre&gt;(.*?)&lt;/pre&gt;', 'g'))[1],
        E'&lt;[^&gt;]+&gt;', '', 'gi'
      ), '&amp;quot' || chr(59), '"'), '&amp;gt' || chr(59), '&gt;'), '&amp;lt' || chr(59), '&lt;'), '&amp;#039' || chr(59), chr(39)), '&amp;amp' || chr(59), '&amp;'
    ) as code
  from
    blog_entry
  where
    body ~ '&lt;pre&gt;.*&lt;pre&gt;'
)
select id, title, code, 'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link from results_stripped
where code like '%%' || %(search)s || '%%' limit 10  
<p>There's a lot going on here. The key component is this bit:</p>
 <code>regexp_matches(body, '&lt;pre&gt;(.*?)&lt;/pre&gt;', 'g'))[1]
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP">regexp_matches() function</a>, with the <code>'g'</code> flag, returns every match for the given regular expression. As part of a larger <code>select</code> query this means that if the expression matches three times you'll get back three rows in the output (in this case with duplicate <code>id</code> and <code>title</code> columns) - which is what I want here.</p>
<p>It's wrapped in a terrifying nest of extra functions. These serve two purposes: they strip out any nested HTML tags, and the un-escape the <code>&amp;quot;</code>, <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;amp;</code> and <code>&amp;#039;</code> HTML entities. I did this as a nested block of <code>replace()</code> functions - there's probably a neater solution here.</p>
<p>The <code>chr(59)</code> bits are a hack: Django SQL Dashboard disallows the <code>;</code> character to ensure people can't execute multiple SQL queries - which could be used to work around some of the per-transaction protective settings applied by the tool.</p>
<p>But I need to search-and-replace <code>&amp;quot;</code> - so I use this pattern to include the semicolon:</p>
 <code>replace(text, '&amp;quot' || chr(59), '"')
</code> 
<p>Where <code>||</code> is the PostgreSQL string concatenation operator.</p>
<p>The search itself is constructed like this:</p>
 <code>where code like '%%' || %(search)s || '%%'
</code> 
<p>This constructs a like query against <code>'%your-search-term%'</code> - the double percentage sign escaping is needed because <code>%</code> has a special meaning here (it's part of the <code>%(search)s</code> named parameter).</p>
<p>One last trick: the final output of the query is produced by this:</p>
  select id, title, code, 'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link from results_stripped  
<p><code>results_stripped</code> is a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/queries-with.html">CTE</a> defined earlier - I usually try to wrap up complex weird stuff like those nested <code>replace()</code> calls in a CTE so I can write a simple final query.</p>
<p>The <code>'https://simonwillison.net/e/' || id as link</code> bit here concatenates together a URL that links to my entry based on its ID. My blog uses <code>/yyyy/Mon/slug/</code> URLs but generating these from a SQL query against the <code>created</code> column was a little fussy, so I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/commit/771878920bbcf46eee3f34d22b2dc35340da07f9">added /e/ID redirecting URLs</a> to make generating links in dashboard queries easier.</p>
 Future plans 
<p>Django SQL Dashboard has already proved itself invaluable for my current project. I imagine I'll be using it for every Django project I build going forward - being able to query the database like this, create ad-hoc visualizations and then link to them is a huge productivity boost.</p>
<p>The bigger question is how it overlaps with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>.</p>
<p>Datasette has been SQLite-only since I started the project three and a half years ago - because I know that building a database abstraction layer is a huge additional commitment and, for Datasette's initial purpose of helping publish read-only data, it didn't feel necessary.</p>
<p>I have a growing suspicion that getting Datasette to work against PostgreSQL (and other database backends) in addition to SQLite is less work than I had originally thought.</p>
<p>Datasette is also built on top of ASGI. Django 3.0 <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/releases/3.0/#asgi-support">introduced ASGI support</a>, so it's now possible to host ASGI applications like Datasette as part of a unified Django application.</p>
<p>So it's possible that the future of Django SQL Dashboard will be for Datasette to eventually make it obsolete.</p>
<p>That doesn't stop it from being extremely useful today. If you try it out I'd love to hear from you! I'm also keen to see people start to expand it for their own projects, especially via the <a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/en/latest/widgets.html#custom-widgets">custom widgets</a> mechanism.</p>
<p>Let me know if you try it out!</p>

<p>This article shows how use verifiable credentials stored on a digital wallet to verify a digital identity and use in an application. For this to work, a trust needs to exist between the verifiable credential issuer and the application which requires the verifiable credentials to verify. A blockchain decentralized database is used and MATTR is used as a access layer to this ledger and blockchain. The applications are implemented in ASP.NET Core.</p>



<p>The verifier application Bo Insurance is used to implement the verification process and to create a presentation template. The application sends a HTTP post request to create a presentation request using the DID Id from the OIDC credential Issuer, created in the previous article. This DID is created from the National Driving license application which issues verifiable credentials and so a trust needs to exist between the two applications. Once the credentials have been issued to a holder of the verifiable credentials and stored for example in a digital wallet, the issuer is no longer involved in the process. Verifying the credentials only requires the holder and the verifier and the decentralized database which holds the digital identities and documents. The verifier application gets the DID from the ledger and signs the verify request. The request can then be presented as a QR Code. The holder can scan this using a MATTR digital wallet and grant consent to share the credentials with the application. The digital wallet calls the callback API defined in the request presentation body and sends the data to the API. The verifier application hosting the API would need to verify the data and can update the application UI using SignalR to continue the business process with the verified credentials.</p>

<p>Create the presentation template for the Verifiable Credential</p>



<p>A presentation template is required to verify the issued verifiable credentials stored on a digital wallet.</p>



<p>The digital identity (DID) Id of the OIDC credential issuer is all that is required to create a presentation request template.  In the application which issues credentials, ie the NationalDrivingLicense, a Razor page was created to view the DID of the OIDC credential issuer.</p>







<p>The DID can be used to create the presentation template. The MATTR documentation is really good here:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template</a></p>



<p>A Razor page was created to start this task from the UI. This would normally require authentication as this is an administrator task from the application requesting the verified credentials. The code behind the Razor page takes the DID request parameter and calls the MattrPresentationTemplateService to create the presentation template and present this id a database.</p>


  public class CreatePresentationTemplateModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrPresentationTemplateService _mattrVerifyService;
	public bool CreatingPresentationTemplate { get; set; } = true;
	public string TemplateId { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public PresentationTemplate PresentationTemplate { get; set; }
	public CreatePresentationTemplateModel(MattrPresentationTemplateService mattrVerifyService)
	{
		_mattrVerifyService = mattrVerifyService;
	}
	public void OnGet()
	{
		PresentationTemplate = new PresentationTemplate();
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		TemplateId = await _mattrVerifyService.CreatePresentationTemplateId(PresentationTemplate.DidId);
		CreatingPresentationTemplate = false;
		return Page();
	}
}

public class PresentationTemplate
{
	[Required]
	public string DidId { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The Razor page html template creates a form to post the request to the server rendered page and displays the templateId after, if the creation was successful.</p>


  @page
@model BoInsurance.Pages.CreatePresentationTemplateModel

&lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-sm"&gt;

                                   value="Create Presentation Template" /&gt;
                        }

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
                        @if (!Model.CreatingPresentationTemplate)
                        {
                            &lt;div class="alert alert-success"&gt;
                                &lt;strong&gt;Mattr Presentation Template created&lt;/strong&gt;
                            &lt;/div&gt;
                        }

                        
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the templateId is created, you can use the template ID to verify&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-sm"&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;img src="~/ndl_car_01.png" width="200" alt="Driver License"&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;
                    &lt;b&gt;Driver Licence templateId from presentation template&lt;/b&gt;
                    &lt;hr /&gt;
                    &lt;dl class="row"&gt;
                        &lt;dt class="col-sm-4"&gt;templateId&lt;/dt&gt;
                        &lt;dd class="col-sm-8"&gt;
                            @Model.TemplateId
                        &lt;/dd&gt;
                    &lt;/dl&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


  


<p>The MattrPresentationTemplateService is used to create the MATTR presentation template. This class uses the MATTR API and sends a HTTP post request with the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer and creates a presentation template. The service saves the returned payload to a database and returns the template ID as the result. The template ID is required to verify the verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to request an API token for the MATTR API using the credential of your MATTR account. This service has a simple token cache and only requests new access tokens when no token exists or the token has expired.</p>



<p>The BoInsuranceDbService service is used to access the SQL database using Entity Framework Core. This provides simple methods to persist or select the data as required. </p>


  private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrPresentationTemplateService(IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService,
	BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService)
{
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreatePresentationTemplateId(string didId)
{
	// create a new one
	var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = await CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(didId);

	// save to db
	var drivingLicensePresentationTemplate = new DrivingLicensePresentationTemplate
	{
		DidId = didId,
		TemplateId = v1PresentationTemplateResponse.Id,
		MattrPresentationTemplateReponse = JsonConvert
			.SerializeObject(v1PresentationTemplateResponse)
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService
		.CreateDriverLicensePresentationTemplate(drivingLicensePresentationTemplate);

	return v1PresentationTemplateResponse.Id;
}

private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(string didId)
{
	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");

	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = await CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(client, didId);
	return v1PresentationTemplateResponse;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrPresentationTemplate method sends the HTTP Post request like in the MATTR API documentation. Creating the payload for the HTTP post request using the MATTR Open API definitions is a small bit complicated.  This could be improved with a better Open API definition. In our use case, we just want to create the default template for the OIDC credential issuer and so just require the DID Id.  Most of the other properties are fixed values, see the MATTR API docs for more information.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt; CreateMattrPresentationTemplate(
	HttpClient client, string didId)
{
	// create presentation, post to presentations templates api
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/verify/presentation-request-template

	var createPresentationsTemplatesUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/templates";

	var additionalProperties = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
	additionalProperties.Add("type", "QueryByExample");
	additionalProperties.Add("credentialQuery", new List&lt;CredentialQuery&gt; {
		new CredentialQuery
		{
			Reason = "Please provide your driving license",
			Required = true,
			Example = new Example
			{
				Context = new List&lt;object&gt;{ "https://schema.org" },
				Type = "VerifiableCredential",
				TrustedIssuer = new List&lt;TrustedIssuer2&gt;
				{
					new TrustedIssuer2
					{
						Required = true,
						Issuer = didId // DID use to create the oidc
					}
				}
			}
		}
	});

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreatePresentationTemplate
	{
		Domain = _mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain,
		Name = "certificate-presentation",
		Query = new List&lt;Query&gt;
		{
			new Query
			{
				AdditionalProperties = additionalProperties
			}
		}
	};

	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

	var uri = new Uri(createPresentationsTemplatesUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var presentationTemplateResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (presentationTemplateResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{

			var v1PresentationTemplateResponse = JsonConvert
					.DeserializeObject&lt;MattrOpenApiClient.V1_PresentationTemplateResponse&gt;(
					await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1PresentationTemplateResponse;
		}

		var error = await presentationTemplateResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

	}

	throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
}
  


<p>The application can be started and the presentation template can be created. The ID is returned back to the UI for the next step.</p>







<p>Verify the verifiable credentials</p>



<p>Now that a template exists to request the verifiable data from the holder of the data which is normally stored in a digital wallet, the verifier application can create and start a verification process. A post request is sent to the MATTR APIs which creates a presentation request using a DID ID and the required template. The application can request the DID from the OIDC credential issuer. The request is signed using the correct key from the DID and the request is published in the UI as a QR Code. A digital wallet is used to scan the code and the user of the wallet can grant consent to share the personal data. The wallet sends a HTTP post request to the callback API. This API handles the request, would validate the data and updates the UI using SignalR to move to the next step of the business process using the verified data.</p>







<p>Step 1 Invoke a presentation request</p>



<p>The InvokePresentationRequest method implements the presentation request. This method requires the DID Id of the OIDC credential issuer which will by used to get the data from the holder of the data. The template ID is also required from the template created above. A challenge is also used to track the verification. The challenge is a random value and is used when the digital wallet calls the API with the verified data. The callback URL is where the data is returned to. This could be unique for every request or anything you want. The payload is created like the docs from the MATTR API defines.  The post request is sent to the MATTR API and a V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse is returned if all is configured correctly.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt; InvokePresentationRequest(
	HttpClient client,
	string didId,
	string templateId,
	string challenge,
	string callbackUrl)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/presentations/requests";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreatePresentationRequestRequest
	{
		Did = didId,
		TemplateId = templateId,
		Challenge = challenge,
		CallbackUrl = new Uri(callbackUrl),
		ExpiresTime = MATTR_EPOCH_EXPIRES_TIME_VERIFIY // Epoch time
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse = JsonConvert
				.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse&gt;(
					await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 2 Get the OIDC Issuer DID</p>



<p>The RequestDID method uses the MATTR API to get the DID data from the blochchain for the OIDC credential issuer. Only the DID Id is required.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt; RequestDID(string didId, HttpClient client)
{
	var requestUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids/{didId}";
	var uri = new Uri(requestUrl);

	var didResponse = await client.GetAsync(uri);

	if (didResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
	{
		var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_GetDidResponse&gt;(
				await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

		return v1CreateDidResponse;
	}

	var error = await didResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	return null;
}
  


<p>Step 3 Sign the request using correct key and display QR Code</p>



<p>To verify data using a digital wallet, the payload must be signed using the correct key. The SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody uses the DID payload and the request from the presentation request to create the payload to sign. Creating the payload is a big messy due to the OpenAPI definitions created for the MATTR API. A HTTP post request with the payload returns the signed JWT in a payload in a strange data format so we parse this as a string and manually get the JWT payload.</p>


  private async Task&lt;string&gt; SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody(
	HttpClient client,
	V1_GetDidResponse did,
	V1_CreatePresentationRequestResponse v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse)
{
	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/v1/messaging/sign";

	object didUrlArray;
	did.DidDocument.AdditionalProperties.TryGetValue("authentication", out didUrlArray);
	var didUrl = didUrlArray.ToString().Split("\"")[1];
	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.SignMessageRequest
	{
		DidUrl = didUrl,
		Payload = v1CreatePresentationRequestResponse.Request
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var response = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
		{
			var result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
			return result;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The CreateVerifyCallback method uses the presentation request, the get DID and the sign HTTP post requests to create a URL which can be displayed in a UI. The challenge is created using the RNGCryptoServiceProvider class which creates a random string. The access token to access the API is returned from the client credentials OAuth requests or from the in memory cache. The DrivingLicensePresentationVerify class is persisted to a database and the verify URL is returned so that this could be displayed as a QR Code in the UI.</p>

/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public async Task&lt;(string QrCodeUrl, string ChallengeId)&gt; CreateVerifyCallback(string callbackBaseUrl)
{
	callbackBaseUrl = callbackBaseUrl.Trim();
	if (!callbackBaseUrl.EndsWith('/'))
	{
		callbackBaseUrl = $"{callbackBaseUrl}/";
	}

	var callbackUrlFull = $"{callbackBaseUrl}{MATTR_CALLBACK_VERIFY_PATH}";
	var challenge = GetEncodedRandomString();

	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");

	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var template = await _boInsuranceDbService.GetLastDriverLicensePrsentationTemplate();

	// Invoke the Presentation Request
	var invokePresentationResponse = await InvokePresentationRequest(
		client,
		template.DidId,
		template.TemplateId,
		challenge,
		callbackUrlFull);

	// Request DID 
	V1_GetDidResponse did = await RequestDID(template.DidId, client);

	// Sign and Encode the Presentation Request body
	var signAndEncodePresentationRequestBodyResponse = await SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody(
		client, did, invokePresentationResponse);

	// fix strange DTO
	var jws = signAndEncodePresentationRequestBodyResponse.Replace("\"", "");

	// save to db // TODO add this back once working
	var drivingLicensePresentationVerify = new DrivingLicensePresentationVerify
	{
		DidId = template.DidId,
		TemplateId = template.TemplateId,
		CallbackUrl = callbackUrlFull,
		Challenge = challenge,
		InvokePresentationResponse = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(invokePresentationResponse),
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		SignAndEncodePresentationRequestBody = jws
	};
	await _boInsuranceDbService.CreateDrivingLicensePresentationVerify(drivingLicensePresentationVerify);

	var qrCodeUrl = $"didcomm://https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/?request={jws}";

	return (qrCodeUrl, challenge);
}

private string GetEncodedRandomString()
{
	var base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(GenerateRandomBytes(30));
	return HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode(base64);
}

private byte[] GenerateRandomBytes(int length)
{
	using var randonNumberGen = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
	var byteArray = new byte[length];
	randonNumberGen.GetBytes(byteArray);
	return byteArray;
}
  


<p>The CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel is the code behind for the Razor page to request a verification and also display the verify QR Code for the digital wallet to scan. The CallbackUrl can be set from the UI so that this is easier for testing. This callback can be any webhook you want or API. To test the application in local development, I used ngrok. The return URL has to match the proxy which tunnels to you PC, once you start. If the API has no public address when debugging, you will not be able to test locally.</p>


  public class CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly MattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService _mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService;
	public bool CreatingVerifier { get; set; } = true;
	public string QrCodeUrl { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public string ChallengeId { get; set; }

	[BindProperty]
	public CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeCallbackUrl CallbackUrlDto { get; set; }
	public CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeModel(MattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService 
		mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService)
	{
		_mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService = mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService;
	}
	public void OnGet()
	{
		CallbackUrlDto = new CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeCallbackUrl();
		CallbackUrlDto.CallbackUrl = $"https://{HttpContext.Request.Host.Value}";
	}

	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
	{
		if (!ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			return Page();
		}

		var result = await _mattrCredentialVerifyCallbackService
			.CreateVerifyCallback(CallbackUrlDto.CallbackUrl);

		CreatingVerifier = false;

		QrCodeUrl = result.QrCodeUrl;
		ChallengeId = result.ChallengeId;
		return Page();
	}
}

public class CreateVerifierDisplayQrCodeCallbackUrl
{
	[Required]
	public string CallbackUrl { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The html or template part of the Razor page displays the QR Code from a successful post request. You can set any URL for the callback in the form request. This is really just for testing.</p>

            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;hr /&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the verification is created, you can scan the QR Code to verify&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Step 4 Implement the Callback and update the UI using SignalR</p>



<p>After a successful verification in the digital wallet, the wallet sends the verified credentials to the API defined in the presentation request. The API handling this needs to update the correct client UI and continue the business process using the verified data. We use SignalR for this with a single client to client connection. The Signal connections for each connection is associated with a challenge ID, the same Id we used to create the presentation request. Using this, only the correct client will be notified and not all clients broadcasted. The DrivingLicenseCallback takes the body with is specific for the credentials you issued. This is always depending on what you request. The data is saved to a database and the client is informed to continue. We send a message directly to the correct client using the connectionId of the SignalR session created for this challenge.</p>


  [ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class VerificationController : Controller
{
	private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;

	private readonly IHubContext&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt; _hubContext;

	public VerificationController(BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService,
		IHubContext&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt; hubContext)
	{
		_hubContext = hubContext;
		_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	}

	[HttpPost]
	[Route("[action]")]
	public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DrivingLicenseCallback([FromBody] VerifiedDriverLicense body)
	{
		string connectionId;
		var found = MattrVerifiedSuccessHub.Challenges
			.TryGetValue(body.ChallengeId, out connectionId);

		// test Signalr
		//await _hubContext.Clients.Client(connectionId).SendAsync("MattrCallbackSuccess", $"{body.ChallengeId}");
		//return Ok();

		var exists = await _boInsuranceDbService.ChallengeExists(body.ChallengeId);

		if (exists)
		{
			await _boInsuranceDbService.PersistVerification(body);

			if (found)
			{
				//$"/VerifiedUser?challengeid={body.ChallengeId}"
				await _hubContext.Clients
					.Client(connectionId)
					.SendAsync("MattrCallbackSuccess", $"{body.ChallengeId}");
			}

			return Ok();
		}

		return BadRequest("unknown verify request");
	}
}
  


<p>The SignalR server is configured in the Startup class of the ASP.NET Core application. The path for the hub is defined in the MapHub method.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	// ...
	
	services.AddRazorPages();
	services.AddSignalR();
	services.AddControllers();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// ...

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapHub&lt;MattrVerifiedSuccessHub&gt;("/mattrVerifiedSuccessHub");
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The Hub implementation requires only one fixed method. The AddChallenge method takes the challenge Id and adds this the an in-memory cache. The controller implemented for the callbacks uses this ConcurrentDictionary to find the correct connectionId which is mapped to the challenges form the verification.</p>


  public class MattrVerifiedSuccessHub : Hub
{
	/// &lt;summary&gt;
	/// This should be replaced with a cache which expires or something
	/// &lt;/summary&gt;
	public static readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt; Challenges 
		= new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();

	public void AddChallenge(string challengeId, string connnectionId)
	{
		Challenges.TryAdd(challengeId, connnectionId);
	}

}
  


<p>The Javascript SignalR client in the browser connects to the SignalR server and registers the connectionId with the challenge ID used for the verification of the verifiable credentials from the holder of the digital wallet. If a client gets a message from that a verify has completed successfully and the callback has been called, it will redirect to the verified page. The client listens to the MattrCallbackSuccess for messages. These messages are sent from the callback controller directly.</p>


  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    
    var connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
		.withUrl("/mattrVerifiedSuccessHub").build();

    connection.on("MattrCallbackSuccess", function (challengeId) {
        console.log("received verification:" + challengeId);
        window.location.href = "/VerifiedUser?challengeid=" + challengeId;
    });

    connection.start().then(function () {
        //console.log(connection.connectionId);
        const challengeId = $("#ChallengeId").val();
        
        if (challengeId) {
            console.log(challengeId);
            // join message
            connection.invoke("AddChallenge", challengeId, 
				connection.connectionId).catch(function (err) {
                return console.error(err.toString());
            });
        }
    }).catch(function (err) {
        return console.error(err.toString());
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
  


<p>The VerifiedUserModel Razor page displays the data and the business process can continue using the verified data. </p>


  public class VerifiedUserModel : PageModel
{
	private readonly BoInsuranceDbService _boInsuranceDbService;

	public VerifiedUserModel(BoInsuranceDbService boInsuranceDbService)
	{
		_boInsuranceDbService = boInsuranceDbService;
	}

	public string ChallengeId { get; set; }
	public DriverLicenseClaimsDto VerifiedDriverLicenseClaims { get; private set; }

	public async Task OnGetAsync(string challengeId)
	{
		// user query param to get challenge id and display data
		if (challengeId != null)
		{
			var verifiedDriverLicenseUser = await _boInsuranceDbService.GetVerifiedUser(challengeId);
			VerifiedDriverLicenseClaims = new DriverLicenseClaimsDto
			{
				DateOfBirth = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.DateOfBirth,
				Name = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.Name,
				LicenseType = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.LicenseType,
				FirstName = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.FirstName,
				LicenseIssuedAt = verifiedDriverLicenseUser.LicenseIssuedAt
			};
		}
	}
}

public class DriverLicenseClaimsDto
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string FirstName { get; set; }
	public string LicenseType { get; set; }
	public string DateOfBirth { get; set; }
	public string LicenseIssuedAt { get; set; }
}
  


<p>Running the  verifier</p>



<p>To test the BoInsurance application locally, which is the verifier application, ngrok is used so that we have a public address for the callback. I install ngrok using npm. Without a license, you can only run your application in http.</p>


  npm install -g ngrok
  


<p>Run the ngrok from the command line using the the URL of the application. I start the ASP.NET Core application at localhost port 5000. </p>


  ngrok http localhost:5000
  


<p>You should be able to copied the ngrok URL and use this in the browser to test the verification.</p>







<p>Once running, a verification can be created and you can scan the QR Code with your digital wallet. Once you grant access to your data, the data is sent to the callback API and the UI will be redirected to the success page.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR APIs work really well and support some of the flows for digital identities. I plan to try out the zero proof flow next. It is only possible to create verifiable credentials from data from your identity provider using the id_token. To issue credentials, you have to implement your own identity provider and cannot use business data from your application. If you have full control like with Openiddict, IdenityServer4 or Auth0, this is no problem, just more complicated to implement. If you do not control the data in your identity provider, you would need to create a second identity provider to issue credentials. This is part of your business logic then and not just an identity provider. This will always be a problem is using Azure AD or IDPs from large, medium size companies. The quality of the verifiable credentials also depend on how good the OIDC credential issuers are implemented as these are still central databases for these credentials and are still open to all the problems we have today. Decentralized identities have to potential to solve many problems but still have many unsolved problems.  </p>

<p>I wrote this fake story on January 24, 2005, in an email to <a href="https://hirshberg.com/">Peter Hirshberg</a> after we jokingly came up with it during a phone call. Far as I know, it was the first mention of the word “iPhone.”</p>
<p>Apple introduces one-button iPhone Shuffle</p>
<p>To nobody’s surprise, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the telephony market is no less radical and minimalistic than the one-button mouse and the gum-stick-sized music player. In fact, the company’s new cell phone — developed in deeply secret partnership with Motorola — extends the concept behind the company’s latest iPod, as well as its brand identity.</p>
<p>Like the iPod Shuffle, the new iPhone Shuffle has no display. It’s an all-white rectangle with a little green light to show that a call is in progress. While the iPhone Shuffle resembles the iPod Shuffle, its user interface is even more spare. In place of the round directional “wheel” of the iPods, the iPhone Shuffle sports a single square button. When pressed, the iPod Shuffle dials a random number from its phone book.</p>
<p>“Our research showed that people don’t care who they call as much as they care about being on the phone,” said Apple CEO Steve Jobs. “We also found that most cell phone users hate routine, and prefer to be surprised. That’s just as true for people answering calls as it is for people making them. It’s much more liberating, and far more social, to call people at random than it is to call them deliberately.”</p>
<p>Said (pick an analyst), “We expect the iPhone Shuffle will do as much to change the culture of telephony as the iPod has done to change the culture of music listening.”</p>
<p>Safety was also a concern behind the one-button design. “We all know that thousands of people die on highways every year when they take their eyes off the road to dial or answer a cell phone,” Jobs said. “With the iPhone Shuffle, all they have to do is press one button, simple as that.”</p>
<p>For people who would rather dial contacts in order than at random, the iPhone Shuffle (like the iPod Shuffle) has a switch that allows users to call their phone book in the same order as listings are loaded loaded from the Address Book application.<br>
To accommodate the new product, Apple also released Version 4.0.1 of &nbsp;Address Book, which now features “phonelists” modeled after the familiar “playlists” in iTunes. These allow the iPhone Shuffle’s phone book to be populated by the same ‘iFill’ system that loads playlists from iTunes into iPod Shuffles.</p>
<p>A number of online sites reported that Apple negotiating with one of the major cell carriers to allow free calls between members who maintain .Mac accounts and keep their data in Apple’s Address Book. A few of those sites also suggested that future products in the Shuffle line will combine random phone calling and music playing, allowing users to play random music for random phone contacts.</p>
<p>The iPhone Shuffle will be sold at Apple retail stores.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work.

<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">new draft in the HTTP working group</a> that deals with signing HTTP messages of all types. Why is it here, and what does that give&nbsp;us?</p><p>HTTP is irrefutably a fundamental building block of most of today’s software systems. Yet security and identity need to be layered alongside HTTP. The most common of these is simply running the HTTP protocol over an encrypted socket using TLS, resulting in HTTPS. While this is a powerful and important security component, TLS works only my protecting the stream of bits in transit. It does not allow for message-level and application-level security operations. But what if we could sign the messages themselves?</p><p>While it is possible to wrap the body of a request in a cryptographic envelope like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/">JOSE</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2/">XML DSig</a>, such approaches force developers to ignore most of the power and flexibility of HTTP, reducing it to a dumb transport layer. In order to sign a message but keep using HTTP as it stands, with all the verbs and headers and content types that it gives us, we will need a scheme that allows us to add a detached signature to the HTTP message. The cryptographic elements to the message can then be generated and validated separately from the request itself, providing a layered approach.</p><p>There have been numerous attempts at creating detached signature methods for HTTP over the years, one of the most famous being the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures">Cavage draft</a> which itself started as a community-facing version of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Amazon’s SIGv4</a> method used within AWS. There were several other efforts, and all of them incompatible with each other in one way or another. To address this, the HTTP Working Group in the IETF stepped up and took on the effort of creating an RFC-track standard for HTTP message signatures that could be used across the variety of use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As of the writing of this post, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">the specification is at version 04</a>. While it’s not finished yet, it’s recently become a bit more stable and so it’s worth looking at it in greater&nbsp;depth.</p> Normalizing HTTP <p>As it turns out, the hardest part of signing HTTP messages isn’t the signing, it’s the HTTP. HTTP is a messy set of specifications, with pieces that have been built up by many authors over many years in ways that aren’t always that consistent. A recent move towards consistency has been the adoption of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941.html">Structured Field Values</a> for HTTP. In short, structured fields allow HTTP headers to house simple, non-recursive data structures with unambiguous parsing and deterministic serialization. These aspects made it perfect for use within the HTTP message signatures specification.</p><p>Previous efforts at HTTP message signing concentrated on creating a signature around HTTP headers, and the current draft is no exception in allowing that. On top of that, the current draft also allows for the definition of specialty fields that contain other pieces of constructed information not found in the headers themselves. These covered components are identified and combined with each other into a signature input string. To this string is added a field that includes all of the input parameters to this signature. For example, let’s say we want to sign parts of this HTTP&nbsp;request:</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br><br>{"hello": "world"} <p>We choose the components we want to sign, including the target of the request and a subset of the available headers, and create the following signature input&nbsp;string:</p> @request-target": post /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog<br>"host": example.com<br>"date": Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>"content-type": application/json<br>"digest": SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>"content-length": 18<br>"@signature-params": ("@request-target" "host" "date" "content-type"  "digest" "content-length");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss" <p>With a given HTTP message and a set of input parameters determining which parts of the message are covered with a signature, any party can re-generate this string with a reasonable level of success. Unsigned headers can be added to the message by intermediaries without invalidating the signature, and it’s even possible for an intermediary to add its own signature to the message on the way through — but we’ll get more into that advanced use case in a future post. The result of this is that the signer and verifier will re-create this signature input string independently of each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Now that we have a normalized string to sign, how do we actually sign&nbsp;it?</p> Signing and Verifying Content <p>Once we have the string, it’s a relatively straightforward matter of applying a key and signature function to the string. Any signature method that takes in and bunch of bytes and spits out a different set of bytes is technically feasible&nbsp;here.</p><p>How do the signer and verifier know which algorithm to use on a given method? It turns out that different deployments have drastically different needs in this regard. As a consequence, this is an aspect that is application specific by the specification, with several common methods called&nbsp;out:</p>  The signer and verifier can both be configured to expect only a specific algorithm, or have that algorithm identified by some aspect external to the protocol.  The signer and verifier can identify the key used to do the signing and figure out the signature algorithm based on that. If an application’s using JSON Web Keys, the alg field of the key provides an easy way to identify a signing mechanism.  If the signer and verifier need to signal the algorithm dynamically at runtime, there is an alg field in the signature parameter set itself that points to a new registry.  And if two or more of these methods are applicable to a given message, the answers all have to match, otherwise something fishy is going on and the signature is invalidated.  <p>Given the above signature input string and an RSA-PSS signing method, we end up with the following Base64-encoded bytes as the signature output:</p> NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg== <p>This gives us a signed object, and now we need to put that into our HTTP&nbsp;message.</p> Sending Signatures in&nbsp;Messages <p>The HTTP message signature specification defines two new headers to carry the signature, Signature and Signature-Input. Both of these use the Dictionary construct from the HTTP Structured Field Values standard to carry a named signature.</p><p>But first, why two headers? This construct allows us to easily separate the metadata about the signature — how it was made — from the signature value itself. This separation makes parsing simpler and also allows the HTTP message signatures specification to support multiple independent signatures on a given&nbsp;message.</p><p>The Signature-Input header contains all the parameters that went into the creation of the signature, including the list of covered content, identifiers for the key and algorithm, and items like timestamps or other application-specific flags. In fact, this is the same value used as the last line of the signature input string, and so its values are always covered by the signature. The Signature header contains the value of the signature itself as a byte array, encoded in Base64. The signer chooses a name for the signature object and adds both items to the headers. The name has no semantic impact, it just needs to be unique within a given&nbsp;request.</p><p>Let’s say this signature is named sig1. The signer adds both headers to the request above, resulting in the following signed&nbsp;request.</p> POST /foo?param=value&amp;pet=dog HTTP/1.1<br>Host: example.com<br>Date: Tue, 20 Apr 2021 02:07:55 GMT<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=<br>Content-Length: 18<br>Signature-Input: sig1=("host" "date" "content-type");created=1618884475;keyid="test-key-rsa-pss"<br>Signature: sig1=:NtIKWuXjr4SBEXj97gbick4O95ff378I0CZOa2VnIeEXZ1itzAdqTpSvG91XYrq5CfxCmk8zz1Zg7ZGYD+ngJyVn805r73rh2eFCPO+ZXDs45Is/Ex8srzGC9sfVZfqeEfApRFFe5yXDmANVUwzFWCEnGM6+SJVmWl1/jyEn45qA6Hw+ZDHbrbp6qvD4N0S92jlPyVVEh/SmCwnkeNiBgnbt+E0K5wCFNHPbo4X1Tj406W+bTtnKzaoKxBWKW8aIQ7rg92zqE1oqBRjqtRi5/Q6P5ZYYGGINKzNyV3UjZtxeZNnNJ+MAnWS0mofFqcZHVgSU/1wUzP7MhzOKLca1Yg==:  {"hello": "world"} <p>Note that none of the other headers or aspects of the message are modified by the signature process.</p><p>The verifier parses both headers, re-creates the signature input string from the request, and verifies the signature value using the identified key and algorithm. But how does the verifier know that this signature is sufficient for this request, and how does the signer know what to sign in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Applying the Message Signature Specification <p>As discussed above, the signer and verifier need to have a way of figuring out which algorithm and keys are appropriate for a given signed message. In many deployments, this information can be gleaned through context and configuration. For example, a key derivation algorithm based on the tenant identifier in the URL can be used to dereference the key needed for a given call. Or an application identifier passed in the body could point to a record giving both the expected algorithm and allowable key material.</p><p>In addition to defining a predictable way to determine this, an application of the HTTP message signatures specification also needs to define which parts of the message need to be signed. For example, and API might have very different behaviors based on a Content-Type header but not really care about the Content-Encoding. A security protocol like OAuth or GNAP would require signing the Authorization header that contains the access token as well as the @request-target specialty field.</p><p>The HTTP protocol is also designed to allow interception and proxy of requests and responses, with intermediaries fully allowed to alter the message in certain ways. Applications that need to account for such intermediaries can be picky about which headers and components are signed, allowing the signature to survive expected message modifications but protecting against unanticipated changes in&nbsp;transit.</p><p>This fundamentally means that no signature method will ever be perfect for all messages — but that’s ok. The HTTP message signature draft instead leans on flexibility, allowing applications to define how best to apply the signature methods to achieve the security&nbsp;needed.</p> Building the&nbsp;Standard <p>The HTTP message signatures specification is still a long way from being done. It’s taken in a number of different inputs and many years of collective community experience, and that initially resulted in some major churn in the specification’s syntax and structure. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04.html">As of version 04</a> though, the major surgery seems to be behind us. While there will inevitably be some changes to the parameters, names, and possibly even structures, the core of this is pretty solid. It’s time to start implementing it and testing it out with applications of all stripes, and I invite all of you to join me in doing just&nbsp;that.</p>

<p>NPR, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/npr-turns-50/">which turned 50</a> yesterday, used to mean National Public Radio. It still does, at least legally; but <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/inside/2010/07/12/128475395/npr-what-s-in-a-name">they quit calling it that</a> in 2010. The reason given was “…most of our audience — more than 27 million listeners to NPR member stations and millions more who experience our content on&nbsp;<a href="http://NPR.org" title="http://NPR. ">NPR.org</a> and through mobile or tablet devices — identify us as NPR.” Translation: We’re not just radio any more.</p>
<p>And they aren’t. Television, newspapers and magazines also aren’t what they were. All of those are now experienced mostly on glowing rectangles connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Put another way, the Internet is assimilating all of them. On the Internet, radio is also fracturing into new and largely (though not entirely) different spawn. The main two are streaming (for music, live news and events) and podcasting (for talk and news).</p>
<p>This sidelines the radio sources called&nbsp;stations. Think about it: how much these days do you ask yourself “What’s on?” And how much do you listen to an actual radio, or watch TV through an antenna? Do you even have a radio that’s not in a car or stored away in the garage?</p>
<p>If you value and manage your time, chances are you are using apps to store and forward your listening and viewing to later times, when you can easily speed up the program or skip over ads and other “content” you don’t want to “consume.” (I put those in quotes because only the supply side talks that way about what they produce and what you do with it.)</p>
<p>This does not match the legacy structure of radio stations. Especially technically.</p>
<p>See, the purpose of stations is to stand in one place radiating sound (called “programs”) on signals, in real time (called ‘live”), around the clock, for a limited geography: a city or a region. Key thing:&nbsp;they have to fill that time.</p>
<p>For this stations can get along without studios (like companies in our current plague have found ways to get along without offices). But they still need to maintain transmitters with antennas.</p>
<p>For AM, which was born in the 1920s, the waves are so long that whole towers, or collections of them, radiate the signals. In almost all cases these facilities take up acres of real estate—sometimes dozens of acres. For FM and TV, media born in the 1940s, the waves are short, but need to radiate from high places: atop towers, tall buildings or mountains.</p>
<p>Maintaining these facilities isn’t cheap. In the case of AM stations, it is now common for the land under towers to be worth far more than the stations themselves, which is why so many AM stations are now going off the air or moving off to share other stations’ facilities, usually at the cost of lost coverage.</p>
<p>This is why I am sure that&nbsp;most or all of these facilities will be as gone as horse-drawn carriages and steam engines, sometime in the next few years or decades. Also why I am documenting transmitters that still stand, photographically. You can see a collection of my transmitter and antenna photos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums">here</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=relevance&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=transmitter">here</a>. (The image above is what radiates KPCC/89.3 from Mt. Wilson, which overlooks Los Angeles.)</p>
<p>It’s a safe bet, for a few more years at least, that stations will still be around, transmitting to people mostly on the Net. But at some point (probably many points) the transmitters will be gone, simply because they cost too much, don’t do enough—and in one significant way, do too much. Namely, fill the clock, 24/7, with “content.”</p>
<p>To help get our heads around this, consider this: the word&nbsp;station <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station">derives</a> from the Latin&nbsp;station- and&nbsp;statio&nbsp;from stare, which means&nbsp;to stand. In a place.</p>
<p>In the terrestrial world, we needed stationary places for carriages, trains and busses to stop. On radio, we used to need what we called a “dial,” where radio stations could be found on stationary positions called channels or frequencies. Now those are numbers that appear in a read-out.</p>
<p>But even those were being obsolesced decades ago in Europe. There a car radio might say the name of a station, which might be received on any number of frequencies, transmitted by many facilities, spread across a region or a country. What makes this possible is a standard called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Data_System">RDS</a>, which uses a function called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_frequency">alternative frequency</a>&nbsp;(AF) to make a radio play a given station on whatever channel sounds best to the radio. This would be ideal for the CBC in Canada and for regional public stations such as WAMC, KPCC, KUER and KCRW, which all have many transmitters scattered around.</p>
<p>Alas, when this standard was being worked out in the ’80s and early ’90s, the North American folks couldn’t imagine one station on many frequencies and in many locations, so they&nbsp;deployed a lesser derivative standard called RDBS, which lacked the AF function.</p>
<p>But this is now, and on its 50th anniversary public radio—and&nbsp;NPR stations especially—are doing well.</p>
<p>In radio ratings for <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001">New Yo</a><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001">rk</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb003">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb009">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">Washington</a>, <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb063">San Diego</a>, and dozens of other markets, the top news station is an NPR one. Here in <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb591">Santa Barbara</a><a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb001"></a>, about a quarter of all listening goes to non-commercial stations, led by <a href="https://www.kclu.org/">KCLU</a>, the most local of the NPR affiliates with transmitters here. (Best I can tell, Santa Barbara, which I wrote about <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">here</a> in 2019, is still the top market for public radio in the country. Number two is still <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">Vermont</a>.)</p>
<p>But I gotta wonder how long the station-based status quo will remain stationary in our listening habits. To the degree that I’m a one-person bellwether, the prospects aren’t good. Nearly all my listening these days is to podcasts or to streams on the Net. Some of those are from stations, but most are straight from producers, only one of which is NPR. And I listen to few of them live.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a good bet that NPR will do well for decades to come. Its main challenge will be to survive the end of station-based live broadcasting. Because that eventuality is starting to become visible.</p>

     <p>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendykimsmith/">Wendy Smith</a>&nbsp; https://www.learninginnovationslab.org/guest-faculty/</p><br><p>The importance of creating or seeing a paradox is that you can understand that the data and facts being presented to you can lead to the recommendation or conclusion being offered, but equally that the same data and facts can equally lead to a different conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is that we are not very good at finding flaws in our own arguments, if for no other reason than they support our incentives and beliefs. We tend to take it personally when someone attacks our logic, beliefs or method, even if they are searching for the paradox. Equally, the person you are about to question reacts just like you do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Searching for the paradox allows you to see the jumps, assumptions and framing in the logic being presented, which lays bare how our thinking and decisions are being manipulated.&nbsp; Often it turns out, others are blinded to see one conclusion, and as a leader and executive, your role is to explore and question the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Logical flow decisions often create paradoxes because of an invalid argument, but they are nevertheless valuable in creating a narrative. We see this as a statement or proposition which, despite sound (or apparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory.&nbsp; Finding a paradox in non-logical flow decisions reveals errors in definitions that were assumed to be rigorous. Equally,&nbsp; a paradox can be seen when a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition, which when investigated, proves to be well-founded or true. &nbsp; What is evident is the need for critical thinking, questions and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>Just because an idea pops into your head during a presentation doesn’t mean it’s true or reasonable. Idea bias is a new skinny belief you have just created, leading you to poor decision making as you have been framed. Often in a meeting, the framing is such that the presenter has set up a story or analogy which you believe in and fail to create new questions about (idea bias); as a way to make the logic jumps needed to justify a story.&nbsp; If you cannot see the paradox, you are in their model, which means you are unlikely to make an unbiased decision.&nbsp; If you can see the paradox you have mastered critical thinking and can use tools to ensure you make decisions that lead to outcomes that you want.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If you cannot see the paradox, you are in a model.</p><br><p>Decision-making framing itself create paradox’s for us&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox">Prevention paradox</a>: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behaviour — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer, from the change.&nbsp; An assumption about the adoption of a product.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making_paradox">Decision-making paradox</a>: Picking “the best decision-making method” is a decision problem in itself.

<p>This article shows how to create and issue verifiable credentials using <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> and an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Core</a>. The ASP.NET Core application allows an admin user to create an OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR service. The credentials are displayed in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page web UI as a QR code for the users of the application. The user can use a digital <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">wallet</a> form MATTR to scan the QR code, authenticate against an <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> identity provider configured for this flow and use the claims from the id token to add the verified credential to the digital wallet. In a follow up post, a second application will then use the verified credentials to allow access to a second business process. </p>

<p>Setup</p>



<p>The solutions involves an MATTR API which handles all the blockchain identity logic.  An ASP.NET Core application is used to create the digital identity and the OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR APIs and also present this as a QR code which can be scanned. An identity provider is required to add the credential properties to the id token. The properties in a verified credential are issued using the claims values from the id token so a specific identity provider is required with every credential issuer using this technic. Part of the business of this solution is adding business claims to the identity provider. A MATTR digital wallet is required to scan the QR code, authenticate against the OIDC provider which in our case is Auth0 and then store the verified credentials to the wallet for later use.</p>







<p>MATTR Setup</p>



<p>You need to register with MATTR and create a new account. MATTR will issue you access to your sandbox domain and you will get access data from them plus a link to support. </p>



<p>Once setup, use the OIDC Bridge tutorial to implement the flow used in this demo. The docs are really good but you need to follow the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">docs</a> exactly. </p>



<p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc</a></p>



<p>Auth0 Setup</p>



<p>A standard trusted web application which supports the code flow is required so that the MATTR digital wallet can authenticate using the identity provider and use the id token values from the claims which are required in the credential. It is important to create a new application which is only used for this because the client secret is required when creating the OIDC credential issuer and is shared with the MATTR platform. It would probably be better to use certificates instead of a shared secret which is persisted in different databases. We also use a second Auth0 application configuration to sign into the web application but this is not required to issue credentials. </p>



<p>In Auth0, rules are used to extend the id token claims. You need to add your claims as required by the MATTR API and your business logic for the credentials you wish to issue.</p>


  function (user, context, callback) {
    const namespace = 'https://--your-tenant--.vii.mattr.global/';
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_issued_at'] = user.user_metadata.license_issued_at;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'license_type'] = user.user_metadata.license_type;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'name'] = user.user_metadata.name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'first_name'] = user.user_metadata.first_name;
    context.idToken[namespace + 'date_of_birth'] = user.user_metadata.date_of_birth;
    callback(null, user, context);
}
  


<p>For every user (holder) who should be able to create verifiable credentials, you must add the credential data to the user profile. This is part of the business process with this flow. If you were to implement this for a real application with lots of users, it would probably be better to integrate the identity provider into the solution issuing the credentials and add a UI for editing the user profile data which is used in the credentials. This would be really easy using ASP.NET Core Identity and for example OpenIddict or IdentityServer4. It is important that the user cannot edit this data. This logic is part of the credential issuer logic and not part of the user profile.</p>



<p>After creating a new MATTR OIDC credential issuer, the callback URL needs to be added to the Open ID connect code flow client used for the digital wallet sign in.</p>







<p>Add the URL to the Allowed Callback URLs in the settings of your Auth0 application configuration for the digital wallet.</p>



<p>Implementing the OpenID Connect credentials Issuer application</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is used to create new OIDC credential issuers and also display the QR code for these so that the verifiable credential can be loaded to the digital wallet. The application requires secrets. The data is stored to a database, so that any credential can be added to a wallet at a later date and also so that you can find the credentials you created. The MattrConfiguration is the data and the secrets you received from MATTR for you account access to the API. The Auth0 configuration is the data required to sign in to the application. The Auth0Wallet configuration is the data required to create the OIDC credential issuer so that the digital wallet can authenticate the identity using the Auth0 application. This data is stored in the user secrets during development.</p>


  {
  // use user secrets
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "--your-connection-string--"
  },
  "MattrConfiguration": {
    "Audience": "https://vii.mattr.global",
    "ClientId": "--your-client-id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--your-client-secret--",
    "TenantId": "--your-tenant--",
    "TenantSubdomain": "--your-tenant-sub-domain--",

    "ClientSecret": "--your-auth0-wallet-client-secret--",
  }
}
  


<p>Accessing the MATTR APIs</p>



<p>The MattrConfiguration DTO is used to fetch the MATTR account data for the API access and to use in the application.</p>


  public class MattrConfiguration
{
	public string Audience { get; set; }
	public string ClientId { get; set; }
	public string ClientSecret { get; set; }
	public string TenantId { get; set; }
	public string TenantSubdomain { get; set; }
	public string Url { get; set; }
}
  


<p>The MattrTokenApiService is used to acquire an access token and used for the MATTR API access. The token is stored to a cache and only fetched if the old one has expired or is not available.</p>


  public class MattrTokenApiService
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;MattrTokenApiService&gt; _logger;
	private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

	private static readonly Object _lock = new Object();
	private IDistributedCache _cache;

	private const int cacheExpirationInDays = 1;

	private class AccessTokenResult
	{
		public string AcessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string access_token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public int expires_in { get; set; }
		public string token_type { get; set; }
		public string scope { get; set; }
	}

	private class MattrCrendentials
	{
		public string audience { get; set; }
		public string client_id { get; set; }
		public string client_secret { get; set; }
		public string grant_type { get; set; } = "client_credentials";
	}

	public MattrTokenApiService(
			IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
			IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory,
			ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
			IDistributedCache cache)
	{
		_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
		_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;MattrTokenApiService&gt;();
		_cache = cache;
	}

	public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetApiToken(HttpClient client, string api_name)
	{
		var accessToken = GetFromCache(api_name);

		if (accessToken != null)
		{
			if (accessToken.ExpiresIn &gt; DateTime.UtcNow)
			{
				return accessToken.AcessToken;
			}
			else
			{
				// remove  =&gt; NOT Needed for this cache type
			}
		}

		_logger.LogDebug($"GetApiToken new from oauth server for {api_name}");

		// add
		var newAccessToken = await GetApiTokenClient(client);
		AddToCache(api_name, newAccessToken);

		return newAccessToken.AcessToken;
	}

	private async Task&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt; GetApiTokenClient(HttpClient client)
	{
		try
		{
			var payload = new MattrCrendentials
			{
				client_id = _mattrConfiguration.ClientId,
				client_secret = _mattrConfiguration.ClientSecret,
				audience = _mattrConfiguration.Audience
			};

			var authUrl = "https://auth.mattr.global/oauth/token";
			var tokenResponse = await client.PostAsJsonAsync(authUrl, payload);

			if (tokenResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
			{
				var result = await tokenResponse.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;AccessTokenItem&gt;();
				DateTime expirationTime = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(result.expires_in).DateTime;
				return new AccessTokenResult
				{
					AcessToken = result.access_token,
					ExpiresIn = expirationTime
				};
			}

			_logger.LogError($"tokenResponse.IsError Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			_logger.LogError($"Exception {e}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}

	private void AddToCache(string key, AccessTokenResult accessTokenItem)
	{
		var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions().SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromDays(cacheExpirationInDays));

		lock (_lock)
		{
			_cache.SetString(key, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(accessTokenItem), options);
		}
	}

	private AccessTokenResult GetFromCache(string key)
	{
		var item = _cache.GetString(key);
		if (item != null)
		{
			return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt;(item);
		}

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>Generating the API DTOs using Nswag</p>



<p>The MattrOpenApiClientSevice file was generated using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag">Nswag</a> and the Open API file provided by MATTR <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref">here</a>. We only generated the DTOs using this and access the client then using a HttpClient instance. The Open API file used in this solution is deployed in the git repo.</p>



<p>Creating the OIDC credential issuer</p>



<p>The MattrCredentialsService is used to create an OIDC credentials issuer using the MATTR APIs. This is implemented using the CreateCredentialsAndCallback method. The created callback is returned so that it can be displayed in the UI and copied to the specific Auth0 application configuration. </p>


  private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
private readonly DriverLicenseCredentialsService _driverLicenseService;
private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
private readonly MattrTokenApiService _mattrTokenApiService;
private readonly MattrConfiguration _mattrConfiguration;

public MattrCredentialsService(IConfiguration configuration,
	DriverLicenseCredentialsService driverLicenseService,
	IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
	IOptions&lt;MattrConfiguration&gt; mattrConfiguration,
	MattrTokenApiService mattrTokenApiService)
{
	_configuration = configuration;
	_driverLicenseService = driverLicenseService;
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_mattrTokenApiService = mattrTokenApiService;
	_mattrConfiguration = mattrConfiguration.Value;
}

public async Task&lt;string&gt; CreateCredentialsAndCallback(string name)
{
	// create a new one
	var driverLicenseCredentials = await CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer();
	driverLicenseCredentials.Name = name;
	await _driverLicenseService.CreateDriverLicense(driverLicenseCredentials);

	var callback = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers/{driverLicenseCredentials.OidcIssuerId}/federated/callback";
	return callback;
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer method implements the different steps described in the MATTR API documentation for this. An access token for the MATTR API is created or retrieved from the cache and DID is created and the id from the DID post response is used to create the OIDC credential issuer.  The DriverLicenseCredentials is returned which is persisted to a database and the callback is created using this object.</p>


  private async Task&lt;DriverLicenseCredentials&gt; CreateMattrDidAndCredentialIssuer()
{
	HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();
	var accessToken = await _mattrTokenApiService
		.GetApiToken(client, "mattrAccessToken");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders
		.TryAddWithoutValidation("Content-Type", "application/json");

	var did = await CreateMattrDid(client);
	var oidcIssuer = await CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(client, did);

	return new DriverLicenseCredentials
	{
		Name = "not_named",
		Did = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(did),
		OidcIssuer = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(oidcIssuer),
		OidcIssuerId = oidcIssuer.Id
	};
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrDid method creates a new DID as specified by the API. The MattrOptions class is used to create the request object. This is serialized using the StringContentWithoutCharset class due to a bug in the MATTR API validation. I created this class using the blog from <a href="https://gunnarpeipman.com/httpclient-remove-charset/">Gunnar Peipman</a>.</p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt; CreateMattrDid(HttpClient client)
{
	// create did , post to dids 
	// https://learn.mattr.global/api-ref/#operation/createDid
	// https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/use-did/

	var createDidUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/core/v1/dids";

	var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocument
	{
		Method = MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateDidDocumentMethod.Key,
		Options = new MattrOptions()
	};
	var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);
	var uri = new Uri(createDidUrl);

	using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
	{
		var createDidResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

		if (createDidResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
		{
			var v1CreateDidResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateDidResponse&gt;(
					await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

			return v1CreateDidResponse;
		}

		var error = await createDidResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
	}

	return null;
}
  


<p>The MattrOptions DTO is used to create a default DID using the key type “ed25519”. See the MATTR API docs for further details.</p>


  public class MattrOptions
{
  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// The supported key types for the DIDs are ed25519 and bls12381g2. 
  /// If the keyType is omitted, the default key type that will be used is ed25519.
  /// 
  /// If the keyType in options is set to bls12381g2 a DID will be created with 
  /// a BLS key type which supports BBS+ signatures for issuing ZKP-enabled credentials.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public string keyType { get; set; } = "ed25519";
}
  


<p>The CreateMattrCredentialIssuer implements the OIDC credential issuer to create the post request. The request properties need to be setup for your credential properties and must match claims from the id token of the Auth0 user profile. This is where the OIDC client for the digital wallet is setup and also where the credential claims are specified. If this is setup up incorrectly, loading the data into your wallet will fail. The HTTP request and the response DTOs are implemented using the Nswag generated classes. </p>


  private async Task&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt; CreateMattrCredentialIssuer(HttpClient client, V1_CreateDidResponse did)
        {
            // create vc, post to credentials api
            // https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/setup-issuer

            var createCredentialsUrl = $"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/ext/oidc/v1/issuers";

            var payload = new MattrOpenApiClient.V1_CreateOidcIssuerRequest
            {
                Credential = new Credential
                {
                    IssuerDid = did.Did,
                    Name = "NationalDrivingLicense",
                    Context = new List&lt;Uri&gt; {
                         new Uri( "https://schema.org") // Only this is supported
                    },
                    Type = new List&lt;string&gt; { "nationaldrivinglicense" }
                },
                ClaimMappings = new List&lt;ClaimMappings&gt;
                {
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="name", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="firstName", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/first_name"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseType", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_type"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="dateOfBirth", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/date_of_birth"},
                    new ClaimMappings{ JsonLdTerm="licenseIssuedAt", OidcClaim=$"https://{_mattrConfiguration.TenantSubdomain}/license_issued_at"}
                },
                FederatedProvider = new FederatedProvider
                {
                    ClientId = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientId"],
                    ClientSecret = _configuration["Auth0Wallet:ClientSecret"],
                    Url = new Uri($"https://{_configuration["Auth0Wallet:Domain"]}"),
                    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" }
                }
            };

            var payloadJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(payload);

            var uri = new Uri(createCredentialsUrl);

            using (var content = new StringContentWithoutCharset(payloadJson, "application/json"))
            {
                var createOidcIssuerResponse = await client.PostAsync(uri, content);

                if (createOidcIssuerResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Created)
                {
                    var v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;V1_CreateOidcIssuerResponse&gt;(
                            await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());

                    return v1CreateOidcIssuerResponse;
                }

                var error = await createOidcIssuerResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            }

            throw new Exception("whoops something went wrong");
        }
  


<p>Now the service is completely ready to generate credentials. This can be used in any Blazor UI, Razor page or MVC view in ASP.NET Core. The services are added to the DI in the startup class. The callback method is displayed in the UI if the application successfully creates a new OIDC credential issuer.</p>


  private readonly MattrCredentialsService _mattrCredentialsService;
public bool CreatingDriverLicense { get; set; } = true;
public string Callback { get; set; }

[BindProperty]
public IssuerCredential IssuerCredential { get; set; }
public AdminModel(MattrCredentialsService mattrCredentialsService)
{
	_mattrCredentialsService = mattrCredentialsService;
}
public void OnGet()
{
	IssuerCredential = new IssuerCredential();
}

public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
{
	if (!ModelState.IsValid)
	{
		return Page();
	}

	Callback = await _mattrCredentialsService
		.CreateCredentialsAndCallback(IssuerCredential.CredentialName);
	CreatingDriverLicense = false;
	return Page();
}
}

public class IssuerCredential
{
	[Required]
	public string CredentialName { get; set; }
}
  


<p>Adding credentials you wallet</p>



<p>After the callback method has been added to the Auth0 callback URLs, the credentials can be used to add verifiable credentials to your wallet. This is fairly simple. The Razor Page uses the data from the database and generates an URL using the MATTR specification and the id from the created OIDC credential issuer. The claims from the id token or the profile data is just used to display the data for the user signed into the web application. This is not the same data which is used be the digital wallet. If the same person logs into the digital wallet, then the data is the same. The wallet authenticates the identity separately. </p>

		}
	}
}
  


<p>The data is displayed using Bootstrap. If you use a MATTR wallet to scan the QR Code shown underneath, you will be redirected to authenticate against the specified Auth0 application. If you have the claims, you can add verifiable claims to you digital wallet.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>MATTR API has a some problems with its API and a stricter validation would help a lot. But MATTR support is awesome and the team are really helpful and you will end up with a working solution. It would be also awesome if the Open API file could be used without changes to generate a client and the DTOs. It would makes sense, if you could issue credentials data from the data in the credential issuer application and not from the id token of the user profile. I understand that in some use cases, you would like to protect against any wallet taking credentials for other identities, but I as a credential issuer cannot always add my business data to user profiles from the IDP. The security of this solution all depends on the user profile data. If a non authorized person can change this data (in this case, this could be the same user), then incorrect verifiable credentials can be created. </p>



<p>Next step is to create an application to verify and use the verifiable credentials created here.</p>

     <br><p>I know the journey is more important than the destination, but destinations provide an essential point as they mark somewhere to head towards.&nbsp; All journeys start with a single step, and for me, this journey started a little over three years ago. I have spent this past period considering the question, “How do we make Better Decisions.” This question was refined to become “How do we make Better Decisions with data.” This expanded into “How do we make Better Decisions with data and be better ancestors?”&nbsp; My journey can finally see a destination.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I am now facing a more significant challenge.</p><p>Having reached the destination zone, I want to leave a mark, and it's straightforward to imagine planting a flag. The hope is that when the flag is planted some of the team back at home can see that you've reached the final place.&nbsp; In most circumstances, the destination is not in the Line-of-Sight. Therefore you pick up the flag and wave it, hoping that somebody with binoculars can see you waving your destination flag. If someone sees you, they relay it to the others that the advance party or pioneers (risk-takers and general nutters) have reached the destination. In innovation and invention land, you're tempted to stay at the destination, hoping that the others will follow you to the same place. Waiting there means you eventually run out of resources, this being cash or budget. Having run out of resources, you're faced with the reality you have to head back to where everyone else is as nobody is going to follow you to the destination; it is too risky.&nbsp; On arriving back at home, there's a bit of a party and a celebration. You relay your stories about the journey and how wonderful the destination is. &nbsp; After a few hours of partying, everybody heads back to their homes, leaving you wondering how to persuade others to go to the destination as well.</p><p>There are a series of videos on YouTube of a single dancer who starts to dance to music, and over periods of 5-minutes to several hours, the dancing crowd grows until everybody is dancing. Early adopters and supporters join the pioneer, and eventually, they are joined by the followers who make the crowd. (2021 #covid19 note, what is a crowd and what is a party?)</p><p>The next day after your return, everybody gets up and goes around their jobs and business as usual.&nbsp; What is now needed is to convert the excitement of the destination into a language and story that the first supporters and early adopters can relate to and join in. What is tremendously difficult is constructing a straightforward linear narrative and step actions, meaning the crowd can also join in and desire to get to a new destination. (crossing the chasm)&nbsp; For businesses right now, this is the digital transformation, data, circular economy, ESG, climate change, AI, ethics and sustainability.&nbsp; The pioneers have been to the destination, planted the flags, imagined the better fruits, but we have to drop the complexity of the issues and find a better story for us all to get there.</p><p>The journey I have been on for the last few years is understanding how we make better decisions.&nbsp; This means I have had to unpack numerous topics and dependencies deep in the messiness of models and complexity. Unsurprisingly there are only a few who are also motivated about understanding the complexity and philiosphy of better decisions, it is my burden. We are converting what we have found at the destination (how to make better decisions with data and be better ancestors) into a language that fellow supporters and early adopters can engage with and discuss.&nbsp;</p><p>BUT</p><p>I am now desperate for expert support to convert the ideas into straightforward narrative and actions that the crowd in the town can take on board and start their journey, but knowing where they are going has been discovered. My struggle is that I find it hard to dumb down the complex into a tweet as it cannot possibly embrace the complexity. I continually flight myself as I can see the simple is not truly representative. The PhD virologist of 30 years is given 1 minute to explain virus mutation on the news.&nbsp; The simple becomes fodder to the vocal and easily upset in social media land as it is easily misunderstood and taken out of context. I spend more time trying to justify (to myself) why I am using simple concepts to explain complex ideas.</p><p></p><p>Tribe, I need some help.&nbsp; Is there anybody out there (a nod to Pink Floyd) who is willing to spend the time in a small community helping to refine the words, language, stories, ideas and concepts into a straightforward linear narrative that portrays actions and activities, which means we can all take steps on a journey to making Better Decisions? This is not a job it is a vocation. Journeys are so much more fun when we do them together, and the next part of the journey is to do it all together. I'm looking for early adopter and supporters who can share their destinations so that together we can create a better narrative about decision making, governance and oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>Are you willing and able to help form and write a narrative to enable others to come on our journey?</p> <br>

   <p></p><p>In commercial land, the axis of power has tended to rest with the CEO/ CFO relationship. &nbsp; There is always a myriad of other political triangles that lobby and wrestle for power and sway decisions.&nbsp; Given that decisions are increasingly reliant on evidence which is data, the CDO gets dragged into everyone's battles, which are not always in the best interest of the business, customer, ecosystem or society - such are incentive scheme.</p><p>Everyone else in the senior team does not want to recognise is that the data they use as evidence and proof is equally supportive or detrimental to everyone else's cause.&nbsp; Whilst everyone else on the leadership team gets to pick and bias what they foreground and promote, the CDO has to keep their mind open and judge all data with the same level of critical thinking.&nbsp; This tends to mean the CDO becomes the punch bag when data either supports or otherwise a decision, which in reality is a political lobby for power which the data may not fully support. However, we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>we are all fallible, and data is not the evidence we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that even the most highly skilled data scientists, who were incentivised to come to the most accurate results, can create a broad range of conclusions, even when given the same data and hypothesis.&nbsp; This means that senior leadership teams don’t know if the data they have and the conclusion they have reached is correct.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent and significant published <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/cd5j9/">paper</a> gave 73 teams the same data and research question. The answers varied widely, and very little variation was easily explained. What the paper goes on to say is that competencies and potential confirmation biases do not explain the broad variation in outcomes.&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><br><p>The paper concludes that if any given study had been conducted by a different (set of) researcher(s), perhaps even the same researchers at a different time, its results may well have varied for reasons that cannot be reduced to easily observable analytical choices or biases.&nbsp; They conclude that steps in the research process remain undisclosed in the standard presentation and consumption of scientific results and have exposed a “hidden universe” of idiosyncratic research and researcher variability. An important takeaway here is that the reality of researcher decisions cannot easily be simulated.</p><p>Therefore, there are at least two forces at play in data leading to a recommendation or decision.&nbsp; One, the bias and foregrounding of data outcomes by a member of the leadership team is for a reason. Two. the same data, same tools, the same team can generate more than one recommendation.&nbsp; How to determine what is at play is a modern-day skill the CDO must-have.&nbsp;</p><p>As the CDO, you have to gain the trust of all your senior team and work with them to determine what is incentive biased, desired outcome-driven, seeking support or driven from the data set where there is naturally more than one possible conclusion.&nbsp; In doing this, you have to be capable of assessing the alignment or divergence from others in the team who have come to different conclusions. &nbsp; This becomes more complex if the data set is public, purchased, or gathered from the ecosystem with partners, as others outside of the organisation can create different conclusions. You have to be prepared to justify your reason, rationale and processes. &nbsp; The skill you need to demonstrate is one of consistency in finding a route to align any data conclusions to the company's purpose and agreed strategic goals and not to the forces of lobby. Leave those calls to the CEO knowing the CEO has your back or get out, as being the new corporate punch bag is not fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>Each leadership team member is playing their own game and is looking to the CDO to find and support data for their cause, lobby, decision or budget.&nbsp; This means that the CDO becomes the corporate punch bag and police, taking over from HR. The CDO has to navigate the path of varying conclusions and desired outcomes from the same data set, which are in conflict as they meet individuals agendas. &nbsp; As the CEO, you have to be aware of this and the game your CFO will play.&nbsp; The power axis itself of the CEO/ CFO relationship comes under stress as the CDO can give you more insights into decisions “presented because of incentives and self-interest” than anyone else, but HR will still want to own it.&nbsp; If you alienate the CDO, you will lose that linkage, which is exactly what others want.&nbsp; However, first, check that the CDO has this trust of the team and that your CDO has the capability and capacity to manage this modern-day leadership challenge.&nbsp; If not, it might be time to upgrade your CDO with new skills or find a new version.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p>Today marks an important milestone in the life of the OpenID Foundation and the worldwide digital identity community.  Following <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/19/resolution-thanking-don-thibeau-for-his-service/">Don Thibeau’s decade of exemplary service to the OpenID Foundation as its Executive Director</a>, today we <a href="https://openid.net/2021/04/28/welcoming-gail-hodges-as-our-new-executive-director/">welcomed Gail Hodges as our new Executive Director</a>.</p>
<p>Don was instrumental in the creation of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, the <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a> program, the <a href="https://fapi.openid.net/">Financial-grade API (FAPI)</a>, and its ongoing worldwide adoption.  He’s created and nurtured numerous liaison relationships with organizations and initiatives advancing digital identity and user empowerment worldwide.  And thankfully, Don intends to stay active in digital identity and the OpenID Foundation, including supporting Gail in her new role.</p>
<p>Gail’s <a href="https://twitter.com/gailhodges">Twitter</a> motto is “Reinventing identity as a public good”, which I believe will be indicative of the directions in which she’ll help lead the OpenID Foundation.  She has extensive leadership experience in both digital identity and international finance, as described in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gail-hodges-26b1b9/">LinkedIn profile</a>.  The board is thrilled to have her on board and looks forward to what we’ll accomplish together in this next exciting chapter of the OpenID Foundation!</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to come meet Gail at the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/openid-foundation-virtual-workshop-tickets-143831524963">OpenID Foundation Workshop tomorrow</a>, where she’ll introduce herself to the OpenID community.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Why are some decentralized systems accepted and widely used while others wither? Why do some “hard forks” succeed while others fail? It all comes down to legitimacy.</p>





<p>
    As an undergraduate engineering major, I recall being surprised by the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem">three body problem</a>. In Newtonian mechanics, there are nice closed-form solutions to problems involving the motion of two interacting bodies, given their initial position and velocity. This isn’t true of systems with three or more points. How can adding just one more point to the system make it unsolvable?
</p>
<p>
    N-body systems are chaotic for most initial conditions and their solution involves numerical methods—simulation—rather than nice, undergraduate-level math. In other words, it’s messy. Humans like simple solutions.
</p>

<p>
    Like the n-body problem, decentralized systems are chaotic and messy. Humans aren’t good at reasoning about emergent behavior from the coordinated, yet autonomous, behavior of interacting agents. We build bureaucracies and enact laws to try to make chaotic systems legible. The internet was our first, large-scale technical system where decentralization and governance clashed. I remember people in the 90’s asking “Who’s in charge of the internet?”

<p>
    In <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a>, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, discusses why legitimacy is crucial for the success of any decentralized endeavor. He says:
</p>
<blockquote>[T]he Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems are capable of summoning up billions of dollars of capital, but have strange and hard-to-understand restrictions on where that capital can go.
     From <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a><br>Referenced 2021-04-26T14:46:43-0600
     </blockquote>
<p>
    These “strange and hard to understand restrictions” are rooted in legitimacy. Decentralized systems must be considered legitimate in order to thrive. That legitimacy is tied to how well the systems and people enabling them, like programmers and miners, are seen to be following “the rules” both written and unwritten. Legitimacy isn’t a technical issue, but a social one.
</p>

<p>
    Wikipedia defines legitimacy as
</p>
<blockquote>
    the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.
</blockquote>
<p>
    While this is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that have large impacts on people and society.
</p>

<p>
    With respect to legitimacy, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B009W6VK70/windleyofente-20">Philip Bobbit</a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
    The defining characteristic … of a constitutional order is its basis for legitimacy. The constitutional order of the industrial nation state, within which we currently live, promised: give us power and we will improve the material well-being of the nation.
</blockquote>

<p>
    In other words, legitimacy comes from the constitutional order: the structure of the governance and its explicit and implicit promises. People grant legitimacy to constitutional orders that meet their expectations by surrendering part of their sovereignty to them. In the quote from Vilaik above, the "strange and hard to understand restrictions" are promises that members of the Bitcoin or Ethreum ecosystems believe those constitutional orders have made. And if they're broken, the legitimacy of those system is threatened. 
</p>
<p>
    Talking about “legitimacy” and “constitutional orders” for decentralized systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or your favorite NFT might feel strange, but I believe these are critical tools for understanding why some thrive and others wither. Or why some hard forks succeed and others don't. 
</p>

<p>
    In Bobbitt’s theory of constitutional orders, transitions from one constitutional order to a new one always requires war. While people seeking legitimacy for one decentralized system or another might not use tanks or missiles, a hard fork is essentially just that—a war fought to cause the transition from one constitutional order to another because of a question of legitimacy. For example, Vitalik describes how the Steem community did a hard fork to create Hive, leaving Steem’s founder (and his tokens) behind because the constitutional order he represented lost its legitimacy because people believed it could no longer keep its promises. 
</p>
<p>
    So when you hear someone talking about a decentralized system and starting sentences with phrases like “Somebody should…” or “Why do we let them…” or “Who’s in charge of…”, beware. Unlike most of the easy to understand systems we’re familiar with, decentralized systems are heterarchical, not hierarchical. Thus the means of their control is political, not authoritarian. These systems are not allowed to exist—they're called "permissionless" for a reason. They simply are, by virtue of their legitimacy in the eyes of people who use and support them.
</p>

<p>
    This doesn’t mean decentralized systems are unassailable, but changing them is slower and less sure than most people would like. When you “know” the right way to do something, you want a boss who can dictate the change. Changing decentralized systems is a political process that sometimes requires war. As Clausewitz said “War is the continuation of politics by other means.”
</p>

<p>
    There are no closed-form solutions to the n-body problems represented by decentralized systems. They are messy and chaotic. I’m not sure people will ever get more comfortable with decentralization or understand it well enough to reason about it carefully. But one thing is for sure: decentralized systems don’t care. They simply are.

  <a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/04/21/the-verifiable-economy-architecture-reference-model-ve-arm/">The Verifiable Economy: Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) 0.1: Original Concepts&nbsp;[OLD]</a>  



 1. Introduction 



 1.1 Goals 



<p>The goals of this article are three-fold:</p>



  Introduce the concept of a Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCA) and how they can be used to implement controls over which specific methods a particular party is allowed to execute against a particular instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). VCAs are both delegatable and attenuatable.  Illustrate how <a>#graphitization techniques</a> can be used for modeling and visualizing:  Trusted Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  DID Documents  Trusted Digital Agents (and their Service Endpoints (SEPs))  Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) and,   Most importantly, their myriad of interrelationships.    Use the above 2 goals to further detail and describe how to use the VE-ARM model for implementing trusted, reliable, efficient, frictionless, standards-based, global-scale software systems based on Fully Decentralized Objects (FDOs).  



 1.2 Purpose 



<p>This article takes the following “All-in” graph view of The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) and partitions it into a series of subgraphs that depict the key elements of the overall architecture reference model for FDOs. Each subgraph is documented with a narrative that is mapped to the numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/ve2-f0.png"></a>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve1-0.3-legend.png"></a>Figure 1. Subgraph 0. The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM)



<p>The above graphitization is the result of a several iterations validating The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) against the following live scenario:</p>



<blockquote><p>Erin acquiring a personal DID and DID Document to enable Erin to acquire a Province of Sovronia Driver’s License (SDL) (represented as an FDO) and hold the SDL in Erin’s digital wallet.</p><a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/29/tdw-glossary-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-user-scenarios-erin-buys-a-car-in-sovronia-3-user-scenarios/">T</a><a href="https://hyperonomy.com/2021/03/29/tdw-glossary-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-user-scenarios-erin-buys-a-car-in-sovronia-3-user-scenarios/">DW Glossary: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) User Scenarios: Erin Buys a Car in Sovronia (3 User&nbsp;Scenarios)</a></blockquote>



<p>A Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) is comprised of the following minimal elements:</p>



  DID (and correspond DID Document)  Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) for the object’s DID and DID Document  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above MVCA for the object (recursively)  A Property Set for the FDO  Property Set DID (and corresponding DID Document)    Property Set MVCA that is issued when the Property Set’s DID and DID Document is issued.  Property Set Verifiable Credential (VC) is issued to hold the object’s properties and their values  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the FDO’s Property Set MVCA (recursively)    A Trusted Digital Agent registered with a Service Endpoint (SEP) in the object’s DID Document that implements the VCA-controlled methods for accessing and interacting with the object and/or it’s property set. Control over which methods are invokable by a party is controlled by the respective MVCAs and a Delegated Directed Graphs of VCAs (if there are any).  



<p>The goal and purpose of the VE-ARM is to describe a Fully-Decentralized Object (FDO) model that unites the following concepts into a single integrated, operational model:</p>



  Verifiable Identifiers, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and DID Documents;  Verifiable Claims, Relationships, and Verifiable Credentials (VCs);   Master Verifiable Capability Authorizations (MVCA) (Master Proclamations), Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) (Proclamations), Verifiable Capability Authorization Method Invocations (MIs); and  Trusted Digital Agents (TDAs).  



 1.3 Background 



<p>The scenario used to model the VE-ARM is an example of a citizen (Erin) of a fictional Canadian province called Sovronia holding a valid physical Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL) as well as a digital, verifiable Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin SDL).</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/drivers-license-erin-amanda-lee-anderson-larged.png"></a> Figure 2. Erin’s “Real World” Sovronia Driver’s License (Erin RW SDL) 



 1.4 Graphitization of the Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM)  



<p>The underlying model was built automatically using a series of <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Cypher queries running against a collection of actual DID Document, Verifiable Credential, and Verifiable Capability Authorization JSON files. The visualization was laid out using the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/?from=Parallelspace">Neo4j </a>Browser. The resulting layout was manually optimized to produce the final version of the graphitization used in this article. The numbered targets used to identify each element in each subgraph were added using Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>



 2. Organization of this Article 



<p>Following a list of Key Definitions, the remainder of this article is organized as a series of increasingly more detailed explanations of the VE-ARM model. The overall model is partitioned into a collection of (overlapping) subgraphs. </p>



<p>Each subgraph is described by a narrative that explains the purpose of each element in the particular subgraph. Each narrative is organized as a list of numbered bullets that further describe to the corresponding  numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph .</p>



<blockquote><p>A narrative is a story. It recounts a series of events that have taken place. … These essays are telling a story in order to drive a point home. Narration, however, is the act of telling a story. </p><a href="https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-narration.html">Examples of Narration: 3 Main Types in Literature</a></blockquote>

 3. Key Definitions 



<p>Several of the following definitions (those related to the concept oferifiable capability authorizations) are inspired by the following RWoT5 article:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/draft-documents/lds-ocap/lds-ocap.md">Linked Data Capabilities</a> by Christopher Lemmer Webber and Mark S. Miller  



<p>Additional context can be found in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data v0.3</a>.</p>



  3.1 VE-ARM Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) Model 



<p>The VE-ARM Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) model used to grant the authority to specific parties to invoke specific methods against an instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). The VE-ARM VCA model is based, in part, on the Object-Capability Model. The VE-ARM VCA model supports Delegation and Attenuation.</p>



 3.2 Object Capability Model 



<blockquote><p>The object-capability model is a computer security model. A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination:</p><p>– An unforgeable reference (in the sense of object references or protected pointers) that can be sent in messages.<br>– A message that specifies the operation to be performed.</p>Object-Capability Model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model</a>)</blockquote>



 3.3 VCA Model Principles Delegation and Attenuation 



<blockquote><p>With delegation, a capability holder can transfer his capability to another entity, whereas with attenuation he can confine a capability before delegating it.</p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11515.pdf">Capability-based access control for multi-tenant systems using OAuth 2.0 and Verifiable Credentials</a></blockquote>



 3.4 Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) 



<p>In The Verifiable Economy, a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) is comprised of the following minimal elements:</p>



  DID (and correspond DID Document)  Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) for the object’s DID and DID Document  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the above MVCA for the object (recursively)  A Property Set for the FDO  Property Set DID (and corresponding DID Document)    Property Set MVCA that is issued when the Property Set’s DID and DID Document is issued.  Property Set Verifiable Credential (VC) is issued to hold the object’s properties and their values  Zero or more Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) linked to the FDO’s Property Set MVCA (recursively)    An Trusted Digital Agent registered with a Service Endpoint (SEP) in the object’s DID Document that implements the VCA-controlled methods for accessing and interacting with the object and/or it’s property set. Control over which methods are invokable by a party is controlled by the respective MVCAs and a Delegated Directed Graphs of VCAs (if there are any).  



 3.5 Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) Model 



<p>A complete decentralized object system based on the concept of FDOs.</p>



 3.6 Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) 



<p>A Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) is a JSON-LD structure that grants (or restricts) a specific party (the controller of a key (grantedKey)) the ability to invoke specific methods against a specific instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). A VCA typically has a type of Proclamation (unless it is a Method Invocation VCA).</p>



<p>A VCA has the following properties:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA  type – “Proclamation”  parent – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for a parent VCA whose control supersedes this current VCA.  subject – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier of the specific instance of the FDO.    grantedKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to whom the specified capabilities are being granted specifically with respect to the specific instance of the FDO.  caveat – the collection of specific capabilities the party represented by grantedKey is granted (or restricted) from invoking against a specific instance of the FDO identified by the subject identifier.  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>NOTE: The current VCA’s capabilities must be equal to or an attenuation of the parent VCA’s capabilities. This part of the VCA model is recursive.</p>



<p>NOTE: An FDO can be an object or a service represented as an object.</p>



<p>The following is an example of a VCA associated with Erin and Erin’s Sovronia Driver’s License Property Set.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetvca.png"></a>Snippet 1. Verifiable Credential Authorization (VCA) Example



 3.7 Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) 



<p>A Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) is a Proclamation-type VCA that is created for every FDO at the time that the DID and DID Document for the FDO is issued by a Trusted Decentralized Identity Provider (TDIDP) (e.g. SOVRONIA).</p>



<p>That is, a new MVCA is created whenever a new DID and DID Document are issued by a TDIDP. The MVCA typically grants authorization for any and all methods to the controller of the DID. (This is the essence of the definition of self-sovereign identity principle.)  </p>



<p>An MVCA has the following properties:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA  type – “Proclamation” (or “Invocation”)  subject – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier of the specific instance of the FDO.  An FDO can be an object or a service represented as an object.  grantedKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to whom the specified capabilities are being granted specifically with respect to the specific instance of the FDO.  caveat – the collection of specific capabilities the party represented by grantedKey is granted (or restricted) from invoking against a specific instance of the FDO identified by the subject identifier. Typically, this is set to RestrictToMethod( * ) granting the controller of the grantedKey to execute any and all methods against the subject. (This is where and how the essence of the definition of the self-sovereign identity principle is realized.)  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>NOTE: A MVCA has no parent property because an MVCA always represents the top-level root VCA in a Delegated Directed Graphs of Verifiable Capability Authorizations (see below). </p>



<p>The following is an example of a MVCA for Erin’s Sovronia Drivers License Property Set. This MVCA is the parent of the above VCA.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetmvca.png"></a>Snippet 2. Master Verifiable Credential Authorization (MVCA) Example



 3.8 VCA Method Invocation (MI) 



<p>A VCA Method Invocation (MI) is a JSON-LD structure that attempts to invoke a specific method against a specific instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO) on behalf of a specific invoking party. An MI is of type Invocation (not Proclamation).</p>



<p>An MI has the following properties:</p>



  id – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the MI  type – “Invocation”  proclamation – trusted, verifiable decentralized identifier for the VCA to be used for this MI against the specific instance of an FDO by a specific party (Proclamation VCA).  method – specific name of the method to be invoked against the specific instance of an FDO by a specific party.  usingKey – trusted, verifiable key of the party to be used to attempt the invocation of the above method against a specific instance of the FDO.  signature – trusted, verifiable proof that this VCA is legitimate.   



<p>NOTE: An MI doesn’t have a subject property. The target object is specified by the subject property of the proclamation VCA.</p>



<blockquote><p>A very important point you make is, “NOTE: An MI doesn’t have a subject property. The target object is specified by the subject property of the proclamation VCA.”&nbsp; That point is so important, not separating designation from authorization, that I’d like to see it in bold.</p>Alan Karp <a href="mailto:alanhkarp@gmail.com">alanhkarp@gmail.com</a>, May 17, 2021 CCG Mailing List</blockquote>



<p>The following is an example of a MI that attempts to invoke the Present method on behalf of Erin against Erin’s Sovronia Drivers License Property Set. The referenced VCA is the VCA example from above.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-erinssovroniadriverslicensepropsetmi.png"></a>Snippet 3. Verifiable Credential Authorization Method Invocation (MI) Example 



 3.9 Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations 



<p>A Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations is a directed list of VCAs that starts with an MVCA as it’s top-level, root VCA. Each VCA in the graph points to the previous VCA in the graph via its parent property. An MI, in turn, refers to a single VCA in the graph via the MI’s proclamation property. The capabilities in effect are those that are specifically listed in the target VCA’s caveat property. While there is no inheritance of capabilities in this model, the capabilities specified by each VCA must be equal or less than (a subset of) the capabilities of the parent VCA (see the definition of Principles of Delegation and Attenuation).</p>



<p>The above examples of an MVCA, a VCA, and an MI, taken together, form an example of a Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations.</p>



<a href="https://hyperonomy.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/ve2-delegated-chain-of-vcas-2.png"></a>Figure 3. Delegated Directed Graph of Verifiable Capability Authorizations Example



<p>3.8.1 Narrative</p>



<p>17. Erin SDL Prop Set MVCA. Erin SDL Prop Set MVCA is the Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MVCA) created for Erin’s SDL Prop Set (DD) at the time that the DID and DID Document were first issued by SOVRONA on behalf of the Province of Sovronia for Erin’s SDL. (A new MVCA is created whenever a new DID and DID Document are issued by a TDIDP. The MVCA grants authorization for any and all methods defined for the subject to the effective issuer. In this case, the effective issuer is the Province of Sovronia.)</p>



<p>18. Erin SDL VCA. Erin SDL VCA is the Verifiable Capability Authorization (VCA) created for Erin’s SDL Prop Set DD. The VCA was issued by the Province of Sovronia authorizing Erin to be able to present the properties (and their values) of Erin’s SDL to a third party using the Present method associated with Erin’s SDL Prop Set and supported (implemented) by Erin’s AGENT. The parent of Erin’s SDL VCA is the Erin SDL MVCA.</p>



<p>19. Erin SDL VCA MI. Erin SDL VCA MI is an example of a MVCA Method Invocation (VCA MI) that uses the Erin SCL VCA which authorizes the potential execution of the Present method by Erin against Erin’s SDL Prop Set.</p>



 3.10 Resource Servers and Authentication Servers 



<blockquote><p>A resource server that hosts a protected resource owned by a resource owner, a client wishing to access that resource, and an authorization server responsible for generating access tokens. Access tokens are granted to clients authorized by the resource owner: client authorization is proven using an authorization grant. In our system we are using the ‘client credentials’ grant. As it can be seen from Fig. 1, when this type of grant is used, a resource owner configures the authentication server with the credentials of the authorized clients; a client authenticates to the authorization server and receives an access token, then it uses the access token to access the protected resource.</p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11515.pdf">Capability-based access control for multi-tenant systems using OAuth 2.0 and Verifiable Credentials</a></blockquote>



<p>Although these terms are not currently used in the VE-ARM, the resource server role is assigned to the FDO AGENT specified in the subject’s DID document. The authorization server role is assigned to the actor who is responsible for creating Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs). In the current example, SOVORONIA hosts the authorization server on behalf of either the Province of Sovronia or Erin.</p>



 4. VE-ARM Principles 



<p>The following principles are used to guide The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM):</p>



  DD MVCA Principle. Every DID (and DID Document) has a corresponding Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MCVA). Whenever a DID and corresponding DID Document is issued, a corresponding Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (MCVA) is automatically created. See F2 in Figure 1. Snippet 4 is an example of a DID Document Master Verifiable Capability Authorization (DD MVCA).  Property Set VC Principle. All of the properties (and their values), a Property Set, for a particular decentralized object are stored in a Verifiable Credential (VC) that has an id value that is equal to the DID id of the decentralized object. See F6 in Figure 6. Snippet 5 is a partial example of a Property Set Verifiable Credential (PS VC).

 12. Conclusions 



<p>The goals of this article are three-fold:</p>



  Introduce the concept of a Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCA) and how they can be used to implement controls over which specific methods a particular party is allowed to execute against a particular instance of a Fully Decentralized Object (FDO). VCAs are both delegatable and attenuatable.  Illustrate how <a>#graphitization techniques</a> can be used for visualizing:  Trusted Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  DID Documents  Trusted Digital Agents (and their Service Endpoints (SEPs))  Verifiable Credentials (VCs)  Verifiable Capability Authorizations (VCAs) and,   Most importantly, their myriad of interrelationships.    Use the above 2 goals to further detail and describe how to use the VE-ARM model for implementing trusted, reliable, efficient, frictionless, standards-based, global-scale software systems based on Fully Decentralized Objects (FDOs).  



<p>This article described The Verifiable Economy Architecture Reference Model (VE-ARM) using a #graphiziation approach for modeling and visualization.  The resulting overall graph was partitioned into a series of subgraphs that depict the key elements of the architecture reference model. Each subgraph was documented with a narrative that is mapped to the numbered blue targets used to identify each element in each subgraph . </p>

<p>This post shows how an ASP.NET Core Web API and an ASP.NET Core Razor page application can be implemented to use windows authentication. The Razor page application uses Javascript to display an autocomplete control which gets the data indirectly from the service API which is protected using windows authentication. The Razor Page application uses the API to get the auto-complete suggestions data. Both applications are protected using windows authentication.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/PoCWindowsAuth">https://github.com/damienbod/PoCWindowsAuth</a></p>



<p>Setup the API</p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core demo API is setup to use windows authentication. The launch settings windowsAuthentication property is set to true and the anonymousAuthentication property to false. The application host file settings on your development PC would also need to be configured to allow windows authentication, which is disabled by default. See the stack overflow link at the bottom for more information.</p>


  {
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": true,
    "anonymousAuthentication": false,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:44364",
      "sslPort": 44364
    }
  },
  


<p>The Startup ConfigureServices method is configured to require authentication using the IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme scheme. This would need to be changed if you were using a different hosting model.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

	services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(option =&gt;
		option.JsonSerializerOptions
              .PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase);
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	if (env.IsDevelopment())
	{
		app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	}

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The API is protected using the authorize attribute. This example returns the user name from the windows authentication.</p>


  [Authorize]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class MyDataController : ControllerBase
{

	private readonly ILogger&lt;MyDataController&gt; _logger;

	public MyDataController(ILogger&lt;MyDataController&gt; logger)
	{
		_logger = logger;
	}

	[HttpGet]
	public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Get()
	{
		return new List&lt;string&gt; { User.Identity.Name };
	}
}
  


<p>Implement the ASP.NET Core Razor pages</p>



<p>The application calling the API also requires windows authentication and requests the data from the API project. The HttpClient instance requesting the data from the API project must send the default credentials with each API call. A HttpClientHandler is used to implement this. The HttpClientHandler is added to a named AddHttpClient service  which can be used anywhere in the application.</p>


  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

	services.AddHttpClient();

	HttpClientHandler handler = new HttpClientHandler()
	{
		UseDefaultCredentials = true
	};

	services.AddHttpClient("windowsAuthClient", c =&gt;{ })
		.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(() =&gt; handler);

	services.AddScoped&lt;MyDataClientService&gt;();
	services.AddRazorPages().AddJsonOptions(option =&gt;
		option.JsonSerializerOptions
			.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase);
}
  


<p>A client service is implemented to call the API from the second project. This client uses the IHttpClientFactory to create instances of the HttpClient. The CreateClient method is used to create an instance using the named client which was configured in the Startup class. This instance will send credentials to the API.</p>


  public MyDataClientService(
	IConfiguration configurations,
	IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
{
	_configurations = configurations;
	_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	_jsonSerializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions
	{
		PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true,
	};
}

public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetMyData()
{
	try
	{
		var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("windowsAuthClient");
		client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configurations["MyApiUrl"]);

		var response = await client.GetAsync("api/MyData");
		if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
		{
			var data = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
			await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

			return data;
		}

		var error = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
		throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}, Message: {error}");

	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
		throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
	}
}
  


<p>Javascript UI</p>



<p>If using Javascript to call the API protected with window authentication, this can become a bit tricky due to CORS when using windows authentication. I prefer to avoid this and use a backend to proxy the calls from my trusted backend to the API. The OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest method is used to call the API. The would also make it easy to map DTOs from my API to my view DTOs as required.</p>


   public class IndexModel : PageModel
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;IndexModel&gt; _logger;
        private readonly MyDataClientService _myDataClientService;
        public List&lt;string&gt; DataFromApi;
        public string SearchText { get; set; }
        public List&lt;PersonCity&gt; PersonCities;

        public IndexModel(MyDataClientService myDataClientService,
            ILogger&lt;IndexModel&gt; logger)
        {
            _myDataClientService = myDataClientService;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public async Task OnGetAsync()
        {
            DataFromApi = await _myDataClientService.GetMyData();
        }

        public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; OnGetAutoCompleteSuggest(string term)
        {
            PersonCities = await _myDataClientService.Suggest(term);
            SearchText = term;

            return new JsonResult(PersonCities);
        }
    }
  


<p>The Razor Page underneath uses an autocomplete implemented in Javascript to suggest data requested from the API. Any Javascript framework can be used in this way.</p>


  @page "{handler?}"
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data from API:&lt;/p&gt;

    @foreach (string item in Model.DataFromApi)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;@item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;fieldset class="form"&gt;
    &lt;legend&gt;Search for a person in the search engine&lt;/legend&gt;
    &lt;table width="500"&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;
                &lt;input class="form-control" id="autocomplete" type="text" style="width:500px" /&gt;
            &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;div class="card" id="results"&gt;
    &lt;h5 class="card-header"&gt;
        &lt;span id="docName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span id="docFamilyName"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docInfo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docCityCountry"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;&lt;span id="docWeb"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/script&gt;
}

  


<p>If all is setup correctly, the ASP.NET Core application displays the API data which is protected using the windows authentication.</p>







<p>CRSF</p>



<p>If using windows authentication, you need to protect against CSRF forgery like any application using cookies. It is also recommended NOT to use windows authentication in the public domain. Modern security architectures should be used like Open ID Connect whenever possible. This works well on intranets or for making changes to existing applications which use windows authentication in secure networks.</p>

   If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet …

<p>If there's one thing that's true about the word "blockchain", it's that
these days people have strong opinions about it.
Open your social media feed and you'll see people either heaping praises
on blockchains, calling them the saviors of humanity, or condemning them
as destroying and burning down the planet and making the rich richer
and the poor poorer and generally all the other kinds of fights that
people like to have about capitalism (also a quasi-vague word
occupying some hotly contested mental real estate).</p>
<p>There are good reasons to hold opinions about various aspects of what
are called "blockchains", and I too have some pretty strong opinions
I'll be getting into in a followup article.
The followup article will be about "cryptocurrencies", which many people
also seem to think of as synonymous with "blockchains", but this isn't
particularly true either, but we'll deal with that one then.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, some of the fighting on the internet is kind of
confusing, but even more importantly, kind of confused.
Some of it might be what I call "sportsballing": for whatever reason,
for or against blockchains has become part of your local sportsball
team, and we've all got to be team players or we're gonna let the local
team down already, right?
And the thing about sportsballing is that it's kind of arbitrary and
it kind of isn't, because you might pick a sportsball team because you
did all your research or you might have picked it because that just
happens to be the team in your area or the team your friends like, but
god almighty once you've picked your sportsball team let's actually not
talk against it because that might be giving in to the other side.
But sportsballing kind of isn't arbitrary either because it tends to
be initially connected to real communities of real human beings and
there's usually a deeper cultural web than appears at surface level,
so when you're poking at it, it appears surface-level shallow but
there are some real intricacies beneath the surface.  (But anyway, go
sportsball team.)</p>
<p>But I digress.
There are important issues to discuss, yet people aren't really
discussing them, partly because people mean different things.
"Blockchain" is a strange term that encompasses a wide idea space,
and what people consider or assume essential to it vary just as
widely, and thus when two people are arguing they might not even be
arguing about the same thing.
So let's get to unpacking.</p>
 "Blockchain" as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general 
<p>Years ago I was at a conference about decentralized networked
technology, and I was having a conversation with someone I had just met.
This person was telling me how excited they were about
blockchains... finally we have decentralized network designs, and so
this seems really useful for society!</p>
<p>I paused for a moment and said yes, blockchains can be useful for some
things, though they tend to have significant costs or at least
tradeoffs.  It's good that we also have other decentralized network
technology; for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standard I was involved in had no blockchains but did rely on the
much older "classic actor model."</p>
<p>"Oh," the other person said, "I didn't know there were other kinds of
decentralized network designs.  I thought that 'blockchain' just meant
'decentralized network technology'."</p>
<p>It was as if a light had turned on and illuminated the room for me.  Oh!
This explained so many conversations I had been having over the years.
Of course... for many people, blockchains like Bitcoin were the first
ever exposure they had (aside from email, which maybe they never gave
much thought to as being decentralized) of something that involved
a decentralized protocol.  So for many people, "blockchain" and
"decentralized technology" are synonyms, if not in technical design,
but in terms of understanding of a space.</p>
<p>Mark S. Miller, who was standing next to me, smiled and gave a very
interesting followup: "There is only one case in which you need a
blockchain, and that is in a decentralized system which needs to
converge on a single order of events, such as a public ledger
dealing with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending#Decentralized_currencies">double spending problem</a>."</p>
<p>Two revelations at once.  It was a good conversation... it was a good
start.
But I think there's more.</p>
 Blockchains are the "cloud" of merkle trees 
<p>As time has gone on, the discourse over blockchains has gotten more
dramatic.  This is partly because what a "blockchain" is hasn't been
well defined.</p>
<p>All terminology exists on an ever-present battle between
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/23-nerdout-fuzzy-and-crisp.html">fuzziness and crispness</a>,
with some terms being much clearer than others.
The term "boolean" has a fairly crisp definition in computer science,
but if I ask you to show me your "stove", the device you show me today
may be incomprehensible to someone's definition a few centuries ago,
particularly in that today it might not involve fire.
Trying to define as in terms of its functionality can also cause
confusion: if I asked you to show me a stove, and you showed me a
computer processor or a car engine, I might be fairly confused, even
though technically people enjoy showing off that they can cook eggs on
both of these devices when they get hot enough.
(See also: <a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/identity-is-a-katamari/">Identity is a Katamari, language is a Katamari explosion</a>.)</p>
<p>Still, some terms are fuzzier than others, and as far as terms go,
"blockchain" is quite fuzzy.
Hence my joke: "Blockchains are the 'cloud' of merkle trees."</p>
<p>This ~joke tends to get a lot of laughs out of a particular kind of
audience, and confused looks from others, so let me explain.
The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that it's a "chain of
blocks", but all that really seems to mean is that it's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">merkle tree</a>... really,
just an immutable datastructure where one node points at the parent node
which points at the parent node all the way up.
The joke then is not that this merkle tree runs on a cloud, but that
"cloud computing" means approximately nothing: it's marketing speak for
some vague handwavey set of "other peoples' computers are doing
computation somewhere, possibly on your behalf sometimes."
Therefore, "cloud of merkle trees" refers to the vagueness of the
situation.
(As everyone knows, jokes are funnier when fully explained, so I'll
turn on my "STUDIO LAUGHTER" sign here.)</p>
<p>So, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, ie a merkle tree, and I mean,
technically speaking, that means that <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a
blockchain (especially if the commits are signed), but when you see
someone arguing on the internet about whether or not blockchains are
"good" or "bad", they probably weren't thinking about git, which aside
from having a high barrier of entry in its interface and some concerns
about the hashing algorithm used, isn't really something likely to
drag you into an internet flamewar.</p>
 "Blockchain" is to "Bitcoin" what "Roguelike" is to "Rogue" 
<p>These days it's common to see people either heaping praises on
blockchains or criticizing them, and those people tend to be shouting
past one another.
I'll save unpacking that for another post.
In the meanwhile though, it's worth noting that people might not be
talking about the same things.</p>
<p>What isn't in doubt is whether or not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
is a blockchain... trying to understand and then explore the problem
space around Bitcoin is what created the term "blockchain".
It's a bit like the video game genre of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelikes</a>,
which started with the game
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>,
particularly explored and expanded upon in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a>,
and then suddenly exploding into the indie game scene as a "genre"
of its own.
Except the genre has become fuzzier and fuzzier as people have explored
the surrounding space.
What is essential?
Is a grid based layout essential?
Is a <a href="http://roguetemple.com/z/hyper/">non-euclidean grid</a> acceptable?
Do you have to provide an ascii or ansi art interface so people can play
in their terminals?
Dare we allow unicode characters?
What if we throw out terminals altogether and just play on a grid
of 2d pixelart?
What about 3d art?
What about permadeath?
What about the fantasy theme?
What about random level generation?
What are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Key_features">key features</a>
of a roguelike?</p>
<p>Well now we're at the point where I pick up a game like
<a href="https://blazingbeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Blazing_Beaks_Wiki">Blazing Beaks</a>
and it calls itself a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Rogue-lites_and_procedural_death_labyrinths">"roguelite"</a>,
which I guess is embracing the point that terminology has gotten extremely
fuzzy... this game feels more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron">Robotron</a>
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29">Rogue</a>.</p>
<p>So... if "blockchain" is to Bitcoin what "roguelike" is to Rogue, then
what's essential to a blockchain?
Does the blockchain have to be applied to a financial instrument, or
can it be used to store updateable information about eg identity?
Is global consensus required?
Or what about a "trusted quorum" of nodes, such as in Hyperledger?
Is "mining" some kind of asset a key part of the system?
Is proof of work acceptable, or is proof of stake okay?
What about proof of space, proof of space-time, proof of pudding?</p>
<p>On top of all this, some of the terms around blockchains have been
absorbed as if into them.
For instance, I think to many people, "smart contract" means something
like "code which runs on a blockchain" thanks to Ethereum's major
adoption of the term, but the
<a href="http://www.erights.org/">E programming language</a>
described "smart contracts" as the "likely killer app of distributed
capabilities" all the way
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990125095122/http://www.erights.org/">back in 1999</a>,
and was
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990209105758/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/smart_contracts_idea.html">borrowing the term</a>
from
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990128165611/http://www.best.com/%7Eszabo/">Nick Szabo</a>,
but really the same folks working on E had described many of those same
ideas in the <a href="https://agoric.com/papers/">Agoric Papers</a> back in 1988.
Bitcoin wasn't even a thing at all until at least 2008, so depending on
how you look at it, "smart contracts" precede "blockchains" by one or
two decades.
So "blockchain" has somehow even rolled up terms outside of its space
as if within it.
(By the way, I don't think anyone has given a good and crisp definition
for "smart contract" either despite some of these people trying to give
me one, so let me give you one that I think is better and embraces its
fuzziness: "Smart contracts allow you to do the kinds of things you
might do with legal contracts, but relying on networked computation
instead of a traditional state-based legal system."
It's too bad more people also don't know about the huge role that Mark
Miller's "split contracts" idea plays into this space because that's
what makes the idea finally makes sense... but that's a conversation
for another time.)
(EDIT: Well, after I wrote this, Kate Sills lent me her
definition, which I think is the best one: "Smart contracts are
credible commitments using technology, and outside a state-provided
legal system."  I like it!)</p>
<p>So anyway, the point of this whole section is to say that kind of like
roguelike, people are thinking of different things as essential to
blockchains.
Everyone roughly agrees on the jumping-off point of ideas but since
not everyone agrees from there, it's good to check in when we're having
the conversation.
Wait, you do/don't like this game because it's a roguelike?
Maybe we should check in on what features you mean.
Likewise for blockchains.
Because if you're blaming blockchains for burning down the planet, more
than likely you're not condemning signed git repositories (or at least,
if you're condemning them, you're probably doing so about it from an
aspect that isn't the fundamental datastructure... probably).</p>
<p>This is an "easier said than done" kind of thing though, because of
course, I'm kind of getting into some "in the weeds" level of details
here... but it's the "in the weeds" where all the substance of the
disagreements really are.
The person you are talking with might not actually even know or consider
the same aspects to be essential that you consider essential though,
so taking some time to ask which things we mean can help us lead to a
more productive conversation sooner.</p>
 "Blockchain" as an identity signal 
<p>First, a digression.
One thing that's kind of curious about the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signaling">"virtue signal"</a>
is that in general it tends to be used as a kind of virtue signal.
It's kind of like the word
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_%28contemporary_subculture%29">hipster</a>
in the previous decade, which weirdly seemed to be obsessively and
pejoratively used by people who resembled hipsters than anyone else.
Hence I used to make a joke called "hipster recursion", which is that
since hipsters seem more obsessesed with pejorative labeling of
hipsterism than anyone else, there's no way to call someone a "hipster"
without yourself taking on hipster-like traits, and so inevitably
even this conversation is N-levels deep into hipster recursion
for some numerical value of N.</p>
<p>"Virtue signaling" appears similar, but even more ironically so
(which is a pretty amazing feat given how much of hipsterdom seems to
surround a kind of inauthentic irony).
When I hear someone say "virtue signaling" with a kind of sneer, part
of that seems to be acknowledging that other people are sending signals
merely to impress others that they are some kind of the same group but
it seems as if it's being raised as in a
you-know-and-I-know-that-by-me-acknowledging-this-I'm-above-virtue-signaling
kind of way.
Except that by any possible definition of virtue signaling, the above
appears to be a kind of virtue signaling, so now we're into virtue
signaling recursion.</p>
<p>Well, one way to claw our way out of the rabbithole of all this is to
drop the pejorative aspect of it and just acknowledge that signaling
is something that everyone does.
Hence me saying "identity signaling" here.
You can't really escape identity signaling, or even sportsballing, but
you can acknowledge that it's a thing that we all do, and there's a
reason for it: people only have so much time to find out information
about each other, so they're searching for clues that they might align
and that, if they introduce you to their peer group, that you might
align with them as well, without access to a god-like view of the
universe where they know exactly what you think and exactly what
kinds of things you've done and exactly what way you'll behave in
the future or whether or not you share the same values.
(After all, what else is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics</a>
but an ethical framework that takes this in its most condensed form as
its foundation?)
But it's true that at its worst, this seems to result in shallow, quick,
judgmental behavior, usually based on stereotypes of the other side...
which can be unfortunate or unfair to whomever is being talked about.
But also on the flip side, people also do identity signal to each other
because they want to create a sense of community and bonding.
That's what a lot of culture is.
It's worth acknowledging then that this occurs, recognizing its use and
limitations, without pretending that we are above it.</p>
<p>So wow, that's quite a major digression, so now let's get back to
"identity signaling".
There is definitely a lot of identity signaling that tends to happen
around the word "blockchain", for or against.
Around the critiques of the worst of this, I tend to agree: I find much
of the machismo hyper-white-male-privilege that surrounds some of the
"blockchain" space uncomfortable or cringey.</p>
<p>But I also have some close friends who are not male and/or are people
of color and those ones tend to actually suffer the worst of it from
these communities internally, but also seem to find things of value in
them, but particularly seem to feel squeezed externally when the field
is reduced to these kinds of (anti?-)patterns.
There's something sad about that, where I see on the one hand friends
complaining about blockchain from the outside on behalf of people who
on the inside seem to be both struggling internally but then kind of
crushed by being lumped into the same identified problems externally.
This is hardly a unique problem but it's worth highlighting for a moment
I think.</p>
<p>But anyway, I've taken a bunch of time on this, more than I care to,
maybe because (irony again?) I feel that too much of public conversation
is also hyperfocusing on this aspect... whether there's a subculture
around blockchain, whether or not that subculture is good or bad, etc.
There's a lot worthwhile in unpacking this discourse-wise, but some of
the criticisms of blockchains as a technology (to the extent it even
is coherently one) seem to get lumped up into all of this.
It's good to provide thoughtful cultural critique, particularly one
which encourages healthy social change.
And we can't escape identity signaling.
But as someone who's trying to figure out what properties of networked
systems we do and don't want, I feel like I'm trying to navigate the
machine and for whatever reason, my foot keeps getting caught in the
gears here.
Well, maybe that itself is pointing to some architectural mistakes,
but socially architectural ones.
But it's useful to also be able to draw boundaries around it so that
we know where this part of the conversation begins and ends.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "decentralized centralization" (or "decentralized convergence") 
<p>One of the weird things about people having the idea of "blockchains" as
being synonymous with "decentralization" is that it's kind of both very
true and very untrue, depending on what abstraction layer you're
looking at.</p>
<p>For a moment, I'm going to frame this in harsh terms: blockchains are
decentralized centralization.</p>
<p>What?
How dare I!
You'll notice that this section is in harsh contrast to the
"blockchain as handwaving towards decentralized networks in general"
section... well, I am acknowledging the decentralized aspect of it,
but the weird thing about a blockchain is that it's a decentralized
set of nodes converging on (creating a centrality of!) a single
abstract machine.</p>
<p>Contrast with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model#Fundamental_concepts">classic actor model</a>
systems like
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>
in <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>,
or as less good examples
(because they aren't quite as behavior-oriented as they are
correspondence-oriented, usually)
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">SMTP</a>
(ie, email).
All of these systems involve decentralized computation and collaboration
stemming from sending messages to actors (aka "distributed objects").
Of CapTP this is especially clear and extreme: computations happen in
parallel across many collaborating machines (and even better, many
collaborating objects on many collaborating machines), and the behavior
of other machines and their objects is often even opaque to you.
(CapTP survives this in a beautiful way, being able to do well on
anonymous, peer to peer, "mutually suspicious" networks.
But maybe read my
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">rambling thoughts about CapTP</a>
elsewhere.)</p>
<p>While to some degree there are some very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">clever</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">tricks</a>
in the world of cryptography where you may be able to get back some of
the opacity, this tends to be very expensive, adding an expensive
component to the already inescapable additional expenses of a
blockchain.
A multi-party blockchain with some kind of consensus
will always, by definition be slower than a single machine operating
alone.</p>
<p>If you are irritated by this framing: good.
It's probably good to be irritated by it at least once, if you can
recognize the portion of truth in it.
But maybe that needs some unpacking to get there.
It might be better to say "blockchains are decentralized convergence",
but I have some other phrasing that might be helpful.</p>
 "Blockchain" as "a single machine that many people run" 
<p>There's value in having a single abstract machine that many people run.
The most famous source of value is in the "double spending problem".
How do we make sure that when someone has money, they don't spend that
money twice?</p>
<p>Traditional accounting solves this with a linear, sequential ledger,
and it turns out that the right solution boils down to the same thing
in computers.
Emphasis on sequential: in order to make sure money balances out
right, we really do have to be able to order things.</p>
<p>Here's the thing though: the double spending problem was in a sense
solved in terms of single-computers a long time ago in the object
capability security community.
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/capability/ode/index.html">Capability-based Financial Instruments</a>
was written about a decade before blockchains even existed and
showed off how to make a "mint" (kind of like a fiat-currency bank)
that can be implemented in about 25 lines of code in the right
architecture (I've <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/blob/4f664218c87fa96432a04d0a107618ec36ab9310/goblins/actor-lib/simple-mint.rkt#L13">ported it to Goblins</a>,
for instance) and yet has both distributed accounts and is robust
against corruption on errors.</p>
<p>However, this seems to be running on a "single-computer based
machine", and again operates like a fiat currency.
Anyone can create their own fiat currency like this, and they are
cheap, cheap, cheap (and fast!) to make.
But it does rely on sequentiality to some degree to operate correctly
(avoiding a class of attacks called "re-entrancy attacks").</p>
<p>But this "single-computer based machine" might bother you for a couple
reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>We might be afraid the server might crash and service will be
  interrupted, or worse yet, we will no longer be able to access our
  accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>Or, even if we could trade these on an open market, and maybe
  diversify our portfolio, maybe we don't want to have to trust a
  single operator or even some appointed team of operators... maybe we
  have a lot of money in one of these systems and we want to be sure
  that it won't suddenly vanish due to corruption.</p>
 
 
<p>Well, if our code operates deterministically, then what if from the
same initial conditions (or saved snapshot of the system) we replay
all input messages to the machine?
Functional programmers know: we'll end up with the same result.</p>
<p>So okay, we might want to be sure this doesn't accidentally get
corrupted, maybe for backup reasons.
So maybe we submit the input messages to two computers, and then
if one crashes, we just continue on with the second one until the
other comes up, and then we can restore the first one from the
progress the second machine made while the first one was down.</p>
<p>Oh hey, this is already technically a blockchain.
Except our trust model is that we implicitly trust both machines.</p>
<p>Hm.
Maybe we're now worried that we might have top-down government
pressure to coerce some behavior on one of our nodes, or maybe we're
worried that someone at a local datacenter is going to flip some bits
to make themselves rich.
So we actually want to spread this abstract machine out over three
countries.
So okay, we do that, and now we set a rule agreeing on what all the
series of input messages are... if two of three nodes agree, that's
good enough.
Oh hey look, we've just invented the "small-quorum-style"
blockchain/ledger!</p>
<p>(And yes, you can wire up <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>
to do just this; a hint as to how is seen in the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
Actually, let's come back to that later.)</p>
<p>Well, okay.
This is probably good enough for a private financial asset, but what
about if we want to make something more... global?
Where nobody is in charge!</p>
<p>Well, we could do that too.
Here's what we do.</p>
 
 
<p>First, we need to prevent a "swarming attack" (okay, this is
  generally called a "sybil attack" in the literature, but for a
  multitude of reasons I won't get into, I don't like that term).
  If a global set of peers are running this single abstract machine,
  we need to make sure there aren't invocations filling up the system
  with garbage, since we all basically have to keep that information
  around.
  Well... this is exactly where those proof-of-foo systems come in
  the first time; in fact Proof of Work's origin is in something
  called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a> which
  was designed to add "friction" to disincentivize spam for email-like
  systems.
  If we don't do something friction-oriented in this category, our
  ledger is going to be too easily filled with garbage too fast.
  We also need to agree on what the order of messages is, so we
  can use this mechanism in conjuction with a consensus algorithm.</p>
 
 
<p>When are new units of currency issued?
  Well, in our original mint example, the person who set up the mint
  was the one given the authority to make new money out of thin air
  (and they can hand out attenuated versions of that authority to
  others as they see fit).
  But what if instead of handing this capability out to individuals
  we handed it out to anyone who can meet an abstract requirement?
  For instance, in <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/">zcap-ld</a>
  an invoker can be any kind of entity which is specified with
  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">linked data proofs</a>,
  meaning those entities can be something other than a single key...
  for instance, what if we delegated to an abstract invoker that was
  specified as being "whoever can solve the state of the machine's current
  proof-of-work puzzle"?
  Oh my gosh!
  We just took our 25-line mint and extended it for mining-style
  blockchains.
  And the fundamental design still applies!</p>
 
 
<p>With these two adjustments, we've created a "public blockchain" akin
to bitcoin.
And we don't need to use proof-of-work for either technically...
we could swap in different mechanisms of friction / qualification.</p>
<p>If the set of inputs are stored as a merkle tree, then all of the
system types we just looked at are technically blockchains:</p>
 
 
<p>A second machine as failover in a trusted environment</p>
 
 
<p>Three semi-trusted machines with small-scale private consensus</p>
 
 
<p>A public blockchain without global trust, with swarming-attack
   resistance and an interesting abstract capability accessible
   to anyone who can meet the abstract requirement (in this case,
   to issue some new currency).</p>
 
 
<p>The difference for choosing any of the above is really a question of:
"what is your trust/failover requirements?"</p>
 Blockchains as time travel plus convergent inputs 
<p>If this doesn't sound believable to you, that you could create
something like a "public blockchain" on top of something like Goblins
so easily, consider how we might extend
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time travel in Terminal Phase</a>
to add multiplayer.
As a reminder, here's an image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, a secret thing about Terminal Phase is that the gameplay is
deterministic (the random starfield in the background is not, but the
gameplay is) and runs on a fixed frame-rate.
This means that given the same set of keyboard inputs, the game will
always play the same, every time.</p>
<p>Okay, well let's say we wanted to hand some way for someone to replay
our last game.
Chess games can be fully replayed with a very
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">condensed syntax</a>,
meaning that merely handing someone a short list of codes they can
precisely replay the same game, every time, deterministically.</p>
<p>Well okay, as a first attempt at thinking this through, what if for
some game of Terminal Phase I played we wrote down each keystroke I
entered on my keyboard, on every tick of the game?
Terminal Phase runs at 30 ticks per second.
So okay, if you replay these, each one at 30 ticks per second, then
yeah, you'd end up with the same gameplay every time.</p>
<p>It would be simple enough for me to encode these as a linked list
(cons, cons, cons!) and hand them to you.
You could descend all the way to the root of the list and start
playing them back up (ie, play the list in reverse order) and you'd
get the same result as I did.
I could even stream new events to you by giving you new items to
tack onto the front of the list, and you could "watch" a game I
was playing live.</p>
<p>So now imagine that you and I want to play Terminal Phase together
now, over the network.
Let's imagine there are two ships, and for simplicity, we're playing
cooperatively.
(The same ideas
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_protocol">can be extended to competitive</a>,
but for narrating how real-time games work it's easier to to start
with a cooperative assumption.)</p>
<p>We could start out by wiring things up on the network so that I am
allowed to press certain keys for player 1 and you are allowed to
press certain keys for player 2.
(Now it's worth noting that a better way to do this doesn't involve
keys on the keyboard but capability references, and really that's
how we'd do things if we were to bring this multiplayer idea live, but
I'm trying to provide a metaphor that's easy to think about without
introducing the complicated sounding kinds of terms like "c-lists" and
"vat turns" that we ocap people seem to like.)
So, as a first attempt, maybe if we were playing on a local area
network or something, we could synchronize at every game tick: I share
my input with you and you share yours, and then and only then do both
of our systems actually input them into that game-tick's inputs.
We'll have achieved a kind of "convergence" as to the current game state
on every tick.
(EDIT: I wrote "a kind of consensus" instead of "a kind of
convergence" originally, and that was an error, because it misleads
on what consensus algorithms tend to do.)</p>
<p>Except this wouldn't work very well if you and I were living far away
from each other and playing over the internet... the lag time for
doing this for every game tick might slow the system to a crawl...
our computers wouldn't get each others' inputs as fast as the game was
moving along, and would have to pause until we received each others'
moves.</p>
<p>So okay, here's what we'll do.
Remember the time-travel GUI above?
As you can see, we're effectively restoring from an old snapshot.
Oh!  So okay.
We could save a snapshot of the game every second, and then both get
each other our inputs to each other as fast as we can, but knowing
it'll lag.
So, without having seen your inputs yet, I could move my ship up and
to the right and fire (and send that I did that to you).
My game would be in a "dirty state"... I haven't actually seen what
you've done yet.
Now suddenly I get the last set of moves you did over the network...
in the last five frames, you move down and to the left and fire.
Now we've got each others' inputs... what our systems can do is
secretly time travel behind the scenes to the last snapshot, then
fast forward, replaying both of our inputs on each tick up until the
latest state where we've both seen each others' moves (but we wouldn't
show the fast forward process, we'd just show the result with the
fast forward having been applied).
This can happen fast enough that I might see your ship jump forward
a little, and maybe your bullet will kill the enemy instead of mine
and the scores shift so that you actually got some points that
for a moment I thought I had, but this can all happen in realtime
and we don't need to slow down the game at all to do it.</p>
<p>Again, all the above can be done, but with actual wiring of
capabilities instead of the keystroke metaphor... and actually, the
same set of ideas can be done with any kind of system, not just
a game.</p>
<p>And oh hey, technically, technically, technically if we both hashed
each of our previous messages in the linked list and signed each one,
then this would qualify as a merkle tree and then this would also
qualify as a blockchain... but wait, this doesn't have anything to do
with cryptocurrencies!
So is it really a blockchain?</p>
 "Blockchain" as synonym for "cryptocurrency" but this is wrong and don't do this one 
<p>By now you've probably gotten the sense that I really was annoyed with
the first section of "blockchain" as a synonym for "decentralization"
(especially because blockchains are decentralized centralization/convergence)
and that is completely true.
But even more annoying to me is the synonym of "blockchain" with
"cryptocurrency".</p>
<p>"Cryptocurrency" means "cryptographically based currency" and it is
NOT synonymous with blockchains.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiCash">Digicash</a> precedes blockchains
by a dramatic amount, but it is a cryptocurrency.
The "simple mint" type system also precedes blockchains and while it
can be run on a blockchain, it can also run on a solo
computer/machine.</p>
<p>But as we saw, we could perceive multiplayer Terminal Phase as
technically, technically a blockchain, even though it has nothing to do with
currencies whatsoever.</p>
<p>So again a blockchain is just a single, abstract, sequential machine,
run by multiple parties.
That's it.
It's more general than cryptocurrencies, and it's not exclusive to
implementing them either.
One is a kind of programming-plus-cryptography-use-case
(cryptocurrencies), the other one is a kind of abstracted machine
(blockchains).</p>
<p>So please.
They are frequently combined, but don't treat them as the same thing.</p>
 Blockchains as single abstract machines on a wider network 
<p>One of my favorite talks is Mark Miller's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXUqfgdDbr8">Programming Secure Smart Contracts</a>
talk.
Admittedly, I like it partly because it well illustrates some of the
low-level problems I've been working on, and that might not be as
useful to everyone else.
But it has this lovely diagram in it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is better understood by watching the video, but the abstraction
layers described here are basically as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>"Machines" are the lowest layer of abstraction on the network, but
   there a variety of kinds of machines.
   Public blockchains are one, quorum blockchains are another, solo
   computer machines yet another (and the simplest case, too).
   What's interesting then is that we can see public chains and quorums
   abstractly demonstrated as machines in and of themselves... even though
   they are run by many parties.</p>
 
 
<p>Vats are the next layer of abstraction, these are basically the
   "communicating event loops"... actors/objects live inside them,
   and more or less these things run sequentially.</p>
 
 
<p>Replace "JS ocaps" with "language ocaps" and you can see actors/objects
   in both Javascript and Spritely living here.</p>
 
 
<p>Finally, at the top are "erights" and "smart contracts", which feed
   into each other... "erights" are "exclusive electronic rights", and
   "smart contracts" are generally patterns of cooperation involving
   achieving mutual goals despite suspicion, generally involving the
   trading of these erights things (but not necessarily).</p>
 
 
<p>Okay, well cool!
This finally explains the worldview I see blockchains on.
And we can see a few curious things:</p>
 
 
<p>The "public chain" and "quorum" kinds of machines still boil down
   to a single, sequential abstract machine.</p>
 
 
<p>Object connections exist between the machines... ocap security.
   No matter whether it's run by a single computer or multiple.</p>
 
 
<p>Public blockchains, quorum blockchains, solo-computer machines
   all talk to each other, and communicate between object references
   on each other.</p>
 
 
<p>Blockchains are not magical things.
They are abstracted machines on the network.
Some of them have special rules that let whoever can prove they qualify
for them access some well-known capabilities, but really they're just
abstracted machines.</p>
<p>And here's an observation: you aren't ever going to move all
computation to a single blockchain.
Agoric's CEO, Dean Tribble,
<a href="https://youtu.be/WeRbY6tiAio?t=712">explained beautifully why on a recent podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems with Ethereum is it is as tightly coupled as
possible.
The entire world is a single sequence of actions that runs on a
computer with about the power of a cell phone.
Now, that's obviously hugely valuable to be able to do commerce in a
high-integrity fashion, even if you can only share a cell phone's
worth of compute power with the entire rest of the world.
But that's clearly gonna hit a brick wall.
And we've done lots of large-scale distributed systems whether
payments or cyberspace or coordination, and the fundamental model
that covers all of those is
islands of sequential programming in a sea of asynchronous communication.
That is what the internet is about, that's what the interchain is about,
that's what physics requires you to do if you want a system to scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put this way, it should be obvious: are we going to replace the entire
internet with something that has the power of a cell phone?
To ask the question is to know the answer: of course not.
Even when we do admit blockchain'y systems into our system, we're going
to have to have many of them communicating with each other.</p>
<p>Blockchains are just machines that many people/agents run.
That's it.</p>
<p>Some of these are encoded with some nice default programming to do
some useful things, but all of them can be done in non-blockchain
systems because
communicating islands of sequential processes is the generalization.
You might still want a blockchain, ie you might want multiple parties
running one of those machines as a shared abstract machine, but
how you configure that blockchain from there might depend on your
trust and integrity requirements.</p>
 What do I think of blockchains? 
<p>I've covered a wide variety of perspectives of "what is a blockchain"
in this article.</p>
<p>On the worse end of things are the parts involving hand-wavey
confusion about decentralization, mistaken ideas of them being tied to
cryptocurrencies, marketing hype, cultural assumptions, and some real,
but not intrinsic, cultural problems.</p>
<p>In the middle, I am particularly keen on highlighting the similarity
between the term "blockchain" and the term "roguelike", how both of
them might boil down to some key ideas or not, but more importantly
they're both a rough family of ideas that diverge from one highly
influential source (Bitcoin and Rogue respectively).
This is also the source of much of the "shouting past each other",
because many people are referring to different components that they
view as essential or inessential.
Many of these pieces may be useful or harmful in isolation, in small
amounts, in large amounts, but much of the arguing (and posturing)
involves highlighting different things.</p>
<p>On the better end of things is a revelation, that blockchains are just
another way of abstracting a computer so that multiple parties can run
it.
The particular decisions and use cases layered on top of this
fundamental design are highly variant.</p>
<p>Having made the waters clear again, we could muddy them.
A friend once tried to convince me that all computers are
technically blockchains, that blockchains are the generalization of
computing, and the case of a solo computer is merely one where a
blockchain is run only by one party and no transaction history or old
state is kept around.
Maybe, but I don't think this is very useful.
You can go in either direction, and I think the time travel and
Terminal Phase section maybe makes that clear to me, but I'm not so
sure how it lands with others I suppose.
But a term tends to be useful in terms of what it introduces, and
calling everything a blockchain seems to make the term even less
useful than it already is.
While a blockchain could be one or more parties running a sequential
machine as the generalization, I suggest we stick to two or more.</p>
<p>Blockchains are not magic pixie dust, putting something on a
blockchain does not make it work better or more
decentralized... indeed, what a blockchain really does is converging
(or re-centralizing) a machine from a decentralized set of computers.
And it always does so with some cost, some set of overhead...
but what those costs and overhead are varies depending on what the
configuration decisions are.
Those decisions should always stem from some careful thinking about
what those trust and integrity needs are... one of the more
frustrating things about blockchains being a technology of great
hype and low understanding is that such care is much less common than
it should be.</p>
<p>Having a blockchain, as a convergent machine, can be useful.
But how that abstracted convergent machine is arranged can diverge
dramatically; if we aren't talking about the same choices, we might
shout past each other.
Still, it may be an unfair ask to request that those without a deep
technical background go into technical specifics, and I recognize
that, and in a sense there can be some amount gained from speaking
towards broad-sweeping, fuzzy sets and the patterns they seem to be
carrying.
A gut-sense assertion from a set of loosely observed behaviors can be
a useful starting point.
But to get at the root of what those gut senses actually map to, we
will have to be specific, and we should encourage that specificity
where we can (without being rude about it) and help others see those
components as well.</p>
<p>But ultimately, as convergent machines, blockchains will not operate
alone.
I think the system that will hook them all together
<a href="https://spritelyproject.org/news/what-is-captp.html">should be CapTP</a>.
But no matter the underlying protocol abstraction, blockchains
are just abstract machines on the network.</p>
<p>Having finally disentangled what blockchains are, I think soon I
would like to move onto what cryptocurrencies are.
Knowing that they are not necessarily tied to blockchains opens us
up to considering an ecosystem, even an interoperable and exchangeable
one, of varying cryptographically based financial instruments, and
the different roles and uses they might play.
But that is another post of its own, for whenever I can get to it,
I suppose.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: After writing this post, I had several conversations
with several blockchain-oriented people.
Each of them roughly seemed to agree that Bitcoin was roughly the
prototypical "blockchain", but each of them also seemed to highlight
different things they thought were "essential" to what a "blockchain"
is: some kinds of consensus algorithms being better than others, that
kinds of social arrangements are enabled, whether transferrable
assets are encoded on the chain, etc.
To start with, I feel like this does confirm some
of the premise of this post, that Bitcoin is the starting point, but
like Rogue and "roguelikes", "blockchains" are an exploration space
stemming from a particular influential technical piece.</p>
<p>However my friend Kate Sills (who also gave me a much better
definition for "smart contracts", added above) highlighted something
that I hadn't talked about much in my article so far, which I do agree
deserves expansion.
Kate said: "I do think there is something huge missing from your
piece.  Bitcoin is amazing because it aligns incentives among actors
who otherwise have no goals in common."</p>
<p>I agree that there's something important here, and this definition of
"blockchain" maybe does explain why while from a computer science
perspective, perhaps signed git trees do resemble blockchains, they
don't seem to fit within the realm of what most people are thinking
about... while git might be a tool used by several people with aligned
incentives, it is not generally itself the layer of
incentive-alignment.</p>

<p>This blog is the script of a talk I did internally at WSO2 in 2015 to inspire the team to build their personal brand. Found this today, buried in my Google Docs, and thought of sharing publicly (unedited), in case if someone finds it&nbsp;helpful!</p><p>Good Morning folks, thanks for joining in — it’s my great pleasure to do this session on ‘My Personal Brand is My Professional Success&nbsp;Story’.</p><p>First of all I must thank Asanka, Zai, Charitha, Usama and the entire marketing team for giving me the opportunity to present on this topic. In first sight, I thought, it’s tough to present on a topic — that I have not consciously focused on — or purposely wanted to achieve myself. Then again, thinking further on the title, I realized whether we like it or not each one of us has a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg">https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*Yp9bj3XCL0s_fbGWUmGA2g.jpeg</a><p>The personal brand is the image of you, that you cultivate in others’ minds. In other words — that is how — others think about you. This raises a question in all ‘radical’ minds — why we have to care about what others think about us — we do our bit in the way we want, and should we care about personal branding? It is extremely important to find answers to this question, because if we are not convinced of something, we will never do&nbsp;it.</p><p>In my view there are no individuals — there is a bigger, greater team behind each individual. This bigger, greater team includes your parents, siblings, spouse, kids, relations, friends. colleagues and many more. You like it or not, more or less you are a reflection of this team behind you. As we grow up as human beings the team behind us — or the team which influences us, widens up. It would not just include well-wishers, but also haters, competitors and many more. But, still you as an individual is a reflection of this team. Sometimes — or even in most of the cases, the haters could motivate you more than well-wishers. This team also includes people you have never talked to — people you have never seen — people who never exist, like some characters in books. This is the team behind you — at the same time — you like it or not you become a member of a team behind another individual or set of individuals. In other words, you get influenced by a team and then again you influence another set of individuals.</p><p>Let me take a quick example. Everyone knows Mahatma Gandhi. In his own words, Ghandi once said — “Three moderns have left a deep impress on my life and captivated me. Raychandbhai by his living contact; Tolstoy by his book, “The Kingdom of God is within you”; and Ruskin by his “Unto This Last”. That was what influenced him — today there are countless number of individuals who are influenced by&nbsp;Gandhi.</p><p>Arguably, CNBC, in 2014, named Steve Jobs as the most influential person in last 25 years. Thousands of people are influenced by Steve Jobs, at the same time there are many other people who influenced Jobs — Edwin H. Land, who co-founded Polaroid and made a number of significant advancements in the field of photography, is one of them, Jobs used to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>In short, whether you like it or not, more or less, you get influenced by others and then again you influence others. Now it is a question on how much an impact you want to make on the rest of the world before you die, to make this world a better place than it looks like today.&nbsp;I</p><p>If you want to make a good/positive impact on others, you care about how they think about you. If you cannot build a positive image of you, in their minds, you will find it extremely hard to make a positive impact in their lives. The positive image of you is the reflection of your character. If you have a bad character, it is extremely hard to build a good image out of it, not quite impossible though. But, if your character is good, the positive image is the bonus what you get for it. Personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself — but to express yourself. Everyone from the history, who has made a positive impact to the world, have expressed themselves. The way Gandhi took to express himself, is not the same which Steve Jobs&nbsp;picked.</p><p>The rest of the talk from here onwards, is about, how to build a good image and then how to express your character to the rest, to build a positive personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, everyone of us, should have a vision for the life. Vision for the life is the one that drives you to the future. The vision for the life is the one that motivates us to wake up every morning. If you don’t have one — start thinking about it from today. Think about, what motivates you to do what you do everyday. Having a good vision is the core in building a great&nbsp;image.</p><p>The vision has to be inspirational — a great vision statement inspires and moves us. It is a motivational force that compels action. You recognize a great vision statement when you find it difficult not to be inspired.</p><p>The vision has to be challenging — the best vision statements challenge us to become better. In this way, a vision statement requires us to stretch ourselves in pursuit of the vision we seek to achieve. The vision is not an ‘easy target’; it is something that if achieved- would represent a sense of pride and fulfillment.</p><p>The vision has to be achievable — vision must not be so far-fetched that is outside of our reach. It must be conceivably possible, though not probable without additional effort.</p><p>When we start working for a company, we get used to spend most of our time working there. If your vision for life does not match with the vision of the company you work for — there could be many conflicts and you won’t be productive. If your vision for life, is to make this world a better place, you cannot work for a company which produces cigarettes or&nbsp;weapons.</p><p>The second most important thing in building a good image, is your integrity. Oprah Winfrey, who is a well-respected TV talk show host, actress, producer and philanthropist, says “Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not.”. I don’t think there is a better way of explaining, ‘integrity’ than this. It captures all what it needs to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I have visited and talked with many WSO2 customers over last eight years. We never talk to a customer with an intention of selling a product. First thing we do is listening to them and learn from them, then we all work towards the best solution to the problem they have. Finally we see how WSO2 could fit into the solution. If it is not a perfect fit — we never lie — we identify the gaps — and find a way to move forward by filling those gaps. Most of the time we win the customer at the second stage, when we build the solution for them and in many cases they agree to go ahead with us, even we are not the perfect match for their problem. That is mainly because, the level of integrity we demonstrate as a&nbsp;company.</p><p>No one is perfect — that also implies everyone makes mistakes. A guy with a high level of integrity would never hide mistakes, but rather would accept it, apologize for it and fix it. Never he would lie — never he would say something to one person and something else to another. Mark Twain once said, “If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember anything.”</p><p>In short, vision for life will drive you to the future, while the integrity is the cornerstone of your personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>The third most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, to raise yourself against negativity. Do not let negativity kill your productivity, enthusiasm, passion and spirit. People who spread negativity are the people who feel extremely insecure in their current state. They only have complaints — no suggestions. Their feedbacks are negative, not constructive. They see only bad — not a single bit of good. Identifying these type of people are not that hard — first you need to shield yourself from negativity — then you need to protect your team. Even just by keeping silent when hear something negative, you indirectly contributes to spread it over — fix it at that very point. If you are closely following the US presidential election campaign, you might have noticed, Donald Trump, who is the republican front runner at the moment, is being heavily criticized for being silent and not correcting a question raised by someone in his political campaign, where he said — ‘Muslims is a problem and Barack Obama is a Muslim’. Even though Trump is still the frontrunner, his popularity has gone down considerably after these dialogues.</p><p>The fourth most important thing you should do in building a positive image is, when you do something do it to a level where it can make an impact. If you believe something is right, go for it and make it happen. At the end of the day you may fail — but look back and see whether you have contributed to your best — if so, you will never frustrate — no&nbsp;regrets.</p><p>Expressing an idea is important — but representing an idea is much more important. When you represent something you own it. If you want to do something to make an impact, you must own it. You should not be a someone who talks the talk but does not walk the&nbsp;walk.</p><p>Tolerating criticism and accepting constructive feedback, is another key aspect in building a positive image. There are no better sources than criticisms to validate the direction we are heading and to learn. Bill Gates, once said ‘Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning’.</p><p>We discussed so far, the need to build a positive image and how to do it. Next we will focus on how to build a personal brand by expressing yourself. As we discussed before, personal branding requires, little more than having a good image — you need to learn to express yourself — not to market yourself. If you already have a positive image, being little expressive will build you a positive personal brand. If you already have a negative image, being little expressive will build you a negative personal brand. The image you build is a reflection of your character. That includes your role, as a father, son, brother, husband, colleague, friend, mentor, developer, architect and many more. You can build an image as a good father and a bad son — or as a good son and a bad brother — or as a good friend and a bad developer — likewise any combinations. But, more or less, ultimately your true image is how you do overall. You can be the best developer in the company, but then again if you do not understand the value of respecting each other’s religions and cultural values or — in a single word, if you are a racist — your top skills as a developer is worthless.</p><p>You need to pick how you want to impact the world — or how you want the world to see you. Thats your personal brand — and you build it on top of your character or the image. Your overall character is the shelter for your personal brand. If you do not build it right — if you find holes in it — you cannot protect your brand, even from a light shower. That’s why building the right character comes well before building a personal&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In my view, the area you can make the most impact to the world, in its positive direction, is the area that you are most passionate about. If you are extremely worried and angry about child labour — you can be a thought leader in protesting against child labour. If you are extremely worried and angry about human rights violations — you can be a thought leader in protecting human rights. If you are extremely passionate about integration technologies, you can be a thought leader in integration space. If you are extremely passionate about machine learning, you can be a thought leader in machine learning space. If you are passionate about APIs — you can be a thought leader in API space. If you are passionate about Big Data, you can be a thought leader in Big Data space. If you are passionate about Identity and Access Management, you can be a thought leader in Identity and Access Management space. Opportunities are limitless — but remember our ground rules — if you do something — do it to a level where it can make a positive impact. You do not need to worry about being a thought leader, but when you make a good positive impact, you will become a thought leader automatically.</p><p>Once you decide the area where you want to make an impact — the rest depends on how good you as a communicator. Communication is critically important, because, that’s the only way you can reach to your audience. Content marketing is the best way to build a brand and reputation online; when people look for information, they tend to go back to sources that were helpful to them. If you can become a trusted source of information through your content, over time you’ll become collectively known as the expert of your specific field. It’s best to start your own blog and update it on a regular basis — at least weekly. If you do not update regularly you lose your audience. At the start it would be tough — but once you make it a practice, it will start to happen effortlessly. Another key principle I would like to highlight here is the difference between good and great. Most of the time the difference between good and great lies heavily on how you do tiny/little things better. You may spend hours in writing a blog — finding the content — validating the content and getting all in order. But — we are bit lazy to put another more five to ten minutes of effort, to format our blog post, publish it in DZone and other blog aggregators, share it in social media sites — and do little more. This additional ten minutes of effort could easily make your blog post from being a good one to a great one — and also would attract a larger audience.</p><p>Regularly participate in mailing lists related to the subject of your interest is another way of passing your message to the rest of the world. These mailing lists may be within WSO2 or even outside. Look for standard bodies like W3C, IETF, OASIS — and any other communities that share the same interest of yours, and eagerly participate in related discussions. Not just the mailing lists, look for interesting groups in Facebook, LinkedIn, StackOverFlow and wherever possible and make your&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Webinars at WSO2 is another key medium to pass your message to the audience of your interest. If you want to be a thought leader in your product space, then your responsibility does not end at the moment you release the product. You need to come up with a plan for evangelization — and webinars could be extremely helpful.</p><p>At WSO2 you get a massive number of opportunities to build your brand. Your personal brand is important to you as well as, to the company you serve. Few years back, we had a VP of Marketing called Katie Poplin — and I personally got motivated by some of the concepts she put forward. One thing she believed was, in the open source community, brand value of individuals are much higher and trustworthier than that of companies. People used to think, everything a company shares, is part of their marketing propaganda — which may not reflect the real value. But, what individuals share are their first hand experience. Also we had monthly awards for best blogger, best evangelist and the best article. If I remember correctly I won both the best blogger and best evangelist awards in couple of months and it was fun&nbsp;:-).</p><p>Then again don’t just get constrained by the the opportunities you get from WSO2. Always look for what is happening outside. Try to get your articles published in external portals. Also — look for writing books. Writing a book is not hard as it looks to be. First you need to come up with a proposal, with an attractive topic, in your domain of expertise, and then submit it to few publishers. Most of the publishers accept book proposals and if you go to their web sites, you will find everything you need to know, on writing books — go for&nbsp;it!.</p><p>Conferences and meetups are another way to establish yourself as a prominent speaker in the corresponding domain. Then again, getting a speaking opportunity will depend on how better you have done your homework.</p><p>These are only few techniques to build your brand, in the domain you are interested in, on top of your personal image or the character. Building your personal brand is a focused exercise, not just a piece of cake. It’s a journey, not a destination. Once you built it — maintaining it and protecting it is much harder. As we discussed before, your image or the character is the shelter or the shield of your personal brand. If you build your character consciously, that’ll help you in protecting your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Finally to wrap up, in this session we discussed the importance of brand building, how to build your character and the image, how to build a personal brand under the shelter of your character. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/my-personal-brand-is-my-professional-success-story-8460fe351113">My Personal Brand is My Professional Success Story!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This article shows a strategy for security multiple APIs which have different authorization requirements but the tokens are issued by the same authority. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used as the identity provider. A user API and a service API are implemented in the ASP.NET Core API project. The access token for the user API data is created using an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">Open ID Connect</a> Code flow with PKCE authentication and the service API access token is created using the client credentials flow in the trusted backend of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> application. It is important that both access tokens will only work for the intended API.</p>

<p>Setup</p>



<p>The projects are setup to use a Blazor WASM application hosted in ASP.NET Core secured using the Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and the BFF pattern. Cookies are used to persist the session. This application uses two separate APIs, a user data API and a service API. The access token from the OIDC authentication is used to access the user data API and a client credentials flow is used to get an access token for the service API. Auth0 is setup using a regular web application and an API configuration. A scope was added to the API which is requested in the client application and validated in the API project.</p>







<p>Implementing the APIs in ASP.NET Core</p>



<p>OAuth2 JwtBearer auth is used to secure the APIs. As we use the same Authority and the same Audience, a single scheme can be used for both applications. We use the default JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme. </p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
	options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme 
		= JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme 
		= JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}).AddJwtBearer(options =&gt;
{
	options.Authority 
		= "https://dev-damienbod.eu.auth0.com/";
	options.Audience 
		= "https://auth0-api1";
});
  


<p>The AddAuthorization method is used to setup the policies so that each API can authorize that the correct token was used to request the data. Two policies are added, one for the user access token and one for the service access token. The access token created using the client credentials flow with Auth0 can be authorized using the azp claim and the Auth0 gty claim. The API client-id is validated using the token claims. The user access token is validated using an IAuthorizationHandler implementation. A default policy is added to the AddControllers method to require an authenticated user meaning a valid access token.</p>


  services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserApiScopeHandler&gt;();

services.AddAuthorization(policies =&gt;
{
	policies.AddPolicy("p-user-api-auth0", p =&gt;
	{
		p.Requirements.Add(new UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement());
		// Validate id of application for which the token was created
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "AScjLo16UadTQRIt2Zm1xLHVaEaE1feA");
	});

	policies.AddPolicy("p-service-api-auth0", p =&gt;
	{
		// Validate id of application for which the token was created
		p.RequireClaim("azp", "naWWz6gdxtbQ68Hd2oAehABmmGM9m1zJ");
		p.RequireClaim("gty", "client-credentials");
	});
});

services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
	var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
		.RequireAuthenticatedUser()
		.Build();
	options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});
  


<p>Swagger is added with an OAuth UI so that we can add access tokens manually to test the APIs.</p>


  services.AddSwaggerGen(c =&gt;
{
	// add JWT Authentication
	var securityScheme = new OpenApiSecurityScheme
	{
		Name = "JWT Authentication",
		Description = "Enter JWT Bearer token **_only_**",
		In = ParameterLocation.Header,
		Type = SecuritySchemeType.Http,
		Scheme = "bearer", // must be lower case
		BearerFormat = "JWT",
		Reference = new OpenApiReference
		{
			Id = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
			Type = ReferenceType.SecurityScheme
		}
	};
	c.AddSecurityDefinition(securityScheme.Reference.Id, securityScheme);
	c.AddSecurityRequirement(new OpenApiSecurityRequirement
	{
		{securityScheme, new string[] { }}
	});

	c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo
	{
		Title = "My API",
		Version = "v1",
		Description = "My API",
		Contact = new OpenApiContact
		{
			Name = "damienbod",
			Email = string.Empty,
			Url = new Uri("https://damienbod.com/"),
		},
	});
});
  


<p>The Configure method is used to add the middleware to implement the API application. It is important to use the UseAuthentication middleware and you should have no reason to implement this yourself. If you find yourself implementing some special authentication middleware for whatever reason, maybe your security architecture might be incorrect.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
	app.UseSwagger();
	app.UseSwaggerUI(c =&gt;
	{
		c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "User API");
		c.RoutePrefix = string.Empty;
	});

	// only needed for browser clients
	// app.UseCors("AllowAllOrigins");

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();

	app.UseRouting();

	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapControllers();
	});
}
  


<p>The UserApiScopeHandler class implements the abstract AuthorizationHandler class. Logic can be implemented here to fulfil the UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement. This requirement is what we use to authorize a request for the user data API. This handler just validates if the required scope exists in the scope claim. </p>


  public class UserApiScopeHandler : 
	AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement&gt;
{

	protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
		AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement requirement)
	{
		if (context == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));
		if (requirement == null)
			throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(requirement));

		var scopeClaim = context
			.User
			.Claims
			.FirstOrDefault(t =&gt; t.Type == "scope");

		if (scopeClaim != null)
		{
			var scopes = scopeClaim
				.Value
				.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
				
			if (scopes.Any(t =&gt; t == "auth0-user-api-one"))
			{
				context.Succeed(requirement);
			}
		}

		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}

public class UserApiScopeHandlerRequirement : 
	IAuthorizationRequirement{ }
  


<p>The policies can be applied anywhere within the application and the authorization logic is not tightly coupled anywhere to the business of the application. By separating the authorization implementation with the business implementation of the application, it is easier to maintain and understand the authorization and business of the application. This has worked well for me and I find it easy to test and maintain applications setup like this over long periods of time.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "p-user-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class UserOneController : ControllerBase
  


<p>The p-service-api-auth policy is applied to the Service API.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "p-service-api-auth0")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ServiceTwoController : ControllerBase
  


<p>When the application is started, the swagger UI is displayed and any access token can be pasted into the swagger UI. Both APIs are displayed in the swagger and both APIs require a different access token.</p>







<p>Calling the clients from ASP.NET Core</p>



<p>A Blazor WASM application hosted in ASP.NET Core is used to access the APIs. The application is secured using a trusted server rendered application and the OIDC data is persisted to a secure cookie.  The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider method is used to set the audience of the API to request the access token with the required scope. The scopes are added to the OIDC options.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
	options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-BlazorServer";
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
	options.Authority = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}";
	options.ClientId = Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"];
	options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Auth0:ClientSecret"];
	options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
	options.Scope.Clear();
	options.Scope.Add("openid");
	options.Scope.Add("profile");
	options.Scope.Add("email");
	options.Scope.Add("auth0-user-api-one");
	options.CallbackPath = new PathString("/signin-oidc");
	options.ClaimsIssuer = "Auth0";
	options.SaveTokens = true;
	options.UsePkce = true;
	options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
	options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";

	options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
	{
		// handle the logout redirection 
		OnRedirectToIdentityProviderForSignOut = (context) =&gt;
		{
			var logoutUri = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}/v2/logout?client_id={Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"]}";

			var postLogoutUri = context.Properties.RedirectUri;
			if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(postLogoutUri))
			{
				if (postLogoutUri.StartsWith("/"))
				{
					// transform to absolute
					var request = context.Request;
					postLogoutUri = request.Scheme + "://" + request.Host + request.PathBase + postLogoutUri;
				}
				logoutUri += $"&amp;returnTo={ Uri.EscapeDataString(postLogoutUri)}";
			}

			context.Response.Redirect(logoutUri);
			context.HandleResponse();

			return Task.CompletedTask;
		},
		OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
		{
			// The context's ProtocolMessage can be used to pass along additional query parameters
			// to Auth0's /authorize endpoint.
			// 
			// Set the audience query parameter to the API identifier to ensure the returned Access Tokens can be used
			// to call protected endpoints on the corresponding API.
			context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter("audience", "https://auth0-api1");

			return Task.FromResult(0);
		}
	};
});

  


<p>Calling the User API</p>



<p>A user API client service is used to request the data from the ASP.NET Core API. The access token is passed as a parameter and the IHttpClientFactory is used to create the HttpClient.</p>


  /// &lt;summary&gt;
/// setup to oidc client in the startup correctly
/// https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core#enterprise-saml-and-others-
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public class MyApiUserOneClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configurations;
	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;

	public MyApiUserOneClient(
		IConfiguration configurations,
		IHttpClientFactory clientFactory)
	{
		_configurations = configurations;
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
	}

	public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetUserOneApiData(string accessToken)
	{
		try
		{
			var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

			client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configurations["MyApiUrl"]);

			client.SetBearerToken(accessToken);

			var response = await client.GetAsync("api/UserOne");
			if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
			{
				var data = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
				await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

				return data;
			}

			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}
}

  


<p>The user access token is saved to the HttpContext after a successful sign-in and the GetTokenAsync method with the “access_token” parameter is used to retrieve the user access token. </p>


  private readonly MyApiUserOneClient _myApiUserOneClient;

public CallUserApiController(
	MyApiUserOneClient myApiUserOneClient)
{
	_myApiUserOneClient = myApiUserOneClient;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetAsync()
{
	// call user API
	string accessToken = 
		await HttpContext.GetTokenAsync("access_token");
	var userData = 
		await _myApiUserOneClient
			.GetUserOneApiData(accessToken);

	return Ok(userData);
}
  


<p>Calling the Service API </p>



<p>Using a service API requires requesting an access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. This flow can only be used in a trusted backend and a secret is required to request an access token. No user is involved. This is a machine to machine request. The access token is persisted to a distributed cache.</p>


  public class Auth0CCTokenApiService
{
	private readonly ILogger&lt;Auth0CCTokenApiService&gt; _logger;
	private readonly Auth0ApiConfiguration _auth0ApiConfiguration;

	private static readonly Object _lock = new Object();
	private IDistributedCache _cache;

	private const int cacheExpirationInDays = 1;

	private class AccessTokenResult
	{
		public string AcessToken { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public DateTime ExpiresIn { get; set; }
	}

	private class AccessTokenItem
	{
		public string access_token { get; set; } = string.Empty;
		public int expires_in { get; set; }
		public string token_type { get; set; }
		public string scope { get; set; }
	}

	public Auth0CCTokenApiService(
			IOptions&lt;Auth0ApiConfiguration&gt; auth0ApiConfiguration,
			IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory,
			ILoggerFactory loggerFactory,
			IDistributedCache cache)
	{
		_auth0ApiConfiguration = auth0ApiConfiguration.Value;
		_logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger&lt;Auth0CCTokenApiService&gt;();
		_cache = cache;
	}

	public async Task&lt;string&gt; GetApiToken(HttpClient client, string api_name)
	{
		var accessToken = GetFromCache(api_name);

		if (accessToken != null)
		{
			if (accessToken.ExpiresIn &gt; DateTime.UtcNow)
			{
				return accessToken.AcessToken;
			}
			else
			{
				// remove  =&gt; NOT Needed for this cache type
			}
		}

		_logger.LogDebug($"GetApiToken new from oauth server for {api_name}");

		// add
		var newAccessToken = await GetApiTokenClient(client);
		AddToCache(api_name, newAccessToken);

		return newAccessToken.AcessToken;
	}

	private async Task&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt; GetApiTokenClient(HttpClient client)
	{
		try
		{
			var payload = new Auth0ClientCrendentials
			{
				client_id = _auth0ApiConfiguration.ClientId,
				client_secret = _auth0ApiConfiguration.ClientSecret,
				audience = _auth0ApiConfiguration.Audience
			};

			var authUrl = _auth0ApiConfiguration.Url;
			var tokenResponse = await client.PostAsJsonAsync(authUrl, payload);

			if (tokenResponse.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
			{
				var result = await tokenResponse.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync&lt;AccessTokenItem&gt;();
				DateTime expirationTime = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(result.expires_in).DateTime;
				return new AccessTokenResult
				{
					AcessToken = result.access_token,
					ExpiresIn = expirationTime
				};
			}

			_logger.LogError($"tokenResponse.IsError Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {tokenResponse.StatusCode}, Error: {tokenResponse.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			_logger.LogError($"Exception {e}");
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}

	private void AddToCache(string key, AccessTokenResult accessTokenItem)
	{
		var options = new DistributedCacheEntryOptions().SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromDays(cacheExpirationInDays));

		lock (_lock)
		{
			_cache.SetString(key, System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(accessTokenItem), options);
		}
	}

	private AccessTokenResult GetFromCache(string key)
	{
		var item = _cache.GetString(key);
		if (item != null)
		{
			return System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;AccessTokenResult&gt;(item);
		}

		return null;
	}
}
  


<p>The MyApiServiceTwoClient service uses the client credentials token client to get the access token and request data from the service API.</p>


  public class MyApiServiceTwoClient
{
	private readonly IConfiguration _configurations;
	private readonly IHttpClientFactory _clientFactory;
	private readonly Auth0CCTokenApiService _auth0TokenApiService;

	public MyApiServiceTwoClient(
		IConfiguration configurations,
		IHttpClientFactory clientFactory,
		Auth0CCTokenApiService auth0TokenApiService)
	{
		_configurations = configurations;
		_clientFactory = clientFactory;
		_auth0TokenApiService = auth0TokenApiService;
	}

	public async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; GetServiceTwoApiData()
	{
		try
		{
			var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient();

			client.BaseAddress = new Uri(_configurations["MyApiUrl"]);

			var access_token = await _auth0TokenApiService.GetApiToken(client, "ServiceTwoApi");

			client.SetBearerToken(access_token);

			var response = await client.GetAsync("api/ServiceTwo");
			if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
			{
				var data = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt;(
				await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync());

				return data;
			}

			throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
		}
		catch (Exception e)
		{
			throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
		}
	}
}


  


<p>The services are added to the default IoC in ASP.NET Core so that construction injection can be used.</p>


  services.AddHttpClient();
services.AddOptions();

services.Configure&lt;Auth0ApiConfiguration(Configuration.GetSection("Auth0ApiConfiguration");
services.AddScoped&lt;Auth0CCTokenApiService&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;MyApiServiceTwoClient&gt;();
services.AddScoped&lt;MyApiUserOneClient&gt;();
  


<p>The service can be used anywhere in the code as required.</p>


  private readonly MyApiServiceTwoClient _myApiClientService;

public CallServiceApiController(
	MyApiServiceTwoClient myApiClientService)
{
	_myApiClientService = myApiClientService;
}

[HttpGet]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; GetAsync()
{
	// call service API
	var serviceData = await 
		_myApiClientService.GetServiceTwoApiData();

	return Ok(serviceData);
}
  


<p>You can test the APIs in the swagger UI. I added a breakpoint to my application and copied the access token. I added the token to the swagger UI.</p>







<p>If you send a HTTP request using the wrong token for the intended API, the request will be rejected and a 401or 403 is returned. Without the extra authorization logic implemented with the policies, this request would not have failed.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>It is really important to validate that only access tokens created for the specific APIs will work. There are different ways of implementing this. If using service APIs which are probably solution internal,  you could possibly use network security as well to separate these into different security zones. It is really important to validate the no access non-functional use case where using the same identity provider to create the access token for different APIs or if the identity provider produces access tokens for different applications which will probably have different security requirements. For high security requirements, you could use sender constrained tokens.</p>

And the costs continue to climb as the drama unfolds with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/13/ever-given-seized-egypt/">port authorities and insurers battling over what’s owed to&nbsp;who.</a></p><p>Transmute is a software company — a verifiable credentials as a service company to be exact — and we’ve been focused specifically on the credentials involved in moving steel assets around the globe alongside our <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/interoperability-is-not-a-choice-387d57c6dc32">customers at DHS SVIP and CBP</a> for the last couple years now. Now, there’s no “silver bullet” for mitigating the fiscal impact of the Ever Given on global trade, and ships who arrived the day it got stuck or shortly after certainly faced a tough decision — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/suez-canal-blocked-ship.html">sail around the Cape of Africa for up to ~$800K [fuel costs alone] + ~26 days to trip or wait it out at an up to $30K per day demurrage expense</a> [without knowing it’d only be stuck for 6 days or ~$180,000].</p><p>So what if you’re a shipping manager and you can make this decision faster? Or, make the call before your ship arrives at the canal? [Some did make this decision, by the way]. What if your goods are stuck on the Ever Given — do you wait it out? Switching suppliers is costly, and you’ve likely got existing contracts in place for much of the cargo. Even if you could fulfill existing contracts and demand on time with a new supplier, what do you do with the delayed cargo expense? What if you’re unsure whether you can sell the duplicate and delayed goods when they reach their originally intended destination?</p><p>Well, verifiable credentials — a special kind of digital document that’s cryptographically provable, timestamped and anchored to an immutable ledger at the very moment in time it’s created — can give companies the kind of data needed to make these sorts of decisions. With use over time for trade data, verifiable credentials build a natural reputation for all the things the trade documents are about: suppliers, products, contracts, ports, regulations, tariffs, time between supply chain handoff points,&nbsp;etc.</p><blockquote>This type of structured data is of such high integrity that supply chain operators can rely on it and feel empowered to make decisions based on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>What I’m hoping comes from this global trade disaster is a change in the way supply chain operators make critical decisions. Supply chains of the future will be powered by verifiable credentials, which seamlessly bridge all the data silos that exist today — whether software-created silos or even the paper-based manual, offline&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Today, it’s possible to move from a static, critical chain style of management where we often find ourselves in a reactive position to supply chains that look more like an octopus. High integrity data about suppliers and products enables proactive, dynamic decision making in anticipation of and in real time response to shifts in the market — ultimately capturing more revenue opportunities and mitigating risk at the same&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/takeaways-from-the-suez-canal-crisis-971f7404b058">Takeaways from the Suez Canal Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.</p>

<p>What is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

 What You'll Need 

<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>

 
 An HTTP client. 
 A URL parsing library. 
 A hashing library that supports SHA256. 
 A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML. 
 The ability to show an HTML form to the user. 
 

 IndieAuth Flow Summary 

<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>

 
 Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address. 
 Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server. 
 Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string. 
 Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string. 
 Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server. 
 

 Step by Step 

<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>

 Show the Sign-In Form 

<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type="url"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>

<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>

<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/indieauth/start" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="url" name="url" placeholder="example.com"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Sign In"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>

 Discover the IndieAuth Server 

<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>

<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href="https://micropub.net">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>

<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#url-canonicalization">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="token_endpoint" href="..."&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href="https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>

 Start the Flow by Redirecting the User 

<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>

<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>

 
 <code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value. 
 <code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app. 
 <code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below. 
 <code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short. 
 <code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server. 
 <code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.) 
 

<p>Calculating the Code Challenge</p>

<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>

 
 Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long 
 Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string 
 Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge 
 

<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>

<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>

 <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code
  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com
  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc
  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256
  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks
  &amp;scope=profile
</code> 

<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>

<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>

 Handle the Redirect Back 

<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>

 <code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa
  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53
</code> 

<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>

 Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info 

<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
 <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> 
 <code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect. 
 <code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request. 
 <code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge. 
 

<p>This is described in additional detail <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>

 <code>{
  "me": "https://indieauth.rocks/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "IndieAuth Rocks",
    "url": https://indieauth.rocks/"
    "photo": "https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>

 
 The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field. 
 If the <code>me</code> URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step. 
 

<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>

<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">in the spec</a>.</p>

<p>Now you're done!</p>

<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their <code>me</code> URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the <code>profile</code> object to keep their profile up to date.</p>

 Testing Your IndieAuth Client 

<p>To test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:</p>

 
 <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing. 
 <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress</a> - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well. 
 <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal</a> - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server. 
 <a href="https://indieweb.org/selfauth">Selfauth</a> - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server. 
 

<p>Eventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at <a href="https://indieauth.rocks">indieauth.rocks</a> so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.</p>

 Getting Help 

<p>If you get stuck or need help, feel free to drop by the <a href="https://indieweb.org/discuss">IndieWeb chat</a> to ask questions! Myself and many others are there all the time and happy to help troubleshoot new IndieAuth implementations!</p>

However, complex decisions based on experience, gut instinct, leadership and opinions still play a role, but most decisions can now be underpinned with a firmer foundation.  BE curious&nbsp;about how the business operates and makes money and its drivers of cost, revenue, and customer satisfaction through the lens of data and analytical models.  BE an ambassador&nbsp;of change. Data uncovers assumptions that unpack previous political decisions and moves power. Data does not create change but will create conflict — how this is managed is a critical CDO skill.  BE a great storyteller.  KNOW who&nbsp;is the smartest data scientist in the company, where the most sophisticated models are, and understand and appreciate what those data teams do and how they do it. Managing and getting the best from these teams is a skill everyone needs.  FIGURE out&nbsp;and articulate the value your team can deliver to the business in the next week, month, and quarter. As the CDO, what is the value you bring to your peers and shareholder in the next 5 years?  IMPROVE decision making&nbsp;using data for day to day, how to reduce risk and how to inform the company on achieving and adapting the company’s strategy.  BUILD relationships&nbsp;to source data both within your business and the wider ecosystem. This is both to determine the quality of the data and be able to better use data and or roll out solutions that improve quality and decision-making.  KNOW what technical questions&nbsp;to ask and being able to live with the complexity involved in the delivery.  <p>Decision making is a complex affair, and as CDO’s we are there to support. Decisions are perceived to be easier when there is lots of data, and the signal is big, loud and really clear. Big data has a place, but we must not forget small signals from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography">ethnographic data</a>&nbsp;sources. Leadership often does not know what to do with critical and challenging small data, especially when it challenges easy assumptions that big data justifies.</p><blockquote><p>A CDO superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias</p></blockquote><p>Our superpower is to shine a light on all data, without bias, and help strategic thinkers, who often put a higher value on quantitative data. They didn’t know how to handle data that wasn’t easily measurable does not show up in existing paid-for reports. Ethnographic work has a serious perception problem in a data-driven decision world. A key role of the CDO is to uncover all data and its value, not bias to a bigger data set — that is just lazy. I love this image from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/triciawang/">@triciawang</a>, where the idea of critical small data set is represented as “thick data.” Do follow her work&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triciawang.com/">https://www.triciawang.com/</a>&nbsp;or that of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievebell/">Genevieve Bell</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://katecrawford.net/about.html">Kate Crawford</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.danah.org/">danah boyd&nbsp;</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/zephoria">@zephoria</a>).</p>          <p>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7">Nokia’s experience of ignoring small data</a></p> Note to the CEO <p>Digital transformation has built a dependence on data, and the bigger the data set, the more weight it is assumed to have. Often, there is a dangerous assumption made that the risk in a decision is reduced because of the data set's size. It may be true for operational issues and automated decision making but not necessarily for strategy.</p><p>As the CEO, you need to determine the half-life of the data used to justify or solidify a decision. Half-life in science is when more than 50 per cent of a substance has undergone a radical change; in business terms, this is when half the value of the data is lost or a doubling of the error. The bigger the data set, the quicker (shorter) the half-life will be. Indeed some data’s half-life is less than the time it took to collect and store it. It is big but it really has no value. For small data sets, such as ethnographic data, the half-life can be longer than a 3 to 5 years strategic planning cycle. Since some data might be small and could be a signal to your future, supporting a CDO who puts equal weight on all data is critical to success.</p>

<p>The article shows how an ASP.NET Core Blazor web assembly UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application can be secured using cookies. <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> is used as the identity provider. The trusted application is protected using the Open ID Connect code flow with a secret and using PKCE. The API calls are protected using the secure cookie and anti-forgery tokens to protect against CSRF. This architecture is also known as the Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern.</p>

  <a href="https://damienbod.com/2021/03/08/securing-blazor-web-assembly-using-cookies/">Securing Blazor Web assembly using Cookies and Azure AD</a>  Securing Blazor Web assembly using Cookies and Auth0  







<p>The application was built as described in the previous blog in this series. Please refer to that blog for implementation details about the WASM application, user session and anti-forgery tokens. Setting up the Auth0 authentication and the differences are described in this blog.</p>



<p>An Auth0 account is required and a Regular Web Application was setup for this. This is not an SPA application and must always be deployed with a backend which can keep a secret. The WASM client can only use the APIs on the same domain and uses cookies. All application authentication is implemented in the trusted backend and the secure data is encrypted in the cookie.</p>







<p>The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect Nuget package is used to add the authentication to the ASP.NET Core application. User secrets are used for configuration which uses the Auth0 sensitive data</p>


  &lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"&gt;

  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;WebProject_DirectoryAccessLevelKey&gt;1&lt;/WebProject_DirectoryAccessLevelKey&gt;
    &lt;UserSecretsId&gt;de0b7f31-65d4-46d6-8382-30c94073cf4a&lt;/UserSecretsId&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;

  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\Client\BlazorAuth0Bff.Client.csproj" /&gt;
    &lt;ProjectReference Include="..\Shared\BlazorAuth0Bff.Shared.csproj" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
  
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server" Version="5.0.5" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer" Version="5.0.5" NoWarn="NU1605" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect" Version="5.0.5" NoWarn="NU1605" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="IdentityModel" Version="5.1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;PackageReference Include="IdentityModel.AspNetCore" Version="3.0.0" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;

&lt;/Project&gt;

  


<p>The ConfigureServices method in the Startup class of the ASP.NET Core Blazor server application is used to add the authentication. The Open ID Connect code flow with PKCE and a client secret is used for the default challenge and a cookie is used to persist the tokens if authenticated. The Blazor client WASM uses the cookie to access the API.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Open ID Connect is configured to match the Auth0 settings for the client. A client secret is required and used to authenticate the application. The PKCE option is set explicitly to use PKCE with the client configuration. The required scopes are set so that the profile is returned and an email. These are OIDC standard scopes. The user profile API is used to return the profile data and so keep the id_token small. The tokens are persisted. If successful, the data is persisted to an identity cookie. The logout client is configured as documented by Auth0 in its example.</p>


  services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt; {
	options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
	options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options =&gt;
{
	options.Cookie.Name = "__Host-BlazorServer";
	options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt; {
	options.Authority = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}";
	options.ClientId = Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"];
	options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Auth0:ClientSecret"];
	options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
	options.Scope.Clear();
	options.Scope.Add("openid");
	options.Scope.Add("profile");
	options.Scope.Add("email");
	options.CallbackPath = new PathString("/signin-oidc");
	options.ClaimsIssuer = "Auth0";
	options.SaveTokens = true;
	options.UsePkce = true;
	options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
	options.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType = "name";

	options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
	{
		// handle the logout redirection 
		OnRedirectToIdentityProviderForSignOut = (context) =&gt;
		{
			var logoutUri = $"https://{Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}/v2/logout?client_id={Configuration["Auth0:ClientId"]}";

			var postLogoutUri = context.Properties.RedirectUri;
			if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(postLogoutUri))
			{
				if (postLogoutUri.StartsWith("/"))
				{
					// transform to absolute
					var request = context.Request;
					postLogoutUri = request.Scheme + "://" + request.Host + request.PathBase + postLogoutUri;
				}
				logoutUri += $"&amp;returnTo={ Uri.EscapeDataString(postLogoutUri)}";
			}

			context.Response.Redirect(logoutUri);
			context.HandleResponse();

			return Task.CompletedTask;
		}
	};
});
  


<p>The Configure method is implement to require authentication. The UseAuthentication extension method is required. Our endpoints are added like in the previous blog.</p>


  public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
	// IdentityModelEventSource.ShowPII = true;
	JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

	app.UseHttpsRedirection();
	app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
	app.UseStaticFiles();

	app.UseRouting();
	app.UseAuthentication();
	app.UseAuthorization();

	app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
	{
		endpoints.MapRazorPages();
		endpoints.MapControllers();
		endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
	});
}
  


<p>The Auth0 configuration can be downloaded in the sample application, or you can configure this direct in the Auth0 UI and copy this. Three properties are required. I added these to the user secrets in my application development. If I deployed this to Azure, I would add these to an Azure Key Vault and can then use managed identities to access the secrets.</p>


  "Auth0": {
   "Domain": "your-domain-in-auth0",
   "ClientId": "--in-secrets--",
   "ClientSecret": "--in-secrets--"
}
  


<p>Now everything will run and you can now use ASP.NET Core Blazor BFF with Auth0. We don’t need any access tokens in the browser.  This was really simple to configure and only ASP.NET Core standard Nuget packages are used. Security best practices are supported by Auth0 and it is really easy to setup. In production I would force MFA and FIDO2 if possible. </p>

  Academic journals are becoming the vacuum tubes of the Academy 2.0 enterprise; they are already described and defined more by their limitations than by their advantages. In their early decades, they served us well, until they didn’t. After the transition to an academy-internal publication economy, powered by ePrint services hosted across the planet, journals will not be missed. That individual academic libraries should need to continue to pony up for thousands of journal subscriptions for decades to come is now an idea only in the Xeroxed business models of for-profit publishers. Everyone else is looking for a way out; and the internet awaits.

<p>Setup</p>



<p>We want implement the flow shown in the following figure. The National Driving license application is responsible for issuing driver licenses and administrating licenses for users which have authenticated correctly. The user can see his or her driver license and a verifiable credential displayed as a QR code which can be used to add the credential to a digital wallet. When the application generates the credential, it adds the credential DID to the blockchain ledger with the cryptographic proof of the issuer and the document. When you scan the QR Code, the DID will get validated and will be added to the wallet along with the request claims. The digital wallet must be able to find the DID on the correct network and the schema and needs to search for the ledger in the correct blockchain. A good wallet should take care of this for you. The schema is required so that the data in the DID document can be understood.</p>







<p>Trinsic Setup</p>



<p>Trinsic is used to connect to the blockchain and create the DIDs, credentials in this example. Trinsic provides good getting started <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">docs</a>.</p>



<p>In Trinsic, you need to create an organisation for the Issuer application.</p>







<p>Click on the details of the organisation to get the API key. This is required for the application. This API Key cannot be replaced or updated, so if you make a mistake and lose this, commit it in code, you would have to create a new organisation. It is almost important to note the network. This is where you can find the DID to get the credentials produced by this issuer. </p>







<p>To issuer credentials, you need to create a template or schema with the claims which are issued in the credential using the template. The issuer application provides values for the claims.</p>







<p>Implementing the ASP.NET Core Issuer </p>



<p>The verifiable credentials issuer is implemented in an ASP.NET Core application using Razor pages and Identity. This application needs to authenticate the users before issuing a verifiable credential for the user. FIDO2 with the correct authenticate flow would be a good choice as this would protect against phishing. You could use credentials as well, if the users of the applications had a trusted ID. You would still have to protect against phishing. The quality of the credentials issued depends on the security of the issuing application. If the application has weak user authentication, then the credentials cannot be trusted. For a bank, gov IDs, drivings license, a high level of security is required. Open ID Connect FAPI with FIDO2 would make a good solution to authenticate the user. Or a user with a trusted gov issued credential together with FIDO2 would also be good. </p>



<p>The ASP.NET Core application initializes the services and adds the Trinsic client using the API Key from the organisation which issues the credentials. The Trinsic.ServiceClients Nuget package is used for the Trinsic integration. ASP.NET Core Identity is used to add, remove users and add driving licenses for the users in the administration part of the application. MFA should be setup but as this is a demo, I have not forced this.</p>

<p>User secrets are used to add the secrets required for the application in development. The secrets can be added to the  Json secrets file and not to the code source. If deploying this to Azure, the secrets would be read from Azure Key vault. The application requires the Trinsic API Key and the credential template definition ID created in Trinsic studio.</p>

<p>The Trinsic credentials service is responsible for creating the verifiable credentials. It uses the users drivers license and creates a new credential using the Trinsic client API using the CreateCredentialAsync method. The claims must match the template created in the studio. A Trinsic specific URL is returned. This can be used to create a QR Code which can be scanned from a Trinsic digital wallet.</p>

<p>When the application is started, you can register and create a new license in the license administration. </p>







<p>Add licences as required. The credentials will not be created here, only when you try to get a driver license as a user.</p>







<p>The QR code of the license is displayed which can be scanned and added to your Trinsic digital wallet.</p>







<p>Notes</p>



<p>This works fairly good but has a number of problems. The digital wallets are vendor specific and the QR Code, credential links are dependent on the product used to create this. The wallet implementations and the URL created for the credentials are all specific and rely on good will of the different implementations of the different vendors. This requires an RFC specification or something like this, if SSI should become easy to use and mainstream. Without this, users would require n-wallets for all the different applications and would also have problems using credentials between different systems.</p>



<p>Another problem is the organisations API keys use the represent the issuer or the verifier applications. If this API keys get leaked which they will, the keys are hard to replace.</p>



<p>Using the wallet, the user also needs to know which network to use to load the credentials, or to login to your product.  A default user will not know where to find the required DID. </p>



<p>If signing in using the wallet credentials, the application does not protect against phishing. This is not good enough for high security authentication. FIDO2 and WebAuthn should be used if handling such sensitive data as this is designed for.</p>



<p>Self sovereign identities is in the very early stages but holds lots of potential. A lot will depend on how easy it is to use and how easy it is to implement and share credentials between systems. The quality of the credential will depend on the quality of the application issuing it.</p>



<p>In a follow up blog to this one, <a href="https://github.com/Franklin89">Matteo </a>will use the verifiable credentials added to the digital wallet and verify them in  a second application.</p>

While remaining compatible with the original standard, this second version adds additional features, among them for user verification enhancements, manageability, enterprise features, and an Apple attestation format.</p>
<p>This parallels the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2149">similar progress of the closely related second version of the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification</a>, which recently achieved Proposed Recommendation (PR) status.</p>

<p>Of the deeper thoughts I might give to this moment, I have <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/25-governance-leadership-founders-syndrome.html">given them elsewhere</a>.  For this blogpost, I just want to speak of feelings... feelings of hurt and hope.</p>
<p>I am reaching out, collecting the feelings of those I see around me, writing them in my mind's journal.  Though I hold clear positions in this moment, there are few roots of feeling and emotion about the moment I feel I haven't steeped in myself at some time.  Sometimes I tell this to friends, and they think maybe I am drifting from a mutual position, and this is painful for them.  Perhaps they fear this could constitute or signal some kind of betrayal.  I don't know what to say: I've been here too long to feel just one thing, even if I can commit to one position.</p>
<p>So I open my journal of feelings, and here I share some of the pages collecting the pain I see around me:</p>
<p>The irony of a movement wanting to be so logical and above feelings being drowned in them.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who found a comfortable and welcoming home in a world of loneliness, and the split between despondence and outrage for that unraveling.</p>
<p>The feelings of those who wanted to join that home too, but did not feel welcome.</p>
<p>The pent up feelings of those unheard for so long, uncorked and flowing.</p>
<p>The weight and shadow of a central person who seems to feel things so strongly but cannot, and does not care to learn to, understand the feelings of those around them.</p>
<p>I flip a few pages ahead.  The pages are blank, and I interpret this as new chapters for us to write, together.</p>
<p>I hope we might re-discover the heart of our movement.</p>
<p>I hope we can find a place past the pain of the present, healing to build the future.</p>
<p>I hope we can build a new home, strong enough to serve us and keep us safe, but without the walls, moat, and throne of a fortress.</p>
<p>I hope we can be a movement that lives up to our claims: of justice, of freedom, of human rights, to bring these to everyone, especially those we haven't reached.</p>

If we reflect on it, finance has been shoring up its position for a while.&nbsp; HR, tech, processes, methods, branding, IP, legal, and culture have become subservient and controlled by finance. In the finance control game, we are all just an asset or liability and set a budget!&nbsp; In the context of control and power and how to make better decisions, as a CDO, your friends and partners are human resources, tech, legal, operations, marketing, sales and strategy; your threat and enemy is finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A critical inquiry you will have on day 0 is what weight do we, this organisation, put on the aspects of good decision making? How do we order and with what authority data, finance,&nbsp; team, processes/methods, justifications, regulation, culture/brand/reputation, compliance/oversight/ governance,&nbsp; reporting and stewardship? What is more important to us as a team; the trustworthiness or truthfulness of a decision?&nbsp; The quality of a decision? The explainability of a decision? The ability to communicate a decision or diversity in a decision?&nbsp; If data is controlled by finance and seen as an asset or liability, how does it affect your decision making capability?</p><p>As the CDO, if you determine that the axis of control remains with the CEO/ CFO it may be time to align your skill to a CEO gets data.&nbsp;</p><p>Note to the CEO</p><p>It is your choice, but your new CDO is your new CFO in terms of power for decision making, which means there will be a swing in the power game. Your existing CEO/ CFO axis is under threat, and we know that underhanded and political games will emerge in all changes of power.&nbsp; You will lead the choice about how you want this to play out given that all CEO’s need to find their next role every 5 to 7 years, which will only ever require more interactions with the CDO and data, defending the CFO power plays will not bring favour to your next role.&nbsp; The CFO remains critically essential, but the existing two-way axis (CEO/CFO) has to become a three-way game that enables the CDO to shine until a new power balance is reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>In 2018 I built a <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-powered-questionnaires/">tool</a> to help researchers evaluate a proposed set of <a href="https://credweb.org/reviewed-signals-20200224/">credibility signals</a> intended to enable <a href="https://misinfocon.com/how-annotation-enables-machine-learning-fc4b0ceab10a">automated systems</a> to rate the credibility of news stories.</p>
<p>Here are examples of such signals:</p>
<p>– Authors cite expert sources (positive)</p>
<p>– Title is clickbaity (negative)</p>
<p>And my favorite:</p>
<p>– Authors acknowledge uncertainty (positive)</p>
<p>Will the news ecosystem ever be able to label stories automatically based on automatic detection of such signals, and if so, should it? These are open questions. The best way to improve news literacy may be the <a href="https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/">SIFT</a> method advocated by Mike Caulfield, which shifts attention away from intrinsic properties of individual news stories and advises readers to:</p>
<p>– Stop</p>
<p>– Investigate the source</p>
<p>– Find better coverage</p>
<p>– Trace claims, quotes, and media to original context</p>
<p>“The goal of SIFT,” writes Charlie Warzel in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/fake-news-media-attention.html">Don’t Go Down the Rabbit Hole</a>, “isn’t to be the arbiter of truth but to instill a reflex that asks if something is worth one’s time and attention and to turn away if not.”</p>
<p>SIFT favors extrinsic signals over the intrinsic ones that were the focus of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credibility/">W3C Credible Web Community Group</a>. But intrinsic signals may yet play an important role, if not as part of a large-scale automated labeling effort then at least as another kind of news literacy reflex.</p>
<p>This morning, in <a href="https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/ap_news/commentary-how-public-health-officials-can-convince-those-reluctant-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine/article_0d3d0540-8c55-5f55-9078-f6ca2052cf4e.html">How public health officials can convince those reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine</a>, I read the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>What made these Trump supporters shift their views on vaccines? Science — offered straight-up and with a dash of humility.</p>
<p>The unlikely change agent was Dr. Tom Frieden, who headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Obama administration. Frieden appealed to facts, not his credentials. He noted that the theory behind the vaccine was backed by 20 years of research, that tens of thousands of people had participated in well-controlled clinical trials, and that the overwhelming share of doctors have opted for the shots.</p>
<p>He leavened those facts with an acknowledgment of uncertainty. He conceded that the vaccine’s potential long-term risks were unknown. He pointed out that the virus’s long-term effects were also uncertain.</p>
<p>“He’s just honest with us and telling us nothing is 100% here, people,” one participant noted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s evidence that acknowledgement of uncertainty really is a powerful signal of credibility. Maybe machines will be able to detect it and label it; maybe those labels will matter to people. Meanwhile, it’s something people can detect and do care about. Teaching students to value sources that acknowledge uncertainty, and discount ones that don’t, ought to be part of any strategy to improve news literacy.</p>

<p>Several years ago I bought two 5-packs of reading glasses. There was a 1.75-diopter set for books, magazines, newspapers, and my laptop (when it’s in my lap), plus a 1.25-diopter set for the screens I look at when working in my <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2009/03/14/the-floating-arms-keyboard/">Captain Kirk chair</a>. They were cheap, and the idea was that they’d be an abundant resource. I could leave spectacles lying around in various places, there would always be a pair handy, no worries about losing them.</p>
<p>So of course I did lose them like crazy. At one point I bought another 5-pack but still, somehow, I’m down to a single 1.75 and a single 1.25. And I just realized it’s been that way for quite a while. Now that the resource is scarce, I value it more highly and take care to preserve it.</p>
<p>I’m sorely tempted to restock. It’s so easy! A couple of clicks and two more 5-packs will be here tomorrow. And they’re cheap, so what’s not to like?</p>
<p>For now, I’m resisting the temptation because I don’t like the effect such radical abundance has had on me. It’s ridiculous to lose 13 pairs of glasses in a couple of years. I can’t imagine how I’d explain that to my pre-Amazon self.</p>
<p>For now, I’m going to try to assign greater value to the glasses I do have, and treat them accordingly. And when I finally do lose them, I hope I’ll resist the one-click solution. I thought it was brilliant at the time, and part of me still does. But it just doesn’t feel good.</p>

<p>Note: This post is the sole opinion and perspective of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Over the past several months I have been diligently attempting to map the dynamically evolving world of trust frameworks and verifiable credentials into a straightforward and hopefully timeless terminology that can be used for policymaking. The storyboard diagram above is what I’ve come up with so&nbsp;far.</p>  Counterparty — for every consequential relationship or transaction there are at a minimum of two parties involved. Regardless of whether the interaction is collaborative, competitive, zero positive sum, they can be considered as counterparties to one&nbsp;another.  Claim — is the something that is the matter of concern between the counterparties — it can be financial, tangible, intangible; something in the present, or a promise of something in the&nbsp;future.  Offer — a counterparty offers something that usually relates to a&nbsp;Claim.  Commit — a counterparty can commit to its&nbsp;Offer.  Present — a counterparty can present an Offer (or a&nbsp;Claim).  Accept — on the other side, the other counterparty accepts an&nbsp;Offer.  Issue — An Offer, once formed, can be issued in whatever form — usually a document or credential that is signed by the counterparty.  Hold — An offer can be held. How it is held depends on its embodiment (e.g.., digital, paper, verbal,&nbsp;etc.)  Verify — An offer, or more specifically its embodiment can be verified for its origin and integrity.  <p>All of the above is made possible&nbsp;by:</p>  Business Trust — how the counterparties decide to trust one another. This is the non-technical aspect of agreements, rules, treaties, legislation, etc.  <p>And underpinned by:</p>  Technical Trust: how the counterparties prove to another that their trust has not been compromised. This the technical aspect that includes, cryptographic protocols, data formats,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Why is this useful? When writing policy, you need a succinct model which is clear enough for subsequent interpretation. To do this, you need conceptual buckets to drop things into. Yes, this model is likely to change, but it’s my best and latest crack at it to synthesize the complex world of digital credentials with an abstraction that might be useful to help us align existing solutions while adopting exciting new capabilities.</p><p>As always, I am open for comment and constructive feedback. You know where to find&nbsp;me.</p>

   <p><br></p><p></p><p>I have written my fair amount over lockdown, but a core tenant of my hope was to leave the old normal behind, not wanting a new normal but a better normal.&nbsp; The old normal (pre-#covid19) was as exhausting as I felt like a dog whose sole objective was to chase its own tail. &nbsp; I perceived that a new normal (post-lockdown) would be straight back to doing the same.&nbsp; My hope was for a&nbsp; “better normal” where I got to change/ pick a new objective.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose I unpack old and new normal with a time lens on both ideas.&nbsp; What am I really (really honestly) doing differently hour by hour, day by day, week by week, month by month and year by year, today compared to the old normal.&nbsp; My new brighter, shinny, hope-filled, better normal looks remarkable like the old when viewed by the lens of time.&nbsp; Meetings, calls, reading, writing, communicating and thinking. Less travel and walking has been replaced with more allocation to the other activities, but I have lost the time I used to throw away, the time to reflect, time to dwell, time to ponder, time to prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Time and its allocation is indicating that the old and the new normals look the same.&nbsp; Where has “My Better Normal Gone?”</p><p>&nbsp;Where has “My Better Normal Gone?”</p><p><br></p><p>If the work to be done is the same, then time is not an appropriate measure of observing change.&nbsp; How about looking at my processes and methods? &nbsp; My methods of work have changed, but not for the better.&nbsp; My old normal heuristics and rules were better as I created more time to walk, travel and, therefore, time to reflect and prepare.&nbsp; I try to allocate more time to different approaches and methods, but “screen-time” appears only to have one determinant - attention (distraction and diversion included)&nbsp;</p><p>So it appears to me that if I want a better normal, I have to change the work to be done (a nod to Clayton Christensen).&nbsp; There has been one change in the work to be done, which has been detrimental from my perspective; I have been forced, like everyone, to exchanged time with family and friends for either time alone or jobs.</p><p>So as the anniversary passes and I reflect on a second lockdown birthday, have I spent enough time changing the work to be done? Probably not, but I now plan to.</p> <br>

<p>It’s no secret we need a better web. The original vision of an open and decentralized network that’s universally accessible continues to be a north star for those working to design the future of digital infrastructure for everyday people. Despite the progress that has been made in democratising access to massive amounts of information, the dire state of cybersecurity and privacy on the internet today present significant barriers to access for too many of our most vulnerable populations. We started MATTR because we believe that standards, transparency, and openness are not only better for users; they make for stronger systems and more resilient networks. We recognize that a decentralized web of digital trust, based on transparency, consent, and verifiable data, can help us address critical challenges on a global scale. It represents a significant opportunity to give people real agency and control over their digital&nbsp;lives.</p> Our story <p>At its inception, we chose “MATTR” as a moniker because we strongly believed that the movement towards more decentralized systems will fundamentally change the nature of data and privacy on the internet. Matter, in its varying states, forms the building blocks of the universe, symbolically representing the capacity for change and transformation that allows us all to grow and adapt. In another sense, people matter, and the impact of decisions we make as builders of technology extend beyond ourselves. It’s a responsibility we take seriously, as Tim Berners Lee puts it, “to preserve new frontiers for the common good.” We proudly bear the name MATTR and the potential it represents as we’ve built out our little universe of products.</p><p>In September 2020, we <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">introduced</a> our decentralized identity platform. Our goal was to deliver standards-based digital trust to developers in a scalable manner. We designed our platform with a modular security architecture to enable our tools to work across many different contexts. By investing deeply in open standards and open source communities as well as developing insights through collaboration and research, we realized that developers want to use something that’s convenient without compromising on flexibility, choice, or security. That’s why we launched our platform with standards-based cryptography and configurable building blocks to suit a broad array of use cases and user experiences in a way that can evolve as technology matures.</p><p>At the same time, we’ve continued to work in open source and open standards communities with greater commitment than ever to make sure we’re helping to build a digital ecosystem that can support global scale. We launched <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/resources/">MATTR Resources</a> as hubs for those interested in these new technologies, developing educational content to explore concepts around decentralized identity, offering guided developer tutorials and videos, and providing documentation and API references. We also unveiled a <a href="https://mattr.global/">new website</a>, introduced a novel approach to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure of verifiable credentials</a>, built and defined a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">new secure messaging standard</a>, developed a prototype for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXvWxFjHvdY">paper-based credentials</a> to cater for low-tech environments, and made a bridge to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">extend OpenID Connect with verifiable credentials</a>. We’ve consistently released tools and added features to make our products more secure, extensible, and easy to use. In parallel, we also <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/10/09/news-release-dhs-st-svip-makes-new-phase-1-awards-five-blockchain-companies">joined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s SVIP program</a> in October to help advance the goals of decentralized identity and demonstrate provable interoperability with other vendors in a transparent and globally-visible manner. Zooming out a bit, our journey at MATTR is part of a much larger picture of passionate people working in collaborative networks across the world to make this&nbsp;happen.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>It has been an incredible year for decentralized and self-sovereign identity as a whole. In light of the global-scale disruption of COVID-19, the demand for more secure digital systems became even more critical to our everyday lives. Start-ups, corporations, governments, and standards organizations alike have been heavily investing in building technology and infrastructure to support an increasingly digital world. We’re seeing this innovation happen across the globe, from the work being done by the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program</a> to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">New Zealand Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>. Many global leaders are stepping up to support and invest in more privacy-preserving digital security, and for good reason. Recent legislation like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have made the role of big tech companies and user data rights increasingly important, providing a clear mandate for a wave of change that promises to strengthen the internet for the public good. This provides an incredible catalyst for all the work happening in areas such as cryptography, decentralized computing and digital governance. Just in the last year, we’ve seen the following advancements:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage WG</a> created at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> to realize an interoperable technology for encrypted and confidential data&nbsp;storage  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> v1.0 specification reached “Candidate Recommendation” stage at the W3C, establishing stability in anticipation of standardization later this&nbsp;year  <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> v1.0 released at DIF, providing a layer-2 blockchain solution for scalable Decentralized Identifiers built on top of ledgers such as Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ethereum  <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging v2.0</a> specification launched at DIF, a new protocol for secure messaging based on Decentralized Identifiers and built on JOSE encryption standards  <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP) became an official working group item at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, advancing the conversation around the role of identity providers on the&nbsp;web  Google’s <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID">WebID project</a> started developing features to allow the browser to mediate interactions between end-users and identity providers in a privacy-preserving way  <p>For more information on how all of these technologies are interconnected, read our latest paper, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the&nbsp;Web</a>.</p><p>In addition, as part of our involvement with the DHS SVIP program, in March of this year we participated in the DHS SVIP Interoperability Plugfest. This event saw 8 different companies, representing both human-centric identity credentials as well as asset-centric supply chain traceability credentials, come together to showcase standards-compliance and genuine cross-vendor and cross-platform interoperability via testing and live demonstrations. The full presentation, including demos and videos from the public showcase day, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MeeP7vDXb9CpSBfjTybYbo8qJfrrbrXCSJa0DklNe2k/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>These are just a handful of the significant accomplishments achieved over the last year. It’s been incredibly inspiring to see so many people working towards a common set of goals for the betterment of the web. As we’ve built our products and developed alongside the broader market, we’ve learned quite a bit about how to solve some of the core business and technical challenges associated with this new digital infrastructure. We’ve also gained a lot of insight from working directly with governments and companies across the globe to demonstrate interoperability and build bridges across different technology ecosystems.</p> Launching MATTR&nbsp;VII <p>We’ve been hard at work making our decentralized identity platform better than ever, and we’re proud to announce that as of today, we’re ready to support solutions that solve real-world problems for your users, in production — and it’s open to everybody.</p><p>That’s why we’re rebranding our platform to MATTR VII. Inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter">seven states of matter</a>, our platform gives builders and developers all the tools they need at their fingertips to create a whole new universe of decentralized products and applications. We provide all the raw technical building blocks to allow you to create exactly what you have in mind. MATTR VII is composable and configurable to fit your needs, whether you’re a well-established business with legacy systems or a start-up looking to build the next best thing in digital privacy. Best of all, MATTR VII is use-case-agnostic, meaning we’ve baked minimal dependencies into our products so you can use them the way that makes the most sense for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Starting today, we’re opening our platform for general availability. Specifically, that means if you’re ready to build a solution to solve a real-world problem for your users, we’re ready to support you. Simply <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">contact us</a> to get the ball rolling and to have your production environment set up. Of course, if you’re not quite ready for that, you can still test drive the platform by signing up for a <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">free trial</a> of MATTR VII to get started right away. It’s an exciting time in the MATTR universe, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We’re continuing to build-out features to operationalize and support production use cases. To this end, in the near future we will be enhancing the sign-up and onboarding experience as well as providing tools to monitor your usage of the platform. Please <a href="https://mattr.global/contact/">reach out</a> to give us feedback on how we can improve our products to support the solutions you’re building.</p><p>We’re excited to be in this new phase of our journey with MATTR VII. It will no doubt be another big year for decentralized identity, bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of bringing cryptography and digital trust to every person on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">Medium</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">Twitter</a> for further&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/launching-mattr-vii-4e11bcb9aaef">Why we’re launching MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Lets talk about that well-worn bit of wisdom: “assume positive intent.” On the
surface it’s excellent advice: practice empathy by mindfully assuming that
people may create issues despite their best intentions. You’ve heard the
parables, from Steven Covey’s <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~v-buenger/658/Steven_Covey.html" title="Steven Covey: Paradigms and the 7 Habits">paradigm shift on the subway</a> to
David Foster Wallace’s <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf" title="Transcription of the 2005 Kenyon Commencement Address - May 21, 2005 — Written and Delivered by David Foster Wallace">latent condemnation</a> of gas-guzzling traffic
and soul-sucking supermarkets. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi has <a href="https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html" title="The best advice I ever got — Indra Nooyi">popularized the
notion</a> to ubiquity in corporate America.</p>
<p>In practice, the assumption of positive intent enables some pretty serious
anti-patterns.</p>
<p>First, focusing on intent downplays impact. Good intentions don’t change the
outcomes of one’s actions: we still must deal with whatever broke. At best, good
intentions enable openness to feedback and growth, but do not erase those
mistakes.</p>
<p>Which leads us to a more fundamental dilemma. In a <a href="https://forge.medium.com/the-problem-with-assuming-positive-intent-ea8385ce961d" title="The Problem With Assuming Positive Intent">piece for Medium</a> last year,
<a href="https://medium.com/@ruth_terry/about">Ruth Terry</a>, quoting the <a href="http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/" title="Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity">Kirwan Institute</a>’s Lena Tenney, summarizes it aptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By downplaying actual impact, assuming positive intent can deprioritize the
experience of already marginalized people.</p>
<p>“All of this focus on intention essentially remarginalizes a person of color
who’s speaking up about racism by telling them that their experience doesn’t
matter because the person didn’t mean it that way,” says Tenney, who helped
create interactive implicit bias learning tools for the Kirwan Institute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarginalization of the vulnerable seriously undermines the convictions
behind “assume positive intent,” not to mention the culture at large. But the
impact transcends racial contexts: it appears wherever people present
uncomfortable issues to people in a dominant position.</p>
<p>Take the workplace. A brave employee publicly calls out a problematic behavior
or practice, often highlighting implicit bias or, at the very least, patterns
that contradict the professed values of the organization. Management nods and
says, “I’m glad you brought that up, but it’s important for us all to assume
positive intent in our interactions with our co-workers.” Then they explain the
context for the actions, or, more likely, list potential mitigating details —
without the diligence of investigation or even consequences. Assume positive
intent, guess at or manufacture explanations, but little more.</p>
<p>This response minimizes the report’s impact to management while simultaneously
de-emphasizing the experience of the worker who voiced it. Such brave folks,
speaking just a little truth to power, may start to doubt themselves or what
they’ve seen. The manager has successfully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting" title="Wikpedia: “Gaslighting”">gaslighted</a> the worker.</p>
<p>Leaders: please don’t do this. The phrase is not “Assume positive intent for me,
but not for thee.” Extend the assumption only to the people reporting
uncomfortable issues. There’s a damn good chance they came to you only by the
assumption of positive intent: if your coworkers thought you had ill-intent,
they would not speak at all.</p>
<p>If you feel inclined to defend behavior or patterns based on presumption of
good intent, avoid that reflex, too. Good intent may be key to transgressors
accepting difficult feedback, but hold them accountable and don’t let
assumptions stand on their own. Impact matters, and so must consequences.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Never use the assumption of good intent to downplay or
dismiss the crucial but uncomfortable or inconvenient feedback brave souls bring
to you.</p>
<p>Assume positive intent in yourself, never assert it in others, and know that,
regardless of intent, problems still must be addressed without making excuses or
devaluing or dismissing the people who have suffered them.</p>

<p>Were it not for the Wayback Machine, a lot of my post-1995 writing would now be gone. Since the advent of online-only publications, getting published has been a lousy way to stay published. When pubs change hands, or die, the works of their writers tend to evaporate.</p>
<p>I’m not a great self-archivist, despite having better-than-average skills for the job. Many but not all of my professional archives are preserved — for now! — on my website. Occasionally, when I reach for a long-forgotten and newly-relevant item, only to find it 404, I’ll dig around and try to resurrect it. The forensic effort can be a big challenge; an even bigger one is avoiding self-blame.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with personal archives. When our family lived in New Delhi in the early 1960s, my dad captured thousands of images. Those <a href="http://jonudell.info/IndiaSlides/">color slides</a>, curated in carousels and projected onto our living room wall in the years following, solidified the memories of what my five-year-old self had directly experienced. When we moved my parents to the facility where they spent their last years, one big box of those slides went missing. I try, not always successfully, to avoid blaming myself for that loss.</p>
<p>When our kids were little we didn’t own a videocassette recorder, which was how you captured home movies in that era. Instead we’d rent a VCR from Blockbuster every 6 months or so and spend the weekend filming. It turned out to be a great strategy. We’d set it on a table or on the floor, turn it on, and just let it run. The kids would forget it was there, and we recorded hours of precious daily life in episodic installments.</p>
<p>Five years ago our son-in-law volunteered the services of a friend of his to digitize those tapes, and brought us the MP4s on a thumb drive. I put copies in various “safe” places. Then we moved a couple of times, and when I reached for the digitized videos, they were gone. As were the original cassettes. This time around, there was no avoiding the self-blame. I beat myself up about it, and was so mortified that I hesitated to ask our daughter and son-in-law if they have safe copies. (Spoiler alert: they do.) Instead I’d periodically dig around in various hard drives, clouds, and boxes, looking for files or thumb drives that had to be there somewhere.</p>
<p>During this period of self-flagellation, I thought constantly about something I heard Roger Angell say about Carlton Fisk. Roger Angell was one of the greatest baseball writers, and Carlton Fisk one of the greatest players. One day I happened to walk into a bookstore in Harvard Square when Angell was giving a talk. In the Q and A, somebody asked: “What’s the most surprising thing you’ve ever heard a player say?”</p>
<p>The player was Carlton Fisk, and the surprise was his answer to the question: “How many time have you seen the video clip of your most famous moment?”</p>
<p>That moment is one of the most-watched sports clips ever: Fisk’s walk-off home run in game 6 of the 1975 World Series. He belts the ball deep to left field, it veers toward foul territory, he dances and waves it fair.</p>
<p>So, how often did Fisk watch that clip? Never.</p>
<p>Why not? He didn’t want to overwrite the original memory.</p>
<p>Of course we are always revising our memories. Photographic evidence arguably prevents us from doing so. Is that good or bad? I honestly don’t know. Maybe both.</p>
<p>For a while, when I thought those home videos were gone for good, I tried to convince myself that it was OK. The original memories live in my mind, I hold them in my heart, nothing can take them away, no recording can improve them.</p>
<p>Although that sort of worked, I was massively relieved when I finally fessed up to my negligence and learned that there are safe copies. For now, I haven’t requested them and don’t need to see them. It’s enough to know that they exist.</p>

<p>After the OAuth 2.0 JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR) specification <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2121">was sent to the RFC Editor</a>, the IESG requested an additional round of IETF feedback.  We’ve published an updated draft addressing the remaining review comments, specifically, SecDir comments from Watson Ladd.  The only normative change made since the 28 was to change the MIME Type from “<code>oauth.authz.req+jwt</code>” to “<code>oauth-authz-req+jwt</code>”, per advice from the designated experts.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this specification takes the JWT Request Object from <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6 of OpenID Connect Core (Passing Request Parameters as JWTs)</a> and makes this functionality available for pure OAuth 2.0 applications – and does so without introducing breaking changes.  This is one of a series of specifications bringing functionality originally developed for OpenID Connect to the OAuth 2.0 ecosystem.  Other such specifications included OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>] and OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>].</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

    This article is about how to ensure Directors gain assurance about “data” that is supporting the recommendations in a Board paper.  <p></p><br><p>I have read, written and presented my fair share of Board and Investment Committee papers over the past 25 years. As Directors, we are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions we take. I can now observe a skills gap regarding “data”, with many board members assuming and trusting the data that forms the basis on which they are asked to approve. There are good processes, methods and procedures for ensuring that any Board papers presented are factual. However, decisions using big-data and their associated analysis tools, including ML and AI, which drives automation, is new and requires different expertise at a higher level of detail.&nbsp; Challenging data is different from finding it hard to question in detail any C-suite on their specific expertise and, more generally, the general counsel, CFO and CTO.&nbsp; The CDO/ CIO axis bridges the value line being both a cost and revenue.&nbsp; With “data” as the business driver, it remains superficially easier to question costs without understanding the consequences on our future decision ability and even harder to unpack unethical revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic “board paper” will likely have the following headings: Introduction, Background, Rationale, Structure/ Operations, Illustrative Financials &amp; Scenarios, Competition, Risks and Legal. Case by case, there are always minor adjustments. Finally, some form of recommendation will invite the board to note key facts and approve the action.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO), to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; A section on Data Attestation will be a declaration that there are traceable evidence and proof of the data and the action of the presenter being a witness to certifying it.&nbsp; Some teams will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix and some will claim it is already inherent in the process. How and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>Such a section could provide a solution until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data correctly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper (already inherent). However, the data expertise and skills at most senior levels are also well below what we need because all the politics, bias and complexity is in the weeds, which is both easy not to know and hide.&nbsp; Board members have to continue to question performance metrics (KPI and BSC) to determine the motivation for any decision, but having to trust “data sets” a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.&nbsp; If nothing else, a “data attestation statement” will set a hurdle for those presenting to prioritise bias, ethics and consequences of data used in their proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Having to trust data sets a different standard to those we have with audit, finance, legal and compliance.</p>  Arguments for and against  <p>Key assumptions</p>  <p>Data is critically important to our future and is foundational for decision making going forward.</p>  <p>Data is more complex today and continues to increase in complexity.</p>  <p>The C-suite and leadership team are experts in their disciplines and has deep expertise in their critical areas, but there is a data skills gap.</p>  <p>There is a recognition at the board that data bias, a lack of audibility, provenance, and data lineage can lead to flawed/bad decision making.</p>  <p>Based on these working assumptions, I do not believe that adding a “Data Attestation” section is a long term fix.&nbsp; Whilst to comply with Section 172 of the Companies Act, it is an absolute requirement to meet the fiduciary duties that we upskill.&nbsp; But data is not like marking, technology, operations, finance or HR - data is new, and the vast majority of boards and senior leadership team have little experience in big data,&nbsp; data analytics or coding.&nbsp; It is a recognition that education and skills development is a better solution, but in the gap between today and skills arriving, we should do something? &nbsp; Critically, I would support introducing a data attestation section with a set date where it falls away.&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential to consider as insurance companies who offer D&amp;O policies are looking at new clauses related to the capability of Directors who make decisions based on data and their ability to know the data was “fit for purpose” for the decision. Insurance companies need to protect their claims business and might feel that the upskilling might take to long.</p><p>Why might this work? Do you get on a plane and ask to pilot it?&nbsp; Do you go to the hospital with the correct google answer or ask a qualified Doctor?&nbsp; We need to form our own view that someone has checked whether the pilot and doctor are qualified.&nbsp; Today, we outsource Audit to a committee because of this same issue; it is complex. But Data is not finance, and data is not an Audit committee issue. Data is a different skill set.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Each Board has to make its own choice. The easiest is to justify to oneself that our existing processes are good enough and we are following “best practices”, compliance thinking. &nbsp; Given the 76 recommendations in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Sir Donald Brydon Review of Audit</a>, assuming that our existing processes are good enough is difficult to justify. If we want to make better decisions with data, we need to make sure we can.&nbsp;</p>  Recommendation  <p>A strong recommendation would be to put in place an “Attestation Clause”, a drop-dead date, a 2-year mandatory data training program aimed at the senior leadership team and Directors/ Board members and a succession plan that priorities data skills for new senior and board (inc NXD) roles.</p>  Proposal  <p>A “data attestation” section intends that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specified any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant, created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <p>The independent auditor should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider; this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body; this is about 3rd party verification and validation. As a company, you build a list of experts and cycle through them regularly. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and an insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important; this does not negate or novate data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Example of a Data Attestation section</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany (PLC) Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in this paper’s presentation. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights, and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest, and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><br><br>

<p>The evolution of identity on the web is happening at a rapid pace, with many different projects and efforts converging around similar ideas with their own interpretations and constraints. It can be difficult to parse through all of these developments while the dust hasn’t completely settled, but looking at these issues holistically, we can see a much bigger pattern emerging. In fact, many of the modern innovations related to identity on the web are actually quite connected and build upon each other in a myriad of complementary ways.</p><p>The rise of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>The core of modern identity is undoubtedly <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), the de-facto standard for user authentication and identity protocol on the internet. It’s a protocol that enables developers building apps and services to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience. Because OIDC is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework, it can also be used as an authorization solution. Its development was significant for many reasons, in part because it came with the realization that identity on the web is fundamental to many different kinds of interactions, and these interactions need simple and powerful security features that are ubiquitous and accessible. Secure digital identity is a problem that doesn’t make sense to solve over and over again in different ways with each new application, but instead needs a standard and efficient mechanism that’s easy to use and works for the majority of&nbsp;people.</p><p>OpenID Connect introduced a convenient and accessible protocol for identity that required less setup and complexity for developers building different kinds of applications and programs. In many ways, protocols like OIDC and <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> piggy-backed on the revolution that was underfoot in the mid 2000’s as developers fled en-mass from web based systems heavily reliant on technologies like XML (and consequently identity systems built upon these technologies like SAML), for simpler systems based on JSON. OpenID built on the success of OAuth and offered a solution that improved upon existing identity and web security technologies which were vulnerable to attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">screen scraping</a>. This shift towards a solution built upon modern web technologies with an emphasis on being easy-to-use created ripe conditions for adoption of these web standards.</p><p>OIDC’s success has categorically sped up both the web and native application development cycle when it comes to requiring the integration of identity, and as a result, users have now grown accustomed to having sign-in options aplenty with all their favorite products and services. It’s not intuitively clear to your average user why they need so many different logins and it’s up to the user to manage which identities they use with which services, but the system works and provides a relatively reliable way to integrate identity on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Success and its unintended consequences</p><p>While OIDC succeeded in simplicity and adoption, what has emerged over time are a number of limitations and challenges that have come as a result of taking these systems to a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>When it comes to the market for consumer identity, there are generally three main actors&nbsp;present:</p>  Identity Providers  Relying Parties  End-Users  <p>The forces in the market that cause their intersection to exist are complex, but can be loosely broken down into the interaction between each pair of&nbsp;actors.</p><p>In order for an End-User to be able to “login” to a website today, the “sweet spot” must exist where each of these sets of requirements are&nbsp;met.</p><p>The negotiation between these three parties usually plays out on the relying party’s login page. It’s this precious real-estate that drives these very distinct market&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Anti-competitive market&nbsp;forces</p><p>In typical deployments of OIDC, in order for a user to be able to “login” to a relying party or service they’re trying to access online, the relying party must be in direct contact with the Identity Provider (IdP). This is what’s come to be known as the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/WebID#the-idp-tracking-problem">IdP tracking problem</a>. It’s the IdP that’s responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties, not the end-users themselves. Over time, these natural forces in OIDC have created an environment that tends to favour the emergence and continued growth of a small number of very large IdPs. These IdPs wield a great deal of power, as they have become a critical dependency and intermediary for many kinds of digital interactions that require identity.</p><p>This environment prevents competition and diversity amongst IdPs in exchange for a convenience-driven technology framework where user data is controlled and managed in a few central locations. The market conditions have made it incredibly difficult for new IdPs to break into the market. For example, when Apple unveiled their “Sign in with Apple” service, they used their position as a proprietary service provider to mandate their inclusion as a third party sign in option for any app or service that was supporting federated login on Apple devices. This effectively guaranteed adoption of their OpenID-based solution, allowing them to easily capture a portion of the precious real-estate that is the login screen of thousands of modern web apps today. This method of capturing the market is indicative of a larger challenge wherein the environment of OIDC has made it difficult for newer and smaller players in the IdP ecosystem to participate with existing vendors on an equal playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>Identity as a secondary concern has primary consequences</p><p>Another key issue in the current landscape is that for nearly all modern IdPs, being an identity provider is often a secondary function to their primary line of business. Though they have come to wear many different hats, many of the key IdPs’ primary business function is offering some service to end-users (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.). Their role as IdPs is something that emerged over time, and with it has surfaced a whole new set of responsibilities whose impact we are only just beginning to grapple&nbsp;with.</p><p>Due to this unequal relationship, developers and businesses who want to integrate identity in their applications are forced to choose those IdPs which contain user data for their target demographics, instead of offering options for IdP selection based on real metrics around responsible and privacy-preserving identity practices for end-users.</p><p>This cycle perpetuates the dominance of a few major IdPs and likewise forces users to keep choosing from the same set of options or risk losing access to all of their online accounts. In addition, many of these IdPs have leveraged their role as central intermediaries to increase surveillance and user behavior tracking, not just across their proprietary services, but across a user’s entire web experience. The net result of this architecture on modern systems is that IdPs have become a locus for centralized data storage and processing.</p><p>The privacy implications associated with the reliance on a central intermediary who can delete, control, or expose user data at any time have proven to be no small matter. New regulations such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> have brought user privacy to the forefront and have spurred lots of public discourse and pressure for companies to manage their data processing policies against more robust standards. The regulatory and business environment that is forming around GDPR and CCPA is pushing the market to consider better solutions that may involve decentralizing the mode of operation or separating the responsibilities of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>Identity Provider&nbsp;lock-in</p><p>Lastly, in today’s landscape there is an inseparable coupling between an End-User and the IdP they use. This effectively means that, in order to transfer from say “Sign In With Google” to “Sign In With Twitter,” a user often has to start over and build their identity from scratch. This is due to the fact that users are effectively borrowing or renting their identities from their IdPs, and hence have little to no control in exercising that identity how they see fit. This model creates a pattern that unnecessarily ties a user to the application and data ecosystem of their IdP and means they must keep an active account with the provider to keep using their identity. If a user can’t access to their account with an IdP, say by losing access to their Twitter profile, they can no longer login to any of the services where they’re using Twitter as their&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>One of the problems with the term Identity Provider itself is that it sets up the assumption that the end-user is being provided with an identity, rather than the identity being theirs or under their control. If end-users have no real choice in selecting their IdP, then they are ultimately subject to the whims of a few very large and powerful companies. This model is not only antithetical to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/technology/congress-big-tech-monopoly-power.html">anti-trust</a> policies and legislation, it also prevents data portability between platforms. It’s made it abundantly clear that the paradigm shift on end-user privacy practices needs to start by giving users a baseline level of choice when it comes to their identity.</p><p>A nod to an alternative model</p><p>Fundamentally, when it comes to identity on the web, users should have choice; choice about which services they employ to facilitate the usage of their digital identities along with being empowered to change these service providers if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>The irony of OpenID Connect is that the original authors did actually consider these problems, and evidence of this can be found in the original OIDC specification: in chapter 7, entitled “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self Issued OpenID Provider</a>” (SIOP).</p><p>Earning its name primarily from the powerful idea that users could somehow be their own identity provider, SIOP was an ambitious attempt at solving a number of different problems at once. It raises some major questions about the future of the protocol, but it stops short of offering an end-to-end solution to these complex problems.</p><p>As it stands in the core specification, the SIOP chapter of OIDC was really trying to solve 3 significant, but distinct problems, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Enabling portable/transferable identities between providers  Dealing with different deployment models for OpenID providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">Nascar&nbsp;Problem</a>  <p>SIOP has recently been of strong interest to those in the decentralized or self-sovereign identity community because it’s been identified as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">potential pathway</a> to transitioning existing deployed digital infrastructure towards a more decentralized and user-centric model. As discussion is ongoing at the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> to evolve and reboot the work around SIOP, there are a number of interesting questions raised by this chapter that are worth exploring to their full extent. For starters, SIOP questions some of the fundamental assumptions around the behaviour and deployment of an&nbsp;IdP.</p><p>OpenID and OAuth typically use a redirect mechanism to relay a request from a relying party to an IdP. OAuth supports redirecting back to a native app for the end-user, but it assumes that the provider itself always takes the form of an HTTP server, and furthermore it assumes the request is primarily handled server-side. SIOP challenged this assumption by questioning whether the identity provider has to be entirely server-side, or if the provider could instead take the form of a Single-Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web Application (PWA), or even a native application. In creating a precedent for improving upon the IdP model, SIOP was asking fundamental questions such as: who gets to pick the provider? What role does the end-user play in this selection process? Does the provider always need to be an authorization server or is there a more decentralized model available that is resilient from certain modes of compromise?</p><p>Although some of these questions remain unanswered or are early in development, the precedent set by SIOP has spurred a number of related developments in and around web identity. Work is ongoing at the OpenID Foundation to flesh out the implications of SIOP in the emerging landscape.</p><p>Tech giants capitalize on the conversation</p><p>Although OIDC is primarily a web-based identity protocol, it was purposefully designed to be independent of any particular browser feature or API. This separation of concerns has proved incredibly useful in enabling adoption of OIDC outside of web-only environments, but it has greatly limited the ability for browser vendors to facilitate and mediate web-based login events. A number of large technology and browser vendors have picked up on this discrepancy, and are starting to take ownership of the role they play in web-based user interactions.</p><p>Notably, a number of new initiatives have been introduced in the last few years to address this gap in user privacy on the web. An example of this can be found in the <a href="https://tag.w3.org/">W3C Technical Architecture Group</a> (TAG), a group tasked with documenting and building consensus around the architecture of the World Wide Web. Ahead of the 2019 <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/09/TPAC/">W3C TPAC</a> in Japan, Apple proposed an initiative called <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2019Sep/0004.html">IsLoggedIn</a>, effectively a way for websites to tell the browser whether the user was logged in or not in a trustworthy way. What they realized is that the behavior of modern web architecture results in users being “logged in by default” to websites they visit, even if they only visit a website once. Essentially as soon as the browser loads a webpage, that page can store data about the user indefinitely on the device, with no clear mechanism for indicating when a user has logged out or wishes to stop sharing their data. They introduced an API that would allow browsers to set the status of user log-ins to limit long term storage of user data. It was a vision that required broad consensus among today’s major web browsers to be successful. Ultimately, the browsers have taken their own approach in trying to mitigate the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>In 2019, Google created their <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">Privacy Sandbox</a> initiative to advance user privacy on the web using open and transparent standards. As one of the largest web browsers on the planet, Google Chrome seized the opportunity provided by an increased public focus on user privacy to work on limiting cross-site user tracking and pervasive incentives that encourage surveillance. Fuelled by the Privacy Sandbox initiative, they created a project called <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> to explore how the browser can mediate between different parties in a digital identity transaction. WebID is an early attempt to get in the middle of the interaction that happens between a relying party and an IdP, allowing the browser to facilitate the transaction in a way that provides stronger privacy guarantees for the end-user.</p><p>As an overarching effort, it’s in many ways a response to the environment created by CCPA and GDPR where technology vendors like Google are attempting to enforce privacy expectations for end-users while surfing the web. Its goal is to keep protocols like OIDC largely intact while using the browser as a mediator to provide a stronger set of guarantees when it comes to user identities. This may ultimately give end-users more privacy on the web, but it doesn’t exactly solve the problem of users being locked into their IdPs. With the persistent problem of data portability and limited user choices, simply allowing the browser to mediate the interaction is an important piece of the puzzle but does not go far enough on its&nbsp;own.</p><p>Going beyond the current state of OpenID&nbsp;Connect</p><p>Though it is a critical component of modern web identity, OIDC is not by any means the only solution or protocol to attempt to solve these kinds of problems.</p><p>A set of emerging standards from the W3C Credentials Community Group aim to look at identity on the web in a very different way, and, in fact, are designed to consider use cases outside of just consumer identity. One such standard is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) which defines a new type of identifier and accompanying data model featuring several novel properties not present in most mainstream identifier schemes in use today. Using DIDs in tandem with technologies like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) creates an infrastructure for a more distributed and decentralized layer for identity on the web, enabling a greater level of user control. VCs were created as the newest in a long line of cryptographically secured data representation formats. Their goal was to provide a standard that improves on its predecessors by accommodating formal data semantics through technologies like JSON-LD and addressing the role of data subjects in managing and controlling data about themselves.</p><p>These standards have emerged in large part to address the limitations of federated identity systems such as the one provided by OIDC. In the case of DIDs, the focus has been on creating a more resilient kind of user-controllable identifier. These kinds of identifiers don’t have to be borrowed or rented from an IdP as is the case today, but can instead be directly controlled by the entities they represent via cryptography in a consistent and standard way. When combining these two technologies, VCs and DIDs, we enable verifiable information that has a cryptographic binding to the end-user and can be transferred cross-context while retaining its security and semantics.</p><p>As is the case with many emerging technologies, in order to be successful in an existing and complicated market, these new standards should have a cohesive relationship to the present. To that end, there has been a significant push to bridge these emerging technologies with the existing world of OIDC in a way that doesn’t break existing implementations and encourages interoperability.</p><p>One prominent example of this is a new extension to OIDC known as <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>. Current OIDC flows result in the user receiving an identity token which is coupled to the IdP that created it, and can be used to prove the user’s identity within a specific domain. OIDC Credential Provider allows you to extend OIDC to allow IdPs to issue reusable VCs about the end-user instead of simple identity tokens with limited functionality. It allows end-users to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital wallet</a> under their control. By allowing data authorities to be the provider of reusable digital credentials instead of simple identity assertions, this extension effectively turns traditional Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p><p>The credentials provided under this system are cryptographically bound to a public key controlled by the end-user. In addition to public key binding, the credential can instead be bound to a DID, adding a layer of indirection between a user’s identity and the keys they use to control it. In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when the subject’s keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user. The innovations upon OIDC mark a shift from a model where relying parties request claims from an IdP, to one where they can request claims from specific issuers or according to certain <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/trust-frameworks">trust frameworks</a> and evaluation metrics appropriate to their use case. This kind of policy-level data management creates a much more predictable and secure way for businesses and people to get the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>OIDC Credential Provider, a new spec at the OpenID Foundation, is challenging the notion that the identity that a user receives has to be an identity entirely bound to its domain. It offers traditional IdPs a way to issue credentials that are portable and can cross domains because the identity/identifier is no longer coupled to the provider as is the case with an identity token. <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">This work</a> serves to further bridge the gap between existing digital identity infrastructure and emerging technologies which are more decentralized and user-centric. It sets the foundation for a deeper shift in how data is managed online, whether it comes in the form of identity claims, authorizations, or other kinds of <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/verifiable-data">verifiable data</a>.</p><p>Broadening the landscape of digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>OIDC, which is primarily used for identity, is built upon OAuth 2.0, whose primary use is authorization and access. If OIDC is about who the End-User is, then OAuth 2.0 is about what you’re allowed to do on behalf of and at the consent of the End-User. OAuth 2.0 was built prior to OIDC, in many ways because authorization allowed people to accomplish quite a bit without the capabilities of a formalized and standardized identity protocol. Eventually, it became obvious that identity is an integral and relatively well-defined cornerstone of web access that needed a simple solution. OIDC emerged as it increasingly became a requirement to know who the end-user (or resource owner) is and for the client to be able to request access to basic claims about them. Together, OIDC and OAuth2.0 create a protocol that combines authentication and authorization. While this allows them to work natively with one another, it’s not always helpful from an infrastructure standpoint to collapse these different functions together.</p><p>Efforts like WebID are currently trending towards the reseparation of these concepts that have become married in the current world of OpenID, by developing browser APIs that are specifically geared towards identity. However, without a solution to authorization, it could be argued that many of the goals of the project will remain unsatisfied whenever the relying party requires both authentication and authorization in a given interaction.</p><p>As it turns out, these problems are all closely related to each other and require a broad and coordinated approach. As we step into an increasingly digital era where the expectation continues to evolve around what’s possible to do online, the role of identity becomes increasingly complex. Take, for example, sectors such as the financial industry dealing with increased requirements around electronic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) policies. In parallel with the innovation around web identity and the adoption of emerging technologies such as VCs, there has been a growing realization that the evolution of digital identity enables many opportunities that extend far beyond the domain of identity. This is where the power of verifiable data on the web really begins, and with it an expanded scope and structure for how to build digital infrastructure that can support a whole new class of applications.</p><p>A new proposed browser API called <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI) offers a promising solution to browser-mediated interactions that complements the identity-centric technologies of OIDC and WebID. It currently takes the form of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfill</a> to allow these capabilities to be used in the browser today. Similar to how SIOP proposes for the user to be able pick their provider for identity-related credentials, CHAPI allows you to pick your provider, but not just for identity — for any kind of credential. In that sense, OIDC and CHAPI are solving slightly different problems:</p>  OIDC is primarily about requesting authentication of an End-User and receiving some limited identity claims about them, and in certain circumstances also accessing protected resources on their&nbsp;behalf.  CHAPI is about requesting credentials that may describe the End-user or may not. Additionally, credentials might not even be related to their identity directly and instead used for other related functions like granting authorization, access,&nbsp;etc.  <p>While OIDC offers a simple protocol based upon URL redirects, CHAPI pushes for a world of deeper integration with the browser that affords several useability benefits. Unlike traditional implementations of OIDC, CHAPI does not start with the assumption that an identity is fixed to the provider. Instead, the end-user gets to register their preferred providers in the browser and then select from this list when an interaction with their provider is required. Since CHAPI allows for exchanging credentials that may or may not be related to the end-user, it allows for a much broader set of interactions than what’s provided by today’s identity protocols. In theory, these can work together rather than as alternative options. You could, for instance, treat CHAPI browser APIs as a client to contact the end-user’s OpenID Provider and then use CHAPI to exchange and present additional credentials that may be under the end-user’s control.</p><p>CHAPI is very oriented towards the “credential” abstraction, which is essentially a fixed set of claims protected in a cryptographic envelope and often intended to be long lived. A useful insight from the development of OIDC is that it may be helpful to separate, at least logically, the presentation of identity-related information from the presentation of other kinds of information. To extend this idea, authenticating or presenting a credential is different from authenticating that you’re the subject of a credential. You may choose to do these things in succession, but they are not inherently related.</p><p>The reason this is important has to do with privacy, data hygiene, and best security practices. In order to allow users to both exercise their identity on the web and manage all of their credentials in one place, we should be creating systems that default to requesting specific information about an end-user as needed, not necessarily requesting credentials when what’s needed is an authentic identity and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Adopting this kind of policy would allow configurations where the identifier for the credential subject would not be assumed to be the identifier used to identify the subject with the relying party. Using this capability in combination with approaches to <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a> like <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">VCs with JSON-LD BBS+ signatures</a> will ensure not only a coherent system that can separate identity and access, but also one that respects user privacy and provides a bridge between existing identity management infrastructure and emerging technologies.</p><p>An emergent user experience</p><p>Using these technologies in tandem also helps to bridge the divide between native and web applications when it comes to managing identity across different modalities. Although the two often get conflated, a digital wallet for holding user credentials is not necessarily an application. It’s a service to help users manage their credentials, both identity-related and otherwise, and should be accessible wherever an end-user needs to access it. In truth, native apps and web apps are each good at different things and come with their own unique set of trade-offs and implementation challenges. Looking at this emerging paradigm where identity is managed in a coherent way across different types of digital infrastructure, “web wallets” and “native wallets” are not necessarily mutually exclusive — emerging technologies can leverage redirects to allow the use of&nbsp;both.</p><p>The revolution around digital identity offers a new paradigm that places users in a position of greater control around their digital interactions, giving them the tools to exercise agency over their identity and their data online. Modern legislation focused on privacy, portability, security and accessible user experience is also creating an impetus for the consolidation of legacy practices. The opportunity is to leverage this directional shift to create a network effect across the digital ecosystem, making it easier for relying parties to build secure web experiences and unlocking entirely new value opportunities for claims providers and data authorities.</p><p>Users shouldn’t have to manage the complexity left behind by today’s outdated identity systems, and they shouldn’t be collateral damage when it comes to designing convenient apps and services. Without careful coordination, much of the newer innovation could lead to even more fragmentation in the digital landscape. However, as we can see here, many of these technology efforts and standards are solving similar or complementary problems.</p><p>Ultimately, a successful reinvention of identity on the web should make privacy and security easy; easy for end-users to understand, easy for relying parties to support, and easy for providers to implement. That means building bridges across technologies to support not only today’s internet users, but enabling access to an entirely new set of stakeholders across the globe who will finally have a seat at the table, such as those without access to the internet or readily available web infrastructure. As these technologies develop, we should continue to push for consolidation and simplicity to strike the elusive balance between security and convenience across the ecosystem for everyday&nbsp;users.</p><p>Where to from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Solving the challenges necessary to realize the future state of identity on the web will take a collective effort of vendor collaboration, standards contributions, practical implementations and education. In order to create adoption of this technology at scale, we should consider the following as concrete next steps we can all take to bring this vision to&nbsp;life:</p><p>Continue to drive development of bridging technologies that integrate well with existing identity solutions and provide a path to decentralized and portable&nbsp;identity</p>  E.g. formalization of OIDC Credential Provider to extend existing&nbsp;IdPs  <p>Empower users to exercise autonomy and sovereignty in selecting their service provider, as well as the ability to change providers and manage services over&nbsp;time</p>  E.g. selection mechanisms introduced by SIOP and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Adopt a holistic approach to building solutions that recognizes the role of browser-mediated interactions in preserving user&nbsp;privacy</p>  E.g. newer browser developments such as CHAPI and&nbsp;WebID  <p>Build solutions that make as few assumptions as necessary in order to support different types of deployment environments that show up in real-world use&nbsp;cases</p>  E.g. evolution of SIOP as well as supporting web and native&nbsp;wallets  <p>Ensure that the development of decentralized digital identity supports the variety and diversity of data that may be managed by users in the future, whether that data be identity-related or otherwise</p><p>Taking these steps will help to ensure that the identity technologies we build to support the digital infrastructure of tomorrow will avoid perpetuating the inequalities and accessibility barriers we face today. By doing our part to collaborate and contribute to solutions that work for everybody, building bridges rather than building siloes, we can create a paradigm shift that has longevity and resilience far into the future. We hope you join&nbsp;us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/the-state-of-identity-on-the-web-cffc392bc7ea">The State of Identity on the Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Reading a collection of John McPhee stories, I found several that were new to me. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/06/28/duty-of-care">The Duty of Care</a>, published in the New Yorker in 1993, is about tires, and how we do or don’t properly recycle them. One form of reuse we’ve mostly abandoned is retreads. McPhee writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>A retread is in no way inferior to a new tire, but new tires are affordable, and the retreaded passenger tire has descended to the status of a clip-on tie.</p></blockquote>
<p>My dad wore clip-on ties. He also used retreaded tires, and I can remember visiting a shop on several occasions to have the procedure done.</p>
<p>Recently I asked a friend: “Whatever happened to retreaded tires?” We weren’t sure, but figured they’d gone away for good reasons: safety, reliability. But maybe not. <a href="https://www.tirerecappers.com/how-does-retread-work/">TireRecappers</a> and <a href="https://www.treadwright.com/pages/retread-moldcure-manufacturing">TreadWright</a> don’t buy those arguments. Maybe retreads were always a viable option for our passenger fleet, as they still are for our truck fleet. And maybe, with better tech, they’re better than they used to be.</p>
<p>In Duty of Care, McPhee tells the story of the Modesto pile. It was, at the time, the world’s largest pile of scrap tires containing, by his estimate, 34 million tires.</p>
<blockquote><p>You don’t have to stare long at that pile before the thought occurs to you that those tires were once driven upon by the Friends of the Earth. They are Environmental Defense Fund tires, Rainforest Action Network tires, Wilderness Society tires. They are California Natural Resources Federation tires, Save San Francisco Bay Association tires, Citizens for a Better Environment tires. They are Greenpeace tires, Sierra Club tires, Earth Island Institute tires. They are Earth First! tires!</p></blockquote>
<p>(I love a good John McPhee list.)</p>
<p>The world’s largest pile of tires left a surprisingly small online footprint, but you can find the LA Times’ <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-11-30-mn-16908-story.html">Massive Pile of Tires Fuels Controversial Energy Plan</a> which describes the power plant — 41 million dollars, 14 megawatts, “the first of its kind in the United States and the largest in the world” — that McPhee visited when researching his story. I found it on Google Maps by following McPhee’s directions.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were abandon your car three miles from the San Joaquin County line and make your way on foot southwest one mile…</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the power plant. There’s no evidence of tires, or trucks moving them, so maybe the plant, having consumed the pile, is retired. Fortunately it never caught fire, that would’ve made a hell of a mess.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire_recycling">Wikipedia</a>, we’ve reduced our inventory of stockpiled tires by an order of magnitude from a peak of a billion around the time McPhee wrote that article. We burn most of them for energy, and turn some into ground rubber for such uses as paving and flooring. So that’s progress. But I can’t help but wonder about the tire equivalent of Amory Lovins’ <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-efficiency/whats-a-negawatt">negawatt</a>: “A watt of energy that you have not used through energy conservation or the use of energy-efficient products.”</p>
<p>Could retreaded passenger tires be an important source of negawatts? Do we reject the idea just because they’re as unfashionable as clip-on ties? I’m no expert on the subject, obviously, but I suspect these things might be true.</p>

<p>みなさん、フランスの２０世紀の作曲家、ダマーズの「フルート、オーボエ、クラリネットとピアノのための四重奏」をご存知でしょうか？いかにもフランスという洒脱な曲です。リンクを貼ったのは二楽章ですが、ダマーズはこれに限らず第二楽章に楽しいものがおおいです。</p>



<p>ダマーズはコルトーの弟子で、フォーレのノクチュルヌとバルカローレの全曲録音を最初にした人でもあります。</p>



<p>新古典主義の作曲だったので20世紀にはあまり評価されていませんでしたが、最近評価が上がってきて録音も手に入るようになってきています。いかにもフランス的。プーランクが好きだったらダマーズも好きだと思います。</p>

<p>On March 9, The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* hosted presentations from Xavier Vila, Product Manager for Validated ID and Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Director of Astrea on eIDAS and Self Sovereign Identity.  The presentations covered the technical, legal and business dimensions of bridging between eIDAS and SSI concepts and increasing the value and usability of digital identity in the European model.</p><p>A key component of the Digital Europe architecture is the existence of a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure.  This journey was started in 2014 with the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.  As has been discussed in previous Vienna Digital Identity Meetups, a high assurance digital identity is the key piece connecting the physical and digital worlds, and this piece was not included in the initial creation of our digital world.</p><p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success?  There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU.  Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready.  Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.  All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p><p>Validated ID has been developing a eIDAS - ESSIF bridge bringing the eIDAS trust seals to Verifiable Credentials.  As a  Qualified Trust Service Provider under the eIDAS, Validated ID has been offering trust services to customers across Europe since 2012.  Xavier presented this current work and provides a detailed explanation on how the eIDAS-SSI bridge applies the qualified electronic seals to Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Dr. Alamillo further clarified the importance of the eIDAS-SSI Bridge in his presentation on SSI in the eIDAS Regulation.  When a Qualified Electronic Seal is applied to a Verifiable Credential the combined document becomes a legal document with cross border legal value within the EU.  Currently in an identity context, eIDAS is the European wide identity meta system, providing the framework for the 27 nation states of the EU to operate as a very large federated identity network.  However, the point was raised the in the current ongoing revision of the eIDAS regulation, it is possible that handling of electronic identification may be changed from a ‘connecting of services’ to a new trust service.</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/522501200">https://vimeo.com/522501200</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:04:00 - Xavier Vila, Validated ID </p>  <p>0:34:00 - Questions </p>  <p>0:42:00 - Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Astrea </p>  <p>1:18:00 - Questions </p>  <p>1:28:00 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events  </p>  <p>Resources</p><p>SSI - eIDAS Bridge GitHub Repo - <a href="https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/">https://github.com/validatedid/ssi-eidas-bridge/</a></p><p>Xavier Vila’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/210308-Vienna-Identity-Meetup-SSI-eIDAS-Bridge.pdf">Vale-SSI-EIDAS Bridge.pdf<br>Nach</a>o Alamillo’s Presentation Deck: <a href="https://www.thedinglegroup.com/s/Vienna-digital-identity-event-eIDAS-Alamillo.pdf">Alamillo-SSI-EIDAS.pdf</a></p><p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance.

<p>For 20 bucks or less, nowadays, you can buy an extra-wide convex mirror that clips onto your car’s existing rear-view mirror. We just tried one for the first time, and I’m pretty sure it’s a keeper. These gadgets claim to eliminate blind spots, and this one absolutely does. Driving down 101, I counted three seconds as a car passed through my driver’s-side blind spot. That’s a long time when you’re going 70 miles per hour; during that whole time I could see that passing car in the extended mirror.</p>
<p>Precious few gadgets spark joy for me. This one had me at hello. Not having to turn your head, avoiding the risk of not turning your head — these are huge benefits, quite possibly life-savers. For 20 bucks!</p>
<p>It got even better. As darkness fell, we wondered how it would handle approaching headlights. It’s not adjustable like the stock mirror, but that turns out not to be a problem. The mirror dims those headlights so they’re easy to look at. The same lights in the side mirrors are blinding by comparison.</p>
<p>I’ve been driving more than 40 years. This expanded view could have been made available at any point along the way. There’s nothing electronic or digital. It’s just a better idea that combines existing ingredients in a new way. That pretty much sums up my own approach to product development.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the metaphor. Seeing around corners is a superpower I’ve always wanted. I used to love taking photos with the fisheye lens on my dad’s 35mm Exacta, now I love making panoramic views with my phone. I hate being blindsided, on the road and in life, by things I can’t see coming. I hate narrow-mindedness, and always reach for a wider view.</p>
<p>I’ll never overcome all my blind spots but it’s nice to chip away at them. After today, there will be several fewer to contend with.</p>

<p>The column republished below, originally at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html</a>, was the vector that connected me to my dear friend Gardner Campbell. I’m resurrecting it here partly just to bring it back online, but mainly to celebrate the ways in which Gardner — a film scholar among many other things — is, right now, bringing his film expertise to the practice of online teaching. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3106">this post</a> he reflects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the learning spaces I’ve been in provide very poorly, if at all, for the supposed magic of being co-located. A state-mandated prison-spec windowless classroom has less character than a well-lighted Zoom conference. A lectern with a touch-pad control for a projector-and-screen combo is much less flexible and, I’d argue, conveys much less human connection and warmth than I can when I share a screen on Zoom during a synchronous class, or see my students there, not in front of a white sheet of reflective material, but in the medium with me, lighting up the chat, sharing links, sharing the simple camaraderie of a hearty “good morning” as class begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3096">this one</a> he shares the <a href="https://youtu.be/82Gu4BKagpI">course trailer</a> (!) for Fiction into film: a study of adaptations of “Little Women”.</p>
<p>My 2005 column was a riff on a New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/movies/is-a-cinema-studies-degree-the-new-mba.html">Is Cinema Studies the new MBA</a>? It was perhaps a stretch, in 2005, to argue for cinema studies as an integral part of the new freshman comp. The argument makes a lot more sense now.</p>
 
 The New Freshman Comp 
<p>For many years I have alternately worn two professional hats: writer and programmer. Lately I find myself wearing a third hat: filmmaker. When I began making the films that I now call screencasts, my readers and I both sensed that this medium was different enough to justify the new name that we collaboratively gave it. Here’s how I define the difference. Film is a genre of storytelling that addresses the whole spectrum of human experience. Screencasting is a subgenre of film that can tell stories about the limited — but rapidly growing — slice of our lives that is mediated by software.</p>
<p>Telling stories about software in this audiovisual way is something I believe technical people will increasingly want to do. To explain why, let’s first discuss a more ancient storytelling mode: writing.</p>
<p>The typical reader of this column is probably, like me, a writer of both prose and code. Odds are you identify yourself as a coder more than as a writer. But you may also recently have begun blogging, in which case you’ve seen your writing muscles grow stronger with exercise.</p>
<p>Effective writing and effective coding are more closely related than you might think. Once upon a time I spent a year as a graduate student and teaching assistant at an Ivy League university. My program of study was science writing, but that was a tiny subspecialty within a larger MFA (master of fine arts) program dedicated to creative writing. That’s what they asked me to teach, and the notion terrified me. I had no idea what I’d say to a roomful of aspiring poets and novelists. As it turned out, though, many of these kids were in fact aspiring doctors, scientists, and engineers who needed humanities credits. So I decided to teach basic expository writing. The university’s view was that these kids had done enough of that in high school. Mine was that they hadn’t, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>I began by challenging their reverence for published work. Passages from books and newspapers became object lessons in editing, a task few of my students had ever been asked to perform in a serious way. They were surprised by the notion that you could improve material that had been professionally written and edited, then sold in bookstores or on newsstands. Who were they to mess with the work of the pros?</p>
<p>I, in turn, was surprised to find this reverent attitude even among the budding software engineers. They took it for granted that programs were imperfect texts, always subject to improvement. But they didn’t see prose in the same way. They didn’t equate refactoring a program with editing a piece of writing, as I did then and still do.</p>
<p>When I taught this class more than twenty years ago the term “refactoring” wasn’t commonly applied to software. Yet that’s precisely how I think about the iterative refinement of prose and of code. In both realms, we adjust vocabulary to achieve consistency of tone, and we transform structure to achieve economy of expression.</p>
<p>I encouraged my students to regard writing and editing as activities governed by engineering principles not unlike the ones that govern coding and refactoring. Yes, writing is a creative act. So is coding. But in both cases the creative impulse is expressed in orderly, calculated, even mechanical ways. This seemed to be a useful analogy. For technically-inclined students earning required humanities credits, it made the subject seem more relevant and at the same time more approachable.</p>
<p>In the pre-Internet era, none of us foresaw the explosive growth of the Internet as a textual medium. If you’d asked me then why a programmer ought to be able to write effectively, I’d have pointed mainly to specs and manuals. I didn’t see that software development was already becoming a global collaboration, that email and newsgroups were its lifeblood, and that the ability to articulate and persuade in the medium of text could be as crucial as the ability to design and build in the medium of code.</p>
<p>Nowadays, of course, software developers have embraced new tools of articulation and persuasion: blogs, wikis. I’m often amazed not only by the amount of writing that goes on in these forms, but also by its quality. Writing muscles do strengthen with exercise, and the game of collaborative software development gives them a great workout.</p>
<p>Not everyone drinks equally from this fountain of prose, though. Developers tend to write a great deal for other developers, but much less for those who use their software. Laziness is a factor; hubris even more so. We like to imagine that our software speaks for itself. And in some ways that’s true. Documentation is often only a crutch. If you have to explain how to use your software, you’ve failed.</p>
<p>It may, however, be obvious how to use a piece of software, and yet not at all obvious why to use it. I’ll give you two examples: Wikipedia and del.icio.us. Anyone who approaches either of these applications will immediately grasp their basic modes of use. That’s the easy part. The hard part is understanding what they’re about, and why they matter.</p>
<p>A social application works within an environment that it simultaneously helps to create. If you understand that environment, the application makes sense. Otherwise it can seem weird and pointless.</p>
<p>Paul Kedrosky, an investor, academic, and columnist, alluded to this problem on his blog last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Funny conversation I had with someone yesterday: We agreed that the thing that generally made us both persevere and keep trying any new service online, even if we didn’t get it the first umpteen times, was having Jon Udell post that said service was useful. After all, if Jon liked it then it had to be that we just hadn’t tried hard enough. [<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001115.html">Infectious Greed</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I immodestly quote Paul’s remarks in order to revise and extend them. I agree that the rate-limiting factor for software adoption is increasingly not purchase, or installation, or training, but simply “getting it.” And while I may have a good track record for “getting it,” plenty of other people do too — the creators of new applications, obviously, as well as the early adopters. What’s unusual about me is the degree to which I am trained, inclined, and paid to communicate in ways that help others to “get it.”</p>
<p>We haven’t always seen the role of the writer and the role of the developer as deeply connected but, as the context for understanding software shifts from computers and networks to people and groups, I think we’ll find that they are. When an important application’s purpose is unclear on the first umpteen approaches, and when “getting it” requires hard work, you can’t fix the problem with a user-interface overhaul or a better manual. There needs to be an ongoing conversation about what the code does and, just as importantly, why. Professional communicators (like me) can help move things along, but everyone needs to participate, and everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer struggling to evangelize an idea, I’d start by reiterating that your coding instincts can also help you become a better writer. Until recently, that’s where I’d have ended this essay too. But recent events have shown me that writing alone, powerful though it can be, won’t necessarily suffice.</p>
<p>I’ve written often — and, I like to think, cogently — about wikis and tagging. But my screencasts about Wikipedia and del.icio.us have had a profoundly greater impact than anything I’ve written on these topics. People “get it” when they watch these movies in ways that they otherwise don’t.</p>
<p>It’s undoubtedly true that an audiovisual narrative enters many 21st-century minds more easily, and makes a more lasting impression on those minds, than does a written narrative. But it’s also true that the interactive experience of software is fundamentally cinematic in nature. Because an application plays out as a sequence of frames on a timeline, a narrated screencast may be the best possible way to represent it and analyze it.</p>
<p>If you buy either or both of these explanations, what then? Would I really suggest that techies will become fluid storytellers not only in the medium of the written essay, but also in the medium of the narrated screencast? Actually, yes, I would, and I’m starting to find people who want to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>A few months ago I heard from Michael Tiller, who describes himself as a “mechanical engineer trapped in a computer scientist’s body.” Michael has had a long and passionate interest in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modelica.com/">Modelica</a>, an open, object-oriented language for modeling mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, and control systems. He wanted to work with me to develop a screencast on this topic. But it’s far from my domains of expertise and, in the end, all he really needed was my encouragement. This week, Michael launched a website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/">Dynopsis.com</a>&nbsp;that’s chartered to explore the intersection of engineering and information technologies. Featured prominently on the site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=modelica_screencast">this 20-minute screencast</a>&nbsp;in which he illustrates the use of Modelica in the context of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynasim.se/">Dymola</a>&nbsp;IDE.</p>
<p>This screencast was made with Windows Media Encoder 9, and without the help of any editing. After a couple of takes, Michael came up with a great overview of the Modelica language, the Dymola tool, and the modeling and simulation techniques that they embody. Since he is also author of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0792373677">book</a>&nbsp;on this subject, I asked Michael to reflect on these different narrative modes, and here’s how he responded on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were interested in teaching someone just the textual aspects of the Modelica language,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-0719698-6919906">this is exactly the approach I would take</a>.<br>
…<br>
But when trying to teach or explain a medium that is visual, other tools can be much more effective. Screencasts are one technology that could really make an impact on the way some subjects are taught and I can see how these ideas could be extended much further. [<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=node/19">Dynopsis: Learning by example: screencasts</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re just scratching the surface of this medium. Its educational power is immediately obvious, and over time its persuasive power will come into focus too. The New York Times recently asked: “Is cinema studies the new MBA?” I’ll go further and suggest that these methods ought to be part of the new freshman comp. Writing and editing will remain the foundation skills they always were, but we’ll increasingly combine them with speech and video. The tools and techniques are new to many of us. But the underlying principles — consistency of tone, clarity of structure, economy of expression, iterative refinement — will be familiar to programmers and writers alike.</p>

<p>We’ve been here 6 years, and the magical Sonoma County landscape just keeps growing on me. I’ve written about the spectacular coastline, a national treasure just twenty miles to our west that’s pristine thanks to the efforts of a handful of environmental activists, notably <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/07/21/walking-the-kortum-trail/">Bill Kortum</a>. Even closer, just ten miles to our east, lies the also spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains">Mayacamas range</a> where today I again hiked Bald Mountain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Ridge_State_Park">Sugarloaf Ridge State Park</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever visit this region and fancy a hike with great views, this is the one. (Ping me and I’ll go with you at the drop of a hat.) It’s not too challenging. The nearby Goodspeed Trail, leading up to Gunsight Notch on Hood Mountain, is more demanding, and in the end, less rewarding. Don’t get me wrong, the view from Gunsight — looking west over the Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa plain — is delightful. But the view from the top of Bald Mountain is something else again. On a clear day (which is most of them) you can spin a slow 360 and take in the Napa Valley towns of St. Helena and Calistoga to the west, Cobb and St. Helena mountains to the north, the Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa plain to the east, then turn south to see Petaluma, Mt. Tamalpais, the top of the Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco, the San Pablo Bay, the tops of the tallest buildings in Oakland, and Mt. Diablo 51 miles away. Finally, to complete the loop, turn east again to look at the Sierra Nevada range 130 miles away.</p>
    
<p>The rugged topography you can see in that video occurs fractally everywhere around here. It’s taken a while to sink in, but I think I can finally explain what’s so fascinating about this landscape. It’s the sightlines. From almost anywhere, you’re looking at a 3D puzzle. I’m a relative newcomer, but I hike with friends who’ve lived their whole lives here, and from any given place, they are as likely as I am to struggle to identify some remote landmark. Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.</p>
<p>We’ve lived in flat places, we’ve lived in hilly places, but never until now in such a profoundly three-dimensional landscape. It is a blessing I will never take for granted.</p>

<p>An idea has been maturing in my thoughts for a while now. Or rather I have been thinking about a series of ideas, programming projects I would love to actualise, which I recently realised share a common thread. Memory and how we access it. Probably not surprising for software developers, pretty much any application we can imagine requires some form of data store. Although rarely, in my experience, do we talk about this data in terms of memory.</p>
<p>My more recent work researching identity, privacy and trust in digital interactions has evolved and broadened my perspective on the importance of memory. Our identity, whatever we conceive that to be, must be understood to exist in close relation to memory. Or the mathematician in me wants to say as a function of memory I ~ F(m) <a>1</a>. And as Herbert Simon details in the Science of the Artificial, memory is a key property of any intelligent system <a>2</a>.  The ability to take information from the past and apply it when navigating the present moment is a powerful skill in the Homo Sapien toolbox, both as individuals and a species.</p>
<p>These patterns of thought on memory percolating in my mind have further been influenced through my engagement with blockchain/distributed ledger both as a concept and through the practical application of it in application development. I especially find the ideas coming out of the Ethereum community transformative to the possibilities for digital application design. Persistent Compute Objects (PICOs) <a>3</a> are a more recent idea and open source project I have been following that appears to support novel interaction patterns.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey to this point, what follows in a sketch of the evolution of my thoughts on memory told through the lens of three ideas and the questions these ideas sparked in me. Then I intend to reflect on where my thoughts are at now, because it is only now reflecting on these ideas that I see the common thread - human memory. </p>
<p>The ideas that influenced my thinking and help illustrate my thoughts are; Viewing Time, The Community Mind and Nifty Books. Each originates at a different point in my life but all were ideas for programming side projects I could use to cut my teeth on a new technology, language or library. Each idea has a special place in my own memory, and it is from these memories that the thoughts I am sharing emerged.</p>
 Viewing Time 
<p>My first idea, back before I knew how to program. The inspirational carrot I used to motivate myself to learn. Not that I ever wrote more than a few lines of code on this. It originates from a time in Maastricht visiting a friend, we were sitting looking at a beautiful view and I thought: </p>
 What if we could create a timelapse of a view from a specific location? A View of Time. 
<p>I think I tried to get my friend to go back their every day to take a photo to do just this. Not the ideal solution, my thinking has evolved since then. Here are some of the questions I thought about:</p>
 
 
<p>What if we could crowd source the collection of the photos for a view, enabling anyone with a camera to contribute?</p>
 
 How would view’s of time be discovered, found, contributed to and viewed? 
 
<p>How would you prevent “bad” view from being added. Inappropriate, non valued, etc?</p>
 
 Who decides what a “bad” view is? 
 Authorisation problem 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Where would views be stored?</p>
 
 Who stores them? 
 Who has control over them? 
 Who manages that control? 
 
 
 Who would host and pay for this application and why? 
 
<p>How might Viewing Time change our relationship with our environment and help us reflect on the change happening all around us?</p>
 
 Chasing Ice, a documentary I watched on another visit to the Netherlands, emphasised how powerful this could be. <a href="https://earthvisioninstitute.org/share-this/columbia-glacier-alaska/">Here is an example</a>. 
 Watching a Chinese cityscape evolve over these last 20 years would have provided another staggering view of time and change. 
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/21/timelapse-satellite-images-china-fastest-growing-cities">Here are some examples of this using satellite imagery</a> 
 How might Viewing Time help communities record and interact with shared memories? 
 I was recently involved with planting a Community Orchard and became aware how valuable creating a view as a shared artifact could be. It might help communities celebrate and appreciate the positive changes they bring about. 
 
 
 How might date, time or season be used to present different time-lapses of the same view? 
 
<p>How would we prevent overtourism?</p>
 
 I never wanted to turn view’s into used and abused tourist spaces, an acknowledged tension. 
 Explicitly want to avoid insta tourism type effects. How?  
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trs-isdu4eE">This is a funny add from the Kiwi’s recently keeping me mindful of this</a> 
 What are the incentives? 
 How do we ensure this is an artifact all can enjoy while minimising the unintended consequences associated with the change in context-relative informational norms? 
 How might this be used to create incentives for positive, respectful tourism? 
 Realised in part this is about how views are discovered. 
 This got me closer to the importance of location. 
 
 
 
<p>What if you could only discover view’s if you were in it’s location?</p>
 
 How might this help to prevent bad content? 
 How would you even prove you were in a certain location? 
 Who/what would you prove it to? 
 
 
 
<p>What is the context and associated informational norms with a View?</p>
 
 Who defines and evolves these norms? 
 What are the rules? 
 
 
 How might location be used as a strong authenticator?<a>4</a> 
 
<p>These are all pointers, sketching the outlines of thought that I have been evolving over the 5 or so years since first appeared in my mind. </p>
<p>It is an idea that I never made any meaningful, tangible progress on. Except for a few positive conversations with friends it has remained wishful thinking. It is in my humble opinion, a beauty of an idea, something that I would love to see happen. I am optimistic, the technology and mental model for application design is shifting in ways that open up an entirely new design space for these kinds of ideas. Something other than the for profit venture capitalist endeavours that have lead to the colonisation and privatisation of much of our virtual spaces. A for-profit venture could never be the best realisation of this idea.</p>
 The Community Mind 
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is my baby. My first <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/sideproject">side project</a>. It is how I learnt React and felt the power of GraphQl. The first website and server I ever deployed - a challenging experience but one I <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-from-deploying-my-first-full-stack-web-application-34f94ec0a286/">learnt from</a>.  It is was also my first encounter with authentication and account management, what a nightmare that was.</p>
<p>After completing a year in industry this was the next programming project I worked on. I committed a lot of my time to this work. Including spending a month straight on it while dipping my toes into the digital nomad lifestyle in Chiang Mai, where I was exposed to and became fascinated with blockchain, Bitcoin and all that crazy stuff. An influential period of my life really. </p>
<p>Anyway, the idea revolves around creating a place for us to organise our questions. A space for questions to be shared and thought about, but not a place to collect answers. In my mind it was explicitly not for answers. Rather it would provide triggers to thought’s within individuals as they pondered these questions from the their own unique perspective shaped by their lived experience. I am a strong believe that we all have the ability to imagine creative ideas and possibilities, the hard part of course is actioning those ideas. As in many ways this text demonstrates.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this idea came from the book <a href="https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/">A More Beautiful Question</a>. I wanted to try to develop something that would make it easier to ask and discover beautiful questions. A place where these questions could be crowd sourced, recorded and connected.  I wanted to provide an interface for individuals to explore a web of interconnected questions being thought by others. I wanted people to be able to contribute their own questions and thought pathways to this network. Each individual interacting with and contributing to the community mind.</p>
<p>The questions that surfaced when thinking through the design requirements of such a project were something along these lines:</p>
 
 
<p>How will I manage questioners?</p>
 
 I was still thinking in a user account paradigm in these days.  
 Who gets to ask questions? 
 Who gets to see the questions asked? 
 
 
 
<p>How will questioners search and discover the questions they are interested in?</p>
 
 What if questions could be linked to other questions? 
 Who can link questions to other questions? Which links do people see and how do they decide? 
 What if these links grew in strength the more they were traversed and endorsed like neural pathways in our own minds? 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent duplicate questions?</p>
 
 Am I trying to create a single global repository of questions?  
 
<p>Or would it be better to allow each individual to manage their web of questions independently?</p>
 
 How might you enable the best of both? 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent bad data? Questions that don’t align with the ethos of the mind?</p>
 
 Whose mind? Who decides? 
 How might questions be optimally curated? 
 What is optimal and who is curating? 
 
 
 Where would this information be stored?  
 
<p>What is the business model for such an application?</p>
 
 What are the incentives? 
 
 
 
<p>When initially developing this project I had in mind a database for storing questions and their links, which people would interact with. Searching and filtering to discover the questions they were interested in. Contributing their own questions and connections to this storage. All managed by some centralised application, providing a single view and interface for people to interact with. Today, I have a model of individual’s being able to maintain their own mind, curating the questions and connections that find useful to them. Then providing a mechanism to network and aggregate the minds of others into a larger web of questions for all to explore. Imagine a mind like a GitHub repository, the entity that creates it would be able to manage the rules governing how questions and links are contributed. I even considered private minds as a potential business model. Although my desire was and remains today to develop an open source tool for recording, curating and discovering beautiful questions. I see them as a loose scaffold around thought, hinting at the problem space without prescribing the solution. A common entry point to creativity, that any individual from any background at any moment in time would be able to interact with. Using their own unique perspective to draw new insights and inspire different solutions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fond memories developing this idea, including a weekend in Porto visiting a friend where I discovered the joy and value of committing thoughts to paper. Creating a physical artifact to interact with. Something that in my view can never fully be replicated in a digital medium, but what if you could have both?</p>

    </p>
<p>Towards the end of my <a href="https://github.com/wip-abramson/TheCommunityMind">active development</a> of this idea I attempted to integrate a token, Simple Token, as part of a challenge they held. My idea at the time was to use this as some form of incentive mechanism for the application, although the actual execution was a bit clumsy looking back. You can view my submission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMABXKGoiAk&amp;t=1s">here</a>. Then there is this old <a href="https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/5">Github issue</a> from a month long hackathon called Blockternship. </p>
<p>While development is dormant, I am still very committed to making this a thing. One day!</p>
 Nifty Books 
<p>This is another lovely idea, in my book at least. Originating from my desire to learn how to write smart contracts using solidity, the Ethereum programming language. The idea stemmed from thinking through how we might digitally represent books the books we own, creating a distributed library and opening access to a wealth of books. Moving them off our shelves and into peoples hands, helping the wisdom held within them diffuse into more peoples minds and become recorded in their memories. Book’s can provide an intoxicating fountain of knowledge or a refreshing escape from reality. I appreciate both aspects equally and would love more to experience their joy. </p>
<p>For a bit of history of this idea you can see <a href="https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/23">my proposal</a> for the ETH Berlin hackathon around this. I proposed creating an application that allowed anyone to mint an <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC721 Non-Fungible Token</a> to represent their physical book. Unfortunately, I ended up forming a different team and haven’t made much progress on realising this idea. I remain a sketchy solidity developer at best. That said, progress has been made. The concept is more mature in my mind, and the ethereum development landscape has come a long way since 2018. As my recent experience at the virtual <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETH Denver</a> highlighted, while I didn’t manage to submit anything or even write much code I did get a sense for how far things have come. The <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> repo seems like a great place to start, if I ever do manage to carve out time to create this.</p>
<p>I am convinced, and regularly reminded, how this idea could unlock so much hidden value. Book’s deserve to be read more than once, indeed there is something beautiful about a book having been read by many different people. Throughout the course of my studies in Edinburgh I have developed a fairly extensive personal collection of some truly fascinating books. I would love to have a means to share them with others in the area also interested in this material. And yes I am sure there exist ways for me to do this if I really tried, but I believe giving a book a memory has more implications that simply making it easily shareable.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that this idea has raised over the years as I wondered about how it might be developed:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we digitally represent a physical book?</p>
 
 How would you link the physical book with it’s digital representation? 
 Would a QR Code work here? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we represent ownership?</p>
 
 What affordances should owners of books have? 
 What affordances should borrower’s have? 
 
 
 
<p>How would books within the virtual library be discovered, requested and returned?</p>
 
 How might you pay for postage of book between participants? 
 
<p>What if the model was to create primarily a local virtual library, but with exchanges between localities when requested?</p>
 
 Libraries have existed like this for ages. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How might the digital representation of a book be used to embed it with a memory?</p>
 
 What information would the book want to store in it’s memory? 
 How might we represent the list of borrowers without compromising their privacy? 
 
<p>What if the book had an interface to the Community Mind allowing readers to ask and share questions that the material provoked in them?</p>
 
 How might being in possession of a book, either as a lender or borrower provide a mechanism for access control into other applications? E.g. the Community Mind. 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way individuals interact with eBook’s today? 
 How might this approach help us appreciate this medium more deeply? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we deter bad actors abusing the virtual library?</p>
 
 What is the incentive model? 
 Who decides? 
 What is to stop malicious actors creating virtual book’s unattached to physical copies?  
 What prevents people from stealing book’s they have borrowed? 
 
 
 Who stores the information around virtual books?  
 
<p>How are the search and discovery capabilities for these books mediated? </p>
 
 Who is mediating this? 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way book’s are shared and exchanged by travellers? 
 
<p>What if the things we bought came with a configurable and extendable digital memory?</p>
 
 How might this both simplify and expand the field of interaction enabled and perceived by those in proximity to the device? 
 
 
 
<p>As usual, a whole load of questions. Always there are questions. I present them here to provoke your own thought and inquiry around these ideas.</p>
 The Common Thread 
<p>Now, these ideas are not directly or intentionally linked. They are connected through me, and through my desire to produce ideas for software applications I would be motivated to create. Most developers you meet will have a few of these kicking around if you ask them. Over time all ideas evolve, dots connect and new insight emerges. The three ideas I presented trace the evolution of me, as much as anything else, from a computer science undergraduate to hopefully a final year PhD student. </p>
<p>It is only recently, from the new perspectives my research has provided me that I can reflect on all these ideas and clearly see a common thread in my thinking. In keeping with the article will summarise in a series of questions:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we use technology to experiment with the ways in which we can attach memory to the artifacts we place meaning in?</p>
 
 How might we design this memory to be open and extendable supporting permission-less innovation at the edges? 
 
 
 
<p>How might artifacts use this memory to intelligently interact with it’s environment and the people interacting with it?</p>
 
 How might such artifacts be designed to respect the privacy of those it interacts with while ensuring they are held accountable within a defined context? 
 
 
 
<p>What if we started to centralise information on artifacts, using our physical interaction with these artifacts to provide an alternative to the search engine for the discovery of information?</p>
 
 How might centralising information on the artifact, be that a location, object or thought transform the way  design digital systems and our ability to actively maintain collective memory at all scales of society? 
 
 
 How might context-relative informational norms for managing this memory be defined, communicated, upheld and evolved? 
 How might such artifacts change the way we identify and authenticate digitally? 
 
<p>How might this change the nature of the virtual spaces we interact in?</p>
 
 How might this provide natural limits to the participants within these spaces? 
 How might this create virtual neighbours and encourage trustworthy behaviour and positive relationships? 
 
 
 
<p>What are the descriptive and normative properties for structuring memory?</p>
 
 What are the properties of collective memory that we experience in the majority of virtual environments we exist in today and how do they differ from the ways we have managed memory in the physical reality across time and context? 
 
 
 
<p>It is an exploration of the structure of memory, how we might augment this structure with intention using digital technology and the implications of this on meaning making within both individuals and groups. To date this exploration has predominantly involved a few powerful entities constructing, owning and manipulating the digital structures of memory to meet their own agenda’s <a>5</a>. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that while working on this idea I created artifacts, both physical and digital, they hold meaning to me but are no longer only accessible too me. By committing thoughts to paper, code or words, they become remembered at least partially in a different kind of memory. Indeed this text itself is one of these artifacts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but it’s long already and I wrote this for fun more than anything. A break from the rigidity of academic writing that can be suffocating at times. A more detailed, formal analysis of these ideas is for another time. </p>
<p>Thanks for making it this far. These thoughts are pretty fresh, I would love to know what they triggered in you. </p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This is something my thoughts wander across on occasion. I am always drawn the ideas in quantum field theory where particles exist in a field of potential, it is only upon measurement that the field collapses. Feels like there is something interesting in having a similar mental model for identity.</p>

<p>Persistent Compute Objects, a fascinating but little known project originating from Phil Windely some time ago I believe. It is currently being actively developed at Brigham Young university.

<p>One idea that stuck with me from this is location based authentication. This is one of the reasons I was so interested by the <a href="https://foam.space/location">FOAM project</a>, although it seems a long way from reaching it’s potential at the moment. Alternative, censorship resistant location services feels like something that would unlock a lot of value.</p>

     <p></p><br><p>I have written and read my fair share of board and investment papers over the past 25 years.&nbsp; This post is not to add to the abundance of excellent work on how to write a better board/ investment paper or what the best structure is - it would annoy you and waste my time.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic “board paper” will likely have the following headings: Introduction, Background, Rationale, Structure/ Operations, Illustrative Financials &amp; Scenarios, Competition, Risks and Legal. Case by case there are always minor adjustments. Finally, there will be some form of Recommendation inviting the board to note key facts and approve the request.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO) to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called &nbsp; “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; Some will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix; how and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>The intention of this new heading and section is that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert, that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specifies any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <br><p>In regards to the independent auditor, this should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider, this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body, this is about third party verification and validation. A company you build a list of experts and cycle through them on a regular basis. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and a large insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important, this does not remove data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Data Attestation</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany PLC Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in the presentation of this paper. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why do this?</p><p>Whilst Directors are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions they take, right now there is a gap in skills in data and many board members don’t know how to test the data that forms the basis on which they are being asked to approve. This is all new and a level of detail that requires deep expertise.&nbsp; This provides an additional line until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data properly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper, however, the data expertise and skills in the majority of senior levels are also well below what we need.&nbsp; If nothing else it will get those presenting to think carefully about data, bias and the ethics of their proposal.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg</a> Why developer-first IAM&nbsp;? And why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters? <p>In my previous blog, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>, I discussed why the enterprises will demand for developer-first IAM. As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/">announcement</a> came yesterday on Okta’s intention to acquire Auth0 for $6.5B, which is probably 40 times the Auth0’s current revenue, is a true validation of the push towards developer-first IAM. However, this is not Okta’s first effort towards developer-first IAM. In 2017, Okta acquired Stormpath, a company that built tools to help developers to integrate login with their apps. Stormpath soon got absorbed into the Okta platform, but yet, Okta’s selling strategy didn’t change. It was always top-down.</p><p>In contrast to Okta, Auth0 follows a bottom-up sales strategy. One of the analysts I spoke to couple of years back told that the Auth0 name comes in an inquiry call only when a developer joins in. The acquisition of Auth0 will give Okta, the access to a broader market. So, it is important for Okta to let Auth0 run as an independent business, as also mentioned in the acquisition announcement.</p><p>Auth0 is not just about the product; but also the developer tooling, content and the developer community around it. Okta will surely benefit from this ecosystem around Auth0. Also, for years, Azure is the primary competitor of Okta, and Auth0 acquisition will make Okta stronger against Azure in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Late 2020, in one of the the earnings calls, the Okta announced that it sees the total market for its workplace identity management software as $30 billion, but it sees another, additional market for customer identity software at $25 billion. In the customer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven customer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements. The developer-first IAM is more critical in building a CIAM solution than in workforce IAM. In the latest Forrester <a href="https://wso2.com/resources/analyst-reports/the-forrester-wave-customer-identity-and-access-management-q4-2020/">report</a> on CIAM, Auth0 is way ahead of Okta, in terms of the current product offering. Okta will probably use Auth0 to increase their presence in the CIAM domain. Like Microsoft has Azure AD to focus on workforce IAM and Azure B2C to focus on CIAM, Auth0 could be Okta’s offering for&nbsp;CIAM.</p>Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020<p>When Auth0 was founded in 2013, it picked a less-saturated (even right to say fresh), future-driven market segment in IAM — developer-first. Developer-first is all about the experience. Auth0 did extremely well there. They were worried about building the right level of developer experience, rather than the feature set. Even today, Auth0 stands against others not because of their feature set, but the experience they build for developers.</p><p>The developer-first experience is not only about the product. How you build product features in a developer-first manner, probably contribute 50% of the total effort. The rest is about developer tooling, SDKs, and the content. Then again, the content is not just about the product. The larger portion of the content needs to be on how to integrate the product with a larger ecosystem — and also to teach developers the basic constructs, concepts and best practices in IAM. That helps to win the developer trust!</p>How the Auth0 website looked like in July,&nbsp;2014<p>Auth0’s vision towards developer-first IAM evolved over the past. The way the Auth0 website itself evolved in terms of the messaging and the presentation, reflects how much they want to be on the enterprisy side more today than in the past. As they claim Auth0 has 9000+ enterprise customers, which probably generate $150M annual revenue, the average sales value (ASV) would be around $16500. That probably means, the majority of Auth0 customers are in free/developer/developer pro tiers. So, it’s understandable why they want to bring in enterprise look and messaging, probably moving forward to focus more on top-down driven sales strategy. The big Contact Sales button over the Signup button on the Auth0 website today, sums up this direction to some extent.The Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 could probably strengthen this&nbsp;move.</p>How the Auth0 website looks like today (March,&nbsp;2021)<p>Like Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B in 2018, Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 for $6.5B is a win for developers! Congratulations to both Auth0 and Okta and very much looking forward to see the journey of Auth0 together with&nbsp;Okta.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/why-developer-first-iam-and-why-oktas-auth0-acquisition-matters-9fff3dde81">Why developer-first IAM and why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

I have always searched for the relationships between trust and strategy, value, consent, privacy, identity, data and risk. &nbsp; The well-reasoned articles include <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/imaging-a-digital-strategy-starting-from-trust-3b4b2d8bc92f">Imaging a Digital Strategy starting from TRUST</a>, <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/trust-is-not-a-destination-16c8120ff377">Trust is not a destination!</a>, <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/how-can-brands-restore-user-trust-752dd533daa8">How can Brands restore user trust?</a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2013/06/segmentation-model-based-on-data.html">A segmentation model based on trust</a>, <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2010/12/creating-virtuous-circle.html">The relationship between Trust, Risk and Privacy</a>.&nbsp; This article brings together some of the thinking already explored in previous articles but as the new drawing below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It started as I was playing with Laplace to Fourier and back.&nbsp; These are the transformations between time and frequency.&nbsp; Whilst time and frequency are related, to move between the domains in maths requires some fancy work.&nbsp; On either side of the status is TIME and FREQUENCY, and between them are “transformations.”&nbsp; A bit like our digital transformations, there is the before and the after. &nbsp; This somehow got me thinking about trust. The before state and the after state, with the transformation being “trust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The before status is untrusted or less trusted, and because of specific actions, the end state will either be more trusting, eventually leading to being trusted (a final state) or less trusted, eventually leading back to untrusted.&nbsp; “Trust” itself never exists - it happens to be the word we use as the transition or transformation of state.&nbsp; However, as we socially don’t want to talk about the existing state of trust, I have in you or what status of trust I have after the activities/ actions we use the word “trust” to hide, confuse and remain unclear, perhaps we don’t know ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do you trust me? This is not a very good question; what do you trust me for would be far better, but that is often too raw, so we prefer the former.</p> Does this framing of trust help? <p>We might adopt it within the team to allow us to define the starting and endpoints and the journey, avoiding the word naked word “trust.”&nbsp; We also need to recognise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis</a>, which creates different paths between becoming more trustworthy and either losing trust (time and inaction) or the destruction of trust by action.&nbsp; I would expect everyone has a different hysteresis, and it will vary by age, experience, value, relationships, chemistry and time.&nbsp; We are all on the journey, but we also need to determine who is on the journey with us and if we want to walk at the pace of the slowest or leave a few behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps there is a good reason we find it hard to define trust?</p> <br>

   <p>There are more elephants in the room than you imagined!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When we unpack climate and ESG, it is too big, so we don’t know what to do.&nbsp; However, this post unpacks the “too big” so that we can individually identify the one thing we can all do that will make a difference.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>The 1st elephant in the room</p><p>Never teach an elephant to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the elephant.</p><p>This elephant represents the big issues: politics, geopolitics, policy, human behaviours, policing, crime, cyber-attacks, climate change, poverty, tax, ESG, economics, capitalism, growth, sustainability, vaccines, circular economy, transparency and equality as examples.&nbsp; They are all so big and complex that we cannot get our heads around them.&nbsp; No one person owns the problem.&nbsp; We ignore those who go on about them often by putting them into the category of philosophies as I don’t understand or know what I can do, believing that my individual actions will make no difference.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>The 2nd elephant in the room</p><p>The blind people are asked about their understanding of an elephant but are limited to one part.&nbsp; If you cannot see the whole picture but use a different sense to try and make sense of the elephant, you will likely miss something. How do you know your view is limited?&nbsp; The message is that if you cannot imagine or see the whole elephant but are limited or framed, it means you only get the outcome you expected.&nbsp; Our limits in experience, diversity, understanding bias, behaviour, path dependency, data structure means we are all blind but think we can see.</p><br><p>The 3rd elephant in the room</p><p>How do you eat an elephant? One small chunk at a time</p><p>It is too big to swallow whole, so cut up the big problem into smaller chunks.&nbsp; What is the problem I have to solve today?&nbsp; What is the work to be done?</p><p>It is easy to focus on and has items everyone can identify with, but someone must know it is an elephant to know the priorities and what tasks matter.</p><br><p>The 4th elephant in the room</p><p>When the client asks if you can do it cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Where priorities, budgets and the economics of short-termism override long term purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>Enough said.&nbsp;</p> <br>  <br> <br><br><br><p>Observation</p><p>What can I do that makes a difference?&nbsp; Knowing that the elephant in the room is more significant than anyone can understand (ESG, Climate, policy, behaviours, economics, geopolitics, humanity).&nbsp; I have to accept that I cannot have a complete HD picture of how everything connects but must accept that I am blind, but I can sense a small part and owe a duty to connect and share. Together we will work out the first chuck we need to eat, knowing that we cannot eat it all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What can I do that makes a difference?&nbsp;</p><br><p>ESG and Climate</p><p>We cannot individually do anything about it as it is too big, and my actions are too small. Some leaders do have a clear picture, but how can we break-up the big into smaller steps.&nbsp; Whilst I hope we can debate about the steps’ priorities, there is one action that each of us can take.</p><p>The problem that is too big</p><p>The majority of our agreed economic understanding rests in several supply/ demand models; how we have implemented the controls of the models varies across the globe, including market forces, regulation, government (state control) and stewardship codes.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a three-axis plot, where the axes are Values/ Principles, Accountability/ Obligations and Health of Eco-systems, we create an inner blue box in Figure 1 representing today’s overall economic market and controls.&nbsp; The values and principles tend to focus on self, accountability tends towards an elected authority (self-appointed, director or elected in a democracy) and the health of the ecosystem is focussed on only the one that you interact with (prime) but usually to ensure your health and not everyone’s. There are many exceptions to this model.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand from the <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business RoundTable 2019</a> report that companies in western capital markets are encouraged to think broader and include values that benefit society and all dependent ecosystems.&nbsp; The orange box in figure 1.</p><p>ESG thinking pushes all the boundaries further such that our values/ principles create a sustainable earth, society becomes accountable for its actions, and all ecosystems become healthy (this solves the boundary problem with circular economy thinking where you cannot ignore your actions have an effect on everyone else). This is the larger green box in figure 1</p><p>One elephant in the room is the requirement to move our economic model in three dimensions simultaneously.&nbsp; Walking forward is naturally comfortable (one dimension). Running uphill is harder (two dimensions). Going forward, upwards and outwards by defying gravity for man is challenging; however, this is the big picture elephant of ESG.&nbsp; Change everything at the same time.</p><br><br><p></p><p>Figure 1: The Big ESG problem</p><p>Should we move one direction at a time to make this more digestible?</p><p>There is a debate I believe we need to have in which direction we should focus as a priority?&nbsp; Figure 2 offers a suggestion. How do we move from where we are to where we want to be, in phases and not trying to do everything at once.&nbsp; However, whilst digestible, it might be too slow. We need to agree on a map, but who should own this?</p><p></p><p>Figure 2, where do we go first?</p><br><p>Where are we on the journey right now?</p><p>We are making progress for Directors to move from ShareHolder Primacy mandates to report on ESG Compliance Codes and more informed fiduciary duties. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-quality-and-effectiveness-of-audit-independent-review">Audit (finance) is a mess and is not reliable</a>, and it is not a solution for ESG. We are making progress with capital and investment markets with the addition of stewardship codes, forcing directors to comply as the investment basis they need starts to demand change. Thank you, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">Blackrock </a>and <a href="https://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/insight/equities/a-clear-perspective-on-esg-investing/">Hermes</a>.&nbsp; We are at the early stages of ESG and using public data to make informed investment decisions. However, I believe public data ESG assessment a significant problem as it introduces <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk. </a>ESG public data has three fundamental issues as the boundaries we are dependent on have become less clear.</p><p>1. The quality of the data and implied knowledge we receive from our direct and dependent* eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>2. The quality of the knowledge we receive from our indirect and interdependent** eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>3. Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (assumption first boundary is direct and already in control in our risk model) - the reuse of the same “data” in several justifications.&nbsp;</p><p>* Dependent: balancing being able to get what I want by my own effort as contingent on or determined by the actions of someone else to make it work&nbsp;</p><p>** Interdependence combine my efforts with the efforts of others to achieve successful outcomes together but does not have to be mutual or controlled</p><br><p>Therefore I believe we need to look at a much deeper level of data sharing to achieve sustainability, and the first step is an ESG API for data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>How can we make this happen together?</p><p>Investment industry - move your power to follow and support those who implement a Data API for ESG data the quickest. Let’s get data with attestation to make better decisions.</p><p>Companies and Charities - collect the data and make it available publicly and not via a highly scripted and edited document.&nbsp; Drive out multiple uses of the same data and greenwashing</p><p>Academic/ Standards/ Global bodies - create a top-level ontology for this data set’s data sharing.&nbsp; Ensure that it is creative commons, owned by everyone to benefit everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Government - do your part and lead in collecting and publishing the government’s data - show the way.</p><p>Regulators - lobby to gain the power to strike off and fine Directors who are part of the creation of false data or are not fast enough to react</p><p>Media/ Journalism/&nbsp; - check the data/ analysis/ insights and don’t promote your click model negative headlines over purpose, knowing that the regulators will have the power on the particular issue of data to remove you.&nbsp; Be the body that brings about change and not the one the looks to score wins at society’s expense.</p><p>Researchers/ Consulting - Find ways to help and support the transformation, not by shaming or by creating best practice but by highlighting where we need to focus so we don’t leave anyone behind. Let’s not celebrate successes until we all find a sustainable place. We cannot run faster than our weakest partner.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals - we make change possible because somewhere in here, we have a role, and next is what we can all do.&nbsp; Personally commit to enabling that the data, with rights and attestation, can be collected in everything done.&nbsp; This will ensure I can make my choices based on data that has provenance and lineage.&nbsp;</p><br> Together, with data, we can achieve the sustainable goals we want. <br><br><br>

The reality of leadership and management is that it is a complex adaptive system, and context enables your nature to emerge and nurturing to mature.&nbsp; This is important because we also know there is a link between strategy, styles (leadership) and business structures.&nbsp; In this article, we will unpack how your “nature or nurture” thinking-structure, affects outcomes.&nbsp; Your thinking-structure is also a complex adaptive system as your peers and customers thinking, your companies “culture of structure” thinking affect you. BUT have you considered how your data structure and your data philosophy will have a direct and significant impact on outcomes?&nbsp; <br><p>I’ve known that my neurodiversity package (severe dyslexia, mild high functioning autism, ADHD) informs how I interrupt the world as my “biological cortex” and gut-brain axis structures process sensory data and memory uniquely. I cannot modify my mind or brain’s basic structure any more than I could change my fingerprint, core DNA or the colour of my eyes; however, I can play with my microbiome. It’s an essential part of what makes me, me. My chemical and biological structures enable me to make sense of the world in my way.&nbsp; Communication (language, words, music, song, dance, art, sound, movement, gesture) enables us to share the sense we create from patterns and align with others who approximate the same (tribe).&nbsp; How we actually make sense (learn) is intensely debated, with one camp believing that language is our sense maker, assuming that we might observe patterns but cannot understand it without language? Other than that, we make sense and then create a language to communicate the insight we have gained.&nbsp; Irrespective, language allows us to both structure and navigate our space and share the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is how we structure or frame something nature or nurture? <p>Why does this question matter? We all read, speak and write differently, we all understand differently, but we use questions to clarify understanding, check meaning and create common interruption.&nbsp; How we individually structure meaning is determined from the perspective we have been given (nature), from what we have been taught (nurture) and what we align to (bias).&nbsp; Our structure is an ontology*. Imagine putting one person from each of our worlds religions or faith groups into a room, but assume no-one can speak the same language.&nbsp; How and what would they agree or disagree about as there is no common structure (ontology)</p><p>* An ontology is “the set of things whose existence is acknowledged by a particular theory or system of thought.”&nbsp; (The Oxford Companion to Philosophy)&nbsp;</p><p>By way of example, the word “Evil” creates meaning for you as soon as you read it. Without a doubt, the nature of evil is a complex and nuanced area too often glossed over in a rush to present or evaluate the defences and theodicies. Let’s unpack the word using the super book “<a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/making-evil/dr-julia-shaw/9781786891327">Making Evil</a>” by <a href="https://www.drjuliashaw.com/">Dr Julia Shaw</a>. &nbsp; Evil is an unavoidable part of life that we all encounter as we all suffer in one sense or another, but what makes something evil is a matter of framing/ structure/ ontology. “Natural evil” is the pain and suffering that arises from the natural world’s functioning or malfunctioning. “Moral evil” is the pain and suffering that results from conscious human action or inaction. It is evil where a person or people are to blame for the suffering that occurs; a crucial point is the blameworthiness of the person at fault. Moral evil, at its heart, results from the free choice of a moral agent. If we just look at the consequences, it is not always possible to tell whether moral evil has taken place or not; we have many mitigations. Therefore a level of moral evil can be found in the degree of intention and consequence.&nbsp; However, if we compare death rates for natural evil (suffering) and moral evil at an extreme people killing people, the latter is a rounding error in the form of suffering in the world. The point is that by framing something, I can create a structure for understanding. Critically our structures frame our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Critically our structures frame our understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Structures are ontologies which are philosphies.&nbsp; <p>To explore that our structures frame our understanding, what ontology makes us human? When we look at the different view below, we can view humans in many different ways. Note: I have deliberately ignored the classical all living things ontology structure (insects, birds, fish, mammal, reptiles, plant).&nbsp; The point is that your framing or how you structure something at the start leads to a guided conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Our framing or how we structure something at the start leads to a guided conclusion.</p><p>Pick a different structure, and you get a different answer; the ontology creates a natural conclusion.&nbsp; It is likely that if you pick a philosophy/ ontology/ structure, you can only get what that framing will shine a light on or enable.</p><p>It is likely that if you pick a philosphies/ ontology/ structure, you can only get what that structure will shine a light on or enable.</p><p></p> This matters because all data has structure! <p>I explore continually the future of the digital business, which are underpinned by data, privacy, consent and identity.&nbsp; <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-data-90ba0b803178">Data is Data (it is not oil or sunshine</a>).&nbsp; <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">What is The Purpose of your Data</a>? <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">Quantum (Data) Risk</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/executive-leadership-briefing-is-the-data-presented-to-you-enabling-a-real-choice-5a973c69c9ba">Does data create a choice?</a> <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/is-kpis-innovations-nemesis-cdc320a30c67">Data and KPI’s</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/wisdom-is-nothing-more-than-new-data-wisdom-is-definitely-not-a-pinnacle-9d4e172f1918">Wisdom is just more data</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/when-complex-multi-dimensional-data-and-analysis-create-users-that-cannot-exist-e5776a2fd7b">Data can create what does not exist</a>. <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-not-memory-5b34fee8fed">Data is not Memory</a>.</p><p>I am asking these questions of directors, boards, senior leadership teams and data/ data managers. Directors are accountable in law for ensuring no discrimination and health and safety, but how can we know what we know if we don’t know the structure or framing of the data that gave us the result.&nbsp; If we assume - that is a risk.</p>  <p>Do you have a data philosophy, and what is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is the structure of your data by silo? Is there a single top-level ontology?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Do you know the structure/ ontologies of data for your ecosystem?&nbsp;</p>  <p>What is the attestation and rights of the data in our data lake? How do we check if we are using data for a different purpose than intended?</p>  <p>How would you detect the consequences in your decision making by the aggregation of data with different ontologies?&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Directors are accountable in law for discrimination, health and safety, and decision making (S.172 companies act), but how can we know what we know if we don’t know or understand the structure/ ontology and its limits.&nbsp; We can now longer assume, as it is a known risk.</p><p>For most, this is already too much detail and in the weeds!&nbsp; If you want to go deeper, this is a fantastic paper. <a href="https://www.cdbb.cam.ac.uk/files/a_survey_of_top-level_ontologies_lowres.pdf">A survey of Top-Level Ontologies to inform the ontological choices for a Foundation Data Model</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p> Summary&nbsp; <p>We want to use data to make better decisions and create new value.&nbsp; However, we need to recognise that our data has a structure (ontology). Our data’s very structure (designed or otherwise) creates bias, prevents certain outcomes from being created, and creates others. The reality is that our structures (ontologies) have already committed to the success or failure of your data strategy and business model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that our structures (ontologies) have already committed to the success or failure of your data strategy and business model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a leader, have you asked what is the structure (ontology) of our data?

As we now depend on ecosystem data, do you know the ontologies of others in your ecosystem and how that affects your decision making capability?&nbsp; Gaps in <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html?q=portability">data sharing</a> ontologies affect decisions and create <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">Quantum Risk</a>.&nbsp; What assumptions do we make about data without knowing is essential for investment risk, as we are using public ESG data to make capital allocation decisions without knowing where the data came from, what ontology the data has, if the right analysis tools have been used.&nbsp;</p><br><p>----</p> Implication 1.&nbsp; Management and Leadership <p>The figure-of-8 diagram below shows two interconnected loops. The connection is the mindset of the leader. Outstanding leadership with an open mindset can choose which loop is best at this time.&nbsp; Poor leadership will stick to the lower closed mindset loop.&nbsp; The lower loop never starts with a different way of asking questions or solving problems.&nbsp; Those in this self-confirming loop stick to the same biases, same decisions and same paradigms.&nbsp; This creates the ideas of one culture and a fixed culture. &nbsp; We have our way of doing it.&nbsp; The approach is consistency; the methods are highly efficient and based on the $1bn profit last year, we know it works, and we should continue to do the same.&nbsp; The reward mechanism, KPI and balanced scorecards are structured to keep the same highly efficient and effective thinking.&nbsp; Is assumes that yesterday, today and tomorrow will create the same outcomes if we do it the same.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with this, and during times of stability, many have made vast fortunes with this approach.</p><p>Great leaders follow this loop when it is right but can also swop to the upper loop.&nbsp; Such leaders sense a change. Such a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift">paradigm shift</a>”, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, “is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline”.&nbsp; This shift means there is a new structure to understand (ontology). This paradigm shift has a new structure, which means that there is a need to determine the new culture to create value with a new structure.&nbsp; Together a team will form an approach.&nbsp; At this point, the team will question the shift and the assumptions that have led to change, setting a new mindset for the new order.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically - understanding structure and ontology is crucial, and it is why I believe Data Philosophy, Data Ontology and better decisions based on data are current board issues. Still, they require new skills, are highly detailed, and often require a mind shift.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding structure and ontology is crucial for a data-driven digital board.</p><br><p></p><br> Implication 2.&nbsp; AI and Automation <p>The Data Paradox.&nbsp; How are you supposed to know how to create questions about something that you did not know we had to ask a question of?</p><p>Every child reads a book differently. A child learns to use questions to check and refine understanding. Every software engineer reads code differently. A software engineer is forced to check their understanding of the code and function by asking questions and by being asked questions. Whilst every AI will create sense from the data differently (ontology and code), right now, an AI cannot check its understanding of data by asking questions! Who could/would/ should the AI ask the clarification question of, and how do we check the person who answered is without bias? (Note I am not speaking about <a href="https://medium.com/dataseries/training-machine-learning-models-to-ask-the-right-questions-b6235dd5872b">AQA</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sherlock Holmes in The Great Game says, “people do not like telling you things; they love to contradict you. Therefore if you want smart answers, do not ask a question. Instead, give a wrong answer or ask a question in such a way that it already contains the wrong information. It is highly likely that people will correct you”.&nbsp; Do you do this to your data, or can you do this to your AI?</p><p>Today (Feb 2021), we cannot write an “algorithm” that detects if AI is going to create harm (evil). Partly because we cannot agree on “harm”, we cannot determine the unintended consequences, and we cannot bound harm for a person vs society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is a drive towards automation for efficiency based on the analysis of data. As a Director, are you capable of asking the right questions to determine bias and prejudice created in the automated processes, the data structures, different ontologies, data attestation or bias in the processes?&nbsp; Given Directors are accountable and responsible - indeed, this is a skill all board needs. Where is the audit and quota for these skills, can you prove it is available to the board?&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

<p>Loved reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff&nbsp;Lawson</a>.</p><p>Jeff says in the book that every company is on a journey to becoming a software company and everyone is starting to see the world through the lens of software. He defines the term, software person. A software person is not necessarily a developer, it’s anybody who, when faced with a problem, asks the question, how can software solve this&nbsp;problem?</p> Build vs. Buy (or vs.&nbsp;Die) <p>In the book, Jeff takes the popular debate, build vs. buy, to another dimension; build vs die. As every company is becoming a software company, the competitive advantage they build is in the software they build. When software becomes the interface where the services you offer, meet the customers; unless you build it in the way you want; you&nbsp;die!</p><p>Building what you want gives you the freedom to experiment (or innovate). More you experiment or the ability to experiment more, gives you the edge to understand your customers more. Hence, you grow your business.</p><p>Build, does not necessarily mean building everything from scratch. You don’t build anything that already exists, given that it provides what you need. You only build things that are core to your business, which help building your competitive advantage over all the others. The rest, or the building blocks that help you build what you wish are part of the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p> The Digital Supply&nbsp;Chain <p>Uber, for example, uses 4000+ microservices internally. However, not all of them are developed by Uber itself. Uber uses Google Maps API to pull out location data, the Twilio API to facilitate communication between passengers and drivers and many other APIs. All these APIs are coming from the digital supply chain Uber picks to build its product. Then again, these building blocks in Uber’s digital supply chain are also available to Lyft, and other Uber competitors around the world. What brings Uber the competitive advantage is in what they&nbsp;build!</p><p>The software you build, can be your product, at the same time it can be a building block for another product. Google Maps is Google’s product, however the Google Maps API is a building block for Uber. Alexa is a product of Amazon, however Alexa API is a a building block for&nbsp;Nissan.</p><p>Picking the right digital supply chain is equally important as what you pick to build. Think, what if Uber had to build something equivalent to Google Maps from the scratch? From 2016 to 2018, Uber paid 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Having the right digital supply chain helps you to optimize your development team to build only what you need and no more. Instagram, for example, was only a 13 people team, when Facebook acquired it for $1B in 2012; and WhatsApp team was only 50, when Facebook acquired it for $19B in&nbsp;2014.</p> Build Your Own Identity&nbsp;Stack? <p>Every service you develop, every API you design, every device you use, every person you interact with, will have a managed identity, and in today’s hyperconnected world, the Identity integrations with these business applications and systems, is going to be critical.</p><p>Going back to the build vs. die debate; do you still have to build the Identity stack to gain the competitive advantage in your business? If you are in the Identity business, of course yes, for all the others no. Identity stack you need to build your product is a building block in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>You never worried about building a TCP/IP stack yourself, so, don’t worry about building an Identity stack yourself. However, over the time we have spoken to over a thousand companies (hundreds of them are WSO2 customers), and in most of the cases they bring in unique identity requirements. The uniqueness comes in those requirements are specific to the industry they are in and also specific to the complexity of the business problem they want to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Identity is core to any business, and how you manage identity will also help you in building competitive advantage. At WSO2, we have worked with 90% of the Identity Server customers to solve complex identity problems. Identity Server is open source, and if the business problem is straightforward, they don’t even talk to us, they simply use the product as it is. However, when we work with complex Identity requirements, we have extended the product to solve specific business problems.</p><p>Building these extensions, specific to unique business requirements helped companies to differentiate themselves from others. Then again, they didn’t want to build everything from scratch — rather they started with what’s common (and available to everyone) and started innovating on that. That drastically reduced the time-to-market, and also gave the freedom to innovate.</p><p>I don’t intend to contradict with what I mentioned before, that the Identity stack is part of the digital supply chain you pick, however, the Identity stack you pick for the digital supply chain should have the flexibility to extend with minimal effort to build business requirements specific to your business.</p> The TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>In the 70’s, having support for TCP/IP in a product was considered to be a competitive advantage. Today, it’s given, and nobody worries about TCP/IP support; it’s everywhere.</p><p>Ian Glazer from Salesforce, mentioned in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZPd584l6o&amp;ab_channel=KuppingerCole">keynote</a> at the European Identity Conference 2016 that, it’s the TCP/IP moment in Identity now. He in fact talked about the open standards (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth, SCIM, XACML and so on) in the Identity domain, and how they are going to be part of every product, so no Identity vendor is going to gain competitive advantage just by supporting the open standards. RFPs looking for Identity products will not even worry about asking support for these open standards.</p> The Next TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>Developers do not worry about building a TCP/IP stack, or even worrying about TCP/IP while building software. We believe, the Identity integrations with business applications and systems need to be developer-first (or developer-focused) with the right level of abstractions and tools. And, doing that right, would be the next TCP/IP moment in Identity, that will free the developers from worrying about complexities in Identity integrations.</p> The Developer-first IAM <p>The single Identity administrator role has started diminishing, and the role of the developer is becoming more prominent in Identity integrations. These developers need a better abstraction over core identity concepts; and the developer-first IAM is the way to realize the next TCP/IP moment in Identity.</p><p>In the consumer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven consumer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements.</p><p>A developer-first IAM product builds an abstraction over the core Identity concepts in the form of APIs and SDKs, provides tools for troubleshooting, has the ability to integrate with the organization’s build pipeline, carries the right level of developer experience and has the ability to extend product’s core capabilities to fit into organization’s complex IAM requirements.</p><p>As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations. That’s the next TCP/IP moment in Identity!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

SSI — Legal compliance and the involvement of governments<p>This article describes how governments of sovereign states might be involved in building identity ecosystems based on self-sovereign principles and how regulatory conformity of such ecosystems can be achieved.</p><p>When it comes to identity management the involvement of the government can be a tricky topic. It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) might for some imply, that a citizen is suddenly able to issue his own ID-card, which isn’t the case. Governments are still the primary source of foundational identities.</p> The government as issuer of foundational identities <p>While individuals gain more autonomy with SSI the issuance of national IDs is still the responsibility of the public administration. The Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) differentiates between foundational and contextual identities.</p><blockquote>“A foundational identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).” <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">PCTF</a>&nbsp;[1]</blockquote><p>Hence, the government continues to be the issuer of foundational identities and still holds the authority to revoke these credentials when necessary. However, SSI also enables the usage of other identity providers, which are context dependent — leading to a contextual identity as further explained within the&nbsp;PCTF.</p><blockquote>“A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media). Depending on the identity context, a contextual identity may be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a drivers licence) or may not be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a social media profile).“ [1]</blockquote><p>This means a customer of a bank can use his verified bank ID to identify himself at a credit bureau. Since the bank ID is based on a foundational identity, the contextual identity provided by the bank can be sufficient in this particular use-case given the regulatory environment allows such a usage. However, a contextual identity can, but doesn’t have to be based on a foundational identity.</p><p>The European Commission supports the continued usage of contextual identities online and only demands the usage of foundational identities when required by law as stated in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528">eIDAS public consultation</a> [2] regarding the option to extend the regulation for the public&nbsp;sector:</p><blockquote>“A European identity solution enabling trusted identification of citizens and companies in their digital interactions to access public or private online services (e.g. e- commerce), should be entirely voluntary for users to adhere to and fully protect data and privacy. Anonymity of the internet should be ensured at all times by allowing solutions for anonymous authentication anonymously where user identification is not required for the provision of the service.“ [2]</blockquote> Regulatory compliancy <p>When dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) all involved stakeholders need to adhere to a certain set of laws, which dictate the usage of the such data. These laws highly depend on the citizenship of the data subject (the individual the PII is about) among other important factors. Although the following paragraphs are specifically devoted to the laws of the European Union, the conclusion might also be applied to similar laws such as the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> or the <a href="https://law.asia/regional-data-privacy-laws/">Indian Personal Data Protection Bill&nbsp;(DPA)</a>.</p><p>Within the European Union, there are two laws, which have a significant influence on identity frameworks. The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, determines how personal data from EU citizens can be collected and used. The other important law is the Electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) provision specified in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">N°910/2014</a> [3]. It constitutes the main electronic identification trust framework in the EU and is an elemental building block of the digital single&nbsp;market.</p> GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation Overview of important roles regarding PII data management according to international standards.<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessm%20ent+Reports">EBSI GDPR assessment</a> [4] notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“According to this Regulation, there are two types of actors whose key role in data processing and whose relationship to the data within the data processing environment leads the European legislator to attribute them a set of obligations and responsibilities. Thus, these liable actors are subject to data protection rules.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>These are data controllers, which are defined in article <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">4(7) GDPR</a> [5]&nbsp;as</p><blockquote>“the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law”&nbsp;[5]</blockquote><p>which</p><blockquote>“have to take all necessary measures so that data subjects are sufficiently informed and have the ability to exercise their data protection rights.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The other actor is the data processor who acts as delegate of the data controller and is a separate legal entity according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp169_en.pdf">opinion 1/2010 of the Data protection working party.</a> [6] With multiple nodes running a decentralized network every node acts as a data processor or data controller depending on if the node operator is processing the data as a delegate or not. The EBSI GDPR report further&nbsp;notes:</p><blockquote>“in case of joint controllership, data controllers can contractually assign partial responsibility based on distinct stages of data processing.“ While an agreement between these data processors can regulate the responsibilities, “data subjects will have ot (sic!) be able to exercise their rights against every joint controller“ and “nodes that add and process the on-chain ledger data in order to maintain the consensus will be individually qualified as joint data controllers and this, regardless of a contractual relationship stating the contrary.“ [4]</blockquote><p>For public blockchains with permissionless write access such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, this means, that every miner, which is participating in the proof of work consensus is regarded as data processor given there is an unintentional personal data leakage or correlation with an URL (Uniform resource locator) of a service endpoint within DID Documents as pointed out as critical to keep PII private by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID specification of the W3C in section 10.1</a>.[7] This threat in addition of the numerous other correlation risks mentioned in section 10.2 and 10.3 of said specification make the current implementation of SSI based on permissionless blockchains, which inhibit the capability for natural persons to write a anywise DID on the ledger, a daunting privacy challenge.</p><p>Another important aspect is the question if credentials (or any other form of PII) is stored as hash on the verifiable data registry. A hash is a data digest and is considered a one-way function, which in theory leads to an anonymization of the original information. The debate around the question if a hash constitutes PII is likely to continue, since national data protection agencies are struggling to clearly define if the hashing can be considered an anonymization or pseudonymization.</p><blockquote>“According to the Spanish DPA (Data protection agency), hashing can at times be considered as anonymization or pseudonymization depending on a variety of factors varying from the entities involved to the type of the data at hand.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>Even if the hash constitutes a one-way obfuscation technique, which anonymizes PII, it I) requires a transaction on a public ledger and II) it puts data controllers in a higher risk position with the obligation to avoid correlation of individuals. Risk minimizing obligations for data controllers are easier to implement when there is no hash of a verified credential or verified presentation stored on a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>When it comes to the wallet itself the EBSI GDPR report notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“there is growing consensus about the possibility of data subjects to being simultaneously considered as data controllers for the data that refer to themselves“. The report provides the recommendation that “the privacy preserving technical and organisational measures of the wallet and the personal data transmissions should ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place in order to not limit the empowerment of the data subject through the DLT chosen model.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The report concludes, that data within the wallet application is considered personal data and therefor is subject to the data protection regulation.</p><p>While there is a general assumption that e.g. <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/GDPR-Paper_V1.pdf">Hyperledger Indy implementations are GDPR compliant</a> [8], ultimately courts have to decide if that claim holds up based on a case by case evaluation on the particular implementation. Nevertheless, avoiding the exposure of PII on the verifiable data registry, by I) not allowing natural persons to write public DIDs and II) not storing PII in hashed form on the verifiable data registry facilitate the GDPR compliance obligations.</p> eIDAS: <p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">eIDAS regulation</a> [3] is concerned with two distinct topics. One part is concerned with trust services for private businesses such as electronic signatures, seal, time stamps etc. The other part is regulating the mutual recognition among member states of national implementations of electronic identification (eID) for the public sector. Is a technology neutral approach, which has a strong influence on the international regulatory space. The main goal of mutual recognition of eID is to enable EU citizens access to cross-border public services with their own national eID means. The implementation of eID schemes vary from member state to member state and not all member states have notified an eID scheme as illustrated by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS">overview of pre-notified and notified eID schemes</a> [9] under&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><p>There are three levels of assurance specified for eIDs under eIDAS referring to the degree of confidence in the claimed identity of a person, which include detailed criteria allowing member states to map their eID means against a benchmark (low, substantial and high). Current SSI implementations have the objective to be recognized with a level of assurance specified as substantial.</p><p>It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI by leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessment+Reports">SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo</a> [10]. Especially interesting is the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge">SSI eIDAS bridge</a>, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by deriving a national eID by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Spe%20V%20cification+%2815%29+-+eIDAS+bridge+for+VC-eSealing">technical specification</a>.[12]</p><p>Nevertheless, there are also hindrances in the process of creating a qualified certificate with the derived national identity, because of the way the regulation is defining a qualified signature. Another issue is that national eID schemes require the keys to be in a secure element. However, current SSI wallets only offer software keys and do not leverage the security benefits of a hardware element. Furthermore, the eIDAS regulation doesn’t regulate the case of a private entity issuing an eID attribute to a natural person for the usage of it in other private interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the authentication process to achieve the recognition of notified eIDAS schemes by other member states requires a national node, which provides the authentication service. While aimed to be technology neutral, the obligation to provide this authentication service as delegated authentication component has several drawbacks and also hinders the potential adoption of SSI. The EU has already identified the need to re-evaluate the policies set by&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><blockquote>“Fundamental changes in the overall societal context suggest a revision of the eIDAS Regulation. These include a dramatic increase in the use of novel technologies, such as distributed-ledger based solutions, the Internet of Thing, Artificial Intelligence and biometrics, changes in the market structure where few players with significant market power increasingly act as digital identity ‘gatekeepers’, changes in user behavior with increasing demand for instant, convenient and secure identification and the evolution of EU Data Protection legislation” [2]</blockquote><p>The consultation continues with its&nbsp;target:</p><blockquote>“The objective of this initiative is, first of all, to provide a future proof regulatory framework to support an EU-wide, simple, trusted and secure system to manage identities in the digital space, covering identification, authentication and the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations. Secondly, the initiative aims at creating a universal pan-European single digital ID. These objectives could be achieved through an overhaul of the eIDAS system, an extension of eIDAS to the private sector, the introduction of a European Digital Identity (EUid) building on the eIDAS system or combination of both.”&nbsp;[2]</blockquote><p>In an private interview for an academic study Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo suggested embodying new technologies such as SSI into the revised regulation e.g. by not mandating the provision of an authentication facility and creating new trust services such as electronic identification. In another private interview Luca Boldrin suggested keeping national identity systems as they are but use a derivation of national identity for cross-border context for public and private businesses in parallel to current node implementation to enable a European identity.</p><p>Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo argues that having derived national eIDs and eID trust services has the benefit of increased privacy by using a peer to peer authentication instead of a delegated authentication model (the national eIDAS node). This also leads to less liability issues by shifting the authentication part to private providers as well as less costs associated with running authentication infrastructure for governments, because these are provided by Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) instead of national eIDAS nodes. These DPKI systems also have the benefits of being more resilient to attacks compared to a single node, which represents a single point of failure. However, regulating eID as trust service also means opening up identification for the private market, which might not be in the interest of national governments.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>When I walk around our neighborhood I see very few copies of our local newspaper on sidewalks, porches, and front lawns. We subscribe because it’s a lifelong habit, and because we like to support local journalism, and in my case because it’s a welcome reprieve from a long day of screentime.</p>
<p>This archaic habit has also, weirdly, become a kind of superpower. From time to time I meet people who are surprised when I know facts about them. These facts are public information, so why should it be surprising that I know them? Because they appear in the print edition of the newspaper. Consider the man in this photo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were out for a Sunday morning walk, carrying the newspaper, when we saw him in a cafe. We had just read an article about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petalumawhiskerino/photos">Whiskerino</a>, the annual contest of fancy beards and mustaches in Petaluma. And here was the guy whose photo was featured in the article!</p>
<p>That was a nice coincidence, but the kicker is that he had no idea his picture was in the paper. Not being of newspaper-reading age, and not having friends of newspaper-reading age, he had to depend on elders to alert him. I guess we got to him before his parents did.</p>
<p>When a similar thing happened this weekend, it occurred to me that this could be a good marketing strategy for newspapers. Do you want to wield an information superpower? Do you want to amaze people by knowing facts that they can’t imagine you could possibly know? Subscribe to the print edition of your local newspaper!</p>

 <a href="https://ludopoitou.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/directoryservices.png"></a> 



<p>In August 2020, we’ve rolled out a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-platform-updates-are-here">new release of the ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> which included updated versions of all of the products, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a> 7.0. I didn’t write a post about the new release, mostly due to our focus to deliver the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-cloud-gets-even-better">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and family vacation.</p>



<p>But ForgeRock Directory Services 7.0 is a major release in many ways. It is the first to be released with <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html#whats-new-700">a sample docker file and full support to run in Kubernetes</a> environments in the Cloud. To achieve that, we’ve made a number of significant changes especially in how security is managed, and how replication is configured and enabled. The rest of the server remains quite the same, delivering consistent performance and reliability. You should read the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>



<p>Since, DS 7 was successfully deployed in production, in VMs or in Docker/Kubernetes, and our customers have praised the simplicity and efficiency of the new version. However, some customers have experienced some difficulties with upgrading their current deployment to the 7.0 release, mostly due to the changes I’ve mentioned above. So we have been improving our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/upgrade-guide/">Upgrade Guide</a>, with greater details, and my colleague <a href="https://marginnotes2.wordpress.com/">Mark Craig</a>, has posted a series of 3 articles on Upgrading to Directory Services 7: </p>

<p>In a 1999 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=642&amp;v=FiK7s_0tGsg">interview</a> David Bowie said that “the potential for what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable.” I had no problem imagining the good, it was the bad where my imagination failed. The web of the late 90s was a cornucopia of wonder, delight, and inspiration. So was the blogosophere of the early 2000s. I know a lot of us are nostalgic for those eras, and depressed about how things have turned out. The bad is really quite bad, and sometimes I feel like there’s no way forward.</p>
<p>And then something wonderful happens. This time the spark was David Grinspoon aka @DrFunkySpoon. I’ve written before about a Long Now talk in which he posits that we might not just be living through the beginning of a geological epoch called the Anthropocene but rather — and far more profoundly — the dawn of an eon that he calls <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/09/25/welcome-to-the-sapiezoic/">the Sapiezoic</a>. Today he posted <a href="https://twitter.com/DrFunkySpoon/status/1358064758763753478">a stunning new visualization of plate tectonics</a>.</p>
<p>As always when I think about plate tectonics, I’m reminded of the high school science teacher who introduced me to the topic. His name is John Ousey, and this happened almost 50 years ago. What always stuck with me is the way he presented it. Back then, plate tectonics was a new idea. As Mr. Ousey (he later became Dr. Ousey) described the continents sliding apart, I can still see the bemused look on his face. He was clearly wrestling with the concept, unsure whether to believe things really happen that way. That healthy skepticism, coupled with trust in the scientific process, made an indelible impression on me.</p>
<p>One of the wonders of the Internet is the ability to find people. It took some sleuthing, but I did find him and this ensued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote to John Ousey and he replied!</p>
<p>"I learned about Plate Tectonics (then called Continental Drift) by taking weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton. It was brand new and I'm not sure that he was totally convinced about it either."</p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1358106780153249792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That’s the kind of magic that can still happen, that does happen all the time.</p>
<p>I learned for the first time that John Ousey’s introduction to plate tectonics came by way of “weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton” who was himself perhaps “not totally convinced.” Despite uncertainty, which he acknowledged, John Ousey was happy to share an important new idea with his Earth science class.</p>
<p>What a privilege to be able to thank him, after all these years, for being a great teacher who helped me form a scientific sensibility that has never mattered more than now. And to share a moment of appreciation for an extraordinary new visualization of the process once known as continental drift. Yes, there’s a dark side to our connected world, darker than I was once willing to imagine. But there is also so much light. It’s always helpful to consider deep geological time. That video shows a billion years of planetary churn. We’ve only been connected like this for 25 years. Maybe we’ll figure it out. For today, at least, I choose to believe that we will.</p>

    Framing the problem <p>I am fighting bias and prejudice about risk perceptions; please read the next lines before you click off.&nbsp; We tend to be blind sighted to “risk” because we have all lived it, read it and listened to risk statements.&nbsp; The ones on the TV and radio for financial products, the ones at the beginning of investment statements, ones for health and safety for machinery, ones for medicine, ones on the packets of cigarettes, the one when you open that new app on your new mobile device. We are bombarded with endless risk statements that we assume we know the details of, or just ignore.&nbsp; There are more books on risk than on all other management and economics topics together.&nbsp; There is an entire field on the ontologies of risk; such is the significance of this field. This article is suggesting that all that body of knowledge and expertise has missed something.&nbsp; A bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly, and already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the Board pack or PowerPoint deck for new investment, intervention case or for the adoption of the new model, there is a risk and assumptions list.&nbsp; We have seen these so many times we don’t read them.&nbsp; These statements are often copies, and the plagiarism of risk statements inaccurately copied is significant; no effort is put in as such statements have become a habit in the process methodology. &nbsp; The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all. Quite frankly, we see risk as the prime reason to stop something and occasionally manage it closer but never too understand something better.&nbsp; If you are operating a digital or data business you have new risks that are not in your risk statement, you have not focussed on them before, you are unlikely to have been exposed to them, and this article is to bring them to your attention.&nbsp; Is that worth 8 minutes?</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peadar-duffy-b47360a/">Peadar Duffy</a> whom I have been collaborating with on this thinking, and he has published <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6762051599817875456/">a super article on the same topic (quantum risk) here</a>&nbsp;</p> The purpose of business&nbsp; <p>We know that 3% of our data lake is finance data today; shockingly, 90% of our decisions are based on this sliver of data (Source Google). As we have to aim for a better ratio of “data: decisions” that includes non-financial data; we will make progress towards making better decisions that benefit more than a pure shareholder primacy view of the world.&nbsp; As leaders, we have a desire to make the best possible decisions we can. We fuse data, experience and knowledge to balance our perception of risk, probability and desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The well-publicised “<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business Roundtable</a>” report in Aug 2019 redefines a corporation’s purpose to promote ‘An Economy That Serves All … [Americans]’.&nbsp; The idea that company purpose should be closer to ecosystem thinking has been gaining prevalence since the financial crisis in 2008.&nbsp; The thinking has significant supporters such as <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/uk/individual/larry-fink-ceo-letter">Larry Fink</a>,&nbsp; Blackrock’s founder and CEO, who is an influential voice for ESG reporting and promotes changes to decision making criteria for better outcomes. His yearly letters are an insightful journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Donald Brydon's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Dec 2019 report</a> highlights that governance and audit need attention if we are to deliver better decisions, transparency and accountability. The report concludes that audit has significant failings and our approach to tick box compliance is not serving directors, shareholders or society to the level expected. Given that so much of our risk management depends on the quality of the audit, internal and external, it is likely that we are unduly confident in data that is unreliable. This point alone about audit failure could be sufficient for this article’s conclusion; however, we are here to explore Quantum Risk. Quantum Risk only exists because of the business dependency we now have on data from our co-dependent supply chains to dependent ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Quantum Risk is NEW&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>As a term from physics that describes particles’ properties, “quantum” will help frame new risk characteristics.&nbsp; The primary characteristics of quantum particles’ behaviour are:- the uncertainty principle, composite systems and entanglement. &nbsp; In a language, I understand these characteristics for Quantum risk are:</p>  <p>When you observe the same risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same risk can be in many places simultaneously, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your risk and my risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem; they are coupled but may not be directly connected.</p>   Framing Risk <p>Risk, like beauty, privacy, trust, transparency and many other ideals, is a personal perspective on the world; however, we all accept that we have to live with risk.</p><p>Risk, and the management of risk, fundamentally assumes that you can identify it first. &nbsp;If you cannot identify the risk, there is no risk to consider or manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Having identified the risk, you assess the risks to categorise and prioritise them using the classic impact vs likelihood model.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the management (review and control) of risk determines if you are doing the right things or action is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible to add a third axis to a classic likelihood, impact risk model, “quality of knowledge.” The third axis visually highlights that a focus on high risks accumulates the most knowledge as that is where the management focus and control is required, and it needs data which becomes knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp; If there is a deficit in knowledge because of <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">poor data</a>, it translates into an increased risk hidden because of poor data at any point in the matrix.&nbsp; Poor data (knowledge) can mean that either the impact (consequence) will be more severe or the likelihood (probability) is more likely. In part, we can overcome poor data problems by recognising that it always exists, but it easily hides the rather current issues of pandemics and systemic risk. However, if the quality of knowledge is based on erroneous data (<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/02/what-is-purpose-of-data-v2.html">data without rights and attestation</a>), we have no truth to the likelihood and impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Some sophisticated models and maths help qualify and understand the nature of risk depending on its nature and size.&nbsp; However, the list of risks that any one company faces is defined, specified and has been thought about over a long period.&nbsp; Uncovering new risk is considered unlikely; however, it is this that we are exploring and given our natural confirmational bias towards risk (we know it) - this is hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Classic risk models are framed to gain certainty, where risk is the identification, understanding, management and control of uncertainty.&nbsp; Existing risk models are highly efficient within this frame of reference, and we can optimise to our agreed boundaries of control with incredible success.&nbsp; Risk within our boundary (sphere of direct control) is calculated, and it becomes a quantified measure, enabling incentives to be created that provide a mechanism for management control. &nbsp; Risk outside our boundary (indirect control on a longer supply or value chain), whilst it is someone else’s risk we are dependent on them to manage it. Such dependencies are vital in modern global businesses. We have developed methodology (contracts) and processes (audit) to ensure that we are confident that any risk to us, inside or outside of our direct control, is identified and managed.</p><p>However, as leaders, we face three fundamental issues on this move to an economy that serves broader eco-systems as the boundaries we are dependent on have become less clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. The quality of the data and implied knowledge we receive from our direct and dependent* eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>2. The quality of the knowledge we receive from our indirect and interdependent** eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>3. Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (assumption first boundary is direct and already in control in our risk model)</p><p>* Dependent: balancing being able to get what I want by my own effort as contingent on or determined by the actions of someone else to make it work&nbsp; ** Interdependence combine my efforts with the efforts of others to achieve successful outcomes together but does not have to be mutual or controlled&nbsp;</p> Risk as a shared belief has wider dependencies.&nbsp; <p>Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (Point 3 above) introduces the concept of second and third-order boundaries for broader (inter)-dependent ecosystems. This short section explains where those boundaries are and why they matter in the context of a business’s purpose moving toward a sustainable ecosystem (ESG.)</p><p>The figure below expands on the dependency thinking into a visual representation. The three-axis are values/ principles as a focus [self, society, planet earth], who has accountability/ obligations [no-one, an elected authority such as a director, society or all of humanity], and the health of our eco-systems (prime, secondary, tertiary and all).</p><p>The small blue area shows the limitations of our current shareholder primacy remit, where Directors have a fiduciary duty to ensure that their prime business thrives and value is created for shareholders (stakeholders,) at the expense of others. Having a healthy ecosystem helps (competition, choice, diverse risk, margin.)&nbsp; As envisaged by the Business Roundtable, a sustainable ecosystem is the orange area, expanding the Directors remit to more eco-systems and embracing more of a “good for society” value set but does not increase director accountability.&nbsp; ESG v1.0 widens the remit to the green area; this step-change expands all current thinking and dependencies of any one player on others on a broader ecosystem. We become sustainable together.&nbsp;</p><p></p> How is it possible for unidentified risks to exist? <p>In simple terms, there is no new unknown risk; however, what is known to someone may not be known by everyone. Risk is hiding in plain sight. As we are expanding our remits as discussed in the last section above, we are increasingly dependent on others managing their risk to the same level we manage risk and share data across the ecosystem. This is where Quantum Risk arises, at the boundaries, in the long-tail of the universe of risk.</p><p>In the figure below, The Growing Universe of Risk. We are very good at the management of insurable, measurable known:known (identified and shared) risk. We are also very good at un-insurable, measurable (impact, likelihood, knowledge) and known:unknown risk mainly because the determined likelihood of occurrence and impact is moderate.&nbsp; Indeed, we have created excellent tools to help mitigate and accept uninsurable, un-measurable “unknown:unknown” risk.&nbsp; In mitigation we accept that the data quality&nbsp; (knowledge) is poor, but the impact is low, as is the likelihood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum risk is the next step out; it is emergent at the boundaries of (inter)-dependencies created as we need to create sustainable ecosystems where we share data. We are increasingly reliant on data from indirectly related players to our ecosystem, and we have no power or control. We have no rights to data and no clue on attestation. Quantum risk is not in our current risk model, or existing risk frameworks and is unimagined to us.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br> Business Risk Vs Data Risk <p>Business risk is something that every business has to deal with.&nbsp; Kodak and Nokia maybe not as well as say IBM, Barclays or Microsoft. &nbsp; Mobile phone networks should have seen mobile data services coming and therefore the advent of international voice and video apps that meant there was always going to be a natural decline in SMS, local and international mobile revenue. Most rejected this business risk in 2005 only seeing growth in core areas.&nbsp; However good hindsight is, apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram came about due to the timing of three interrelated advances, which created business risk. &nbsp; Device capability, network capability and pricing.&nbsp; Device designers and manufacturers have to keep pushing technology to keep selling devices; device technology will always advance. &nbsp; Network capacity was always going to increase, and packet-switched capability has massive economies of scale over voice circuits. Large, fast packet circuits were always going to win.&nbsp; Pricing by usage prevents usage; bundles work for increasing capacity.&nbsp; For a mobile operator, the objective is to fill the network capacity that is built to maximise ROI, bundles work, as does Apps that move revenue from one product to the next.&nbsp; This is a business risk created by change and dependencies on others in your ecosystem, quantum risks are a business risk but hide in data.</p><p>Data Risk falls into three buckets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data that you collect directly as part of the process of doing business.&nbsp; Critically you can determine the attestation (provenance and lineage) of the data, and it comes from your devices, sensors and systems.&nbsp; There is a risk that you don’t collect, store, protect, analyse or know if the data is true.&nbsp; In truth, this is the front end of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put priority. Nothing new here.</p>  <p>Data you collect from third parties who you have a relationship with. A supplier, partners, collaborator, associate or public data.&nbsp; Whilst you are likely to have the “rights to use data” (contract), you are unlikely to have “attestation” (provenance and lineage) of the shared data back to the origin. You will have access to summary or management levels (knowledge and insights), and you should have audit and other contractual agreements to check. &nbsp; There is often a mutual relationship where you both share data, both dependent on the data quality. The risk is that you don’t qualify, check, question or analyse this 3rd party data.&nbsp; In truth, this is another head-end risk of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put significant resources. The exception will be public data as there is no route to understanding bias, ontology or purpose, however public data is not usually used exclusively for decision making, with one exception right now ESG and this worries me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Quantum Risk is a data risk where you neither have control of nor access to, data. Still, this data set has become critical to decision making as we move to sustainable ecosystems, stewardship codes and ESG.&nbsp; However, it requires us to dig into the dark and mysterious world data ontologies, which we have to unpack quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   Ontologies&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>To explain your reasoning, rationale or position, you need to define how entities are grouped into basic categories that structure your worldview and perspective. If you have a different perspective, you will behave and act differently.&nbsp; Such a structure is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">ontology</a> (how we view the world) and is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a> (how do we know what is true and how we have gone about investigating/ proving it?). Ontology is a branch of philosophy but is critical in understanding data and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">information science</a> as it encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. Think of data ontology as a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point you would have thought with 5,000 years of thinking about this we would have one top-level ontology from which everything would flow.&nbsp; Alas, we don’t have one for anything.&nbsp; There is no black and white agreed way to look at anything in philosophy, physics, biology, humanities, data, climate, language, sound, knowledge, compute, behaviour and every other topic. This means that it is safe to assume your way of describing your world, in your organisation, through data is different from everyone else in your ecosystem.&nbsp; Those same data points represented in 1 and 0’s mean completely other things in different ontologies. Your worst scenario is different ontologies inside your silos which means you have different world views but may not know this.&nbsp; <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo">Ontology is one of the roles for a CDO, explored here</a>.&nbsp; Now to epistemology, which is concerned with the creation of knowledge, focusing on how knowledge is obtained and investigating the most valid ways to reach the truth. Epistemology essentially determines the relationship between the data, analyst and reality and is rooted in your ontological framework. Different data science teams can have the same data set and very different views, and then we add the statistics team.&nbsp; What truth or lies do you want?&nbsp; This matters when data is shared - how do you know what your business partners thinks is true about their data?</p><p>It only gets more complicated the more you unpack this and I will write an article about this soon. However, as shown in the figure, knowing how you view the world in data, does not guarantee that everyone else in your ecosystem has the same view.&nbsp; I have seen very few contracts for data sharing at business data levels share the ontology and mapping schedules between then. Yes we often share naming/ data dictionary level, but that is not ontology. Assuming that shared data has the same purpose between the partner is “quantum risk.” This risk is at the boundaries, and it only appears when you look.&nbsp; Imagine you are <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">sharing data</a> in your ecosystem on critical systems and as you read this, you realise you have not asked the question about the different world views you and your partners have towards collecting, analysing, and reporting for data.&nbsp; The event is not the same thing.&nbsp; Remember, at the start, we know everything about risk. I am in the same bucket. This is all new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Responses to Quantum Risk <p>I made two bold claims at the beginning. “The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all,” and “a bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly and is already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.”&nbsp; I wish it were easy, but Quantum Risk emerges at our digital business boundaries where we share data, the further we go out the less attestation and rights we have. The complexity of Quantum Risk creates havoc with our existing frameworks and models as:</p>  <p>When you observe the same quantum risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same quantum risk can be in many places at the same time, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your quantum risk and my quantum risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem, but they are not connected and not seen.</p>  <p>Given this, how do we respond? We need to get better with understanding the <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">purpose of our data</a>; we need to find CDO expertise to help us unpack our data ontologies and rethink what we consider are boundaries for commercial purposes, which means revisiting our contracts and terms.&nbsp; One question for those who get this far, have you tested how your users understand your Terms and Conditions on data use and privacy. I have never seen it in a test schedule as it is a barrier not a value proposition. We tell users to “Click here” fast and trust us. It is an obvious gap to investigate from a partner when you depend on that data and it is shared with you, and your advertising model now depends on it.</p><p>Any good economist/ strategist will immediately recognise the opportunity to game data at the boundary. How can I create an advantage, and what are the implications is another whole topic to unpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As a final thought, will your corporation consider Quantum Risk?&nbsp;</p><p>If your fellow senior leadership team is focused on the head end of the long tail, you will see a focus on implementing processes that align to regulation/ rules/ law and policies. You are likely to manage risk very well and be rewarded for doing so via cascading KPI’s.&nbsp; Quantum risk will be thought about when there are best practices or a visible loss of competitive position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Corporates with a more mature risk profile know there are loopholes and whilst have a focus on compliance, they have a hand in the lobby forums so they can benefit by putting risk onto others and gaining an advantage from being the owner of IP when the lobby work becomes policy.&nbsp; Quantum risk thinking will emerge when there is a clear identification of competitive advantage.</p><p>The most mature risk leadership teams are creating new thinking to ensure that they are sustainable and not forced to make retrospective changes as they just focussed on compliance and had delivery based KPI linked bonuses.&nbsp; These are the pioneers in digital and will pick up quantum risk first.&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>I wrote this essay in 2006 as part of a series of Internet explainers I did for New Hampshire Public Radio. It never aired for reasons lost to history, so I’m publishing this 15-year-old time capsule here for the first time. My motive is of course not purely archival. I’m also reminding myself why I should still practice now what I preached then.</p>
 How and why to tell your story online 
<p>Teens and twenty-somethings are flocking to social websites like MySpace and Facebook, where they post photos, music, and personal diaries. Parents, teachers, and cops wish they wouldn’t. It’s a culture war between generations, and right now everybody’s losing.</p>
<p>Kids: Listen up. Did you hear the story about the college student who didn’t get hired because of his Facebook page? Or the teenage girl whose MySpace blog told an attacker when she’d be home alone? These things happen very rarely, but they can happen. Realize that the words and pictures you publish online will follow you around for the rest of your lives. Realize that wrong choices can have embarrassing or even tragic consequences.</p>
<p>Now, grownups, it’s your turn to listen up. You’re right to worry about the kids. But there’s another side to the story. The new forms of Internet self-publishing — including social networks, blogs, podcasting, and video sharing — can be much more than narcissistic games. Properly understood and applied, they’re power tools for claiming identity, exerting influence, and managing reputation. Sadly, very few adults are learning those skills, and fewer still are teaching them.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to condemn bad online behavior. We’ve got to model good online behavior too — in schools, on the job, and in civic life. But we’re stuck in a Catch-22 situation. Kids, who intuit the benefits of the new social media, fail to appreciate the risks. Grownups, meanwhile, see only risks and no benefits.</p>
<p>There’s a middle ground here, and we need to approach it from both sides of the generation gap. The new reality is that, from now on, our lives will be documented online — perhaps by us, perhaps by others, perhaps by both. We may or may not influence what others will say about us. But we can surely control our own narratives, and shape them in ways that advance our personal, educational, professional, and civic agendas.</p>
<p>Your online identity is a lifelong asset. If you invest in it foolishly you’ll regret that. But failing to invest at all is equally foolish. The best strategy, as always, is to invest wisely.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple test to guide your strategy. Imagine someone searching Google for your name. That person might be a college admissions officer, a prospective employer, a new client, an old friend, or even a complete stranger. The reason for the search might be to evaluate your knowledge, interests, agenda, accomplishments, credentials, activities, or reputation.</p>
<p>What do you want that person to find? That’s what you should publish online.</p>
<p>To find three examples of what I mean, try searching the web for the following three names: Todd Suomela, Martha Burtis, Thomas Mahon. In each case, the first Google result points to a personal blog that narrates a professional life.</p>
<p>Todd Suomela is a graduate student at the University of Michigan. On his blog, Todd writes about what he’s learning, and about how his interests and goals are evolving. He hasn’t launched his professional career yet. But when he does, his habit of sharing the information resources he collects, and reflecting thoughtfully on his educational experience, will serve him well.</p>
<p>Martha Burtis is an instructional technologist at the University of Mary Washington. She and her team research and deploy the technologies that students, faculty, and staff use to learn, teach, and collaborate. On her blog, Martha writes about the tools and techniques she and her team are developing, she assesses how her local academic community is making use of those tools and techniques, and thinks broadly about the future of education.</p>
<p>Thomas Mahon is a Savile Row tailor. His shop in London caters to people who can spend two thousand pounds on a classic handmade suit. I’ll never be in the market for one of those, but if I were I’d be fascinated by Mahon’s blog, EnglishCut.com, which tells you everything you might want to know about Savile Row past and present, about how Mahan practices the craft of bespoke tailoring, and about how to buy and care for the garments he makes.</p>
<p>For Todd and Martha and Thomas, the benefits of claiming their Net identities in these ways run wide and deep. Over time, their online narratives become autobiographies read by friends, colleagues, or clients, and just as importantly, read by people who may one day become friends, colleagues, or clients.</p>
<p>In most cases, of course, the words, pictures, audio, and video you might choose to publish online won’t attract many readers, listeners, or viewers. That’s OK. The point is that the people they do attract will be exactly the right people: those who share your interests and goals.</p>
<p>We’ve always used the term ‘social networking’ to refer to the process of finding and connecting with those people. And that process has always depended on a fabric of trust woven most easily in the context of local communities and face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>But our interests and goals aren’t merely local. We face global challenges that compel us to collaborate on a global scale. Luckily, the new modes of social networking can reach across the Internet to include people anywhere and everywhere. But if we’re going to trust people across the Internet, we’ll need to be able check their references. Self-published narrative is one crucial form of evidence. The public reaction to such narratives, readily discoverable thanks to search engines and citation indexes, is another.</p>
<p>Is this a new and strange new activity? From one perspective it is, and that’s why I can’t yet point to many other folks who’ve figured out appropriate and effective ways to be online, as Todd and Martha and Thomas have.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, Internet self-publishing is just a new way to do what we’ve been doing for tens of thousand years: telling stories to explain ourselves to one another, and to make sense of our world.</p>

    We continually move towards better data-led decisions; however, we can easily ask our dataset’s wrong question. Without understanding “What is the purpose of data” on which we are basing decisions and judgements, it is easy to get an answer that is not in the data. How can we understand if our direction, Northstar or decision is a good one?&nbsp; Why am I interested in this? I am focusing on how we improve governance and oversight in a data-led world.&nbsp; <p>I wrote a lengthy article on<a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-data-90ba0b803178"> Data is Data.</a> It was a kickback at the analogies that data is oil, gold, labour, sunlight - data is not. Data is unique; it has unique characteristics. That article concluded that the word “Data” is also part of the problem, but we should think of data as if discovering a new element with unique characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data is a word, and it is part of the problem.&nbsp; Data doesn’t have meaning or shape, and data will not have meaning unless we can give it context. As<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodoralau/"> Theodora Lau</a> eloquently put it; if her kiddo gets 10 points in a test today (data as a state), the number 10 has no meaning, unless we say, she scored 10 points out of 10 in the test today (data is information). And even then, we still need to explain the type of test (data is knowledge) and what to do next or how to improve (data is insights).&nbsp; Each of these is a “data” point, and we don’t differentiate the use of the word “data” in these contexts.</p><p>Data’s most fundamental representation is “state” where it represents the particular condition something is in at a specific time.&nbsp; I love<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hughmacleod/"> Hugh’s work @gapingvoid</a> (below) representation&nbsp; Information is knowing that there are different “states” (on/off). Knowledge is finding patterns and connections.&nbsp; Insight knows comparatives to state. Wisdom is the journey.&nbsp; We live in the hope that the data we have will have an impact.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the data community has rested on two key characteristics of data: non-rivalrous (which plays havoc with our current understanding of ownership) and non-fungible (which is true if you assume that data carries information.)&nbsp; Whilst these are both accurate observations; they are not that good as universal characteristics.</p>  <p>Non-rivalrous. Economists call an item that can only be used by one person at a time as "rivalrous." Money and capital are rivalrous. Data is non-rivalrous as a single item of data can simultaneously fuel multiple algorithms, analytics, and applications.&nbsp; This is, however, not strictly true. Numerous perfect copies of “data” can be used simultaneously because the marginal cost of reproduction and sharing is zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Non-fungible. When you can substitute one item for another, they are said to be fungible.&nbsp; One sovereign bill can be replaced for another sovereign bill of the same value; one barrel of oil is the same as the next.&nbsp; So the thinking goes, data is non-fungible and cannot be substituted because it carries information.&nbsp; However, if your view is that data carries state (the particular condition that something is in at a specific time), then data is fungible. Higher-level ideals of data that is processed (information, knowledge, insights) are increasingly non-fungible.</p>   Money as a framework to explore the purpose of data&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Sovereign currency (FIAT), money in this setting, has two essential characteristics.&nbsp; It has rivalrous and fungible.&nbsp; Without these foundational characteristics, money cannot fulfil its original purpose (it has many others now); a trusted exchange medium.&nbsp; Money removes the former necessity of a direct barter, where equal value had to be established, and the two or more parties had to meet for an exchange.&nbsp; What is interesting is that there are alternatives to FIAT which exploit other properties.&nbsp; Because of fraud, we have to have security features, and there is a race to build the most secure wall.</p><p></p><br><p>[Just as a side note - money is an abstraction and part of the rationale for a balance sheet was to try to connect the abstraction back to real things. Not sure that works any more]</p> Revising the matrix “what problem is to be solved?”&nbsp; <p>Adding these other options of exchange onto the matrix, we have a different way to frame what problem each type of currency offers as a method of exchange mechanism. This is presented in the chart below.&nbsp; Sand and beans can be used, but they provide a messy tool compared to a sovereign currency.&nbsp; Crypto works, and it solves the problem, but without exchange to other currencies, it had fundamental limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If we now add digital data and other aspects of our world onto the matrix, we have a different perspective. We all share gravity, sunsets and broadcast TV/ radio on electromagnetic waves.&nbsp; However, only one atom can be used at a time, and that atom is not-interchangeable (to get the same outcome.)&nbsp; The point is that digital data is not in the same quadrant as sovereign currency and electrons as a beautiful solution based on being fungible and rivalrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the broadest definition of data which is “state”; chemical, atoms, gravity, electrons have state and therefore are also data.&nbsp; To be clear will now use Digital Data to define our focus and not all data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>These updates to the matrix highlight that, if data is non-rivalrous and non-fungible, these characteristics mean that is is very unclear to what problem digital data is solving.&nbsp; We see this all the time in the digital data market, as we cannot agree on what “data” is, it is messy.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for us as a digital data community is; “what are the axis [characteristics] that mean digital data is in the top corner of a matrix? This is where digital data is a beautiful solution to a defined problem, given that digital data is at its core is “knowing state.”&nbsp; I explored this question on a call with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott David</a>, and we ended up resting on “Rights and Attestation” as the two axes&nbsp;</p><p>Rights in this context are that you have gained rights from the Parties.&nbsp; What and how those rights were acquired is not the question; it is just that you have the rights you need to do what you need to do.</p><p>Attestation in this context is the evidence or proof of something.&nbsp; It is that you know what you have is true and that you can prove the state exists. How you do this is not the point; it is just you know it is provable.</p><p></p><p>As we saw with the money example, data will never have these (rights and attestation) characteristics exclusively; it is just when it has them, data is most purposeful.&nbsp; Without attestation, the data you have is compromised, and any conclusions you reach may not be true or real. Continually we have to test both our assumptions and the provability of our digital data. &nbsp; Rights are different as rights are not correlated with data quality, but rights may help resolve ownership issues.&nbsp; A business built without rights to the data they are using is not stable or sustainable.&nbsp; How and if those Rights were obtained ethically are matters to be investigated.&nbsp; Interestingly, these characteristics (rights and attestation)&nbsp; would readily fit into existing risk and audit frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a specific focus on ESG, sustainability, data for decision making, and better data for sharing.&nbsp; Given that most comparative ESG data is from public reports (creative commons or free of rights), it is essential to note there is a break in the attestation.&nbsp; ESG data right now is in the least useful data bucket for decision making, but we are making critical investment decisions on this analysis data set. It is something that we have to address.&nbsp;</p><br> In summary <p>If the purpose of data is “to share state” then the two essential characteristics data must have are rights and attestation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, as data becomes information (knowing state), knowledge (patterns of states), insight (context in states) and wisdom - these characteristics of rights and attestation matter even more.&nbsp; If you are making decisions on data that you don’t know if it is true or have the rights to it, becomes a dangerous place.&nbsp;</p><p>As a side, there is lots of technology and processes to know if the state is true (as in correct - not truth); if the state sensing is working and the level of accuracy; if the state at both ends has the same representation (providence/ lineage ); if it is secure; if we can gain information; if we can combine data sets and what the ontology is.&nbsp; But these are not fundamental characteristics; they are supportive and ensure we have a vibrant ecosystem of digital data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> I am sure there are other labels for such a matrix and interested in your views, thoughts and comments.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Are you registered for the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> yet?  As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=267">I wrote a decade, a year, and a day ago</a>, “It’s where Internet identity work gets done.”  That remains as true now is it was then!</p>
<p>As a personal testimonial, I wrote this to the IIW organizers after the 2020 IIWs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Thanks again for running the most engaging and successful virtual meetings of the year (by far!).  While I’ve come to dread most of the large virtual meetings, IIW online remains true to the spirit of the last 15 years of useful workshops.  Yes, I miss talking to Rich and the attendees in the coffee line and having impromptu discussions throughout, and we’ll get back to that in time, but the sessions remain useful and engaging.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m also proud that Microsoft is continuing its 15-year tradition of sponsoring the workshop.  Rather than buying dinner for the attendees (the conversations at the dinners were always fun!), we’re sponsoring scholarships for those that might otherwise not be able to attend, fostering an even more interesting and diverse set of viewpoints at the workshop.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>At the 2015 Postgres conference, the great IT philosopher Robert <a>r0ml</a> Lefkowitz delivered a talk entitled The Image of Postgres. Here’s the blurb.</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you think about what a database is? If you think of a database as only a place to store your data, then perhaps it does not really matter what the internals of that database are; all you really need is a home for your data to be managed, nothing more.</p>
<p>If you think of a database as a place where you develop applications, then your expectations of your database software change. No longer do you only need data management capabilities, but you require processing functions, the ability to load in additional libraries, interface with other databases, and perhaps even additional language support.</p>
<p>If your database is just for storage, there are plenty of options. If your database is your development framework, you need Postgres.</p>
<p>Why? Well, let’s get philosophical.</p></blockquote>
<p>For over a year, I’ve been using Postgres as a development framework. In addition to the core Postgres server that stores all the Hypothesis user, group, and annotation data, there’s now also a separate Postgres server that provides an interpretive layer on top of the raw data. It synthesizes and caches product- and business-relevant views, using a combination of PL/pgSQL and PL/Python. Data and business logic share a common environment. Although I didn’t make the connection until I watched r0ml’s talk, this setup harkens back to the 1980s when Smalltalk (and Lisp, and APL) were programming environments with built-in persistence. The “image” in r0ml’s title refers to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561145/what-is-a-smalltalk-image">Smalltalk image</a>, i.e. the contents of the Smalltalk virtual machine. It may also connote reputation, in the sense that our image of Postgres isn’t that of a Smalltalk-like environment, though r0ml thinks it should be, and my experience so far leads me to agree.</p>
<p>I started writing a book to document what I’ve learned and done with this idea. It’s been a struggle to find motivation because, well, being the patron saint of trailing-edge technologies is often lonely and unrewarding. A book on this particular topic is likely to appeal to very few people. Stored procedures? So last century! Yes, Python provides a modern hook, but I can almost guarantee that one of the comments on my first book — “has a vision, but too weird” — would come back around.</p>
<p>I’m tempted not to bother. Maybe I should just focus on completing and polishing the things the book would describe. </p>
<p>And yet, it’s hard to let go. This isn’t just a compelling idea, it’s delivering excellent results. I rewatched r0ml’s talk today and got fired up again. Does it resonate for you? Would you like to see the ideas developed? If you watch the talk, please let me know. </p>
<p>Here are some excerpts to pique your interest.</p>
<p>On databases vs file systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I submit that the difference between the database and a file system is that database is a platform for enforcing your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On ontology:</p>
<blockquote><p>
client: The business guys are always upset because they want to know how many customers we have and we can’t tell them.</p>
<p>r0ml: That doesn’t sound like a very hard problem. SELECT * from the customer table, right?</p>
<p>client: No you don’t understand the problem.</p>
<p>r0ml: OK, what’s the problem?</p>
<p>client: It depends what you mean by customer because if you’re selling cell phone insurance, is the customer the person who has the cell phone account? What if they have two handsets and they’re both insured? What if it’s a family account and there are kids on the plan, do they count as customers? What if it’s a business account and you have 1000 people covered but only 700 using?</p>
<p>r0ml: How my customers you have, that’s a business rule.</p>
<p>So figuring out what your schema is, and figuring out how you organize the stuff and what do you do in the database, that’s all part of enforcing your business rules.</p>
<p>You have to decide what these things mean.</p>
<p>It’s an ontological problem.</p>
<p>You have to classify your knowledge and then enforce your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On n-tier architecture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Let us think about the typical web application architecture. This architecture is called the three-tier architecture because it has four tiers. You have your browser, your web server, the thing that runs Python or PHP or JavaScript or Ruby or Java code, and then the database. And that’s always how you do it. And why do you do it that way? Well because that’s how everybody does it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On Smalltalk and friends:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.
</p></blockquote>

  <p>Shortly after the 2016 election, I pulled out a book written by my grandfather,
chronicling the history of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachhagel">Bachhagel</a>,
the village in southern Germany where he grew up.</p>
<p>I re-read the chapters describing how the Nazis, in short order, took over
life there in 1933. His eye-witness account describes in fascinating,
and horrifying detail, how quickly the established order and century-old
traditions were hollowed out and then overrun.</p>
<p>Bachhagel at the time was a tiny place, probably less than 1000 people, out in the
countryside, of no political or economic importance. I could have understood how
the Nazis would concentrate on the major population and economic centers to
crush the opposition, but Bachhagel certainly was as far away from that as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it just took a few months, after which the established order had
been swept out and the thugs were fully in charge, day to day, from school to church
to public events, and their entire worldview was the only thing that mattered.</p>
<p>With Joe Biden in the office this week, it seems we have turned a chapter.
And looking back to the 2016 election day, I realize that although the past four years were
bad, people died, children got separated, and many other outrages, we
have been lucky. In 2016, I had been expecting worse, and possibly much worse.</p>
<p>Why didn’t it turn out as bad as I had feared? It’s not that the defenders of the
republic did a particularly good job.  Instead, the would-be usurpers just
sucked at getting anything done, including just actually using the power in their.
hands. If it had been the original Nazis, the consequences would
have been so much worse.</p>
<p>I vastly prefer better defenses, however, than being lucky with having an
incompetent opponent.  In computer security terms, Trump was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">Zero Day Vulnerability</a> of
the constitutional system of the US – a successful attack vector that previously had
not been known.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people still aren’t taking this attack vector as a seriously as they should,
otherwise we’d have specific legal and practical fix proposals all over the news,
which we don’t. Which means the vulnerability remains, and our primary defense
will remain the same: hoping that the attacker is incompetent. As long as we don’t
fix the system, the next attacker is going to try a similar route and they may very
well be more capable. In which case we’d really be in trouble.</p>
<p>So: I raise my glass to imcompetence. Next time, may we get a similar bunch of
incompetents. Or actually get our act together and make sure there won’t be a
next time.</p>

 Sufficiency Currency: What Communities Want <p>Starting out with some assumptions, I returned from 11 weeks of travel including visits to 7 intentional communities (ecovillages) with a more solidified idea of what the “sufficiency currency” might look like. Before I go into that, it’s useful for me to distinguish the major differences between the Sufficiency Currency project and other projects.</p><p>By the way, we aren’t even sure that “Currency” is the right name for the project, and you can <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/naming-sufficiency-currency/">check out this blog </a>for a discussion of different names for the&nbsp;project.</p> Sufficiency Currency&nbsp;Inquiry <p>The Sufficiency Currency project is looking at non-monetary currency solutions and the two major inquiries are:</p>  How can we create “group” measures and currencies. Production is a group activity, but money is an individual measure. What if we could only transact as a group or community? What would that type of communications would represent the complexity of interactions among communities?  If the purpose of an economy is to provide people’s basic survival needs (food, shelter, energy, health), what would we measure such that we can support everyone and increase the capacity of a society to grow to support more&nbsp;people?  <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p> Goals and Hypothesis <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p><p>The fundamental goals of the project&nbsp;are:</p>  Create a form of economy that looks directly at the sustainability of life in the economy, rather than a proxy measure&nbsp;(money).  Create local self-sufficiency for communities, and in particular, encourage local regenerative and healthy forms of food and energy production.  Specifically for the regenerative/intentional/ecovillage/permaculture movements, support three outcomes:  Make it easy to transact within the network as well as with bodies outside of the&nbsp;network.  Make it easy to expand the movement and better share the resources coming into the&nbsp;network.  For people who want to join or create regenerative communities, make it easier to do so through this unified economic structure.  <p>The initial hypothesis for the Sufficiency Currency is that there are three important measures that a group of communities would want to look at in order to meet&nbsp;the</p> Market Research: How Does It Really&nbsp;Look? <p>In September-November of 2020, I traveled to a number of Ecovillages in Italy, Slovenia and Spain, to discuss my vision and understand what they really need in terms of their interactions among themselves and with their neighboring communities who may or may not be ecovillages.</p><p>The first thing I realized was that there are quite a few community currency and cryptocurrency projects trying to push their ideas into ecovillages. There are some isolated examples of successful community currency attempts within the intentional community movement, and dozens, if not hundreds of failure stories. The communities themselves are quite aware that they don’t need an alternative monetary currency to function. They are also aware that using monetary and trade based currency doesn’t reflect their values. Finally, these people are busy and they don’t have a lot of spare time for currency experiments. Usually there are one or two people who are responsible for anything that would require a computer. Others have computers and phones, but they are highly disinterested in activities that would require any serious amount of time in front of a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>The most gratifying find was that the kind of pooling proposed in the Sufficiency Currency project does appeal to the ecovillages. It would have to be very easy to manage, but they are already managing multiple interactions in their vicinity, and systematizing that is of interest. In fact, the same kind of thinking process has come from some of the national ecovillage support networks, but it hasn’t been a priority, nor is it really within the core competencies of the coordination networks for intentional communities.</p><p>All of the communities have some form of trade with the other communities in the area. Depending on the location, they might be interacting with local farms and businesses, cooperatives, or other ecovillages. The agreements look different among different entities, but in general there is a looser type of trade than you would see between businesses. For example, at one ecovillage the nearby town flooded and they went down to help out, taking the volunteers with them and neglecting their harvesting work for a couple of days. There was no formal trade — it was just helping people out — and at the same time, they know that this will be helpful for them when it comes to their needs vis-à-vis the municipal government. Similarly, they had an informal agreement with a local agricultural cooperative, where they were helping with the farm work in return for some produce, but they were giving it a try for a year before they came to any formal agreement. The assumption of cooperation and reciprocation was more important than the specifics of the&nbsp;deal.</p> Designing the&nbsp;Currency <p>Designing the “representables”, or currency, for the communities is like designing any product. The first step is to get clear on the problems the community wants to solve. The way they described their problems were mostly in terms of overwhelm:</p>  Every contract needs to be negotiated separately and the documentation is scattered.  The negotiation takes a lot of&nbsp;time.  Different parties have different ideas of fairness, and fairness isn’t necessarily expressed in monetary&nbsp;value.  Some items are truly scarce, while some are abundant, and monetary exchange doesn’t help them identify that type of value or seek solutions.  Depending on the type of organization, the terms of business are different. If it’s another ecovillage, it’s a very different type of relationship than if it’s just a nearby village that doesn’t belong to the regenerative agriculture movement.  <p>When translated into measurable currencies that can be represented in software, the Sufficiency Currency would aim, firstly, to create an easy-to-use interface for putting together contacts between two entities. Secondly, the dashboard would include the following measures:</p>  Fairness. Although fairness is subjective, it’s probably the most important measure to maintain for long-term relationships. For a sustainable network of ecovillages, it’s important for the members to feel the other group is dealing fairly with&nbsp;them.  Scarcity and abundance. Some items are scarce, for example, the number of trucks that are available. A good representation might be dark or light colors, or thickness of a line. Others are abundance, for example, squash in the summer. Even if the trade is fair, some things might wear out over time while others are easily replenished. Representing the scarcity or abundance of something in the communities allows people to identify joint problems to solve. For example, if there aren’t enough trucks, perhaps they would train some community members to repair and assemble trucks from spare parts. One of the main functions of the currency is to help the communities take joint&nbsp;action.  Reputation. Reputation would be a multi-dimensional measure that allows communities to get information about one another, such as how ecologically conscious one community is, whether they have traded fairly in the past, etc. The reputation measures need to be developed over&nbsp;time.  <p>The three measures above are a start for creating an alternative to monetary trading. The goal over time will be to have the communities simply share both their resources and their challenges to grow over time as a movement.</p>

<p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro kit you can ship to a remote location and then control from your studio. You can use this to ship a remote interview kit to someone where all they have to do is plug in a few connections and you'll be able to control everything remotely!</p>

<p></p>

<p>The overall idea is you'll ship out an ATEM Mini Pro (or ISO), a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K (or any other camera, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled by the ATEM!), and a Raspberry Pi. The guest will connect the Raspberry Pi to their home network, connect the camera's HDMI to the ATEM, turn everything on, and you'll immediately be able to control the remote end yourself!</p>

<p>The remote ATEM can then stream to any streaming service directly, or if you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9OTROesp0">Streaming Bridge</a>, you can get a high quality video feed of the remote guest brought directly into your studio!</p>

 Devices Used in this Tutorial 

 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2LUZntd">ATEM Mini Pro</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3nURgKu">ATEM Mini Pro ISO</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lwar0g">GL.iNet AR750S Travel Router</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38RrySV">Raspberry Pi 4</a> (a <a href="https://amzn.to/39ELjMD">Pi 3</a> will also work, but they aren't that much cheaper anyway) 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/2N8c1FP">MicroSD Card</a> for the Raspberry Pi, I like the 32gb A2 cards 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/3swb22v">USB Ethernet adapter</a> to get an additional ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/3bLCR0X">Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K</a> (any camera will do, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled remotely too!) 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38PXY04">Blackmagic Streaming Bridge</a> to receive the remote ATEM video feed in your studio 
 

 Set up the Studio Side 

<p>We'll start with setting up the studio side of the system. This is where your computer to control the remote ATEM will be, and this end will have the VPN server. If you have a Streaming Bridge, it would be on this end as well in order to receive the streaming video feed from the remote ATEM.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First we're going to set up the GL.iNet router as a Wireguard server.</p>

<p>Plug your computer in to one of the two ethernet ports on the right, or connect to its WiFi hotspot. There's a sticker on the bottom showing the default wifi name and password as well as the IP address of the router. (It's probably <code>192.168.8.1</code>).</p>

<p>Open that address in your browser and it will prompt you to set up an admin password. Make sure you keep that somewhere safe like a password manager.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up Internet Access for the Travel Router 

<p>The first thing we need to do is get internet access set up on this router. You'll definitely want to hardwire this in to your studio network rather than use wifi. Plug an ethernet cord from your main router in the studio to the port on the left. Once that's connected, the admin dashboard should pop up a section to configure the wired connection. You can use DHCP to get it on your network. Eventually you'll want to give this device a fixed IP address by going into your main router and setting a static DHCP lease. The specifics of that will depend on your own router so I'll leave that up to you to look up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my case the travel router's IP address is 10.10.12.102.</p>

 Configure the Wireguard Server 

<p>Now we're ready to set up the travel router as a Wireguard server. Wireguard is relatively new VPN software that is a lot faster and easier to use compared to older VPN software like OpenVPN. It's conveniently already built in to the travel router as well, making it an excellent option for this.</p>

<p>Go to the VPN menu on the side and expand it to reveal the Wireguard Server tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click "Initialize Wireguard Server" and you'll be able to set it up. Enable the "Allow Access Local Network" toggle, and change the "Local IP" to <code>172.16.55.1</code>. (It doesn't really matter what IP range you use for the Wireguard interface, but this address is unlikely to conflict with your existing network.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can click "Start", and then go into the "Management" tab.</p>

<p>Click the big "Add a New User" button. Give it a name like "RemoteATEM". This will create a config for it which you'll use to set up the remote side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the icon under "Configurations" and click the "Plain Text" tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that text into a text editor (not Word or Google Docs!). We're going to make a few changes to make it look like the below.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>We don't want the ATEM to send the video feed over the VPN, so change the AllowedIPs line to: <code>172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24</code>. If it's set to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> then all the traffic on the remote end will be funneled through your VPN server and your studio's internet connection. That's usually what you want when you're using a VPN for privacy, but we don't want to add latency to sending the video feed if you're streaming from the remote end to YouTube directly. The IP address in the <code>Endpoint =</code> line is the public IP address of your studio network, so make sure you leave that line alone. You can remove the <code>DNS =</code> line since we aren't routing all network traffic through the VPN. Make sure you keep the PrivateKey and PublicKey that your router generated though!</p>

<p>This next part is the magic that makes it work. The key here is we need to let other devices on the WireGuard server end access devices on the LAN side of the WireGuard client. The ATEM will be behind the WireGuard client (described in the next section), the ATEM itself wouldn't normally be visible to other things on the Wireguard server side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the most complicated step. You'll need to edit a text file on the router by connecting to it via ssh. Open Terminal on a mac, or PuTTY on Windows.</p>

 <code>ssh root@192.168.8.1
</code> 

<p>The root ssh password is the same admin password you created when you first set up the router. (You won't see your keystrokes as you're typing your password.)</p>

<p>You'll need a text editor to edit the file. If you're familiar with <code>vi</code>, it's already installed. If you want something easier to use, then you can install <code>nano</code>.</p>

 <code>opkg update
opkg install nano
</code> 

<p>Now you can edit the file using nano:</p>

 <code>nano /etc/config/wireguard_server
</code> 

<p>Navigate to the bottom of the file and add this line:</p>

 <code>        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>The file should now look something like the below</p>

 <code>config servers
        option local_port '51820'
        option local_ipv6 'fd00:db8:0:abc::1'
        option private_key '&lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option public_key '&lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option access 'ACCEPT'
        option local_ip '172.16.55.1'
        option enable '1'

config peers 'wg_peer_9563'
        option name 'RemoteATEM'
        option client_key '&lt;CLIENT PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option private_key '&lt;CLIENT PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option client_ip '172.16.55.2/32'
        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>To save and exit, press control X, and press Y and enter when prompted. You'll need to reboot this device once this is set up, so click the "reboot" button in the top right corner of the admin panel.</p>

 Set Up Port Forwarding 

<p>The last step on the studio side is to set up port forwarding from your studio router to forward port 51820 to the IP address of the WireGuard server. This is what will let the remote end be able to connect to your studio VPN. How you do this will depend on what router you use in your studio. Most routers will have a web interface to configure them which will let you set up port forwarding rules.</p>

<p>You'll need to know the IP address of your studio router as well as the IP address of the travel router. Create a port forwarding rule to forward port 51820 to your travel router's IP address.</p>

<p>For example, this is what it looks like in my Unifi router to create the forwarding rule.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alright, we're set on this end! You now have a WireGuard server accessible from outside of your network! If you're curious to keep experimenting with WireGuard, you can even set up your mobile phone or laptop as a WireGuard client so that you can connect back to your studio on the go!</p>

<p>Next, we're ready to set up the remote end for the ATEM Mini Pro.</p>

 Set up the Remote Side for the ATEM 

<p>The remote kit side will have the ATEM Mini Pro, the camera, and the WireGuard client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the WireGuard client powers on, it will connect to your studio network and make the ATEM Mini acessible from your studio network.</p>

<p>I want to preface this section by saying I tried really hard to make this work with another GL.iNet router, but ran into a few blockers before switching to using a Raspberry Pi. As such, this step is a lot more involved and requires quite a bit more command line work than I would like. If you are reading this and happen to know how to do this with the GL.iNet router instead, I would be very interested in hearing it! Feel free to get in touch with details!</p>

 Install Raspberry Pi OS 

<p>The first thing to do is burn the Raspberry Pi OS image to a MicroSD card. Download the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> app, and go through the steps of installing the Raspberry Pi OS. If you're comfortable on the command line, you can use the "lite" version which doesn't include the desktop environment. I prefer this since I'm never going to be connecting a monitor to this anyway after the first round of setup.</p>

<p>After the card is created, stick it in the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. You'll need a keyboard and monitor connected to set things up the first time. You'll also want to make sure the Raspberry Pi has an internet connection, so plug in an ethernet cord to the ethernet port on the Pi into your home router.</p>

 Install WireGuard 

<p>It looks like in the near future, WireGuard will be included by default in Raspberry Pi OS, so first check if it's already there by typing <code>which wg</code>, and if it shows you a path like <code>/usr/bin/wg</code> then you can skip this step since it's already installed!</p>

<p>If you need to install WireGuard, you can install it from the "testing" packages by running these commands:</p>

 <code>echo "deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian testing main" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wireguard
</code> 

<p>Now when you run <code>which wg</code> you should see that it's installed.</p>

 WireGuard Setup 

<p>Remember that big block of text you created in the previous step? It's time to use it! You'll need to paste that into the WireGuard configuration file on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code> 

<p>Paste in the full contents of the configuration replacing anything that is already in that file if any.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>Save and quit by pressing control X, then Y and enter when prompted.</p>

 Turn the Raspberry Pi into a Router 

<p>The Raspberry Pi will be sharing its internet connection with the ATEM Mini, so it's time to turn it into a router! (This is the reason I wanted to use a travel router instead, because this step is already done in that case.)</p>

<p>First, plug in the USB ethernet adapter to one of the USB ports, and connect an ethernet cable from that to the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up that ethernet device. Edit the file using the command below:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1
</code> 

<p>Paste in the following text exactly as written:</p>

 <code>auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.5.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
</code> 

<p>This creates a new network on the Raspberry Pi which will be the private network for the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>We're going to set up a few more things first, then eventually reboot the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server firewalld
</code> 

<p>Now edit the DHCP server config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
</code> 

<p>You'll need to set the <code>domain-name</code> and <code>domain-name-servers</code> as follows:</p>

 <code>option domain-name "rpi.local";
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the bottom and add the following lines as well:</p>

 <code>subnet 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.5.100 192.168.5.200;
        option routers 192.168.5.1;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
}
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Next, open the <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
</code> 

<p>Add <code>eth1</code> to the <code>INTERFACESv4</code> line and save the file.</p>

 <code>INTERFACESv4="eth1"
INTERFACESv6=""
</code> 

<p>Now we can set up the firewall to allow this traffic through and enable IP masquerading.</p>

 <code>sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-masquerade --permanent
</code> 

<p>Lastly, we'll tell the WireGuard client to start up on boot by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
</code> 

<p>Finally, we're ready to reboot the Raspberry Pi and see if it all works!</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>With any luck, the Raspberry Pi will boot up and connect to your WireGuard server and everything will be working!</p>

<p>On the Raspberry Pi, you should be able to type <code>sudo wg</code> to see the status of the WireGuard client. If it worked, you'll see the endpoint you're connected to as well as a "latest handshake" and some transfer stats showing how much data has gone over the VPN.</p>

<p></p>

 Let's Try it Out! 

<p>With everything up and running, it's time to try to connect to your ATEM! You'll need to find or set the IP address of the ATEM on the remote side. You can try out <code>192.168.5.100</code> since it will be the first device that the DHCP server sees, or you can connect your ATEM over USB and use the ATEM Setup app to find the address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Of course, to really put it to the test, you'll want to unplug from USB and see if you can connect from your laptop through the VPN.</p>

<p>Remember, at this point your laptop running the ATEM Software Control app should be connected to your travel router either over wifi or ethernet. Your ATEM Mini is the remote end, and that's connected to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Open the ATEM Software Control app and type in the ATEM's IP address under "Manual IP Address". (It won't be able to auto-discover it on the network since it's going over a VPN.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have a Blackmagic camera connected to the ATEM, you'll be able to control it from the Camera tab since it's connected to the ATEM via HDMI! No networking stuff to worry about there.</p>

 Using the Streaming Bridge 

<p>Now you're ready to choose where to stream! The remote ATEM can stream directly to YouTube if that's how you're using it. Because of the way we set up WireGuard, the ATEM will use the remote end's internet connection rather than sending the video through the VPN and out of your studio. That saves a hop and will give you better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to stream to your Streaming Bridge, that should "just work" by using the local IP address of the Streaming Bridge. Connect the Streaming Bridge to your travel router, then open the ATEM Setup app to find its IP address. In my case it's <code>192.168.8.127</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and choose "Local network with key". It's a "local network" because it's going over the VPN. The nice thing about doing it this way is you don't have to set up port forwarding in your studio's router to the bridge, since it will all happen over the VPN!</p>

<p>Next click the "External ATEM Mini Pro" tab to export the configuration file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You'll need to make one change in the file since the normal local network discovery that it does won't work over the VPN. Open the xml file in a text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, and replace the URL with the IP address of your Streaming Bridge, for example:</p>

 <code>&lt;servers&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;rtmp://192.168.8.127:1935/app&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/servers&gt;
</code> 

<p>Now you can load that config file in the ATEM Software Control from the "Stream" menu in the top menu bar, and you'll have a new streaming destination to choose!</p>

<p></p>

 Recording Locally 

<p>If you also ship a USB drive plugged in to the remote ATEM, you can record the program locally as a backup! If you use a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, you can even tell the camera itself to record a high quality video to an SD card or SSD in the camera itself!</p>

<p>And that's it! Hopefully all of this worked for you. If you have any trouble, feel free to post a question on the <a href="https://forum.livevideotech.today/c/support/5">Live Video Tech</a> forums to get some assistance!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-leads-social-media-companies.html">According to CNBC</a>,
Facebook made $7.89 in revenue per average global user in the 3rd quarter last year (with a high of
$39.63 in the US and Canada, and a low of $2.22 outside US, Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific).</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB">According to Yahoo! Finance</a> and my calculation, if
its expenses in the same quarter were $13.4 billion, expense per user was  $13.4 / $21.5 * $7.89 = $4.92
on average (proportionally allocated given expense / revenue ratio).</p>
<p>Revenue per user is obviously quite different in different parts of the world, but what about costs?
It seems to me that on a per-user-basis, selling and serving all those ads in the US and Canada that led
to so much revenue per user is probably more expensive, compared to some places that have less commerce.
But as dramatically different as $39.63 and $2.22 on the revenue side? I don’t think so. Not even close.</p>
<p>In other words, users in the rest of the world at $2.22 of revenue per user are almost certainly
not profitable. Even if expenses there were only half of average, it would still not be enough.</p>
<p>Of course these numbers are averages across the regions, and chances are that the differences between users
within one region are also quite striking. I don’t have numbers on those. But I would bet that some
users in the US and Canada also bring in less revenue than the $4.92 in average cost per user.</p>
<p>Who would those unprofitable users be in the US, say? Well, those demographics
and those neighborhoods in the social graph in which advertisers see little opportunities to make a sale,
because, for example, everybody is unemployed and angry.</p>
<p>(So if, for example, a certain presidential campaign came by and wanted to specifically target this
demographic with political ads … I for one can vividly imagine the leap of joy of some Facebook business guy
who finally saw how to get promoted: “I turned a million users from being a cost center to being
a profit center”. And democracy be damned. Of course, I’m speculating here, but directionally I don’t
think I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>Which suggests another strategy to unseat Facebook as the dominant social network: focus on picking off the
users that generate the most revenue for Facebook, as they subsidize the rest. If that relatively small
subset of users jumped ship, the rest of the business would become unprofitable.</p>
<p>(I jotting this down because I hadn’t seen anybody suggest this strategy. We do need to find ways
of ending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> after all.)</p>

<p>This modular cage allows you to stack <a href="https://geni.us/f2B4y">Blackmagic Bidirectional SDI/HDMI 3G Converters</a> on a desk or behind other gear.</p>

<p>The design is composed of four parts: the main shelf, the top shelf, a top plate that sits on top of the top shelf, and an optional angled base. The angled base plate lets you mount the whole stack on top of rack gear that's mounted at a 9° angle, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk">StarTech 8U desktop rack</a>. You can print as many of the main shelves as you need to stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk"></a></p>



<p>The shelves are designed so that the converters can slip in from one side with enough of a gap on top to be able to insert and remove them even after a stack is assembled.</p>

<p>If you'd like, you can glue the stack together to make a solid structure. Otherwise the pegs are long enough that the stack is reasonably stable even without glue.</p>

A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a> a standardized specification that provides a mechanism to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.  <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/103_1_2020/">CAN/CIOSC 103–1:2020 Digital Trust And Identity — Part 1</a> specifies minimum requirements and a set of controls for creating and maintaining trust in digital systems and services that, as part of an organization’s mandate, assert and or consume identity and credentials in data pertaining to people and Organizations.  <p>Admittedly, I am writing this for the Canadian context (as the third choice is Canadian-only, so insert your own national or international standard here), but the main reasons I have chosen these three is because they represent a new way forward to develop a digital ecosystem that is open, inclusive, and balanced in favour towards the individual.</p><p>I realize that there are many more standards at play, but it is my belief that it is these three that will enable trusted digital identity across many ecosystems — across industries and across political boundaries.</p><p>That’s my start for&nbsp;2021!</p>

<p>My superpower has always been finding new uses for old tech. In the late 90s I dusted off the venerable NNTP server, which had been the backbone of the Usenet, and turned it into my team’s Slack. In the late 2000s I used iCalendar to make citywide event calendars. In the late 2010s I went deep into SQL.</p>
<p>It’s always intensely pragmatic. But also, I can’t deny, whimsical.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I offer you the public pay phone at the Pinnacles Visitor Center. I stayed in that campground on a road trip just before the election. Given the tense political and epidemiological situation, I’d promised to message home regularly. There was no cell service in the park so I headed over to the office. It was closed, so I sat on the bench and connected to their WiFi. Or tried to. You could connect, sometimes, but you couldn’t move any data. The router was clearly in need of a reboot.</p>
<p>The only option left was the public phone. I can’t remember the last time I used one. Most people alive today have, perhaps, never used one. But there it was, so I gave it a shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time, you could pick up the handset, dial 0 for operator, and place a so-called collect (charge-reversed) call. Now dialing 0 gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>The instructions taped to the phone (in the 90s I’m guessing) say you can call an 800 number, or use a calling card. I remember calling cards, I had one once. Not a thing lately.</p>
<p>And then there was this: “Dial 611 for help.”</p>
<p>Me: 611</p>
<p>611: Hello, this is Steve.</p>
<p>Me: I’m at the Pinnacles Visitor Center trying to send a message.</p>
<p>Steve: Use the WiFi.</p>
<p>Me: I can’t, it’s broken.</p>
<p>Steve: Huh, that’s interesting. Let me see if I can reboot the router.</p>
<p>And he did. So there you have it. The public phone still provides a valuable service. Its mission has evolved over the years. Nowadays, it exists to summon Steve the IT guy who can fix the WiFi by turning it off and on again. </p>
<p>Works like a charm!</p>

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm. The work is happening in places like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, to name a&nbsp;few.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">Learn Concepts: Web of Trust 101</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>If you've been putting off setting aside some time to learn about OAuth, now is your chance!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've helped thousands of developers learn about OAuth by hosting live workshops in person, online events through O'Reilly and Okta, as well as by publishing videos on YouTube! I'm super thrilled to announce that I just finished packaging up the workshop and have launched it as a new course, "<a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0</a>"!</p>

<p>The course is 3.5 hours of video content, quizzes, as well as interactive exercises with a guided learning tool to get you quickly up to speed on OAuth, OpenID Connect, PKCE, best practices, and tips for protecting APIs with OAuth.</p>

<p>The course is <a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">available now on Udemy</a>, and if your company has a Udemy for Business subscription you can find it there as well! If you download the app, you can even sync the video course to a mobile device to watch everything offline!</p>

<p><a href="http://oauth.wtf/course"></a></p>

<p>The exercises in the course will walk you through the various OAuth flows to set up an OAuth server, get an access token, use a refresh token, and learn the user's name and email with OpenID Connect. You can see a sneak peek of the tool that interactively helps you debug your apps at <a href="https://oauth.school/">oauth.school</a>.</p>

 Free OAuth Videos 

<p>I've also got a bunch of videos about OAuth available on YouTube for you to watch at any time! Take a look at my <a href="https://oauth.net/videos/">curated playlist of videos</a> where you'll find everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td00HpMI3Q8">live sketch notes</a> of a conversation about PKCE and OAuth security, to a description of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espX8qKjywI">OAuth phishing</a>, to&nbsp;details on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHzERullHe8">why you shouldn't use the implicit flow</a>.</p>

This means that websites and applications that are protected by Oracle can enable their audience of users to authenticate with FIDO2 authenticators for multi-factor authentication (MFA) as well as passwordless authentication. This simplifies the user experience and may reduce the number of authenticators that users need to access the variety of web applications they interact with on a regular basis.

It defines the rules for all stakeholders and enables legally binding relationships with the combination of governance frameworks, which are built on top of trust frameworks.</p><p>But before we dive deeper into the part of the trust infrastructure, we need to understand the core components and the different types of identity architecture first.</p> Core components of identity architecture <p>There are three core components within an identity system, which in general mainly manage relationships. These are identifiers enabling the means for “remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship” <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">as explained by Phil Windley</a>. In the case of SSI, these are decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which are created by a controller, which might be a person, organization or software system. Controllers can use different authentication factors, which according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the level of assurance for eIDAS (CEF DIGITAL)</a>, can be possession-based factors (e.g. hardware), knowledge-based factors (e.g. keys or passwords) or inherent factors (e.g. biometrics like a fingerprint). Oftentimes a combination of different authentication factors is used to demonstrate the authority of an identifier.</p>Architectural types of identity systems; Image adapted, original by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil&nbsp;Windley</a><p>Phil Windley distinguishes between administrative, algorithmic and autonomic systems, which are illustrated in the image above. We are of course quite familiar with administrative systems such as e-mail, mobile or social network services. Algorithmic systems in contrast leverage some sort of distributed ledger as verified data registry to register a public key / decentralized identifier on a ledger. This gives the controller more sovereignty of the identifier among other perks. However, due to privacy concerns, keys or identifiers of individuals should not be stored on a publicly accessible database. Hence, autonomic identity architecture was developed to enable the “controller to use her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably [sic] sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log” as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil Windley states</a>. Current SSI implementations tend to use a combination of algorithmic and autonomic architecture.</p> Governance frameworks <p>The <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/governance.html">Business Dictionary</a> defines governance as the “establishment of policies, and continuous monitoring of their proper implementation, by the members of the governing body.” It includes the mechanisms required to balance powers and defines their primary duties to enhance the prosperity and viability of the organization. The objective for governance entities is to ensure the alignment of involved stakeholders, the definition of the implementation and the processes and use-cases executed on top of it. The purpose of a governance framework is to define the different stakeholders, determine their rights and duties as well as defining the policies under which the network is operated. Therefore, it serves as a legal foundation for the operation of the particular network. It consists of several legal documents, which are published by the governing authority.</p><p>The governance of the network (the verifiable data registry also referred to as ledger or trust anchor) itself is only a small part of the total governance required. According to the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) foundation</a> there are four layers, which require an adapted governance framework matching the needs of the particular layer.</p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Stack; Image source: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a><p>As illustrated in the figure above, the Trust over IP stack is not only separated in layers, but also in technical and governance stacks within the layers. The stack is indented to provide the certainty for higher levels that the underlying ones can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Layer one includes the verifiable data registries, which can be implemented on different technology frameworks. The Sovrin Foundation is an example of a governance authority, which published a <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-%20content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V2.pdf">governance framework for layer one</a>. Other public utilities include <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and <a href="https://bedrockconsortium.org/">Bedrock</a> among others. While the mentioned networks align their efforts particularly to the ToIP stack there are countless others, which can be used as a public utility as the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID specification registry</a> discloses. These range from generic public permissionless networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin to networks with permissioned write access, which serve a particular use-case.</p><p>Tim Bouma (Senior policy analyst for identity management at the treasury board secretariat of Canada) does not see the need of the government to build and operate a verifiable data registry and highlights the importance of a plurality of operators. However, he points out that the involvement and participation of governments is crucial in defining how the infrastructure is used and relied on as stated in a <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">personal interview</a>.</p>DID methods as specified in the W3C DID specification registry.<p>The second layer describes the communication between agents. Within the ToIP stack, this communication is indented to be executed via a hybrid of an algorithmic and atomic architecture such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec">peer DIDs</a> or KERI implementations of self-certifying identifiers as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-%20identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">described by Ph.D. Samuel M. Smith</a>. This means that publicly resolvable DIDs are used for public entities and private peer DIDs for individuals. The following illustration provided by <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> provides an overview of these interactions.</p>SSI interactions and the usage of public and peer DIDs; Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a><p>However, not all SSI implementations use peer DIDs. For instance, the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/essif-the-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-4572f6875e12">ESSIF</a>-MVP1 does not currently use peer DIDs but might add them later as deemed appropriate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Specification+%282%29+-+DID+Modelling">technical specification of DID modelling</a>. Hence, the same type of DID is used for both issuer and holder. The governing authority of layer two is highly dependent on the communication protocols used by the implementation in question. For implementations, which use peer DIDs according to the DIDcomm protocol the governing entity is the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDcomm working group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Both layer one and layer two define technical or rather cryptographic trust, in contrast to layer three and four, which define human&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Layer three protocols support the exchange of data such as verified credentials with different types of signatures, which enable a holder to create verifiable presentations as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md">ToIP Aries-RFC</a>. It states that one of the goals of the ToIP Foundation is “to standardize all supported credential exchange protocols so that any ToIP-compatible agent, wallet, and secure data store can work with any other agent, wallet, and secure data store.” An issuer can issue any set of claims to any holder, which can then prove them to any verifier. The verifier can decide, which issuers and which claims it&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Layer four of the stack defines the rules for a particular digital trust ecosystem such as healthcare, finance, food products, education etc. These are led by a governance authority, which already exists or is established for this particular purpose. It consists of a variety of different stakeholders such as business entities, government agencies, individuals or other interested parties. These ecosystem frameworks also define the semantics of verified credentials. The semantic of a verified credential defines, which attributes are part of it and their meaning in the particular context. If you want to join an existing ecosystem or want to know more about their work you can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">public ToIP confluence documentary hub&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Trust frameworks <p>A trust framework sets the overall legal framework for digital interactions. These trust frameworks are technology agnostic and are uniquely adapted to the jurisdiction they serve. They set the rules for the recognition of electronic identification and authentication and specify the requirements to achieve a certain level of assurance (LoA).</p><p>The combination of the different governance frameworks as illustrated in the ToIP stack is sometimes also referred to as trust framework. However, jurisdictions have their own requirements for electronic authentication, which serve as the underlying trust framework. In the case of Europe, the eIDAS regulation clearly defines the requirements for authentication factors to achieve a certain level of assurance. For instance, to achieve the LoA substantial, two factors are necessary. According to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview%20=%2F40044784%2F40044786%2FGuidance+on+Levels+of+Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the LoA</a> published by the CEF Digital, one out of the two factors needs to be&nbsp;either:</p><blockquote>I) a presentation of an identity document or <br>II) verification of the possession of evidence representing the claimed identity recognized by a member state or <br>III) a previous procedure executed by the same member state not related to the issuance of electronic identification, which provides the equivalent assurance or <br>IV) presenting a valid notified electronic identification mean with the LoA substantial or&nbsp;high.</blockquote><p>While these requirements can in theory also be defined in a governance framework, the incorporation of such requirements into statutory law facilitates the creation and enforcement of legally binding relationships. Hence, existing statutory law (or case-law depending on the jurisdiction) needs to be incorporated by different governance frameworks to achieve a holistic approach and enforce legal liability.</p><p>According to Tim Bouma as one of the main contributor to the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) these frameworks intertwine and complement each other <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">as stated in a personal interview</a>. He suggests that policymakers have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts to evaluate if they have the right concepts to build out a suitable framework and regulation. The PCTF “is not a ‘standard’ as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria. It’s a tool to help assess a digital identity program that puts into effect the relevant legislation, policy, regulation, and agreements between parties.” <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_1/PSP-PCTF-V1.1-Consultation-Draft.pdf">PCTF&nbsp;V1.1</a></p><p>While the eIDAS regulation itself aims to be technology agnostic there are some aspects, which complicate the adherence of the regulation for SSI implementations. However, this is a topic for its own article. In the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2020-04/SSI_eIDAS_legal_report_final_0.pdf">eIDAS SSI legal report</a>, Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo describes the potential shift of the eIDAS regulation as trust framework on Page 22 as followed: „Adopting the SSI principles imply, generally speaking, an increased complexity in trust management and a shifting from hierarchical or federated trust assurance frameworks (…) to network-based socio- reputational trust models or accumulative trust assurance frameworks that use quantifiable methods to aggregate trust on claims and digital identities.” Hence, we can already observe the suggestions and considerations to adapt the regulation to suit new innovative solutions.</p> Key takeaways:   Governance frameworks and trust frameworks need to be combined to form a holistic approach.  Governance frameworks of SSI implementations need to respect the requirements and specifications of trust frameworks of the jurisdiction in which use-cases with regulatory obligations are carried&nbsp;out.  Regulators need to evaluate existing regulations concerning electronic identification and authentication and their suitability with new identity architecture.  Governments should engage with the public sector to collaboratively explore the requirements for a legally binding trust infrastructure.  <p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>My friend <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/">Amy Guy</a> is
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">running for election</a>
on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C TAG</a>
(Technical Architecture Group).
The TAG is an unusual group that sets a lot of the direction of the
future of standards that you and I use everyday on the web.
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">Read their statement on running</a>,
and if you can, ie if you're one of those unusual people labeled
as "AC Representative", please consider
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/tagelect-2020/">voting for them</a>.
(Due to the nature of the W3C's organizational and funding structure,
only paying W3C Members tend to qualify... if you know you're working
for an organization that has paying membership to the W3C, find out
who the AC rep is and strongly encourage them to vote for Amy.)</p>
<p>So, why vote for Amy?
Quite simply, they're running on a platform of putting the needs of
users first.
Despite all the good intents and ambitions of those who have done
founding work in these spaces, this perspective tends to get
increasingly pushed to the wayside as engineers are pressured to shift
their focus on the needs of their immediate employers and large
implementors.
I'm not saying that's bad; sometimes this even does help advance the
interest of users too, but... well we all know the ways in which it
can end up not doing so.
And I don't know about you, but the internet and the web have felt an
awful lot at times like they've been slipping from those early ideals.
Amy's platform shares in a growing zeitgeist (sadly, still in the
wispiest of stages) of thinking and reframing from the perspective of
user empowerment, privacy, safety, agency, autonomy.
Amy's platform reminds me of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8890">RFC 8890: The Internet Is For End Users</a>.
That's a perspective shift we desperately need right now... for the
internet and the web both.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for the philosophical-alignment angle.
But what about the "Technical" letter in TAG?
Amy's standing there is rock-solid.
And I know because I've had the pleasure of working side-by-side
with Amy on several standards (including
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, of which we are
co-authors.</p>
<p>Several times I watched with amazement as Amy and I talked about some
changes we thought were necessary and Amy just got in the zone, this
look of intense hyperfocus (really, someone should record the Amy Spec
Editing Zone sometime, it's quite a thing to see), and they refactored
huge chunks of the spec to match our discussion.
And Amy knows, and deeply cares, about so many aspects of the W3C's
organization and structure.</p>
<p>So, if you can vote for, or know how to get your organization to vote
for, an AC rep... well, I mean do what you want I guess, but if you
want someone who will help... for great justice, vote Amy Guy to the
W3C TAG!</p>
