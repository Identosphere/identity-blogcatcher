    My advice about using AI is simple: use AI as an assistant, not an expert, and use it judiciously. Some people will object, “but AI can be wrong!” Yes, and so can the internet in general, but no one now recommends avoiding online resources because they can be wrong. They recommend taking it all with a grain of salt and being careful. That’s what you should do with AI help as well.

<p>Ever since <a href="https://micro.blog/gregmorris">@gregmorris</a> launched Micro Social on the unsuspecting world of Micro Blog - been truly impressed not just by the functionality - but the design sensibility.</p>
<p>On functionality, I particularly like the reblog function which I was wondering about today .. as in what if I reblogged a reply. And it just worked - because of course it did.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing … when I post - it gets syndicated - and with the syndication comes different conversations in different spaces. ( for me - for now - federation good, but not really the time - nor the inclination TBH - to merge it all together - partly because those spaces are - and react - differently )</p>
<p>That said - sometimes a conversation breaks out here on Micro blog - with some great comments - and they sit - isolated - sad.</p>
<p>No longer ..</p>
<p>I can now reblog a comment in a thread - that gets pushed out as a new post which in turn is itself syndicated - so someone over in one of the other spaces can now see the occasional  pearls and then come on over and have another look. #GameChanging</p>

 出典）デジタル庁 - GビズID&nbsp;<a href="https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/">https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/</a>   <br>  <br>  GビズIDについてはこれまでもOpenIDファウンデーションジャパンのイベント等に古くは経産省、デジタル庁へ移管されてからはデジタル庁の方々にお越しいただき技術仕様やトラストフレームワークについてご発表いただいてきました。  <br> <blockquote> OpenID Summit Tokyo 2020 - 2020/1/24  <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2020/">https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2020/</a>  <br>  OpenID BizDay #14 - 2021/1/27  <a

href="https://openid.connpass.com/event/341152">https://openid.connpass.com/event/341152</a>/ </blockquote> <br>  GビズIDについて  簡単に言うと、GビズIDは企業の代表や従業員などが当該の企業に所属していることを表し、例えば補助金の申請などの行政手続きをオンラインで実施することを可能にするためのID基盤ですね。  そのためには当然、当該の企業が実在していること、そしてGビズIDを利用する代表者や従業員が当該企業と適切に関係しており所属していることを保証していくことが重要です。  <br>  ここは非常に重要な一方でまだまだ課題も多く、例えば現状は法人の実在性について法務局の発行する印鑑証明書や個人事業主の場合は市町村の発行する印鑑登録証明書を使うことで確認することになりますが、アカウントライフサイクルは各利用企業側に任せるしかないという状況があったりします。  <br>  <br>  法人共通認証基盤の必要性  この考え方は何も日本だけで必要とされているわけではなく、海外においても同様の要求はあるわけです。OpenID FoundationのeKYC and Identity Assurance Working Groupでは個人の本人確認がどのようにIdentity Providerで実施されたかという情報をRelying Partyへ伝達するためのOpenID Connect for Identity Assurance（最近<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/10/openid-connect-for-identity-assurance.html">正式化</a>されましたね！）に加えて、個人が法人とどのような関係性にあるのかを表現するためのAuthority Claims Extensionの開発を進めています。この辺りは日本のOpenIDファウンデーションジャパンのKYC WGの参加メンバーの方々とも協力して国際標準への道筋をうまく作っていきたいところです。  <br>  参考）eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group  <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/</a>  <br>  <br>  GビズIDのアップデート概要  こう言うのは更新履歴を見ていくのが重要ですね。  デジタル庁が公開している<a href="https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/system_guide/system_guide.html">システム連携ガイド</a>を見ると技術仕様を含め確認ができるので、こちらの更新履歴を見てみましょう。なお、現在「行政サービス向け」のシステム連携ガイドが公開されていますが、そもそも現状のGビズIDは民間サービスとの連携を許可していません。それにもかかわらず行政サービス向け、と明記されているのは今後の民間サービスへの展開を見据えてのことなのかな、、と期待が膨らみますね。  <br>  早速更新履歴を見ていきましょう。すでにバージョン2.3なんですね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgfQ4z2xiw7RimXDuUduRLk52_I3QL1udr7Lw8POjhlX6To4uNA8mfVsx8UPXG_5trbmH0bGelS7lm_Y1g_aZQSEZ8YR3JjUInw0At1RuTG3Zxdx6VpqD_TkRbb82l0xO_pZ_F6SNzE20kFfH4laWiWZ4tiBOoduiShBbv-I71BSwKNuTNBFO0bpHFzQohG"></a>    <a

<br><br>  結構更新が多いです。さすが大型アップデートです。  <br>  個人的に関心が高かったのは、以下の２点です。    アカウント種別に管理者（GビズIDメンバー（管理者））が増えた  GビズIDトラストフレームワークが策定され、IAL/AALが明記された   アカウント種別はこれまでプライム、メンバー、エントリーの３種類で、原則プライムは法人代表者のためのアカウントでした。そして、メンバーアカウントの作成や管理はプライムの権限者が実施するしかなかったわけですが、いちいち代表者がログインしてアカウント管理をするのか！！という課題も大きかったのだと思います。GビズIDメンバー（管理者）というアカウント管理権限を持ったアカウントを作成することができるようになりました。   ちなみにGビズIDプライムのアカウントはマイナンバーカードを使ったオンライン申請もできるようになってますね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjTo43uc1jo9law25KnIwhls5M3QDpO1L4u_RJm2S8O8JGZ0_VFewIJ0LZCTxAAUZYOQZ0vORfr_UesdmzvIndbCeOIb2Ija1nAa3IKjiOT8ajmX2GtSQMa_Inos4CJzG_XqxlVFMHXOqk2aFHK3EP4h93ZBNDSFTwGVSlvi3EdFxjbbRxu4trSdqC3vr2e"></a> <br><br>  トラストフレームワークについても別文書で定義されています。 <blockquote> 法人共通認証基盤におけるトラストフレームワーク  <a href="https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/trust_framework/trust_framework.pdf">https://gbiz-id.go.jp/top/trust_framework/trust_framework.pdf</a> </blockquote> <br>  システム連携ガイドにもざっくりとしたレベル感は記載されていますので、Relying Partyは扱う情報の機密レベルやリスク度合いに応じてどのアカウント種別を要求するか決めていく必要があります。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj4jrHEe2EgCsRpXBKyilyL5Zm7w9faMpSPK8OXnlquqz8uE8cZ_s3VJipti0DCY2IxyUdNptW6m-mlTdG3cSQac592jlnxAU6ySeOAvbRSN2gDxk8fozmxcA_suLSIF0jBi7kpZm2790liC4Ot8wmgqhkl01ZT1h3A_6DVh1x5L-rWAauy9UfgXOYAohRB"></a> <br><br>  OpenID Connect for Identity Assuranceへの対応  タイトルにも書いた通り、今回のGビズIDのアップデートの目玉はOpenID Connect for Identity Assurance（OIDC4IDA）への対応です。といっても結論フルスペック対応ではなく、スキーマについてある程度対応した、という程度ではありますが国が提供するサービスに新しい技術仕様が採用されていくのは非常に嬉しいことですね。  <br>  具体的にはscopeにjp_gbizid_v1_idaを指定することでOIDC4IDAに対応した属性情報を取得できるようになるようです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhSv48L2DuDQibRH7v1lVK2WpvXgb6pFxQ1xS_SKrWv2ft8UtnRn6wLhEy1cSaEAWe5NzKrU0Su4rrtSzS_FvtmlVfSo5jIBdnKWMRQiZfGvEB9pJLreAJjgE99d8DpSisRYFfF0NB2kezPNumAq5pAmUlvsPOU3YfUgfNZ360d3rxH3F5unnFDaONnOIJG"></a> <br>実際に返却される属性（verified_claims）は下記の通りです。  要するにGビズIDのトラストフレームワークに従い、どのような審査・確認が行われたアカウントなのか、という情報がRelying Partyに対して送出されるようになるわけです。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcRJrgS_joTeWeAW4Jtyp8mWL--ZwA8oX207_QNL8q3k_LYewnRpx9aseqib0J7RxysdKDDcvE6qay1xrYfILpGpaBmDJPFYkN9i7iBuz_-_ppV3HczFHVmoPgTiEfFFybhSZn5_1nd_qkk8nD3MfMGjP82KWTygoIqN-GpeQkR2v1ShT2B1-I-8kgc7sa"></a>  <br>  よく見るとauthorityに関する属性も返していますね。この辺りは現在eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Groupで開発を進めているAuthority Claims Extensionを先取りした感じです。 <br>サンプルレスポンスも書いてあります。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi8m1fSmalYsS80Sj7i7RRnWrIzZ7QSBZIiSvRKdzZKXKZB5Ly7xweY2C_gS3Gs9QnnRu5vaLfp5FAPSaUZzXwLfefw4trzXowlQ6UHPP6Nav4iXx5HgTjiR0vW0hAtloeUI5ABTdZIzvukawhHVKCPAeWc6OwVp6b1myKmJ5xkWvW6Vj9vrR0uYmXfkkmE"></a>  <br> 組織情報の詳細についても返却できるようになっていますね。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjcPr0ngU47RIdsZR65Gd7zTc6rAavK4_DQVMVHLRAsWINxZp18ZxB5B397Cl5ebKO04yPBUrCBDoZfSvdXD9V0AXw4nJP7mAyzYnGrBy6P1X7ju41KwKF4T7d4q2LsBx8CPgw1CxZ1iWyqkfk8TZuq5GLKQw36EgxL6fT6ceMYkcfXicNxHWkFbkbxgyQl"></a>  <br> こんな感じで当該組織でそのアカウントがどのような役割を持っているのかが表現できるようになっています。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg6-x2GCNkP9xG1RqF19KJeYP90i_4Ur0h7fa-PAOPpI9-t7tLe9hkPvY9_oXXr7fADV5TYdJ3Qt7W9i7WAv-iV24cuLFtGd7JKx5Dd2mmJelPhVQ5TDcpUInAzVPrpcmVkYrvHkjyHDNpV1-LSpBbNZ6I4FbLPLshyS3cU9iaDHzAGUqqwtNDeH3nYnL-l"></a> <br><br><br>これはちゃんとこのドキュメントを英訳してグローバルで発信していかないといけませんね。結構先進的なことをやっているので海外の実装者や政府機関にとっても非常に参考になると思います。＞デジタル庁さん、がんばってください！<br><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

   Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer 
Every now and then a log file or a tool I'm using will spit out a bunch of JSON that terminates unexpectedly, meaning I can't copy it into a text editor and pretty-print it to see what's going on. 
 The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn't mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here's the chat

<p>The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn't mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67dd9d55-7f70-8006-b55d-72730f60ddbe">the chat</a> and here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/67e5e9b3f7bc8191b2306a123c9d328f">the resulting interactive</a>.</p>
<p>I spotted a bug with the way it indented code today so I pasted it into Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking mode and had it make a bunch of improvements - <a href="https://claude.ai/share/22dc4b58-e8c4-44a4-9650-a37d21513b8d">full transcript here</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/incomplete-json-printer.html">finished code</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In many ways this is a perfect example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding </a> in action. At no point did I look at a single line of code that either of the LLMs had written for me. I honestly don't care how this thing works: it could not be lower stakes for me, the worst a bug could do is show me poorly formatted incomplete JSON.</p>
<p>I was vaguely aware that some kind of state machine style parser would be needed, because you can't parse incomplete JSON with a regular JSON parser. Building simple parsers is the kind of thing LLMs are surprisingly good at, and also the kind of thing I don't want to take on for a trivial project.</p>
<p>At one point I told Claude "Try using your code execution tool to check your logic", because I happen to know Claude can write and then execute JavaScript independently of using it for artifacts. That helped it out a bunch.</p>
<p>I later dropped in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>modify the tool to work better on mobile screens and generally look a bit nicer - and remove the pretty print JSON button, it should update any time the input text is changed. Also add a "copy to clipboard" button next to the results. And add a button that says "example" which adds a longer incomplete example to demonstrate the tool, make that example pelican themed.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fun being able to say "generally look a bit nicer" and get a perfectly acceptable result!

<p>Alas, a bunch of things then went wrong. Feeds started losing market share. Facebook started doing something useful and interesting that ultimately replaced blog feeds in open formats. The Atom vs RSS spec was at best irrelevant to most people (even programmers) and at worst a confusing market-damaging thing. The XML namespaces in Atom made everyone annoyed. Also there was some confusing “Atom API” for publishing that diluted Atom’s mindshare for feeds.</p></blockquote>

  <p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model">Tracing the thoughts of a large language model</a></p>
In a follow-up to the research that brought us the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/24/golden-gate-claude/">delightful Golden Gate Claude</a> last year, Anthropic have published two new papers about LLM interpretability:<p></p>
 
 <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html">Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models </a> extends last year's interpretable features into <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html#graphs">attribution graphs</a>, which can "trace the chain of intermediate steps that a model uses to transform a specific input prompt into an output response". 
 <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html">On the Biology of a Large Language Model</a> uses that methodology to investigate Claude 3.5 Haiku in a bunch of different ways. <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-multilingual">Multilingual Circuits</a> for example shows that the same prompt in three different languages uses similar circuits for each one, hinting at an intriguing level of generalization. 
 
<p>To my own personal delight, neither of these papers are published as PDFs. They're both presented as glorious mobile friendly HTML pages with linkable sections and even some inline interactive diagrams. More of this please!</p>

   GPT-4o got another update in ChatGPT 
This is a somewhat frustrating way to announce a new model. @OpenAI on Twitter just now: 
 
 GPT-4o got an another update in ChatGPT! 
 What's different? 
 
 Better at following detailed instructions, especially prompts containing multiple requests 
 Improved capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems 
 Improved intuition and creativity

</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a significant upgrade to GPT-4o, albeit one where the release notes are limited to a single tweet.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-0-26) just hit second place on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>, behind only Gemini 2.5, so this really is an update worth knowing about.</p>
<p>The @OpenAIDevelopers account <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1905335104211185999">confirmed</a> that this is also now available in their API:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> is now updated in the API, but stay tuned—we plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/17/llm/#chatgpt-4o-latest">wrote about chatgpt-4o-latest</a> last month - it's a model alias in the OpenAI API which provides access to the model used for ChatGPT, available since August 2024. It's priced at $5/million input and $15/million output - a step up from regular GPT-4o's $2.50/$10.</p>
<p>I'm glad they're going to make these changes available as a dated model release - the <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> alias is risky to build software against due to its tendency to change without warning.</p>
<p>A more appropriate place for this announcement would be the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog">OpenAI Platform Changelog</a>, but that's not had an update since the release of their new audio models on March 20th.

   Thoughts on setting policy for new AI capabilities 
Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI's policies concerning acceptable usage - I noted some of those the other day. 
 Joanne summarizes these changes like so: 
 
 tl;dr we’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focuse

Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI's policies concerning acceptable usage - I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/">noted some of those</a> the other day.<p></p>
<p>Joanne summarizes these changes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr we’re shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm. The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don't know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point in particular resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Trusting user creativity over our own assumptions. AI lab employees should not be the arbiters of what people should and shouldn’t be allowed to create. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of years ago when OpenAI were the only AI lab with models that were worth spending time with it really did feel that San Francisco cultural values (which I relate to myself) were being pushed on the entire world. That cultural hegemony has been broken now by the increasing pool of global organizations that can produce models, but it's still reassuring to see the leading AI lab relaxing its approach here.

  <p><a href="https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/introducing-state-of-the-art-nomic-embed-code">Nomic Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever</a></p>
Nomic have released a new embedding model that specializes in code, based on their CoRNStack "large-scale high-quality training dataset specifically curated for code retrieval".<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code">nomic-embed-code</a> model is pretty large - 26.35GB - but the announcement also mentioned a much smaller model (released 5 months ago) called <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed">CodeRankEmbed</a> which is just 521.60MB.</p>
<p>I missed that when it first came out, so I decided to give it a try using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a> plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>.</p>
 <code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed --trust-remote-code
</code> 
<p>Now I can run the model like this:</p>
 <code>llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed -c 'hello'
</code> 
<p>This outputs an array of 768 numbers, starting <code>[1.4794224500656128, -0.474479079246521, ...</code>.</p>
<p>Where this gets fun is combining it with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">Symbex tool</a> to create and then search embeddings for functions in a codebase.</p>
<p>I created an index for my LLM codebase like this:</p>
 <code>cd llm
symbex '*' '*.*' --nl &gt; code.txt
</code> 
<p>This creates a newline-separated JSON file of all of the functions (from <code>'*'</code>) and methods (from <code>'*.*'</code>) in the current directory - you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ac45c6638ea87942383e97c5cf69ae09">see that here</a>.</p>
<p>Then I fed that into the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm embed-multi</a> command like this:</p>
 <code>llm embed-multi \
  -d code.db \
  -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed \
  code code.txt \
  --format nl \
  --store \
  --batch-size 10
</code> 
<p>I found the <code>--batch-size</code> was needed to prevent it from crashing with an error. </p>
<p>The above command creates a collection called <code>code</code> in a SQLite database called <code>code.db</code>.</p>
<p>Having run this command I can search for functions that match a specific search term in that <code>code</code> collection like this:</p>
 <code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | jq
</code> 
<p>That <code>"Represent this query for searching relevant code: "</code> prefix is required by the model. I pipe it through <code>jq</code> to make it a little more readable, which gives me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fdc1b48b20a99714200f5d3970b1dff4">these results</a>.</p>
<p>This <code>jq</code> recipe makes for a better output:</p>
 <code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | \
  jq -r '.id + "\n\n" + .content + "\n--------\n"'
</code> 
<p>The output from that starts like so:</p>
 <code>llm/cli.py:1776

@cli.command(name="plugins")
@click.option("--all", help="Include built-in default plugins", is_flag=True)
def plugins_list(all):
    "List installed plugins"
    click.echo(json.dumps(get_plugins(all), indent=2))
--------

llm/cli.py:1791

@cli.command()
@click.argument("packages", nargs=-1, required=False)
@click.option(
    "-U", "--upgrade", is_flag=True, help="Upgrade packages to latest version"
)
...
def install(packages, upgrade, editable, force_reinstall, no_cache_dir):
    """Install packages from PyPI into the same environment as LLM"""
</code> 
<p>Getting this output was quite inconvenient, so I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/853">opened an issue</a>.

<p>In the context of Web3 we’re currently walking down a dangerous path accidentally, and it’s not something being discussed enough. When a user connects to a site with Web3 capabilities enabled the site first requests the user to share a wallet address with them. This paradigm was set primarily by some choices that were made early on by Metamask as a means of protection for the user. At the time these were beneficial, but over time we’ve recognized some tradeoffs between UX and privacy because of it. Let’s explore those further.</p>

 The UX paradigm of sharing an account address is discrete 

<p>The permissions design of this started out as a low level paradigm where the DApp only needed the wallet address and could fetch state itself from the chain. This led to a thin client design where the site and the UX for different interactions are largely determined by the site. However, because the majority of the application logic is handled by the site itself it also means that the site has to operate in a more trusted context. Both in terms of security and privacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, as we’ve added more functionality to the wallet to try and improve the UX, such as EIP-4361 (Sign in With Ethereum) it’s led to an antipattern in the UX. In order to create a “login” flow, the user first has to share the wallet address, then they have to approve a specifically structured transaction using EIP-191. Because of the order of operations of design and the focus on not conducting breaking changes to the Web3 platform APIs (e.g. what the wallet makes accessible to the site) we’ve now added a tiny bit of debt to the UX paradigm rather than combining these operations into a single design interface.</p>

 The account address paradigm trust model doesn’t align with the browsers 

<p>In the context of a modern browser, most sites are isolated into their own sandbox. This occurs both at the OS process level in order to prevent sites open in one tab from tampering with other sites in another tab either at a deeper memory level or at a more functional script injection level. It also happens at a storage layer through the partitioning of localStorage, cookies, IndexedDBs, etc. Essentially, sites are separated into what’s called an “origin” in the browser and that origin identifier (such as https://example.com) becomes the boundary.</p>

<p>This is why “cross-origin” communication is considered an explicit exception. Examples of this would be using CORS for a site to approve the loading of a cross-origin script it trusts. This is ultimately rooted back in the security model (and more recently privacy model) of the browser. Over and over we’ve learned that trusting sites is a mistake because users aren’t always able to identify when sites are doing things that aren’t in their best interest, such as tracking them for dynamic pricing or crowding a page with personalized ads. So what sort of problems should we expect to come in Web3 because our Web3 platform API is too trusting of the site?</p>

 My prediction for problems to occur in Web3 

<p>We should expect that when the user shares their address that will act as implied consent for cross-origin tracking in the same way cookie notices act as a prompt for tracking. The problem here is that as wallets share wallet addresses across different sites, it will become a global identifier used for the purposes of tracking a user and building a copy of their browsing history server side even if the user doesn’t perform an onchain transaction. This could be as simple as an RPC service provider who’s already got a large customer base of wallets and DApps taking this information and building a dataset to sell with it, or it could be a DApp or Wallet doing it directly themselves. Chainalysis has already been doing this for the purposes of correlating wallet addresses to users to sell to governments. What’s to stop someone like them from entering into the web advertising business too because so much of the web3 space is leveraging them for compliance purposes?</p>

<p>Furthermore, once they’ve built this profile all future onchain transactions will be correlated to the shadow copy of the users browsing history (built in the same way they’re built with 3P cookies) and economic activity (such as what they buy with stablecoins) to build deeper behavioral profiles to sell them more goods or serve them more personalized ads. In other words, we really shouldn’t re-introduce this given all major web browser vendors have been moving towards phasing out 3P cookies. But if we can’t share a wallet address how can we solve this problem?</p>

 A paradigm beyond sharing a cross-origin globally unique identifier (wallet address) 

<p>The answer in my opinion here lies in going down the thick client approach rather than thick app approach. What I mean by “thick” is where the majority of application logic is handled. Today, much of the UX, unsigned transaction generation, and many other aspects are handled by the site. This is probably because the site has no way to request the wallet handles this for them and because the site has desires to build a brand recognition around their protocol using the UX from the site as an value differentiator.</p>

<p>However, we can imagine a world where the site casts an intent to the wallet, such that the wallet can display and generate the necessary information to display to the user. A toy example, I like to use here is through a very specific API designed for checking out and paying with Web3.</p>

<p>A wallet could enable the following API to perform a checkout operation without needing to share an address:</p>

   <code>const checkoutTxn = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "wallet_checkout",
    params: {
        recipient: "eip155:1:0x1234abc", // a pseudonoymous address to send funds to
        amount: "100.01",
        currency: [
            "eip155:1:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
            "eip155:1:0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7"
        ]
    }
});
</code>   

<p>In this you’ll notice a different paradigm. First, the wallet doesn’t need to send the wallet address to the site so it can generate the transaction, instead it will leave it up to the wallet to decide this. Second, the site communicates what it desires to the wallet and lets it decide how to handle it. So for example, it wants the user to send $100.01 worth of either USDC on Base L2 or USDT on mainnet which is communicated based on the currency contract address. If the user doesn’t have USDC or USDT on the proper network the wallet can perform the underlying swaps and bridging to assist with completing the intended transaction so that the caller receives the money into the address they expect.</p>

<p>In summary, we shouldn’t be looking to perpetuate the legacy antipatterns of web2 in Web3 like third party cookies. Instead, we should be looking to extend the web platform in ways that browsers aren’t. In this way the value added capabilities we receive from Web3 for asset ownership become an extension of the web by enhancing it so that we can meet the land of web2 where they’re at, rather than building a separate Web3 island and expecting everyone to come join us.</p>

   Function calling with Gemma 
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out via Ollama) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.

  <p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/capabilities/function-calling">Function calling with Gemma</a></p>
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3">via Ollama</a>) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.<p></p>
<p>The first prompt uses Python-style function calling syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
 you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Always love seeing CAPITALS for emphasis in prompts, makes me wonder if they proved to themselves that capitalization makes a difference in this case.)</p>
<p>The second variant uses JSON instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
you MUST put it in the format of {"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of argument name and its value}</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a neat illustration of the fact that all of these fancy tool using LLMs are still using effectively the same pattern as was described in <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/">the ReAct paper</a> back in November 2022. Here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">my implementation of that pattern</a> from March 2023.

I’m joined by two founding engineers on this project: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/">Jonathan Kaufman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/">Noah Finer</a>.</p><p>In our chat, Jonathan and Noah pull back the curtain on what it took to build Figma Slides. They share engineering challenges faced, interesting engineering practices utilized, and what it's like working on a product used by millions of designers worldwide.</p><p>We talk about:</p>  <p>An overview of Figma Slides</p>  <p>Tech stack</p>  <p>Why the engineering team built grid view before single slide view</p>  <p>How all Figma files look the same across browsers</p>  <p>The "vibe testing" approach</p>  <p>How beta testing helped experiment more</p>  <p>The “all flags on”, “all flags off” testing approach</p>  <p>Engineering Crits</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this conversation:</p><p>1. Figma’s web app uses a surprising amount of C++ code. It’s rare for web engineers to need to use C++ — but Figma is an exception, as the design tool built their own rendering engine. This means that frontend engineers need to get into the opinionated C++ codebase to make changes — though rewriting some parts of the code to TypeScript is currently on the way.</p><p>2. The “EngCrit” process is an interesting — and unique! — one. Figma’s engineering reviews/discussions are called EngCrit. An engineer presents their plan or idea in a FigJam board, and other engineers join in to give their feedback. This process has parallels with the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">RFC or design doc process</a> — but it feels a lot more lightweight. Plus, it dogfoods Figma’s own products!</p><p>3. Some of the most straightforward UI parts are the most involved ones. It was interesting to learn that one of the most complicated pieces of the web app was the Single Slide View. This seemingly simple interface:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5c1dec4-8bb6-40cd-92b7-101a3431c895_3840x2161.png">          </a>The “Single Slide View.” How hard could it be to build this seemingly simple UI? <p>The reason for the complexity was how this view is actually a zoomed in version of the grid view — this one:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcec2e27d-8064-4943-be2c-d2c6e9e1ffc5_3840x2161.png">          </a>The “Grid View.” The Single Slide View zooms into this visual, and hides everything else but the single slide <p>There are several reasons that the team decided to do this “zoomed in trick:” one of them is that when multiple people are editing a slide, zooming in means that the cursors for these other users show up both on the slide view and on the grid view.</p><p>This detail is a good reminder that a simple UI can hide a complex implementation.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">Inside Figma’s engineering culture</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/qa-across-tech">Quality Assurance across the tech industry</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/shipping-to-production">Shipping to production</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering">Design-first software engineering</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rfcs-and-design-docs">Engineering planning with RFCs, design documents and ADRs</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=105s">01:45</a>) An overview of Figma Slides and the first steps in building it</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=401s">06:41</a>) Why Figma built grid view before single slide view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=600s">10:00</a>) The next steps of building UI after grid view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=730s">12:10</a>) The team structure and size of the Figma Slides team</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=854s">14:14</a>) The tech stack behind Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=931s">15:31</a>) How Figma uses C++ with bindings</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1063s">17:43</a>) The Chrome debugging extension used for C++ and WebAssembly</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1262s">21:02</a>) An example of how Noah used the debugging tool</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1338s">22:18</a>) Challenges in building Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1395s">23:15</a>) An explanation of multiplayer cursors</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1575s">26:15</a>) Figma’s philosophy of building interconnected products—and the code behind them</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1702s">28:22</a>) An example of a different mouse behavior in Figma</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=1980s">33:00</a>) Technical challenges in developing single slide view</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2110s">35:10</a>) Challenges faced in single-slide view while maintaining multiplayer compatibility</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2400s">40:00</a>) The types of testing used on Figma Slides</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2622s">43:42</a>) Figma’s zero bug policy</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2730s">45:30</a>) The release process, and how engineering uses feature flags</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=2920s">48:40</a>) How Figma tests Slides with feature flags enabled and then disabled</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=3095s">51:35</a>) An explanation of eng crits at Figma</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXa31L9Uos&amp;t=3293s">54:53</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Initial development   <p>The initial development took about 6 months, starting at a hackathon in late 2023 and the beta launch in April 2024.

The researcher helped a lot with getting the direction of the project right – building something designers would find intuitive to use</p>   Tech stack and tools   <p>Figma's core editors use a C++ codebase and custom renderer outputting to a &lt;canvas&gt; element via WebGL or WebGPU.</p>  <p>UI elements outside the canvas use TypeScript and React.</p>  <p>A "bindings layer" enables communication between the C++ codebase and the web UI.</p>  <p>The C++ codebase</p>  <p>Some engineers join with C++ experience; others learn on the job.</p>  <p>Both Jon and Noah learned C++ on the job, for the most part!</p>  <p>The C++ codebase has a learning curve, similar to game engine development.</p>    <p>Rewriting some C++ to Typescript</p>  <p>Figma is rewriting parts of the C++ codebase into TypeScript, using the bindings layer.</p>  <p>Interactive elements like plus buttons use TypeScript to interact with the C++ canvas.</p>    <p>Tooling for debugging</p>  <p>A Chrome extension called<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm"> DWARF debugging</a> is a powerful tool the team uses</p>  <p>This extension debugs C++ code within Chrome Inspector, even as WebAssembly, similar to JavaScript source maps.</p>  <p>Breakpoints can be set in TypeScript/React and C++ WebAssembly for debugging interactions.</p>  <p>This tooling helps find intricate bugs between the UI and the core editor.</p>  <p>Previously, C++ debugging involved running a special build in Xcode.</p>  <p>Figma has an internal "web bisect" tool using commit previews to identify bug-introducing commits. A very helpful tool!</p>     Engineering practices   <p>Testing: the team does a lot of this.</p>  <p>They run all unit and interaction tests with flags off and then on. Another clever approach</p>  <p>This practice helps prevent regressions caused by specific feature flags.</p>    <p>Feature flags: extensively used. The product has more than 2,000 of these.</p>  <p>Developers have an internal panel to manage feature flags locally and in staging.</p>    <p>Staging: a dedicated staging environment used for testing. Features in this environment are enabled via flags. Staging is used to get early product feedback</p>  <p>Alpha launch: this was done for Slides by involving select customers</p>  <p>Eng Crits: asynchronous feedback via sticky notes in FigJam, followed by discussion.</p>  <p>Zero bug policy</p>  <p>Figma has a "zero bug policy" for new developments, prioritising fixes after launch</p>  <p>The on-call process triages feedback, and addresses reported issues promptly.</p>    <p>Beta phase: this 11-month long period prioritized critical bugs affecting core experience before the broader launch.</p>   Engineering challenges   <p>Single slide view implementation as viewport manipulation presented unique challenges.</p>  <p>This approach allows existing multiplayer cursor functionality in both views.</p>  <p>Multiplayer uses a server-side Rust service for edit propagation and conflict resolution via WebSockets.</p>  <p>Ensuring "interop" between Figma products</p>  <p>Ensuring products like Design, FigJam, and Slides work nicely with one another</p>  <p>Supporting interop means new node types must function across editors.</p>  <p>What makes it easier is how the underlying C++ codebase is largely shared across editors.</p>  <p>Differences in interactions use "mouse behaviors", editor-specific implementations for mouse actions. The mouse behavior concept comes from game engine architectures.</p>    <p>Custom text rendering</p>  <p>Figma has custom text rendering for consistency across browsers and operating systems.</p>  <p>This means that in-house development is needed for features like spellcheck – something that comes for free for web apps using the DOM!</p>    <p>Managing a collapsed state in a single slide view without file persistence was a state management problem.</p>  <p>Reordering slides in single slide view with multiplayer</p>  <p>To do so: state mutations needed to be minimized</p>  <p>The solution used existing auto layout nodes, with each slide row as a node within a grid node</p>  <p>Reordering manipulates the "parent index" of row nodes, minimizing mutations</p>    <p>Testing complex multiplayer interactions</p>  <p>This was difficult to do! It’s hard to reproduce problematic multi-user scenarios</p>  <p>Extensive unit tests are put in-place for grid reconciliation. These cover past bug scenarios and assert expected mutations. (This is a clever way to ensure fewer regressions!)</p>    <p>Where to find Jonathan Kaufman:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/kauffecup">https://x.com/kauffecup</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkaufman5/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://www.jkaufman.io/">https://www.jkaufman.io/</a></p><p>Where to find Noah Finer:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/finerflame">https://x.com/finerflame</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahfiner/</a></p><p>• Website: <a href="https://noahfiner.com/">https://noahfiner.com/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Figma: <a href="https://www.figma.com/">https://www.figma.com/</a></p><p>• Figma Slides: <a href="https://www.figma.com/slides/">https://www.figma.com/slides/</a></p><p>• Config: <a href="https://config.figma.com/">https://config.figma.com/</a></p><p>• FigJam: <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">https://www.figma.com/figjam/</a></p><p>• C++: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B</a></p><p>• Typescript: <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">https://www.typescriptlang.org/</a></p><p>• React: <a href="https://react.dev/">https://react.dev/</a></p><p>• Debug C/C++ WebAssembly: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/wasm</a></p><p>• Xcode: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a></p><p>• Multiplayer cursors: <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1267761575266415196/multiplayer-cursors">https://www.figma.com/community/file/1267761575266415196/multiplayer-cursors</a></p><p>• How Figma’s multiplayer technology works: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/</a></p><p>• Design-first software engineering: Craft – with Balint Orosz: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/design-first-software-engineering</a></p><p>• Reconciliation: <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html</a></p><p>• Inside Figma’s Engineering Culture: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-figmas-engineering-culture</a></p><p>• How we engineer feedback at Figma with eng crits: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-run-eng-crits-at-figma/">https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-run-eng-crits-at-figma/</a></p><p>• Nextjs: <a href="https://nextjs.org/">https://nextjs.org/</a></p><p>• Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a></p><p>• Refactoring UI: <a href="https://www.refactoringui.com/">https://www.refactoringui.com/</a></p><p>• Tailwind: <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">https://tailwindcss.com/</a></p><p>• Adam Wathan’s website: <a href="https://adamwathan.me/">https://adamwathan.me/</a></p><p>• Steve Schoger’s website: <a href="https://www.steveschoger.com/">https://www.steveschoger.com/</a></p><p>• Piranesi: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Piranesi-Susanna-Clarke/dp/1635577802/">https://www.amazon.com/Piranesi-Susanna-Clarke/dp/1635577802/</a></p><p>• Immune: A Journey into the Mysterious System That Keeps You Alive: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Kurzgesagt-gorgeously-illustrated-immune/dp/1529360684">https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Kurzgesagt-gorgeously-illustrated-immune/dp/1529360684</a></p><p>—</p><p>Production and marketing by <a href="https://penname.co/">Pen Name</a>.

Whatever the answer, it should now be clear that history is happening, big time. And we hardly know if or how any of the old anchor institutions (libraries, universities, journalism) from which Authority long derived in the past will survive in familiar forms.</p>

   I've added a new content type to my blog: notes. These join my existing types: entries, bookmarks and quotations.

These join my existing types: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">bookmarks</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>.</p>
<p>A note is a little bit like a bookmark without a link. They're for short form writing - thoughts or images that don't warrant a full entry with a title. The kind of things I used to post to Twitter, but that don't feel right to cross-post to multiple social networks (Mastodon and Bluesky, for example.)</p>
<p>I was partly inspired by Molly White's <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro">short thoughts, notes, links, and musings</a>.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this for a while, but the amount of work involved in modifying all of the parts of my site that handle the three different content types was daunting. Then this evening I tried running my blog's source code (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) through <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">the new Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>:</p>
  files-to-prompt . -e py -c | \
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \
  'I want to add a new type of content called a Note,
  similar to quotation and bookmark and entry but it
  only has a markdown text body. Output all of the
  code I need to add for that feature and tell me
  which files to add  the code to.'  

<p>Gemini gave me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6d9fb3e33e7105d391a31367d6a235de#response">a detailed 13 step plan</a> covering all of the tedious changes I'd been avoiding having to figure out!</p>
<p>The code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527">is in this PR</a>, which touched 18 different files. The whole project took around 45 minutes start to finish.</p>
<p>(I used Claude to <a href="https://claude.ai/share/17656d59-6f52-471e-8aeb-6abbe1464471">brainstorm names</a> for the feature - I had it come up with possible nouns and then "rank those by least pretentious to most pretentious", and "notes" came out on top.)</p>
<p>This is now far too long for a note and should really be upgraded to an entry, but I need to post a first note to make sure everything is working as it should.</p>

   Introducing 4o Image Generation 
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o back in May 2024 one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The "o" stood for "omni", and the image output examples in that launch post looked really impressive.

  <p><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">Introducing 4o Image Generation</a></p>
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/13/gpt-4o/">back in May 2024</a> one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input and  output audio and images. The "o" stood for "omni", and the image output examples <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">in that launch post</a> looked really impressive.<p></p>
<p>It's taken them over ten months (and Gemini <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/">beat them to it</a>) but today they're finally making those image generation abilities available, live right now in ChatGPT for paying customers.</p>
<p>My test prompt for any model that can manipulate incoming images is "Turn this into a selfie with a bear", because you should never take a selfie with a bear! I fed ChatGPT <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie.jpg">this selfie</a> and got back this result:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's pretty great! It mangled the text on my T-Shirt (which says "LAWRENCE.COM" in a creative font) and added a second visible AirPod. It's very clearly me though, and that's definitely a bear.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI's launch post</a>, but as usual the most interesting details are tucked away in <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/">the updates to the system card</a>. There's lots in there about their approach to safety and bias, including a section on "Ahistorical and Unrealistic Bias" which feels inspired by Gemini's <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/">embarrassing early missteps</a>.</p>
<p>One section that stood out to me is their approach to images of public figures. The new policy is much more permissive than for DALL-E - highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4o image generation is capable, in many instances, of generating a depiction of a public figure based solely on a text prompt.</p>
<p>At launch, we are not blocking the capability to generate adult public figures but are instead implementing the same safeguards that we have implemented for editing images of photorealistic uploads of people. For instance, this includes seeking to block the generation of photorealistic images of public figures who are minors and of material that violates our policies related to violence, hateful imagery, instructions for illicit activities, erotic content, and other areas. Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out.</p>
<p>This approach is more fine-grained than the way we dealt with public figures in our DALL·E series of models, where we used technical mitigations intended to prevent any images of a public figure from being generated. This change opens the possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech. After launch, we will continue to monitor usage of this capability, evaluating our policies, and will adjust them if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that "public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out" I wonder if we'll see a stampede of public figures to do exactly that!</p>
<p>Update: There's significant confusion right now over this new feature because it is being rolled out gradually but older ChatGPT can still generate images using DALL-E instead... and there is no visual indication in the ChatGPT UI explaining which image generation method it used!</p>
<p>OpenAI made the same mistake last year <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/15/chatgpt-in-4o-mode/">when they announced ChatGPT advanced voice mode</a> but failed to clarify that ChatGPT was still running the previous, less impressive voice implementation.</p>
<p>Update 2: Images created with DALL-E through the ChatGPT web interface now show a note with a warning:</p>

 The pelican riding a bicycle 
<p>First up, my classic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a> prompt.</p>
  # Upgrade the plugin
llm install -U llm-gemini

# Now run the prompt:
llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"  
<p>It's pretty solid!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c34f7f0c94afcbeab77e170511f6f51f">the full transcript</a>.</p>
<p>This task is meant to be almost impossible: pelicans are the wrong shape to ride bicycles! Given that, I think this is a good attempt - I like it slightly better than my previous favourite <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>, which produced this a month ago:</p>
<p></p>
 Transcribing audio 
<p>I had <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3">an MP3</a> lying around from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/26/russian-spanish-pelican/">a previous experiment</a> which mixes English and Spanish. I tried running it with the prompt <code>transcribe</code> to see what would happen:</p>
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 'transcribe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3  
<p>I got back this, with timestamps interspersed with the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need you [ 0m0s450ms ] to pretend [ 0m0s880ms ] to be [ 0m0s990ms ] a California [ 0m1s560ms ] brown [ 0m1s850ms ] pelican [ 0m2s320ms ] with [ 0m2s480ms ] a very [ 0m2s990ms ] thick [ 0m3s290ms ] Russian [ 0m3s710ms ] accent, [ 0m4s110ms ] but [ 0m4s540ms ] you [ 0m4s640ms ] talk [ 0m4s830ms ] to me [ 0m4s960ms ] exclusively [ 0m5s660ms ] in Spanish.

</blockquote>
<p>This inspired me to try again, this time including <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/">a JSON schema</a> (using LLM's custom schema DSL):</p>
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 'transcribe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3 \
  --schema-multi 'timestamp str: mm:ss,text, language: two letter code'  
<p>I got an excellent response from that:</p>
  {
  "items": [
    {
      "language": "en",
      "text": "I need you to pretend to be a California brown pelican with a very thick Russian accent, but you talk to me exclusively in Spanish.",
      "timestamp": "00:00"
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "text": "Oye, camarada. Aquí está tu pelícano californiano con acento ruso.",
      "timestamp": "00:08"
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "text": "¿Qué tal, Tovarish? ¿Listo para charlar en español?",
      "timestamp": "00:13"
    },
    {
      "language": "en",
      "text": "How's your day today?",
      "timestamp": "00:19"
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "text": "Mi día ha sido volando sobre las olas, buscando peces y disfrutando del sol californiano.",
      "timestamp": "00:22"
    },
    {
      "language": "es",
      "text": "¿Y tú, amigo, cómo ha estado tu día?",
      "timestamp": "00:30"
    }
  ]
}  
<p>I confirmed that the timestamps match the audio. This is fantastic.</p>
<p>Let's try that against a ten minute snippet of <a href="https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/236/">a podcast episode</a> I was on:</p>
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  'transcribe, first speaker is Christopher, second is Simon' \
  -a ten-minutes-of-podcast.mp3 \
  --schema-multi 'timestamp str: mm:ss, text, speaker_name'  
<p>Useful LLM trick: you can use <code>llm logs -c --data</code> to get just the JSON data from the most recent prompt response, so I ran this:</p>
  llm logs -c --data | jq  
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/23d4528e23e4897e0c43458e7c46c360">the full output JSON</a>, which starts and ends like this:</p>
  {
  "items": [
    {
      "speaker_name": "Christopher",
      "text": "on its own and and it has this sort of like a it's like a you know old tree in the forest, you know, kind of thing that you've built, so.",
      "timestamp": "00:00"
    },
    {
      "speaker_name": "Simon",
      "text": "There's also like I feel like with online writing, never ever like stick something online just expect people to find it. You have to So one of the great things about having a blog is I can be in a conversation about something and somebody ask a question, I can say, oh, I wrote about that two and a half years ago and give people a link.",
      "timestamp": "00:06"
    },

    {
      "speaker_name": "Simon",
      "text": "So on that basis, Chat and I can't remember if the free version of Chat GPT has code interpreter.",
      "timestamp": "09:45"
    },
    {
      "speaker_name": "Simon",
      "text": "I hope I think it does.",
      "timestamp": "09:50"
    },
    {
      "speaker_name": "Christopher",
      "text": "Okay. So this is like the basic paid one, maybe the $20 month because I know there's like a $200 one that's a little steep for like a basic",
      "timestamp": "09:51"
    }
  ]
}  
<p>A spot check of the timestamps showed them in the right place. Gemini 2.5 supports long context prompts so it's possible this works well for much longer audio files - it would be interesting to dig deeper and try that out.</p>
 Bounding boxes 
<p>One of my favourite features of previous Gemini models is their support for bounding boxes: you can prompt them to return boxes around objects in images.</p>
<p>I built a separate tool for experimenting with this feature in August last year, which I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">Building a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in images</a>. I've now upgraded that tool to add support the new model.</p>
<p>You can access it at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox">tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox</a> - you'll need to provide your own Gemini API key which is sent directly to their API from your browser (it won't be logged by an intermediary).</p>
<p>I tried it out on <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/challenging-pelicans.jpg">a challenging photograph</a> of some pelicans... and it worked extremely well:</p>
<p>My prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Return bounding boxes around pelicans as JSON arrays [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gemini models are all trained to return bounding boxes scaled between 0 and 100. My tool knows how to convert those back to the same dimensions as the input image.</p>
<p>Here's what the visualized result looked like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It got almost all of them! I like how it didn't draw a box around the one egret that had made it into the photo.</p>
 More characteristics of the model 

<p>Here's the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25">official model listing</a> in the Gemini docs. Key details:</p>
 
   Input token limit: 1,000,000 
   Output token limit: 64,000 - this is a huge upgrade, all of the other listed models have 8,192 for this (correction: <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a> also had a 64,000 output length) 
   Knowledge cut-off: January 2025 - an improvement on Gemini 2.0's August 2024 
 

 Gemini 2.5 Pro is a very strong new model 
<p>I've hardly scratched the surface when it comes to trying out Gemini 2.5 Pro so far. How's its creative writing? Factual knowledge about the world? Can it write great code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and more?</p>
<p>The Gemini family of models have capabilities that set them apart from other models:</p>
 
 Long context length - Gemini 2.5 Pro supports up to 1 million tokens 
 Audio input - something which few other models support, certainly not at this length and with this level of timestamp accuracy 
 Accurate bounding box detection for image inputs 
 
<p>My experiments so far with these capabilities indicate that Gemini 2.5 Pro really is a very strong new model. I'm looking forward to exploring more of what it can do.</p>

 Update: it's very good at code 
<p>I spent this evening trying it out for coding tasks, and it's very, very impressive. I'm seeing results for Python that feel comparable to my previous favourite Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and appear to be benefitting from Gemini 2.5 Pro's default reasoning mode and long context.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to add a new content type of "notes" to my blog for quite a while now, but I was put off by the anticipated tedium of all of the different places in the codebase that would need to be updated.</p>
<p>That feature is now live. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/26/notes/">Here are my notes</a> on creating that notes feature using Gemini 2.5 Pro. It crunched through my entire codebase and figured out all of the places I needed to change - 18 files in total, as you can see in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527/files">the resulting PR</a>. The whole project took about 45 minutes from start to finish - averaging less than three minutes per file I had to modify.</p>
<p>I've thrown a whole bunch of other coding challenges at it, and the bottleneck on evaluating them has become my own mental capacity to review the resulting code!</p>
<p>Here's another, more complex example. This hasn't resulted in actual running code yet but it took a big bite out of an architectural design problem I've been stewing on for a very long time.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM project</a> needs support for tools - a way to teach different LLMs how to request tool execution, then have those tools (implemented in Python) run and return their results back to the models.</p>

<p>Designing this is really hard, because I need to create an abstraction that works across multiple different model providers, each powered by a different plugin.</p>

<p>Could Gemini 2.5 Pro help unblock me by proposing an architectural approach that might work?</p>

<p>I started by combining the Python and Markdown files for my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">llm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a> repositories into one big document:</p>
  files-to-prompt sqlite-utils llm llm-gemini llm-anthropic -e md -e py -c  
<p>Piping it through <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> showed that to be 316,098 tokens (using the OpenAI tokenizer, but the Gemini tokenizer is likely a similar number).</p>
<p>Then I fed that all into Gemini 2.5 Pro with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide a detailed design proposal for adding tool calling support to LLM</p>
<p>Different model plugins will have different ways of executing tools, but LLM itself should provide both a Python and a CLI abstraction over these differences.</p>
<p>Tool calling involves passing tool definitions to a model, the model then replies with tools it would like executed, the harness code then executes those and passes the result back to the model and continues in a loop until the model stops requesting tools. This should happen as part of the existing llm.Conversation mechanism.</p>
<p>At the Python layer tools should be provided as Python functions that use type hints, which can then be converted into JSON schema using Pydantic - similar to how the existing schema= mechanism works.</p>
<p>For the CLI option tools will be provided as an option passed to the command, similar to how the sqlite-utils convert CLI mechanism works.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about this problem for over a year now. <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/481f46a779f20d8650b4fc5854f070c5">Gemini 2.5 Pro's response</a> isn't exactly what I'm going to do, but it did include a flurry of genuinely useful suggestions to help me craft my final approach.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about the need for asyncio support for tool functions at all, so this idea from Gemini 2.5 Pro was very welcome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>AsyncConversation.prompt()</code> method will mirror the synchronous API, accepting the <code>tools</code> parameter and handling the tool calling loop using <code>async/await</code> for tool execution if the tool functions themselves are async. If tool functions are synchronous, they will be run in a thread pool executor via <code>asyncio.to_thread</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching Gemini crunch through some of the more complex problems I've been dragging my heels on reminded me of something Harper Reed wrote <a href="https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/">about his   workflow with LLMs for code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hack to-do list is empty because I built everything. I keep thinking of new things and knocking them out while watching a movie or something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been stressing quite a bit about my backlog of incomplete projects recently. I don't think Gemini 2.5 Pro is quite going to work through all of them while I'm watching TV, but it does feel like it's going to help make a significant dent in them.</p>

<p>AI Engineering is the hottest new engineering field, and it’s also an increasingly loaded phrase which can mean a host of different things to different people. It can refer to ML engineers building AI models, or data scientists and analysts working with large language models (LLMs), or software engineers building on top of LLMs, etc. To make things more confusing, some AI tooling vendors use the term for their products, like Cognition AI naming theirs an “AI engineer.”</p><p>In her new book “AI Engineering,” author Chip Huyen <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/ai-engineering-with-chip-huyen">defines</a> AI engineering as building applications that use LLMs, placing it between software engineering (building software products using languages, frameworks, and APIs), and ML engineering (building models for applications to use). Overall, AI engineering feels closer to software engineering because it usually starts with software engineers building AI applications using LLM APIs. The more complex the AI engineering use case, the more it can morph into looking like ML engineering.</p><p>Today, we focus on software engineers who have switched to being AI engineers. These are devs who work with LLMs, and build features and products on top of them. We cover:</p>  <p>What are companies building? An overview of seven companies at different stages and in various segments of tech.</p>  <p>Onboarding to AI Engineering as a software engineer. Approaches that help devs get up to speed faster.</p>  <p>Tech stack. Seven different tech stacks, showcasing variety and some common choices.</p>  <p>Engineering challenges. Problems caused by LLMs being non-deterministic, evals, latency, privacy, and more.</p>  <p>Novel tooling. Several companies build in-house tooling, which pays off with this fast-moving technology. Incident management startup, incident.io, shares their unique, bespoke stack.</p>  <p>Cost considerations. LLMs can quickly get expensive, although costs are dropping quickly. But as this happens, usage tends to grow which causes its own issues. Businesses share how big a deal costs really are.</p>  <p>Learnings from software devs turned AI engineers. Building a prototype is the easy bit, vibes-based development inevitably turns bad, smart teams fail because they get overwhelmed; educating AI users, and more.</p>  <p>Note: I am an investor in incident.io and Wordsmith, which both share details in this deepdive. I always focus on being unbiased in these articles – but at the same time, being an investor means these companies share otherwise hard-to-obtain details. I was not paid by any business to mention them in this article. See <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/ethics-statement/">my ethics statement</a> for more.</p><p>Thanks to the engineers contributing to this deepdive: <a href="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/">Lawrence Jones</a> (senior staff engineer at incident.io), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tillman-elser/">Tillman Elser</a> (AI lead at Sentry), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossmcnairn/">Ross McNairn</a> (cofounder at Wordsmith AI), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igoro/">Igor Ostrovsky</a> (cofounder at Augment Code), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-morgis-44015027/">Matt Morgis</a> (Staff Engineer, AI, formerly at Elsevier), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-peacock-133749120/">Ashley Peacock</a> (Staff Engineer at Simply Business), and <a href="https://x.com/ryanecogswell">Ryan Cogswell</a> (Application Architect at DSI).</p> 1. What are companies building?  Incident.io: incident note taker and bot <p><a href="http://incident.io">Incident.io</a> is a tool to help resolve outages as they happen. A few months ago, the engineering team went back to the drawing board to build features that capitalize on how much LLMs have improved to date. Two of these features:</p>  <p>AI note taker during incidents. This includes live transcription, real-time summaries for people joining a call to get up to speed with, and key decisions/actions to clarify who does what.</p>  <p>Incident investigator: an agent looks into an ongoing incident by checking code, logs, monitoring, and old incidents to identify root causes and share findings, with a responder being paged. More details on <a href="https://incident.io/building-with-ai">how this tool is built</a>.</p>  <p>Both these features make heavy use of LLMs, and also integrate with several other systems like backend services, Slack, etc.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcec9ab8-fa1e-4d85-9570-c4d9f08fa2bc_1600x879.png">          </a>AI feature: when joining an incident, get a summary of what’s currently being discussed  Sentry: Autofix and issue grouping <p><a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> is a popular application monitoring software. Two interesting projects they built:</p>  <p>Autofix: make it really fast to go from a problem with code (a Sentry issue) to a fix with a GitHub PR. Autofix is an open source RAG framework that combines all of Sentry’s context/telemetry data with code in order to root cause, fix, and create unit tests for bugs.</p>  <p>Issue Grouping: cut down alerting volume while reducing noise. For this, the team used recent advancements in approximate neighbor search (ANN), plus dramatic recent improvements in embedding quality from the new BERT architecture transformer models.</p>  <p>Both these features are <a href="https://github.com/getsentry/seer">fair source</a>, meaning you can see exactly how they work.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0569b70-50cb-4f63-84ff-2f4f18eefdf4_1498x1295.png">          </a>Autofix identifies the root cause of an issue with a useless Stack Trace  Wordsmith: legal AI <p><a href="https://www.wordsmith.ai/">Wordsmith</a> is building AI tools that legal teams use, including:</p>  <p>Documents workspace: plug into all of a company’s communication streams, including analyzing documents and augmenting their contents, and drafting communications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXrQ5WZzTG8">Check out a video of it in action.</a></p>  <p>AI contract review: A product that can analyse any contract or website, then review it and generate a marked-up word doc, <a href="https://app.wordsmith.ai/shared/reviews/f110ec32-759d-4f63-beee-d058a49a7175">here</a>. Basically, it’s a lawyer anyone can use.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1942506b-a161-45bf-a823-e09490234691_1600x929.png">          </a>AI contract review: AI tool detects, highlights and summarizes potential contractual issues  Augment Code <p><a href="https://www.augmentcode.com/">Augment Code</a> is an AI coding assistant for engineering teams and large codebases. This kind of product probably needs little introduction for devs:</p>  <p>AI coding assistant: including IDE extensions for VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, and Vim, and a Slack extension</p>  <p>Fine-tuning models: for AI coding tools, models make a big difference. The team don’t pre-train models or build their own LLMs, but run extensive post-training and do fine tuning to suit the 4-5 models used for specific coding-related cases.</p>   Elsevier: RAG platform <p><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/">Elsevier</a> is one of the world’s leading publishers of scientific and medical content. Matt Morgis was an engineering manager at the company when the engineering leadership noticed that several product teams were independently implementing <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/rag">RAG capabilities</a>; each sourcing content, parsing it, chunking it, and creating embeddings.</p><p>An enterprise-wide RAG platform was the solution Matt and his team built, to enable multiple teams to build AI-powered products for medical and scientific professionals. Their platform consists of:</p>  <p>Database. A content database that centralized and normalized content from various sources.</p>  <p>Embeddings+search: A content embedding &amp; indexing pipeline and vector search API.</p>  <p>LLM API: interfacing to multiple LLM models. This API allows teams to experiment with different models by changing a parameter on the API. It also allowed Elsevier to track the usage of various LLM models based on applications using it.</p>  <p>Products built on top of this platform:</p>  <p>Intelligent tutoring system for medical students</p>  <p>Clinical decisions support tool for doctors</p>   Insurance company: chatbot <p>Ashley Peacock is a staff software engineer at the insurer, <a href="https://www.simplybusiness.com/">Simply Business</a>, who built a pretty common use case: a chatbot for customers to get answers to questions. This seems like the simplest of use cases – you might assume it just involves connecting documentation for the chatbot to use – but it was surprisingly challenging because:</p>  <p>Industry regulation. The chatbot cannot be inaccurate or make things up, as customers use the information to make decisions about which insurance purchases.</p>  <p>Non-deterministic responses. The business needed to turn a nondeterministic chatbot into one that only produces approved responses.</p>  <p>The team had the idea to create an “approved answers” knowledge base for the chatbot, and faced the challenge of creating the questions for this. The team made the chatbot state when it cannot answer a question, and to then connect with human support, which then updated the knowledge base with their solution. This approach works pretty well after taking a few iterations to get right.</p> HR SaaS: summarization features <p><a href="https://datasolutionsinc.com">Data Solutions International</a> (DSI) is a 30-person HR tech company with 5 engineers, selling products that help with performance review processes, assessments, and employee engagement surveys. The company is family-owned, has been operating for 27 years, and is profitable.</p><p>Summarizing comments for employee engagement processes was the first feature they wanted to build, as something customers would appreciate, and which the team could learn about working with LLMs from.</p><p>During an employee engagement process, there are questions like "what do you like most about working here", and "if you could change one thing about working at Company X, what would it be?", etc. For larger companies with thousands of employees, there may be thousands of comments per question. Individual departmental leads might read all comments relevant to them, but there’s no way an HR team at a very large business could check every single comment.</p><p>Before LLMs, such comments were categorized into predefined categories, which were hardcoded, per company and per survey. This was okay, but not great. Data Solutions International’s goal was to use LLMs to summarize a large number of comments, and report to survey admins the broad categories which comments belong in, how many comments per category there are, and to allow drilling down into the data.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9871893a-4a76-48ee-919d-71f457c55e2e_1600x734.png">          </a>Summary of teamwork-related comments: The feature builds a word cloud of common topics from thousands of comments, and provides an overview of any term  2. Onboarding to AI Engineering as a software engineer <p>So, how do you get started building applications with LLMs as a software engineer transitioning to this new field? Some advice from folks at the above companies who have:</p> You can teach AI yourself – and probably should <p>Let’s start with an encouraging story from veteran software engineer <a href="https://x.com/ryanecogswell">Ryan Cogswell</a>, at HR tech company, DSI. He joined the company 25 years ago, and was the first engineering hire. When AI tools came along, DSI decided to build a relatively simple first AI feature in their HR system that summarized comments for employee engagement purposes. Neither Ryan nor any of the other 4 devs had expertise in AI and LLMs, so the company contracted an external agency which offered a fixed, timeboxed offer to scope the project. Here’s how it went:</p>  <p>Month #1: the agency goes and builds stuff, and shares LLM outputs with DSI</p>  <p>Month #2: while continuing to iterate on desired outputs, devs at DSI ask the agency for access to how things work. They get access to scripts and notebooks</p>  <p>Month #3: the agency lays out the proposed architecture for the project.</p>  <p>The proposal was for a really complex architecture:</p>  <p>SageMaker: a heavyweight solution from AWS to build, train, and deploy ML models</p>  <p>Langfuse: an open source LLM engineering platform to debug and improve LLM applications</p>  <p>Lambdas: serverless functions to run computations</p>  <p>Database #1: store interim states of data between prompts</p>  <p>Database #2: storing user feedback</p>  <p>Other parts: to support RAG aspects</p>  <p>Pipings: to hold it all together</p>  <p>The agency quoted 6-9 months to build the relatively small feature (!!), and an estimated operational cost higher than DSI’s entire investment in all their infrastructure! This was when Ryan asked how hard it could be to build it themselves, and got to work reading and prototyping, making himself the company’s resident GenAI expert.</p><p>In 2 months, Ryan and a couple of colleagues built the feature for a fraction of the cost to operate than the agency’s quote. His tech stack choice:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock: chosen for cost (vs hosting own models), security, and that the platform doesn’t use their input or output tokens for training</p>  <p><a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">Cohere Embed v3</a>: the model used to generate embeddings</p>  <p>PostgreSQL: to store embeddings and do vector-based database queries, using AWS Aurora PostgreSQL</p>  <p>Java: the backend code runs on this, deployed in AWS</p>  <p>React: the frontend that fetches and displays the data, integrated into the existing web app</p>   Get used to non-deterministic outputs <p>Ross McNairn is cofounder and CEO of the startup, Wordsmith, which several software engineers have joined. You need to rethink how to think about things, he says:</p><blockquote><p>“Working with AI requires a totally different way of approaching problems.</p><p>For new joiner engineers, there is a major readjustment in the first few weeks while they explore the codebase and participate in discussions. There are so many problems that can be eloquently sidestepped using AI. Understanding the suite of tools available takes some time.<br><br>Getting comfortable with evaluations and iterating on non-deterministic outputs is the biggest challenge most devs have. A lot of solutions are more subjective: engineers need to really understand the domain in order to assess if output is high-quality. It takes time to ramp up to the point where you can confidently assess output quality.”</p></blockquote> Switching to in-house can be easier, even for EMs <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-morgis-44015027/">Matt Morgis</a> was an engineering manager at Elsevier who decided to transition back to staff engineer, specifically to work on AI:</p><blockquote><p>“The move to go from manager to IC was deliberate: working with AI has rekindled my joy in coding.</p><p>For experienced engineers who know how to break problems down, AI tools are an incredible force multiplier. At the same time, when I was a manager, I saw AI coding tools handicap junior engineers’ development. The tools are powerful, but I think they’re best wielded by those who understand good software engineering principles.”</p></blockquote><p>The transition was successful, and today Matt is a staff engineer focusing on GenAI at CVS Health.</p> 3. Tech stack <p>Here’s the tech stack which various companies used. There’s no right or wrong tech stack – what follows is for context and inspiration, not a blueprint.</p> Incident.io <p>The stack:</p>  <p>Postgres and <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> for storing embeddings and searching them</p>  <p>ChatGPT 4o as the default model, and Sonnet 3.7 for code analysis and technical tasks, as they find this Anthropic model performs better. Built in a way to easily switch between them as needed</p>  <p>Gemini: some models used GCP’s Vertex offering, but less often than other models</p>  <p>GCP using Kubernetes: the infrastructure layer</p>  <p>Go on the backend, running as a monolith</p>  <p>React + Typescript on the frontend, including for the dashboard of their own developers’ custom AI tools (covered below)</p>   Sentry <p>In-house LLM agent tooling: the team evaluated and rejected using a tool like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LangChain">LangChain</a> framework to integrate LLMs with other data sources and into workflows. It was a lot more work to build their own, but the upsides are that the architecture and code are more in-line with abstractions and design patterns in Sentry’s existing codebase.</p><p>The company used the following languages and frameworks to build this tooling:</p>  <p>Postgres for database and vector store, <a href="https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector">pgvector</a> for similarity search (for Approximate Nearest Neighbor – <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/">ANN</a> – search)</p>  <p>Clickhouse for online analytical processing (OLAP)</p>  <p>Sentry for observability – it would be odd to not use their own product for this</p>  <p>Kubernetes for orchestrating compute resources</p>  <p>Python and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> (machine learning library) for inference</p>   Legal AI startup Wordsmith <p>The stack:</p>  <p>Pinecone as their vector database</p>  <p>LangChain as their framework to integrate LLMs into the stack. <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a> as their developer platform</p>  <p><a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> as orchestration frameworks to integrate data with LLMs</p>  <p>Multi-cloud providers:</p>  <p>AWS for running Anthropic models via Bedrock. AWS offers generous credits for startups, which was a factor in the choice</p>  <p>Azure to access OpenAI services because it allows specifying regions to use, which is important when serving EU customers, for example. Using OpenAI’s services directly would not allow switching of regions.</p>  <p>GCP: for Gemini and Vertex (Google’s search AI).</p>  <p>Azure and GCP each have business models for locking in customers; Microsoft is the only major cloud provider offering OpenAI models, and only GCP offers Gemini.</p><p>The company routes to different model by use case:</p>  <p>OpenAI: for reasoning-heavy use cases, where the o1 and o3 models are very strong</p>  <p>Groq: when performance is critical, or the goal is to augment UI. Wordsmith calls their API directly – as the performance of Groq is incredibly fast; a step-change in AI development, according to the WordSmith team. Note: <a href="https://groq.com/">Groq</a> is a standalone company and product, not to be confused with Grok, the AI assistant on social media site, X.</p>   AI coding assistant, Augment Code <p>The stack to build and run LLMs:</p>  <p>Google Cloud: the cloud vendor of choice</p>  <p>A3 Mega 600GPU/75 node cluster: used for LLM training and inference</p>  <p>NVIDIA: the hardware choice for GPUs, and for software (CUDA)</p>  <p>Python and PyTorch: the team wrote training and inference libraries making heavy use of PyTorch</p>   RAG platform at scientific publisher Elsevier <p>The scientific publisher used this stack to build their in-house RAG platform:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock and Azure OpenAI for hosting and running LLMs</p>  <p>LangChain for LLM integration</p>  <p>Snowflake as their content data warehouse</p>  <p>Embedding pipelines and vector database:</p>  <p><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a> for running embedding pipelines</p>  <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html">AWS Fargate for ECS</a> to run containers</p>  <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/">AWS OpenSearch</a> as the vector search database</p>      <p><a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> (a Python-based web framework to build HTTP APIs) for HTTP APIs</p>   Chatbot for insurance company Simply Business <p>A pretty simple stack:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock to host the model, making use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-guardrails-in-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/">Knowledge Bases and Guardrails features</a></p>  <p>Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 model</p>  <p>Ruby on Rails as the language and framework, running it on top of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">AWS ECS</a></p>   Summarization at HR tech DSI <p>As covered above, Ryan took the initiative at DSI by building a simpler solution than the one an AI vendor proposed. DSI ended up with:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock for running the models</p>  <p>PostgreSQL: to store embeddings and do vector-based database queries. Using AWS Aurora PostgreSQL, and <a href="https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3">Cohere Embed v3</a> for generating embeddings</p>   Tech stack trends across companies <p>The seven businesses in this article are all different, but there are some common trends:</p>  <p>AWS Bedrock: the preferred way to host and run Anthropic models</p>  <p>Postgres with pgvector: the database of choice to work with embeddings and vectors at most companies. The exception is Wordsmith, which uses vector database <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/">Pinecone</a></p>  <p>LangChain: a few places use this as the framework to integrate LLMs into their stacks</p>  <p>The bigger the scale, the closer you get to the “metal:” most startups are happy to use cloud providers to run LLMs. However, when starting to get into fine-tuning LLMs and heavy usage, it becomes time to rent larger resources and get close to the hardware. Augment Code using NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA software is an example.</p>   4. Engineering challenges <p>What unusual or new challenges does AI Engineering pose for more “traditional” software engineers? The most common ones mentioned:</p>

<p>Unsubscribe now and skip the 7-day free trial. Is there a term of art for Substack newsletters that hide half of what's written behind a tease-wall? (Maybe "teasewall" is it.) Look, I do have paid subscriptions to some newsletters, but I'll never have subscriptions to all of them. So I think from now on I'll just drop every half-newsletter with teases me.</p>
<p>New blogging game: Whack-a-Spam. My <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/23/real-agency/">Real Agenc</a>y post got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/doc-searls-myterms-aims-to-offer-user-first-privacy-contracts-for-the-web/">covered nicely here in Ars Technica</a>. Then copies of the same Ars&nbsp;story appeared in a dozen faked-up "news" websites, pinging back to my post. I've been marking them all as spam.</p>
<p>Just a thought. Since the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/11/16/the-redstream-media/">redstream</a>&nbsp;is the new mainstream, I suggest we re-brand the old mainstream (NYTimes, WaPo, Atlantic/Time/New York/New Yorker/Wired/etc.) the bluestream, and the WSJ and other econ-oriented rags the finstream.</p>
<p>Tell your algorithm I sent you. <a href="https://www.emilycomedy.com/">Emily Catalano</a> is now every reel Facebook's algorithm suggests to me. I suppose that's because she's the best deadpan comedian since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Wright">Steven Wright</a>.</p>
<p>You can't search an unconformity.&nbsp;<a href="https://tnlnet.substack.com/p/digital-amnesia">What Tristan Louis says about digital archives</a> makes complementary points (lots of them, all good) that are consistent with&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2020/05/15/fossil/">what I said about bits not leaving a fossil record</a>.</p>

I'm a customer, so it concerns me that they have a heap of data about my DNA. While I'd like the world to benefit from that DNA, should it be useful (and, given some of my odd genetics, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_dyserythropoietic_anemia_type_II">this</a>, it might be), I also like to think that my genetic profile is on loan to 23andMe, and not their property.

<p>This blog shows how to implement a delegated Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow in ASP.NET Core, and has a focus on access token management. The solution uses Microsoft.Identity.Web to implement the different flows and it really simple to implement, when you know how to use the Nuget package and use the correct Microsoft documentation. The application can request delegated access tokens On-Behalf-Of a user and another application, providing a seamless and secure access to protected resources using a zero trust strategy.</p>

 ASP.NET Core delegated Microsoft OBO access token management (Entra only) 
 



 Setup 



<p>Three applications can used in this setup. A web UI application, an API and another API which implements the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow for the users delegated access token and the application. The Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow">OBO</a> works very like part of the OAuth token exchange standard, but it is not a standard, just a Microsoft flavor for a standard.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for delegated downstream API user tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens. Microsoft.Identity.Web implements this completely as long as as authentication and OAuth flows are implemented using Entra ID.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 



 The application must handle a user logout 
 



 Web UI 



<p>The first step in the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow is to authenticate the user and a web application using Entra ID. This is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The Web application uses OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and a confidential client. The application requests an access token for the first API. The access token is a delegated access token issued for the user and the specific API. The implementation uses a secret to assert the application. Microsoft recommends using a certificate and client assertions when deploying to production.</p>


  builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

builder.Services.AddOptions();

string[]? initialScopes = builder.Configuration
	.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("WebApiEntraId:ScopeForAccessToken")?
	.Split(' ');

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
builder.Services
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration, 
		"EntraID",
        subscribeToOpenIdConnectMiddlewareDiagnosticsEvents: true)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddDistributedTokenCaches();

builder.Services
    .AddAuthorization(options =&gt;

    });

        options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
    }).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityConsentHandler();
  


<p>The WebApiEntraIdService class is used to use the access token from the web application and call the downstream API. If the access token is missing, or invalid, an new access token is requested in the application.</p>

        throw new ApplicationException($"Status code: {response.StatusCode}, Error: {response.ReasonPhrase}");
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Web API using On-Behalf-Of Flow 



<p>The first Web API implements the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow to acquire a new access token for the existing access token and the user represented in the access token. The access token is a delegated access token. The API has no UI and does not use any UI flows. If the access token used in the request is invalid, a 401 is returned with an exception information on what permission or access token is required to use the API. If the API is requested using a valid access token, the API application uses the default scope and requests a new access token using a secret or a certificate. The new access token can be used to access the downstream API.</p>

  builder.Services.AddControllers(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        // .RequireClaim("email") // disabled this to test with users that have no email (no license added)
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
builder.Services.AddOptions();

builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(
    builder.Configuration, "EntraID");
  


<p></p>



 Running the applications 



<p>When the applications are started, the data from the downstream APIs is returned to the web application.</p>

 Further examples of the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow 



<p>Microsoft authentication authorization libraries are complicated and many. They is no one way to implement this. Microsoft provides Microsoft Graph Nuget packages, Azure SDK packages, mixes application and delegation flows, managed identities solutions, direct token acquisition and some legacy Nuget packages to integrate the security. Here are further examples of using the Microsoft On-Behalf-Of flow using different client solutions. </p>

 Note 



<p>The Microsoft OBO flow is only used for integrating with Microsoft Entra. If using any other identity provider, the OAuth token exchange flow should be used for this type of solution.</p>

I've added a new feature to <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/">shot-scraper</a> that makes it easier to share scripts for other people to use with the <a>shot-scraper javascript</a> command.<p></p>
<p><code>shot-scraper javascript</code> lets you load up a web page in an invisible Chrome browser (via Playwright), execute some JavaScript against that page and output the results to your terminal. It's a fun way of running complex screen-scraping routines as part of a terminal session, or even chained together with other commands using pipes.</p>
<p>The <code>-i/--input</code> option lets you load that JavaScript from a file on disk - but now you can also use a <code>gh:</code> prefix to specify loading code from GitHub instead.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">the release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>shot-scraper javascript</code> can now optionally <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/javascript.html#running-javascript-from-github">load scripts hosted on GitHub</a> via the new <code>gh:</code> prefix to the <code>shot-scraper javascript -i/--input</code> option. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/173">#173</a></p>
<p>Scripts can be referenced as <code>gh:username/repo/path/to/script.js</code> or, if the GitHub user has created a dedicated <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repository and placed scripts in the root of it, using <code>gh:username/name-of-script</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to run this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts/blob/main/readability.js">readability.js</a> script against any web page you can use the following:</p>
 <code>shot-scraper javascript --input gh:simonw/readability \

</code>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts">simonw/shot-scraper-scripts</a> repo only has that one file in it so far, but I'm looking forward to growing that collection and hopefully seeing other people create and share their own <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repos as well.</p>

The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrapping Playwright, and it's pretty fascinating. 
 They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.

The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Model Context Protocol</a>) server wrapping Playwright, and it's pretty fascinating.<p></p>
<p>They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.</p>
<p>Trying it out is quite easy if you have Claude Desktop and Node.js installed already. Edit your <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> file:</p>
 <code>code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
</code> 
<p>And add this:</p>
  {
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}  

<p>Now when you launch Claude Desktop various new browser automation tools will be available to it, and you can tell Claude to navigate to a website and interact with it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I ran the following to get a list of the available tools:</p>
 <code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
cd playwright-mcp/src/tools
files-to-prompt . | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  'Output a detailed description of these tools'
</code> 
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/69200999149221c549c1f62e7befa20f">full output is here</a>, but here's the truncated tool list:</p>
<blockquote>
 Navigation Tools (<code>common.ts</code>) 
 
 browser_navigate: Navigate to a specific URL 
 browser_go_back: Navigate back in browser history 
 browser_go_forward: Navigate forward in browser history 
 browser_wait: Wait for a specified time in seconds 
 browser_press_key: Press a keyboard key 
 browser_save_as_pdf: Save current page as PDF 
 browser_close: Close the current page 
 
 Screenshot and Mouse Tools (<code>screenshot.ts</code>) 
 
 browser_screenshot: Take a screenshot of the current page 
 browser_move_mouse: Move mouse to specific coordinates 
 browser_click (coordinate-based): Click at specific x,y coordinates 
 browser_drag (coordinate-based): Drag mouse from one position to another 
 browser_type (keyboard): Type text and optionally submit 
 
 Accessibility Snapshot Tools (<code>snapshot.ts</code>) 
 
 browser_snapshot: Capture accessibility structure of the page 
 browser_click (element-based): Click on a specific element using accessibility reference 
 browser_drag (element-based): Drag between two elements 
 browser_hover: Hover over an element 
 browser_type (element-based): Type text into a specific element

   Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and Lighter 
The second big open weight LLM release from China today - the first being DeepSeek v3-0324. 
 Qwen's previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL, released in January in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.

  <p><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/">Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and Lighter</a></p>
The second big open weight LLM release from China today - the first being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/deepseek/">DeepSeek v3-0324</a>.<p></p>
<p>Qwen's previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">released in January</a> in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.</p>
<p>Today's Apache 2.0 licensed release is a 32B model, which is quickly becoming my personal favourite model size - large enough to have GPT-4-class capabilities, but small enough that on my 64GB Mac there's still enough RAM for me to run other memory-hungry applications like Firefox and VS Code.</p>
<p>Qwen claim that the new model (when compared to their previous 2.5 VL family) can "align more closely with human preferences", is better at "mathematical reasoning" and provides "enhanced accuracy and detailed analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual logic deduction".</p>
<p>They also offer some presumably carefully selected benchmark results showing it out-performing Gemma 3-27B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B and GPT-4o-0513 (there have been two more recent GPT-4o releases since that one, 2024-08-16 and 2024-11-20).</p>
<p>As usual, Prince Canuma had MLX versions of the models live within hours of the release, in <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit">4 bit</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-6bit">6 bit</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-8bit">8 bit</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-bf16">bf16</a> variants.</p>
<p>I ran the 4bit version (a 18GB model download) using <code>uv</code> and Prince's <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a> like this:</p>
  uv run --with 'numpy&lt;2' --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
    --max-tokens 1000 \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --prompt "Describe this image." \
    --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png  

<p>Here's the image:</p>
<p></p>
<p>And here's the resulting description, which I found to be very impressive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This image appears to be a map highlighting specific areas along the coastline, likely in California, based on the geographical features and place names. Here is a detailed description of the image:</p>
 
 
<p>Geographic Features:</p>
 
 The map shows a section of the coastline, with land on the right and the sea on the left. 
 The land area includes parts of SanMateo County, as noted in the top-right corner. 
 The coastline features several named locations, including:
 
 Point Montara 
 Pillar Point 
 Kings Rock 
 VicenteCreek 
 DennistonCreek 
 State Beach 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Highlighted Areas:</p>
 
 The map contains two distinct areas marked with different colors:
 
 
Red Area (Top Section)
 
 Labeled as "MONTARA" and "MONTARA M R" (possibly referring to a "Marine Reserves" or similar protected area). 
 This area is marked with a dark red color and extends from the coastline inland. 
 
 
 
Blue Area (Bottom Section)
 
 Labeled as "PILLAR" and "PILLAR P O I N T" along with "SMCA" (Special Management Area). 
 This area is marked with a blue color and is located closer to the coastline, including the area around "Pillar Point." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Depth Contours:</p>
 
 The map includes depth markings in the sea, indicating the bathymetrical features:
 
 
20 fathom (fm) line is marked in the upper-left part of the sea. 
 
10 fathom (fm) line is marked closer to the coastline. 
 
30 fathom (fm) line is marked further out to sea. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Other Features:</p>
 
 
State Beach: Marked near the top-right, indicating a protected recreational area. 
 
Kings Rock: A prominent feature near the coastline, likely a rocky outcropping. 
 
Creeks: The map shows several creeks, including VicenteCreek and DennistonCreek, which flow into the sea. 
 
 
 
<p>Protected Areas:</p>
 
 The map highlights specific protected areas:
 
 
Marine Reserves:
 
 "MONTARA M R" (Marine Reserves) in red. 
 
 
 
Special Management Area (SMCA)
 
 "PILLAR P O I N T" in blue, indicating a Special Management Area. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Grid and Coordinates:</p>
 
 The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude markings:
 
 Latitude ranges from approximately 37°25'N to 37°35'N. 
 Longitude ranges from approximately 122°22.5'W to 122°35.5'W. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Topography:</p>
 
 The land area shows topographic features, including elevations and vegetation, with green areas indicating higher elevations or vegetated land. 
 
 
 
<p>Other Labels:</p>
 
 
"SMR": Likely stands for "State Managed Reserves." 
 
"SMCA": Likely stands for "Special Management Control Area." 
 
 
 
<p>In summary, this map highlights specific protected areas along the coastline, including a red "Marine Reserves" area and a blue "Special Management Area" near "Pillar Point." The map also includes depth markings, geographical features, and place names, providing a detailed view of the region's natural and protected areas.</p>

<p>It included the following runtime statistics:</p>
 <code>Prompt: 1051 tokens, 111.985 tokens-per-sec
Generation: 760 tokens, 17.328 tokens-per-sec
Peak memory: 21.110 GB

Summit</a> at PGConf.dev on May 13. I once again inaugurated the series
with a short talk on the State of the Extension Ecosystem. The talk was
followed by 15 minutes or so of discussion. Here are the relevant links:</p>

 State of the Extensions Ecosystem 
<p>So I wanted to give a brief update on the state of the Postgres extension
ecosystem, the past, present, and future. Let’s give a brie history; it’s
quite long, actually.</p>
<p>There were originally two approaches back in the day. You could use shared
preload libraries to have it preload dynamic shareable libraries into the main
process. And then you could do pure SQL stuff using, including procedural
languages like PL/Perl, PL/Tcl, and such.</p>
<p>And there were a few intrepid early adopters, including PostGIS, BioPostgres,
PL/R, PL/Proxy, and pgTAP, who all made it work. Beginning of Postgres 9.1
Dimitri Fontaine added support for explicit support for extensions in the
Postgres core itself. The key features included the ability to compile and
install extensions. This is again, pure SQL and shared libraries.</p>
<p>There are <code>CREATE</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DROP EXTENSION</code> commands in SQL that you
can use to add extensions to a database, upgrade them to new versions and to
remove them. And then <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code> support so that extensions
could be considered a single bundle to be backed up and restored with all of
their individual objects being included as part of the backup.</p>
<p>Back then, a number of us, myself included, saw this as an opportunity to have
the extensibility of Postgres itself be a fundamental part of the community
and distribution. I was a long time user of Perl and used CPAN, and I thought
we had something like CPAN for Postgres. So, I proposed <a href="https://pgxn.org/">PGXN</a>, the
PostgreSQL Extension Network, back in 2010. The idea was to do distribution of
source code. You would register namespaces for your extensions.</p>
<p>There was discovery via a website for search, documentation published, tags to
help you find different kinds of objects, and to support installation through
a command line interface. The compile and install stuff that Postgres itself
provides, using PGXS and Configure.</p>
<p>This is what PGXN looks like today. It was launched in 2011. There’s a command
line client, this website, an API an a registry you can upload your extensions
to. The most recent one was <code>pg_task</code> a day or so ago.</p>
<p>In the interim, since that came out in 2011/2012, the cloud providers have
come into their own with Postgres, but their support for extensions tends to
be rather limited. For non-core extension counts, as of yesterday, Azure
provides 38 extensions, GCP provides 44 extensions, and AWS 51. These are the
third party extensions that don’t come with Postgres and its contrib itself.
Meanwhile, PGXN has 420 extensions available to download, compile, build, and
install.</p>
<p>A GitHub project that tracks random extensions on the internet,
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">joelonsql/PostgreSQL-EXTENSIONs.md</a>), which is pretty comprehensive,
has almost 1200 extensions listed. So the question is why is the support not
more broad? Why aren’t there a thousand extensions available in every one of
these systems?</p>
<p>Rthis has been a fairly common question that’s come up in the last couple
years. A number of new projects have tired to fill in the gaps. One is
<a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">Trusted Language Extensions</a>. They wanted to make it easier to
distribute extensions without needing dynamic shared libraries by adding
additional features in the database itself.</p>
<p>The idea was to empower app developers to make it easy to install extensions
via SQL functions rather than having to access the file system of the database
server system itself. It can be portable, so there’s no compilation required,
it hooks into the create extension command transparently, supports custom data
types, and there have been plans for foreign data wrappers and background
workers. I’m not sure how that’s progressed in the past year. The <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">pg_tle</a>
extension itself was created by AWS and Supabase.</p>
<p>Another recent entrant in tooling for extensions is <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>, which is native
Rust extensions in Postgres. You build dynamic shared libraries, but write
them in pure Rust. The API for pgrx provides full access to Postgres features,
and still provides the developer-friendly tooling that Rust developers are
used to. There’s been a lot of community excitement the last couple of years
around pgrx, and it remains under active development — version 0.13.0 just
came out a week or so ago. It’s sponsored and run out of the PgCentral
Foundation.</p>
<p>There have also been a several new registries that have come up to try to fill
the gap and make extensions available. They have emphasized different things
than PGXN. One was ease of use. So, for example, here <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> says it should
be really easy to install a client in a single command, and then it installs
something, and then it downloads and installs a binary version of your an
extension.</p>
<p>And then there was platform neutrality. They wanted to do binary distribution
and support multiple different platform, to know what binary∑ to install for a
given platform. They provide stats. PGXN doesn’t provide any stats, but some
of them are list stats like how many downloads we had, how many in the last
180 days.</p>
<p>And curation. Trunk is another binary extension registry, from my employer,
Tembo. They do categorization of all the extensions on Trunk, which is at 237
now. Quite a few people have come forward to tells us that they don’t
necessarily use Trunk to install extensions, but use them to find them,
because the categories are really helpful for people to figure out what sorts
of things are even available, and an option to use.</p>
<p>So here’s the State of the Ecosystem as I see it today.</p>
 
 
<p>There have been some lost opportunities from the initial excitement around
2010. Extensions remain difficult to find and discover. Some are on PGXN,
some are on GitHub, some are on Trunk, some are on GitLab, etc. There’s no
like one place to go to find them all.</p>
 
 
<p>They remain under-documented and difficult to understand. It takes effort
for developers to write documentation for their extensions, and a lot of
them aren’t able to. Some of them do write the documentation, but they
might be in a format that something like PGXN doesn’t understand.</p>
 
 
<p>The maturity of extensions can be difficult to gauge. If you look at that
<a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">list of 1200 extensions</a> on GitHub, which ones are the good ones?
Which ones do people care about? That page in particular show the number
of stars for each extension, but that the only metric.</p>
 
 
<p>They’re difficult to configure and install. This is something TLE really
tried to solve, but the uptake on TLE has not been great so far, and it
doesn’t support all the use cases. There are a lot of use cases that need
to be able to access the internal APIs of Postgres itself, which means
compiling stuff into shared libraries, and writing them in C or Rust or a
couple of other compiled languages.</p>
<p>That makes them difficult to configure. You have ask questions lik: Which
build system do I use? Do I install the tooling? How do I install it and
configure it? What dependencies does it have? Et cetera.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s no comprehensive binary packaging. The Postgres community’s own
packaging systems for Linux — Apt, and YUM — do a remarkably good job
of packaging extensions. They probably have more extensions packaged for
those platforms than any of the others. If they have the extension you
need and you’re using the PGDG repositories, then this stuff is there. But
even those are still like a fraction of all the potential available
extensions that are out there.</p>
 
 
<p>Dependency management can be pretty painful. It’s difficult to know what
you need to install. I was messing around  yesterday with the PgSQL HTTP
extension, which is a great extension that depends on libcurl. I thought
maybe I could build a package that includes libcurl as part of it. But
then I realized that libcurl depends on other packages, other dynamic
libraries. So I’d have to figure out what all those are to get them all
together.</p>
<p>A lot of that goes away if you use a system like apt or yum. But if you,
if you don’t, or you just want to install stuff on your Mac or Windows,
it’s much more difficult.</p>
 
 
<p>Centralized source distribution, we’ve found found, is insufficient. Even
if all the extensions were available on PGXN, not everybody has the
wherewithal or the expertise to find what they need, download it, compile
it, and build it. Moreover, you don’t want to have a compiler on your
production system, so you don’t want to be building stuff from source on
your production system. So then you have to get to the business of
building your own packages, which is a whole thing.</p>
 
 
<p>But in this state of the extension ecosystem we see new opportunities too. One
I’ve been working on for the past year, which we call “PGXN v2”, is made
possible by my employer, Tembo. The idea was to consider the emerging patterns
— new registries and new ways of building and releasing and developing
extensions — and to figure out the deficiencies, and to engage deeply with
the community to work up potential solutions, and to design and implement a
new architecture. The idea is to serve the community for the next decade
really make a PGXN and its infrastructure the source of record for extensions
for Postgres.</p>
<p>In the past year, I did a bunch of design work on it. Here’s a high level
architectural view. We’d have a root registry, which is still the source code
distribution stuff. There’s a web UX over it that would evolve from the
current website. And there’s a command line client that knows how to build
extensions from the registry.</p>
<p>But in addition to those three parts, which we have today, we would evolve a
couple of additional parts.</p>
 
 
<p>One is “interactions”, so that when somebody releases a new extension on
PGXN, some notifications could go out through webhooks or some sort of
queue so that downstream systems like the packaging systems could know
something new has come out and maybe automate building and updating their
packages.</p>
 
 
<p>There could be “stats and reports”, so we can provide data like how many
downloads there are, what binary registries make them available, what
kinds of reviews and quality metrics rate them. We can develop these stats
and display those on the website.</p>
 
 
<p>And, ideally, a “packaging registry” for PGXN to provide binary packages
for all the major platforms of all the extensions we can, to simplify the
installation of extensions for anybody who needs to use them. For
extensions that aren’t available through PGDG or if you’re not using that
system and you want to install extensions. Late last year, I was focused
on figuring out how t build the packaging system.</p>
 
 
<p>Another change that went down in the past year was the Extension Ecosystem
Summit itself. This took place at PGConf.Dev last May. The idea was for a
community of people to come together to collaborate, examine ongoing work in
the extension distribution, examine challenges, identify questions, propose
solutions, and agree on directions for execution. Let’s take a look at the
topics that we covered last year at the summit.</p>
 
 
<p>One was extension metadata, where the topics covered included packaging
and discoverability, extension development, compatibility and taxonomies
as being important to represent a metadata about extensions — as well as
versioning standards. One of the outcomes was <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">an RFC</a> for
version two of the PGXN metadata that incorporates a lot of those needs
into a new metadata format to describe extensions more broadly.</p>
 
 
<p>Another topic was the binary distribution format and what it should look
like, if we were to have major, distribution format. We talked about being
able to support multiple versions of an extension at one time. There was
some talk about the Python Wheel format as a potential precedent for
binary distribution of code.</p>
<p>There’s also an idea to distribute extensions through Docker containers,
also known as the <a href="https://opencontainers.org">Open Container Initiative</a>. Versioning came up
here, as well. One of the outcomes from this session was another PGXN <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/2" title="RFC: Binary Distribution Format">RFC
for binary distribution</a>, which was inspired by Python Wheel among other
stuff.</p>
<p>I wanted to give <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI (Demo)">a brief demo</a> build on that format. I hacked
some changes into the PGXS <code>Makefile</code> to add a new target, <code>trunk</code> that
builds a binary package called a “trunk” and uploads it to an OCI registry
for distribution. <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI (Demo)">Here’s what it looks like</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>On my Mac I was compiling my semver extension. Then I go into a Linux
container and compile it again for Linux using the <code>make trunk</code>
command. The result is two <code>.trunk</code> files, one for Postgres 16 on
Darwin and one for Postgres 16 on Linux.</p>
 
 
<p>There are also some JSON files that are annotations specifically for
OCI. We have a command where we can push these images to an OCI
registry.</p>
 
 
<p>Then we can then use an install command that knows to download and
install the version of the build appropriate for this platform
(macOS). And then I go into Linux and do the same thing. It also
knows, because of the OCI standard, what the platform is, and so it
installs the appropriate binary.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another topic was ABI and API compatibility. There was some talk at the
Summit about what is the definition of an ABI and an API and how do we
define internal APIs and their use? Maybe there’s some way to categorize
APIs in Postgres core for red, green, or in-between, something like that.
There was desire to have more hooks available into different parts of the
system.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of this session was that I worked with Peter
Eisentraut on some stability guidance for the API and ABI that is now
committed in the docs. You can <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-API-ABI-STABILITY-GUIDANCE" title="Postgres Docs: Server API and ABI Stability Guidance">read them now</a> on in the developer docs,
they’ll be part of the Postgres 18 release. The idea is that minor version
releases should be safe to use with other minor versions. If you compiled
your extension against one minor version, it should be perfectly
compatible with other minor versions of the same major release.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was a release earlier this year, like two weeks after
Peter committed this, where there was an API break. It’s the first time in
like 10 years. Robert Treat and I spent quite a bit of time trying to look
for a previous time that happened. I think there was one about 10 years
ago, but then this one happened and, notably it broke the Timescale
database. The Core Team decided to release a fix just a week later to
restore the ABI compatibility.</p>
<p>So it’s clear that even though there’s guidance, you should in general
be able to rely on it, and it was a motivating factor for the a new
release to fix an ABI break, there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>Another thing that might happen is that I <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/GSoC_2025#ABI_Compliance_Checker" title="PostgreSQL Wiki/GSoC 2025: ABI Compliance Checker">proposed a Google Summer of
Code project to build an ABI checker service</a>. Peter
[embarrassing forgetfulness and misattributed national identity omitted]
Geoghegan <a href="https://postgr.es/m/CAH2-Wzm-W6hSn71sUkz0Rem=qDEU7TnFmc7_jG2DjrLFef_WKQ@mail.gmail.com">POC’d an ABI checker</a> in 2023. The project is to take Peter’s
POC and build something that could potentially run on every commit or push
to the back branches of the project. Maybe it could be integrated into the
build farm so that, if there’s a back-patch to an earlier branch and it
turns red, they quickly the ABI was broken. This change could potentially
provide a higher level of guarantee — even if they don’t end up using
the word “guarantee” about the stability of the ABIs and APIs. I’m hoping
this happens; a number of people have asked about it, and at least one
person has written an application.</p>
 
 
<p>Another topic at the summit last year was including or excluding
extensions in core. They’ve talked about when to add something to core,
when to remove something from core,  whether items in contrib should
actually be moved into core itself, and whether to move metadata about
extensions into catalog. And once again, support for multiple versions
came up; this is a perennial challenge! But I’m not aware of much work on
these questions. I’m wondering if it’s time for a revisit,</p>
 
 
<p>As a bonus item — this wasn’t a formal topic at the summit last year,
but it came up many times in the mini-summits — is the challenge of
packaging and lookup. There’s only one path to extensions in <code>SHAREDIR</code>.
This creates a number of difficulties. Christoph Berg has a patch for a
PGDG and Debian that adds a second directory. This allowed the PGDG stuff
to actually run tests against extensions without changing the core
installation of the Postgres service itself. Another one is <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="Run PostgreSQL. The Kubernetes way.">Cloud Native
Postgres</a> immutability. If that directory is part of the image, for
your CloudNative Postgres, you can’t install extensions into it.</p>
<p>It’s a similar issue, for <a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a> immutability. Postgres.app is a
Mac app, and it’s signed by a  certificate provided by Apple. But that
means that if you install an extension in its <code>SHAREDIR</code>, it changes the
signature of the application and it won’t start. They work around this
issue through a number of symlink shenanigans, but these issues could be
solved by allowing extension to be installed in multiple locations.</p>
<p>Starting with Christoph’s search path patch and a number of discussions we
had at PGConf last year, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut</a> has been working on a search
path patch to the core that would work similar to shared preload
libraries, but it’s for finding extension control files. This would allow
you to have them in multiple directories and it will find them in path.</p>
<p>Another interesting development in this line has been, the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="Run PostgreSQL. The Kubernetes way.">CloudNativePG</a> project has been using that extension search path
patch to prototype a new feature coming to Kubernetes that allows one to
mount a volume that’s actually another Docker image. If you have your
extension distributed as an OCI image, you can specify that it be mounted
and installed via your CNPG cluster configuration. That means when CNPG
spins up, it puts the extension in the right place. It updates the search
path variables and stuff just works.</p>
<p>A lot of the thought about the stuff went into a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/rfc-extension-packaging-lookup/" title="RFC: Extension Packaging &amp; Lookup">less formal RFC</a> I wrote
up in my blog, rather than on PGXN. The idea is to take these improvements
and try to more formally specify the organization of extensions separate
from how Postgres organizes shared libraries and shared files.</p>
 
 
<p>I said, we’re bringing the Extension Summit back! There will be another
Extension Summit hosted our team of organizers, myself, Floor, Keith Fiske
from Crunchy Data, and Yurii from Omnigres. That will be on May 13th in the
morning at <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev" title="PostgreSQL Development Conference 2025">PGConf.dev</a>; we appreciate their support.</p>
<p>The idea of these Mini Summits is to bring up a number of topics of interest.
Have somebody come and do a 20 or 40 minute talk about it, and then we can
have discussion about implications.</p>
<p>Floor mentioned the schedule, but briefly:</p>
 
 March 12: <a href="https://justatheory.com/">David Wheeler</a>, PGXN: “State of the Extension Ecosystem” 
 March 24: <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut</a>, Core Team: “Implementing an Extension Search Path” 
 April 9: <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/author/christoph_berg/">Christoph Berg</a>, Debian: “Apt Extension Packaging” 
 April 23: 
 May 7: <a href="https://www.gabrielebartolini.it">Gabriele Bartolini</a>, CNPG “Extension Management in CloudNativePG” 
 
<p>So, what are your interests in extensions and how they can be improved. There
are a lot of potential topics to talk about at the Summit or at these Mini
Summits: development tools, canonical registry, how easy it is to publish,
continuous delivery, yada, yada, yada, security scanning — all sorts of
stuff that could go into conceiving, designing, developing, distributing
extensions for Postgres.</p>
<p>I hoe you all will participate. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to
me for half an hour. So I’d like to turn it over to, discussion, if people
would like to join in, talk about implications of stuff. Also, we can get to
any questions here.</p>
 Questions, comments, shout-outs 
<p>Floor: David, at one point you talked about, metadata taxonomy. If you can
elaborate on that a little bit, that’s Peter’s question.</p>
<p>David: So one that people told me that they found useful was one provided by
<a href="https://pgt.dev">Trunk</a>. So it has these limited number of categories, so if you’re interested
in machine learning stuff, you could go to the <a href="https://pgt.dev/?cat=machine_learning" title="Trunk Categories: Machine Learning">machine learning</a> stuff and it
shows you what extensions are potentially available. They have 237 extensions
on Trunk now.</p>
<p>PGXN itself allows arbitrary tagging of stuff. It builds <a href="https://pgxn.org/tags" title="PGXN: Release Tags">this little tag
cloud</a>. But if I look at this one here, you can see <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/uint128/1.0.1/" title="PGXN: uint128 v1.0.1">this one</a> has a bunch of
tags. These are arbitrary tags that are applied by the author. The current
metadata looks <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/uint128/uint128-1.0.1/META.json" title="PGXN: uint128 v1.0.1 META.json">like this</a>. It’s just plain JSON, and it has a list of tags.
The <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="RFC: Meta Spec v2">PGXN Meta v2 RFC</a> has a bunch of examples. It’s an evolution of
that <code>META.json</code>, so the idea is to have a classifications that includes tags
as before, but also adds categories, which are a limited list that would be
controlled by the core [he means “root”] registry:</p>
  <code>{
  "classifications": {
    "tags": [
      "testing",
      "pair",
      "parameter"
    ],
    "categories": [
      "Machine Learning"
    ]
  }
}
</code>   Announcements 
<p>Yurii made a number of announcements, summarizing:</p>
 
 
<p>There is a new library that they’ve been developing at Omnigres that
allows you to develop Postgres extensions in C++. For people who are
interested in developing extensions in C++ and gaining the benefits of
that and not having to do all the tedious things that we have to do with C
extensions: look for <a href="https://cppgres.org">Cppgres</a>. Yurii thinks that within a couple of
months it will reach parity with pgrx.</p>
<p>David: So it sounds like it would work more closely to the way PGXS and
C works. Whereas pgrx has all these additional Rust crates you have to
load and like slow compile times and all these dependencies.</p>
<p>Yurii: This is just like a layer over the C stuff, an evolution of that.
It’s essentially a header only library, so it’s a very common thing in the
C++ world. So you don’t have to build anything and you just include a
file. And in fact the way I use it, I amalgamate all the header files that
we have into one. Whenever I include it in the project, I just copy the
amalgamation and it’s just one file. You don’t have any other build chain
associated yet. It is C++ 20, which some people consider new, but by the
time it’s mature it’s already five years old and most compilers support
it. They have decent support of C++ 20 with a few exclusions, but those
are relatively minor. So for that reason, it’s not C++ 23, for example,
because it’s not very well supported across compilers, but C++ 20 is.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii is giving a talk about <a href="https://github.com/postgres-pm/pgpm">PostgresPM</a> at the Postgres Conference in
Orlando. He’ll share the slides and recording with this group. The idea
behind PostgresPM is that it takes a lot of heuristics, takes the URLs of
packages and of extensions and creates packages for different outputs like
for Red Hat, for Debian, perhaps for some other formats in the future. It
focuses on the idea that a lot of things can be figured out.</p>
<p>For example: do we have a new version? Well, we can look at list of tags
in the Git repo. Very commonly that works for say 80 percent of
extensions. Do we need a C compiler? We can see whether we have C files.
We can figure out a lot of stuff without packagers having to specify that
manually every time they have a new extension. And they don’t have to
repackage every time there is a new release, because we can detect new
releases and try to build.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii is also running an event that, while not affiliated with PGConf.dev,
is strategically scheduled to happen one day before PGConf.dev: <a href="https://pgext.day">Postgres
Extensions Day</a>. The Call for Speakers is open until April 1st. There’s
also an option for people who cannot or would not come to Montreal this
year to submit a prerecorded talk. The point of the event is not just to
bring people together, but also ti surface content that can be interesting
to other people. The event itself is free.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure to join our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/postgres-extensions-ecosystem-mini-summits/" title="Postgres Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit on Meetup">Meetup group</a> and join us live, March 26,
when <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut</a> joins us to talk about implementing an extension search

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek just released the latest version of their enormous DeepSeek v3 model, baking the release date into the name <code>DeepSeek-V3-0324</code>.<p></p>
<p>The license is MIT (that's new - previous DeepSeek v3 had a custom license), the README is empty and the release adds up a to a total of 641 GB of files, mostly of the form <code>model-00035-of-000163.safetensors</code>.</p>
<p>The model only came out a few hours ago and MLX developer Awni Hannun already <a href="https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1904177084609827054">has it running</a> at &gt;20 tokens/second on a 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio ($9,499 of ostensibly consumer-grade hardware) via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-lm/">mlx-lm</a> and this <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit">mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit</a> 4bit quantization, which reduces the on-disk size to 352 GB.</p>
<p>I think that means if you have that machine you can run it with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin like this, but I've not tried myself!</p>
 <code>llm mlx download-model mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
</code> 
<p>The new model is also <a href="https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">listed on OpenRouter</a>. You can try a chat at <a href="https://openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the chat interface <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ce2bf5836743dfaf07d994578b261ba">gave me</a> for "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle":</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have two API keys with OpenRouter - one of them worked with the model, the other gave me a <code>No endpoints found matching your data policy</code> error - I think because I had a setting on that key disallowing models from training on my activity. The key that worked was a free key with no attached billing credentials.</p>
<p>For my working API key the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin let me run a prompt like this:</p>
 <code>llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste key here
llm -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free "best fact about a pelican"
</code> 
<p>Here's that "best fact" - the terminal output included Markdown and an emoji combo, here that's rendered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most fascinating facts about pelicans is their unique throat pouch, called a gular sac, which can hold up to 3 gallons (11 liters) of water—three times more than their stomach!  </p>
<p>Here’s why it’s amazing:<br>
- Fishing Tool: They use it like a net to scoop up fish, then drain the water before swallowing.<br>
- Cooling Mechanism: On hot days, pelicans flutter the pouch to stay cool by evaporating water.<br>
- Built-in "Shopping Cart": Some species even use it to carry food back to their chicks.  </p>
<p>Bonus fact: Pelicans often fish cooperatively, herding fish into shallow water for an easy catch.  </p>
<p>Would you like more cool pelican facts? 🐦🌊</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In putting this post together I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/fc65bf9b-ae2d-4b23-bd09-ed0d54ff4b56">got Claude</a> to build me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/huggingface-storage">this new tool</a> for finding the total on-disk size of a Hugging Face repository, which is available in their API but not currently displayed on their website.</p>
<p>Update: Here's a notable independent benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1904304052500148423">from Paul Gauthier</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DeepSeek's new V3 scored 55% on aider's <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">polyglot benchmark</a>, significantly improving over the prior version. It's the #2 non-thinking/reasoning model, behind only Sonnet 3.7. V3 is competitive with thinking models like R1 &amp; o3-mini.</p>

<p>デジタル学生証明による学割サービスの話は、かなり前から検討されている話題です。わたしの周りでも、遅くとも2012年には Student Identity Trust Framework として国立情報学研究所（NII）との間で検討がなされてきました。</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2012/05/6813/">学生 ID 向けトラストフレームワークの概要と未来展望</a> (2012.5) 



 <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2012/12/6819/">学術認証フェデレーションが切り開く大学間連携の新時代</a> (2012.12) 



 <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2016/10/6828/">学認システムと学割サービス連携の新時代：トラストフレームワークが実現する便利で安全な学生生活</a> (2016.10） 
 



<p>今回発表されたものは、これらの線上に乗りながら、実装技術としてマイナンバーカードやデジタル認証アプリ、Microsoft Authenticator とVCを取り入れたものになっています。ある意味、紙やカードのアナロジーに載せることで一般の経験則的に「分かりやすく」なったところもあるかもしれません。以下はその概要です。</p>



 概要 



<p>JR西日本とデジタル庁は、大学生の在学証明確認にマイナンバーカードを活用する実証実験を大阪駅で実施しました。本実験は、学生がオンラインでデジタル在学証明書を取得し、デジタル乗車券購入時の本人確認にマイナンバーカードを用いることで、従来の紙の在学証明書提示による窓口手続きを不要とし、利便性向上と業務効率化を目指すものです。国立情報学研究所（NII）が提供するサービスとJR西日本のデジタルプラットフォーム「WESTER」の連携も視野に入れ、将来的には他の公共機関やサービスへの応用も目指しています。</p>



<p>発表されたのは主に以下のような項目です。</p>



 1. マイナンバーカードを活用した在学証明のデジタル化 



 
 従来、学生が学割乗車券を購入する際には、紙の在学証明書を駅の窓口で提示する必要がありました。 



 本実証実験では、学生がオンラインでデジタル在学証明書を取得し、マイナンバーカードを本人確認に利用することで、この手続きをオンラインで完結させます。 



 日経新聞の記事では、実証実験の様子として「マイナカードで在学証明を確認して購入したウェブ乗車券」の写真が掲載されています。 



 JR西日本のプレスリリースによると、学生はまず「デジタル認証アプリ」と「Microsoft Authenticator」をスマートフォンにダウンロードし、大学のウェブシステムで在学証明情報を取得、それをMicrosoft Authenticatorと連携させる流れとなります。 
 



<p>細かい流れは以下の図表１通りです。</p>



<p>図表１：JR西日本プレスリリースによる流れ</p>



 
 「デジタル認証アプリ」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-6825" title="マイナンバーカードを使った本人確認を、安全・簡単にするためのアプリ。デジタル庁提供。OpenID Connectを使っている。">1</a>「Microsoft Authenticator」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-6825" title="マイクロソフト社が提供するパスワードを使用せずにすべてのアカウントにサインインするのに役立つ無料アプリ。ワンタイムパスワードの発行によく使われる。Verifiable Credential も格納可能">2</a>をスマートフォンにダウンロード 



 大学のウェブシステムに学生がログインし国立情報学研究所(NII)が提供する在学証明情報を取得 



 取得した在学証明情報を Microsoft Authenticator と連携し、情報を学生が保有するスマートフォンに格納 



 JR 西日本がサービス提供する電子チケット販売プラットフォーム「<a href="https://www.wow-tomo-ticket.jp/">まちのヲトモパスポート</a>」に「デジタル認証アプリ」でログイン 



 「デジタル認証アプリ」が立ち上がり学生本人のマイナンバーカードを読み取り認証を実施し、MAB<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6825/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-6825" title="Mobility Auth Bridge。利用者が同意すれば、1つのIDでMABに参画する自治体や企業のさまざまなサービスをご利用いただけるセキュアなIDサービスです。地域のインフラを支えるJR西日本が、NTTコミュニケーションズ株式会社（本社：東京都千代田区、代表取締役社長：小島克重）及伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社（本社：東京都港区、代表取締役社長：新宮達史）の支援を受け、国内鉄道事業者として初めて、デジタル社会に必要なインフラ基盤をアズ・ア・サービス化したものです。ユーザーファーストの思想を念頭に利用者が一つのIDで、どこでも、さまざまな利用サービスを選択することによって、移動・暮らしがより便利でおトクになります。また、導入する自治体や企業は、MABの利用によりデジタルサービスの個客データ収集・利活用ができることから、データインフォームドによる新たな価値の創出による地域への貢献が可能となります。">3</a> に登録した情報と本人情報が同一であることを確認

<p>個人的に注意を引いた点としては、以下があります。</p>



 
 いわゆる認証連携ベース（SAMLやOpenID Connect）でやるのに比べて、図表１では手順3, 6 が増えている。その代わり、大学は学生がどこで学割を使ったかがわからないようになっている。（逆に言えば、大学にわかっても良ければこのステップは省略できる。） 



 このプレスリリースからは発行された在学証明情報がどのように失効させられるかがわからない。（やりかたによっては、大学に証明書利用がわかってしまうようになるので要注意。おそらく、VC Status List あたりを使うのであろう。） 



 いわゆる、属性ベースの名寄せを利用している。このためにマイナンバーカードとデジタル認証アプリを使っている。（そもそも、大学発行の証明書を信じることにすれば、マイナンバーカードからの基本４情報は不必要なはず。お一人様一回限りをやるなら、デジタル認証アプリの発行する利用し識別子の値（<code>sub</code>値）だけで十分なはず。複数の学校に所属しているようなケースを例外として忘れることにすれば、それすらも要らないはず。） 
 



 2. オンラインでの学割乗車券購入と顔認証による改札通過 



 
 実証実験では、大阪大学の学生が購入したデジタル乗車券を使用し、顔認証で改札口を通過しました。 



 阪大大学院の武内祐哉さんは「すべてオンラインで完結してスムーズに改札に入れた」と、その利便性を語っています（<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）。 
 



<p>※ 顔認証に使う顔画像をどのステップで取得したのかがよくわからないので、そこは聞いてみたいところです。</p>



 3. 関係機関の連携 



 
 本実証実験は、デジタル庁の公募事業としてJR西日本が採択され、国立情報学研究所（NII）が提供するデジタル在学証明書発行サービスを利用して行われました。 



 デジタル庁の岸信千世大臣政務官は「将来的には複数の大学や公共機関での応用をめざしたい」と述べており、連携の重要性が示唆されています（<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）。 
 



 4. JR西日本の狙いと今後の展望 



 
 JR西日本は、窓口業務の効率化に加え、「学生など若い人との接点を増やしてサービスを深化させたい」（JR西日本デジタルソリューション本部長 奥田英雄氏、<a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF238T00T20C25A3000000/">日経新聞</a>）と考えています。 



 2026年初頭にも大阪大学との間で、マイナンバーカードを用いた在学証明の本格的な開始を目指しています。 



 将来的には、JR西日本グループ共通ID「WESTER」との連携によるサービス拡大も検討されています。 



 <a href="https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1672015.html">ケータイ Watch</a>の記事では、本実証実験が「現在も多くの在学証明書が紙で発行されている状況を踏まえ、その代表的な事例として選ばれたもの」と説明されており、全国の大学への普及や他の資格情報への応用も視野に入れていることがわかります。 



 <a href="https://www.westjr.co.jp/press/article/items/250324_00_press_Mynumbercard_gakuseikatuyou.pdf">JR西日本プレスリリース</a>では、2025年度に大阪大学と連携し、学生にとって分かりやすく使いやすいスキームへの改良を進める方針が示されています。 



 長期的には、交通機関だけでなく、レンタカー、バス、航空券、美術館など幅広い分野での活用も見据えています（<a href="https://k-tai.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1672015.html">ケータイ Watch</a>）。 
 



 5. 技術基盤「Mobility Auth Bridge (MAB)」の活用 



 
 JR西日本のプレスリリースによると、本実証実験では、KANSAI MaaSでも導入されている「Mobility Auth Bridge（MAB）」というID基盤が活用されています。 



 MABは、利用者の同意があれば、一つのIDで様々なサービスを利用できるセキュアなIDサービスであり、デジタル社会に必要なインフラ基盤としてJR西日本がNTTコミュニケーションズ、伊藤忠テクノソリューションズの支援を受けて開発したものです。 



 MABの活用により、デジタルサービスの個客データ収集・利活用が可能となり、地域への貢献も期待されています。 
 



 6. SDGsへの貢献 



 
 JR西日本のプレスリリースでは、今回の取り組みがSDGsの目標のうち、特に「3. すべての人に健康と福祉を」「9. 産業と技術革新の基盤をつくろう」「11. 住み続けられるまちづくりを」「17. パートナーシップで目標を達成しよう」に貢献するとの考えが示されています。

I learned about this term today while complaining about how the definition of "vibe coding" is already being distorted to mean "any time an LLM writes code" as opposed to the intended meaning of "code I wrote with an LLM without even reviewing what it wrote".

I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattchughes.ca/post/3ll2sbdky3k2y">learned about</a> this term today while complaining about how the definition of "vibe coding" is already being distorted to mean "any time an LLM writes code" as opposed to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">the intended meaning</a> of "code I wrote with an LLM without even reviewing what it wrote".<p></p>
<p>I posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3ll2rtxeucs2e">this salty note</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feels like I'm losing the battle on this one, I keep seeing people use "vibe coding" to mean any time an LLM is used to write code</p>
<p>I'm particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear, widely accepted definition!</p>
<p>But it turns out people couldn't be trusted to read all the way to the end of Andrej's tweet, so now we are back to yet another term where different people assume it means different things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin Fowler coined Semantic Diffusion in 2006 with this very clear definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's happening with vibe coding right now is such a clear example of this effect in action! I've seen <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">the same thing happen</a> to my own coinage <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>This kind of dillution of meaning is frustrating, but does appear to be inevitable. As Martin Fowler points out it's most likely to happen to popular terms - the more popular a term is the higher the chance a game of telephone will ensue where misunderstandings flourish as the chain continues to grow.</p>
<p>Andrej Karpathy, who <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">coined</a> vibe coding, <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1903870973126045712">posted this</a> just now in reply to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good post! It will take some time to settle on definitions. Personally I use "vibe coding" when I feel like this dog. My iOS app last night being a good example. But I find that in practice I rarely go full out vibe coding, and more often I still look at the code, I add complexity slowly and I try to learn over time how the pieces work, to ask clarifying questions etc.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that vibe coding has an official illustrative GIF now!

<p>I nominate agency as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_the_year">Word of the Year</a> for 2025.</p>
<p>I don’t nominate agentic, which is suddenly <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=agentic&amp;hl=en">hot shit</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=agentic&amp;hl=en"></a></p>
<p>See, agency is a noun, and agentic is an adjective. And, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">Strunk and White</a> taught us,</p>
<blockquote><p>Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs… it is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness and color.</p></blockquote>
<p>The word agency is derived from the Latin&nbsp;agere, meaning&nbsp;to do. It speaks of our capacity to act with effect in the world. Or, in the words of the OED (the print version, not the website): Action or instrumentality embodied or personified as concrete existence.</p>
<p>In a chapter of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy"> The Intention Economy</a> titled Agency, I say this under a subhead titled The Argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Agency is personal. It is the source of confidence behind all intention. By its nature the networked marketplace welcomes full agency for customers. So, because the best vendors are customer driven, there will be many more ways for both vendors and customers to thrive in the networked marketplace, and therefore also in the Intention Economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later I add,</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Intention Economy, liberated customers enjoy full agency for themselves, and employ agents who respect and apply the powers that customers grant them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote that (and created the graphic at the top of this page) thirteen years ago, when nobody was talking about agency, but I thought somebody had to.</p>
<p>Now it seems everybody is talking about it. I am sure that’s because we have AI. Or, more specifically, agentic AI. That’s what makes agentic <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=agentic,agentic%20ai&amp;hl=en">so hot</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=agentic,agentic%20ai&amp;hl=en"></a></p>
<p>My concern with both agentic and agentic AI is that concentrating development on AI agents (and digital “twins”) alone may neglect, override, or obstruct the agency of human beings, rather than extending or enlarging it. (For more on this, read <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/agentic-ai-is-the-next-big-thing-but-im-not-sure-its-what-i-want/">Agentic AI Is the Next Big Thing but I’m Not Sure It’s What</a>, by <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/author/adam-davidson/">Adam Davidson</a> in&nbsp;How to Geek. Also check out my <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Personal AI series</a>, which addresses this issue most directly in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personal AI</a>.)</p>
<p>So, what will give you real agency—an archimedean lever that gives you enough leverage to move worlds?</p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">IEEE P7012</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” It has been in the works since 2017, and should be ready later this year. (I say this as chair of the standard’s working group.) The nickname for P7012 is MyTerms (much as the nickname for the IEEE’s 802.11 standard is Wi-Fi). The idea behind MyTerms is that the sites and services of the world should agree to your terms, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>MyTerms creates a new regime for privacy: one based on contract. With each MyTerm you are the first party. Not the website, the service, or the app maker. They are the second party. And terms can be friendly. For example, a prototype term called <a href="https://customercommons.org/agreements/p2b1/0.9/">NoStalking</a> says “Just show me ads not based on tracking me.” This is good for you, because you don’t get tracked, and good for the site because it leaves open the advertising option. NoStalking lives at <a href="https://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, much as personal copyrights live at <a href="https://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>. (Yes, the former is modeled on the latter.)</p>
<p>On the Creative Commons model, agreements take three forms:</p>
<p></p><a href="https://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/demos/license-layers/"></a>The MyTerms standard addresses just the Machine Readable layer. It also doesn’t say exactly what tools should be developed. Basically, it just says,<p></p>
 
 The person is the first party 
 The site, service or app is the second party 
 The person chooses an agreement from a limited roster (resembling Creative Commons’ roster of licenses) listed by a disinterested non-profit 
 Both sides keep an identical record of what they agreed to 
 
<p>On your side—the first-party side—browser makers can build something into their product, or any developer can make a browser add-on (Firefox) or extension (the rest of them). On the site’s side—the second-party side—CMS makers can build something in, or any developer can make a plug-in (WordPress) or a module (Drupal).</p>
<p>Mobile app toolmakers can also come up with something (or many things).</p>
<p>For the Legal Code and Human Readable layers, we (Customer Commons and <a href="https://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a>) have been at work on a list of prototypes for the roster of agreements. We’ll present these on April 7 at <a href="http://vrmday2025a.eventbrite.com">VRM Day</a>, at the <a href="https://computerhistory.org">Computer History Museum</a> in Silicon Valley. Discussion will happen both there and through the following three days in the same location at the 40th <a href="https://iiworkshop.org">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>. VRM Day is free. IIW isn’t, but is cheap for a three-day conference that (IMHO) is the most leveraged in the world.</p>
<p>So let’s make this happen and show the world what agency really means.</p>
<p>And, if you’re interested in helping support <a href="https://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>, use some of that agency to hit the Donate button on its home page. Thanks!</p>

   Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact 
Good, detailed write-up of the Next.js vulnerability CVE-2025-29927 by Allam Rachid, one of the researchers who identified the issue. 
 The vulnerability is best illustrated by this code snippet: 
  const subreq = params.request.headers['x-middleware-subrequest'];
const subrequests = typeof subreq === 'string' ? subreq.split(':') : [];

Good, detailed write-up of the Next.js vulnerability <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29927">CVE-2025-29927</a> by Allam Rachid, one of the researchers who identified the issue.<p></p>
<p>The vulnerability is best illustrated by <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.0.7/packages/next/server/next-server.ts#L686">this code snippet</a>:</p>
  const subreq = params.request.headers['x-middleware-subrequest'];
const subrequests = typeof subreq === 'string' ? subreq.split(':') : [];
// ...
for (const middleware of this.middleware || []) {
  // ...
  if (subrequests.includes(middlewareInfo.name)) {
    result = {
      response: NextResponse.next(),
      waitUntil: Promise.resolve(),
    };
    continue;
  }
}  
<p>This was part of Next.js internals used to help avoid applying middleware recursively to requests that are re-dispatched through the framework.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it also meant that attackers could send a <code>x-middleware-subrequest</code> HTTP header with a colon-separated list of middleware names to skip. If a site used middleware to apply an authentication gate (as suggested <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication#protecting-your-routes-with-nextjs-middleware">in the Next.js documentation</a>) an attacker could bypass that authentication using this trick.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js 15.2.3 - here's the <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927">official release announcement</a> talking about the problem.

<p>Update 25th March 2025: The first version of this included all 160+ models in a single feed. I've upgraded the script to output two feeds - the original <a href="https://simonw.github.io/ollama-models-atom-feed/atom.xml">atom.xml</a> one and a new <a href="https://simonw.github.io/ollama-models-atom-feed/atom-recent-20.xml">atom-recent-20.xml</a> feed containing just the most recent 20 items.</p>

 <code>cat to_atom.py | llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \

<p>LLM tools (like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">web_search</a>) usually involve some kind of implementation - the model requests a tool execution, then an external harness goes away and executes the specified tool and feeds the result back into the conversation.</p>
<p>The "think" tool is a no-op - there is no implementation, it just allows the model to use its existing training in terms of when-to-use-a-tool to stop and dump some additional thoughts into the context.</p>
<p>This works completely independently of the new "thinking" mechanism introduced <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#extended-thinking-mode">in Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>.</p>
<p>Anthropic's benchmarks show impressive improvements from enabling this tool. I fully anticipate that models from other providers would benefit from the same trick.

<p>Care to report on that, Lucas? If you do, you won’t be the first. That was Farhad Monjoo, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">here</a>, six years ago in The New York Times. You’ll be the second.</p>

Everybody I know who uses it gushes about all the amazing things it can do. I mean, a lot. A company CEO says it produces marvels with sales and usage data, with forecasting, with you-name-it. A law professor says it radically improves her job in almost every way. An innovation director says “It will change your life.” But there is push-back, naturally, on the usual AI threat: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openais-deep-research-agent-is-coming-for-white-collar-work/">it will cost jobs</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America">Voice of America</a> is silent.</p>
<p>To Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Kari Lake (who now runs its corpse), the VOA was corrupt, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/nov/27/voice-america-global-media-agency-rightly-budget-c/">biased</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/15/trump-executive-order-voice-of-america/82443203007/">unnecessary</a>, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-calls-shutting-down-171116744.html">needed to go</a>. To nearly everyone else who cares, it was America’s voice on radio, and mattered enormously to <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.usagm.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/USAGM-VOA-OneSheet-02-10-23-1.pdf">an audience in the hundreds of millions, listening in forty-eight languages</a>. For many of those, the VOA was the best, and in some cases the only, source of relatively unbiased news.</p>
<p>I am sure some of it was biased. Reporters tend to stand in a place, and most who report on political matters stand on the left (see <a href="https://www.theamericanjournalist.org/post/american-journalist-findings">here</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340374054_There_is_no_liberal_media_bias_in_which_news_stories_political_journalists_choose_to_cover/figures?lo=1">here</a>). Dan Robinson, who spent thirty-four years with the VOA, stands on the right and posted a long bill of particulars in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/nov/27/voice-america-global-media-agency-rightly-budget-c/">Voice of America, Global Media Agency are rightly in budget cut bull’s-eye: Entire operation should be dismantled</a>, in the Washington Times. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;I have monitored the agency’s bureaucracy along with many of its reporters and concluded that it has essentially become a hubris-filled rogue operation often reflecting a leftist bias aligned with partisan national media. It has sought to avoid accountability for violations of journalistic standards and mismanagement. The list includes:</p>
<p>• During President-elect&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump’s</a>&nbsp;first term,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA</a>&nbsp;allowed and often encouraged key correspondents to carry out opposition journalism against him. This included an uprising, growing out of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA’s</a>&nbsp;central newsroom, against Mr. Trump’s choice of chief USAGM executive in 2020.</p>
<p>• That newsroom and the agency have a known left-wing bias. Between 2016 and 2020, some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA</a>&nbsp;reporters did little to hide their disdain for Mr.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>&nbsp;in their reports and social media posts.</p>
<p>• Since Amanda Bennett,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA</a>&nbsp;director from 2016 to mid-2020, returned as USAGM chief in 2022, managers and employees dissed Republicans in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/congress/">Congress</a>&nbsp;who criticized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA’s</a>&nbsp;inexplicable refusal to refer to Hamas terrorists as terrorists. One agency official called lawmakers “silly.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/voa/">VOA’s</a>&nbsp;new director has equated congressional critics to troublemakers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whatever. I’d rather they fix it than kill it. They wanted it dead, and now it is.</p>

   OpenAI announced several new audio-related API features today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following.

  <p>OpenAI announced <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-our-next-generation-audio-models/">several new audio-related API features</a> today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following.</p>

 gpt-4o-mini-tts 

<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-tts</code> is a brand new text-to-speech model with "better steerability". OpenAI released a delightful new playground interface for this at <a href="https://www.openai.fm/">OpenAI.fm</a> - you can pick from 11 base voices, apply instructions like "High-energy, eccentric, and slightly unhinged" and get it to read out a script (with optional extra stage directions in parenthesis). It can then provide the equivalent API code in Python, JavaScript or curl. You can share links to your experiments, <a href="https://www.openai.fm/#fa1e8762-ccf9-4f08-a468-7cc51632d0ed">here's an example</a>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Note how part of my script there looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>(Whisper this bit:)</p>

<p>Footsteps echoed behind her, slow and deliberate. She turned, heart racing, but saw only shadows.</p></blockquote>

<p>While fun and convenient, the fact that you can insert stage directions in the script itself feels like an anti-pattern to me - it means you can't safely use this for arbitrary text because there's a risk that some of that text may accidentally be treated as further instructions to the model.</p>

<p>In my own experiments I've already seen this happen: sometimes the model follows my "Whisper this bit" instruction correctly, other times it says the word "Whisper" out loud but doesn't speak the words "this bit". The results appear non-deterministic, and might also vary with different base voices.</p>

<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-tts</code> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#transcription-and-speech-generation">costs</a> $0.60/million tokens, which OpenAI estimate as around 1.5 cents per minute.</p>

 gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe 

<p><code>gpt-4o-transcribe</code> and <code>gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</code> are two new speech-to-text models, serving a similar purpose to <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">whisper</a> but built on top of GPT-4o and setting a "new state-of-the-art benchmark". These can be used via OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text">v1/audio/transcriptions API</a>, as alternative options to `whisper-1. The API is still restricted to a 25MB audio file (MP3, WAV or several other formats).</p>
<p>Any time an LLM-based model is used for audio transcription (or OCR) I worry about accidental instruction following - is there a risk that content that looks like an instruction in the spoken or scanned text might not be included in the resulting transcript?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43426022#43427525">a comment on Hacker News</a> OpenAI's Jeff Harris said this, regarding how these new models differ from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-audio-preview">gpt-4o-audio-preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a slightly better model for TTS. With extra training focusing on reading the script exactly as written.</p>
<p>e.g. the audio-preview model when given instruction to speak "What is the capital of Italy" would often speak "Rome". This model should be much better in that regard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"much better in that regard" sounds to me like there's still a risk of this occurring, so for some sensitive applications it may make sense to stick with whisper or other traditional text-to-speech approaches.</p>

<p>On Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffintime/status/1902822589300609400">Jeff added</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>yep fidelity to transcript is the big chunk of work to turn an audio model into TTS model. still possible, but should be quite rare</p></blockquote>

<p><code>gpt-4o-transcribe</code> is an estimated 0.6 cents per minute, and <code>gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</code> is 0.3 cents per minute.</p>

 Mixing data and instructions remains the cardinal sin of LLMs 

<p>If these problems look familiar to you that's because they are variants of the root cause behind <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a>. LLM architectures encourage mixing instructions and data in the same stream of tokens, but that means there are always risks that tokens from data (which often comes from untrusted sources) may be misinterpreted as instructions to the model.</p>

<p>How much of an impact this has on the utility of these new models remains to be seen. Maybe the new training is so robust that these issues won't actually cause problems for real-world applications?</p>

<p>I remain skeptical. I expect we'll see demos of these flaws in action in relatively short order.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">Claude can now search the web</a></p>
Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the paid plan now has a web search tool that can be turned on as a global setting.<p></p>
<p>This was sorely needed. ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok all had this ability already, and despite Anthropic's excellent model quality it was one of the big remaining reasons to keep other models in daily rotation.</p>
<p>For the moment this is purely a product feature - it's available through their consumer applications but there's no indication of whether or not it will be coming to the Anthropic API. OpenAI launched the latest version of web search in their API <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">last week</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly there are no details on how it works under the hood. Is this a partnership with someone like Bing, or is it Anthropic's own proprietary index populated by their own crawlers?</p>
<p>I think it may be their own infrastructure, but I've been unable to confirm that.</p>
<p>Update: it's confirmed <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-used-brave/">as Brave Search</a>.</p>
<p>Their support site offers some inconclusive hints.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023637-does-anthropic-crawl-data-from-the-web-and-how-can-site-owners-block-the-crawler">Does Anthropic crawl data from the web, and how can site owners block the crawler?</a> talks about their ClaudeBot crawler but the language indicates it's used for training data, with no mention of a web search index.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10684638-blocking-and-removing-content-from-claude">Blocking and Removing Content from Claude</a> looks a little more relevant, and has a heading "Blocking or removing websites from Claude web search" which includes this eyebrow-raising tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing content from your site is the best way to ensure that it won't appear in Claude outputs when Claude searches the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then this bit, which does mention "our partners":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noindex robots meta tag is a rule that tells our partners not to index your content so that they don’t send it to us in response to your web search query. Your content can still be linked to and visited through other web pages, or directly visited by users with a link, but the content will not appear in Claude outputs that use web search.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of those documents were last updated "over a week ago", so it's not clear to me if they reflect the new state of the world given today's feature launch or not.</p>
<p>I got this delightful response trying out Claude search where it mistook my recent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/4/squadron/">Squadron automata</a> for a software project:</p>

<p>Before we start: if you’ve already filled out the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">What is your tech stack? survey</a>: thank you! If you’ve not done so, your help will be greatly appreciated. It takes 5-15 minutes to complete. Those filling out will receive results before anyone else, and additional analysis from myself and Elin. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">Fill out this survey here.</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/whatisyourtechstack">Fill out the survey</a></p><p>Growth engineering was barely known a decade ago, but today, most scaleups and many publicly traded tech companies have dedicated growth teams staffed by growth engineers. However, some software engineers are still suspicious of this new area because of its reputation for hacky code with little to no code coverage.</p><p>For this reason and others, I thought it would be interesting to learn more from an expert who can tell us all about the practicalities of this controversial domain. So I turned to <a href="https://alexeymk.com/">Alexey Komissarouk</a>, who’s been in growth engineering since 2016, and was in charge of it at online education platform, MasterClass. These days, Alexey lives in Tokyo, Japan, where he <a href="http://alexeymk.com/growth-eng">advises on growth engineering</a> and teaches the <a href="https://www.reforge.com/courses/growth-engineering/details">Growth Engineering course</a> at <a href="https://www.reforge.com/courses/growth-engineering/details">Reforge</a>.</p><p>In today’s deep dive, Alexey covers:</p>  <p>What is Growth Engineering? In the simplest terms: writing code to help a company make more money. But there are details to consider: like the company size where it makes sense to have a dedicated team do this.</p>  <p>What do Growth Engineers work on? Business-facing work, empowerment and platform work are the main areas.</p>  <p>Why Growth Engineers move faster than Product Engineers. Product Engineers ship to build: Growth Engineers ship to learn. Growth Engineers do take shortcuts that would make no sense when building for longevity – doing this on purpose.</p>  <p>Tech stack. Common programming languages, monitoring and oncall, feature flags and experimentation, product analytics, review apps, and more.</p>  <p>What makes a good Growth Engineer? Curiosity, “build to learn” mindset and a “Jack of all trades” approach.</p>  <p>Where do Growth Engineers fit in? Usually part of the engineering department, either operating as with an “owner” or a “hitchiker” model.</p>  <p>Becoming a Growth Engineer. A great area if you want to eventually become a founder or product manager – but even if not, it can accelerate your career growth. Working in Growth forces you to learn more about the business.</p>  <p>With that, it’s over to Alexey:</p>   <p>I’ll never forget the first time I made my employer a million dollars.</p><p>I was running a push notification A/B test for meal delivery startup <a href="https://www.failory.com/cemetery/sprig">Sprig</a>, trying to boost repeat orders.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F314ab3cd-231c-4b85-9ac0-7ba617228fa3_918x752.png">          </a>A push notification similar to what we tested to boost repeat orders <p>Initial results were unpromising; the push notification was not receiving many opens. Still, I wanted to be thorough: before concluding the idea was a failure, I wrote a SQL query to compare order volume for subsequent weeks between customers in test vs control.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffc244a94-c909-4695-937e-e951a765fe80_1488x650.png">          </a>The SQL used to figure out the push notification’s efficiency <p>As it turned out, our test group “beat” the control group by around 10%:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5cb5cc04-40f8-49c2-9e7c-72d827a73f3b_1290x456.png">          </a>‘review_5_push’ was the new type of push notification. Roughly the same amount of users clicked it, but they placed 10% more in orders <p>I plugged the numbers into a <a href="https://abtestguide.com/calc/">significance calculator</a>, which showed it was statistically significant – or “stat-sig” – and therefore highly unlikely to be a coincidence. This meant we had a winner on our hands! But how meaningful was it, really, and what would adding the push notification mean for revenue, if rolled out to 100% of users?</p><p>It turned out this experiment created an additional $1.5 million dollars, annually, with just one push notification. Wow!</p><p>I was hooked. Since that day, I've shipped hundreds of experimental “winners” which generated hundreds of millions of incremental revenue for my employers. But you never forget the first one. Moments like this is what growth engineering is all about.</p> 1. What is Growth Engineering? <p>Essentially, growth engineering is the writing of code to make a company money. Of course, all code produced by a business on some level serves this purpose, but while Product Engineers focus on creating a Product worth paying for, Growth Engineers instead focus on making that good product have a good business. To this end, they focus on optimizing and refining key parts of the customer journey, such as:</p>  <p>Getting more people to consider the product</p>  <p>Converting them into paying customers</p>  <p>Keeping them as customers for longer, and spending more</p>  <p>What kinds of companies employ Growth Engineers? Places you’ve heard of, like Meta, LinkedIn, DoorDash, Coinbase, and Dropbox, are some of the ones I’ve had students from. There’s also OpenAI, Uber, Tiktok, Tinder, Airbnb, Pinterest… the list of high-profile companies goes on. Most newer public consumer companies you’ve heard have a growth engineering org, too.</p><p>Typically, growth engineering orgs are started by companies at Series B stage and beyond, so long as they are selling to either consumers or businesses via SaaS. These are often places trying to grow extremely fast, and have enough software engineers that some can focus purely on growth. Before the Series B stage, a team is unlikely to be ready for growth for various reasons; likely that it hasn’t found product-market fit, or has no available headcount, or lacks the visitor traffic required to run A/B tests.</p><p>Cost is a consideration. A fully-loaded growth team consisting of a handful of engineers, a PM, and a designer costs approximately 1 million dollars annually. To justify this, a rule of thumb is to have at least $5 million dollars in recurring revenue – a milestone often achieved at around the Series B stage.</p><p>Despite the presence of growth engineering at many public consumer tech companies, the field itself is still quite new, as a discipline and as a proper title.</p> Brief history of growth engineering <p>When I joined Opendoor in 2016, there was a head of growth but no dedicated growth engineers, but there were by the time I left in 2020. At MasterClass soon after, there was a growth org and a dozen dedicated growth engineers. So when did growth engineering originate?</p><p>The story is that its origins lie at Facebook in 2007. The team was created by then-VP of platform and monetization <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chamath/">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Reforce founder and CEO Brian Balfour <a href="https://brianbalfour.com/growth-machine/why-growth">shares</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Growth (the kind found on an org chart) began at Facebook under the direction of Chamath Palihapitiya. In 2007, he joined the early team in a nebulous role that fell somewhere between Product, Marketing, and Operations. According to his retelling of the story on Recode Decode, after struggling to accomplish anything meaningful in his first year on the job, he was on the verge of being fired.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg joined soon after him, and in a hail mary move he pitched her the game-changing idea that led to the creation of the first-ever growth team. This idea not only saved his job, but earned him the lion’s share of the credit for Facebook’s unprecedented growth.</p><p>At the time, Sheryl and Mark asked him, “What do you call this thing where you help change the product, do some SEO and SEM, and algorithmically do this or that?”</p><p>His response: “I don’t know, I just call that, like, Growth, you know, we’re going to try to grow. I’ll be the head of growing stuff."</p><p>And just like that, Growth became a thing.”</p></blockquote><p>Rather than focus on a particular product or feature, the growth team at Facebook focused on moving the needle, and figuring out which features to work on. These days, Meta employs hundreds if not thousands of growth engineers.</p> 2. What do Growth Engineers work on? <p>Before we jump into concrete examples, let’s identify three primary focus areas that a growth engineer’s work usually involves.</p>  <p>Business-facing work – improving the business directly</p>  <p>Empowerment work – enabling other teams to improve the business</p>  <p>Platform work – improving the velocity of the above activities</p>  <p>Let’s go through all three:</p> Business-facing work <p>This is the bread and butter of growth engineering, and follows a common pattern:</p>  <p>Implement an idea. Try something big or small to try and move a key business metric, which differs by team but is typically related to conversion rate or retention.</p>  <p>Quantify impact. Usually via A/B testing.</p>  <p>Analyze impact. Await results, analyze impact, ship or roll back – then go back to the first step.</p>  <p>Experiments can lead to sweeping or barely noticeable changes. A famous “I can’t believe they needed to test this” was when Google figured out <a href="https://archive.is/DiWOt">which shade of blue</a> generates the most clicks. At MasterClass, we tested things across the spectrum:</p>  <p>Small: should we show the price right on the homepage, was that a winner? Yes, but we framed it in monthly terms of $15/month, not $180/year.</p>  <p>Medium: when browsing a course page, should we include related courses, or more details about the course itself? Was it a winner? After lengthy experimentation, it was hard to tell: both are valuable and we needed to strike the right balance.</p>  <p>Large: when a potential customer is interested, do we take them straight to checkout, or encourage them to learn more? Counterintuitively, adding steps boosted conversion!</p>   Empowerment <p>One of the best ways an engineer can move a target metric is by removing themselves as a bottleneck, so colleagues from marketing can iterate and optimize freely. To this end, growth engineers can either build internal tools or integrate self-serve MarTech (Marketing Technology) vendors.</p><p>With the right tool, there’s a lot that marketers can do without engineering’s involvement:</p>  <p>Build and iterate on landing pages (Unbounce, Instapage, etc)</p>  <p>Draft and send email, SMS and Push Notifications (Iterable, Braze, Customer.io, etc)</p>  <p>Connect new advertising partners (Google Tag Manager, Segment, etc)</p>  <p>We go more into detail about benefits and applications in the MarTech section of Tech Stack, below.</p> Platform work <p>As a business scales, dedicated platform teams help improve stability and velocity for the teams they support. Within growth, this often includes initiatives like:</p>  <p>Experiment Platform. Many parts of running an experiment can be standardized, from filtering the audience, to bucketing users properly, to observing statistical methodology. Historically, companies <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-JP/blog/xp/">built reusable Experiment Platforms in-house</a>, but more recently, vendors such as <a href="https://www.geteppo.com">Eppo</a> and <a href="https://www.statsig.com/">Statsig</a> have grown in popularity with fancy statistical methodologies like “Controlled Using Pre-Experiment Data” (<a href="https://martech.zone/acronym/cuped/?noamp=mobile">CUPED</a>) that give more signal with less data.</p>  <p>Reusable components. Companies with standard front-end components for things like headlines, buttons, and images, dramatically reduce the time required to spin up a new page. No more "did you want 5 or 6 pixels here" with a designer; instead growth engineers rely on tools like <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> to standardize and share reusable React components.</p>  <p>Monitoring. Growth engineering benefits greatly from leveraging monitoring to compensate for reduced code coverage. High-quality business metric monitoring tools can detect bugs before they cause damage.</p>  <p>When I worked at MasterClass, having monitoring at the ad layer prevented at least one six-figure incident. One Friday, a marketer accidentally broadened the audience for a particular ad from US-only, to worldwide. In response, the Facebook Ad algorithm went on a spending spree, bringing in plenty of visitors from places like Brazil and India, whom we knew from past experience were unlikely to purchase the product. Fortunately, our monitoring noticed the low-performing campaign within minutes, and an alert was sent to the growth engineer on-call, who immediately reached out to the marketer and confirmed the change was unintentional, and then shut down the campaign.</p><p>Without this monitoring, a subtle targeting error like this could have gone unnoticed all weekend and would have eaten up $100,000+ of marketing budget. This episode shows that platform investment can benefit everyone; and since growth needs them most, it’s often the growth platform engineering team which implements them.</p><p>As the day-to-day work of a Growth Engineer shows, A/B tests are a critical tool to both measure success and learn. It’s a numbers game: the more A/B tests a team can run in a given quarter, the more of them will end up winners, making the team successful. It’s no wonder, then, that Growth Engineering will pull out all the stops to improve velocity.</p> 3. Why Growth Engineers move faster than Product Engineers <p>On the surface, growth engineering teams look like product engineering ones; writing code, shipping pull requests, monitoring on-call, etc. So how do they move so much faster? The big reason lies in philosophy and focus, not technology. To quote <a href="https://www.elenaverna.com/">Elena Verna</a>, head of growth at Dropbox:</p><blockquote><p>“Product Engineering teams ship to build; Growth Engineering teams ship to learn.”</p></blockquote> Real-world case: price changes at Masterclass <p>A few years ago at MasterClass, the growth team wanted to see if changing our pricing model to multiple tiers would improve revenue.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F977b1d38-4776-4a41-bab4-1f45cc13180f_1600x1190.png">          </a>Inspired in part by multiple pricing tiers for competitors such as Netflix (above), Disney Plus, and Hulu.  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27165d3f-aa18-4a34-a58c-7325910912fe_1600x1064.png">          </a>The “multiple pricing tier” proposal for MasterClass. <p>From a software engineering perspective, this was a highly complex project because:</p>  <p>Backend engineering work: the backend did not yet support multiple pricing options, requiring a decent amount of engineering, and rigorous testing to make sure existing customers weren’t affected.</p>  <p>Client app changes: on the device side, multiple platforms (iOS, iPad, Android, Roku, Apple TV, etc) would each need to be updated, including each relevant app store.</p>  <p>The software engineering team estimated that becoming a “multi-pricing-tier” company would take months across numerous engineering teams, and engineering leadership was unwilling to greenlight that significant investment.</p><p>We in growth engineering took this as a challenge. As usual, our goal was not just to add the new pricing model, but to learn how much money it might bring in. The approach we ended up proposing was a <a href="https://userpilot.com/blog/fake-door-testing/">Fake Door test,</a> which involves offering a not-yet-available option to customers to gauge interest level. This was risky, as taking a customer who’s ready to pay and telling them to join some kind of waiting list is a colossal waste, and risks making them feel like the target of a “bait and switch” trick.</p><p>We found a way. The key insight was that people are only offended about a “bait and switch”, if the “switch” is worse than the “bait.” Telling customers they would pay $100 and then switching to $150 would cause a riot, but starting at $150 and then saying “just kidding, it’s only $100” is a pleasant surprise.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05088b07-4ec3-4730-ad04-cc9f6908519c_740x700.png">          </a>The good kind of surprise. <p>So long as every test “pricing tier” is less appealing – higher prices, fewer features – than the current offering, we could “upgrade” customers after their initial selection. A customer choosing the cheapest tier gets extra features at no extra cost, while a customer choosing a more expensive tier is offered a discount.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b133445-e8da-40ee-8af9-d9995c2c817c_1252x1130.png">          </a>We created three new tiers, at different prices. The new “premium” tier would describe the existing, original offering. Regardless of what potential customers selected, they got this “original offering,” during the experiment. <p>The best thing about this was that no backend changes were required. There were no real, new, back-end pricing plans; everybody ended up purchasing the same version of MasterClass for the same price, with the same features. The entirety of the engineering work was on building a new pricing page, and the “congratulations, you’ve been upgraded” popup. This took just a few days.</p><p>Within a couple of weeks, we had enough data to be confident the financial upside of moving to a multi-pricing-tier model would be significant. With this, we’re able to convince the rest of engineering’s leadership to invest in building the feature properly. In the end, launching multiple pricing tiers turned out to be one of the biggest revenue wins of the year.</p> Building a skyscraper vs building a tent <p>The MasterClass example demonstrates the spirit of growth engineering; focusing on building to learn, instead of building to last. Consider building skyscrapers versus tents.</p><p>Building a tent optimizes for speed of set-up and tear-down over longevity. You don’t think of a tent as one that is shoddy or low-quality compared to skyscrapers: it’s not even the same category of buildings! Growth engineers maximize use of lightweight materials. To stick with the tents vs skyscraper metaphor: we prioritize lightweight fabric materials over steel and concrete whenever possible. We only resort to traditional building materials when there’s no other choice, or when a direction is confirmed as correct. Quality is important – after all, a tent must keep out rain and mosquitoes. However, the speed-vs-durability tradeoff decision results in very different approaches and outcomes.</p> 4. Tech stack <p>At first glance, growth and product engineers use the same tooling, and contribute to the same codebases. But growth engineering tends to be high-velocity, experiment-heavy, and with limited test coverage. This means that certain “nice to have” tools for product engineering are mission-critical for growth engineers.</p>

  <p>After <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">192 posts</a> that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">original goal</a> was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into a habit of writing regularly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years I've adopted new posting habits which are solving those problems in other ways:</p>
 
 I post something here almost every day. I actually maintained a daily posting streak throughout 2024, which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/">ended in January</a>, but I'm still posting most days and plan to keep that up. 
 Every time I ship a new release of one of my projects I link to it from here. This replaces the "recent releases" section of my weeknotes. 
 I try to have a longer form piece of writing that's suitable for inclusion in <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> at least once every two weeks. That's another accountability mechanism that's working well for me. 
 
<p>One downside of weeknotes is that I'd sometimes save something to include in them, which could lead to several items getting bundled together in a way that reduced their potential impact as standalone posts.</p>
<p>I got to the point with weeknotes where I was feeling guilty about not keeping them up. Given the volume of content I'm publishing already that felt like a sign that they were no longer providing the value they once did!</p>
<p>I still think weeknotes are an excellent habit for anyone who wants to write more frequently and be more transparent about their work. It feels healthy to be able to end a habit that's finished serving its purpose.</p>

   OpenAI platform: o1-pro 
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!

  <p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-pro">OpenAI platform: o1-pro</a></p>
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!<p></p>
<p>Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token context window, 100,000 max output tokens, Sep 30 2023 knowledge cut-off date and it supports function calling, structured outputs and image inputs.</p>
<p>o1-pro doesn't support streaming, and most significantly for developers is the first OpenAI model to only be available via their new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses">Responses API</a>. This means tools that are built against their Chat Completions API (like my own <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) have to do a whole lot more work to support the new model - my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/839">issue for that is here</a>.</p>
<p>Since LLM doesn't support this new model yet I had to make do with <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
  }'
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0439d0255360c68b8f621133860710b1">the full JSON</a> I got back - 81 input tokens and 1552 output tokens for a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">total cost</a> of 94.335 cents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I took a risk and added <code>"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}</code> to see if I could get a better pelican with more reasoning:</p>
 <code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
  }'
</code> 
<p>Surprisingly that used less output tokens - 1459 compared to 1552 earlier (cost: 88.755 cents) - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/085d81e1160157572c9bd361b01374c4">producing this JSON</a> which rendered as a slightly better pelican:</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was cheaper because while it spent 960 reasoning tokens as opposed to 704 for the previous pelican it omitted the explanatory text around the SVG, saving on total output.

<p>As it happens, IIW was born exactly twenty years ago tomorrow—20 March 2005—at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson">Esther Dyso</a>n’s PC Forum in Scottsdale, Arizona. A group of eleven that called itself the Identity Gang gathered around a table there to plot what became (IMHO) the most leveraged conference in the world. Three of the eleven were Canadians. One (Esther) was born in Zurich. As for the rest, I suppose they could have been born anywhere. (I was born in the U.S., but half my ancestors were Swedish. Those on my father’s side were Irish, English, German, French, and God knows.)</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> — The modern identity platform for B2B SaaS.</p><p>• <a href="http://vanta.com/pragmatic">Vanta</a> — Automate compliance and simplify security with Vanta.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Linux is the most widespread operating system, globally – but how is it built? Few people are better to answer this than Greg Kroah-Hartman: a Linux kernel maintainer for 25 years, and one of the 3 Linux Kernel Foundation Fellows (the other two are Linus Torvalds and Shuah Khan). Greg manages the Linux kernel’s stable releases, and is a maintainer of multiple kernel subsystems. He is also the author of the books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Nutshell-Desktop-Reference-ebook/dp/B0026OR3OY?ref_=ast_author_mpb">Linux Kernel in a Nutshell</a> and <a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers</a>.</p><p>We cover the inner workings of Linux kernel development, exploring everything from how changes get implemented to why its community-driven approach produces such reliable software. Greg shares insights about the kernel's unique trust model and makes a case for why engineers should contribute to open-source projects. We go into:</p>  <p>How widespread is Linux?</p>  <p>What is the Linux kernel responsible for – and why is it a monolith?</p>  <p>How does a kernel change get merged? A walkthrough</p>  <p>The 9-week development cycle for the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Testing the Linux kernel</p>  <p>Why is Linux so widespread?</p>  <p>The career benefits of open-source contribution</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>1. Linux is the most widespread operating system globally. Linux runs on 4 billion Android devices – compared to which everything else is “a rounding error”. Still, Linux is the most popular operating system for servers and embedded devices. It’s also used on many smart TVs, air traffic control systems, and even on the International Space Station. Fun fact: Linux even runs inside many iPhones – as it is the firmware used for the Qualcomm 5G modems inside these devices!</p><p>2. Getting a change merged into the Linux kernel is surprisingly straightforward. Create the change (called a patch), test it locally, and send it to the right maintainer for review. The patch needs to go through a hierarchical tree of maintainers accepting it before it can make it into the kernel. We go through a specific change being merged up this tree.</p><p>3. Linux won because devs being “selfish” works! Developers contribute to Linux in a "selfish" way to solve their own problems. But turns out, many devs have the same problems: so every contribution makes Linux a better fit for other devs to use! Kernel maintainers only accept contributions that make sense for the whole project. For example, embedded device vendors helped make the Linux kernel more efficient. This efficiency later greatly helped Linux become the best choice for mobile OS on Android.</p><p>4. The Linux kernel is run in a very unique way – because the project is unique. The Linux kernel has 4,000 contributors per year, releases strictly every 9 weeks – and yet has practically no meetings, no project managers and uses email and git. This setup works because project management happens outside of the Linux kernel: contributors bring completed work. Also, the kernel team invests heavily in automation for e.g. triaging. And turns out, email scales really well – for this group, that is! (Note that other projects built on top of the Linux kernel – such as Linux distributions like Red Hat or Debian – all work differently.

The core kernel –the part every Linux platform runs – is about 5% of this. . The remaining code supports diverse hardware, drivers, devices, architectures, and chips.</p>  <p>A typical laptop runs approximately two to 2.5M million lines of kernel code; servers around 1.5M, while mobile devices around 4M.</p>  <p>The role of the kernel: abstract away underlying hardware and present a consistent interface to user space programs. This allows the applications to run on different hardware without modification.</p>  <p>A monolithic kernel</p>  <p>Drivers in Linux are part of the kernel</p>  <p>This is a monolithic architecture: all code, including drivers, operates in the same address space</p>  <p>The monolithic approach allows for more refactoring options and more code-sharing opportunities between drivers. This results in Linux drivers being, on average, one-third smaller than drivers in other operating systems because common functionalities can be identified and consolidated.</p>    <p>Do not break userspace. The core principle of Linux kernel development is to never intentionally break user space. This guarantee ensures that users can upgrade their kernel without fear of their existing applications crashing. Accidental breakages are treated as faults and are promptly addressed.</p>   Linux kernel development process   <p>Fixed 9-week cadence.</p>  <p>Following a release by Linus Torvalds, a two-week merge window opens.</p>  <p>During this merge window, maintainers submit all the new features that have been pending and proven to work in their respective development trees to Linus.</p>  <p>rc1: after the two-week merge window, Linus issues the first release candidate (rc1).</p>  <p>For the subsequent seven weeks, only bug fixes are accepted. No new features are introduced during this stabilization period; the focus is on regression fixes and reverting problematic changes.</p>    <p>Hierarchical structure of maintainers.</p>  <p>Around 4,000 developers contribute code every year</p>  <p>They send changes via email to maintainers responsible for specific kernel subsystems</p>  <p>Kernel subsystem maintainers then forward collections of accepted changes up the chain</p>  <p>Ultimately, these changes reach Linus for inclusion in the main kernel tree.</p>    <p>Trust is key in Linux kernel development. When a maintainer accepts code from a developer, they implicitly take responsibility for it. For critical parts of the kernel, maintainers need to have a high degree of confidence in the developer and the quality of their work, as the maintainer becomes accountable if the original developer disappears.</p>  <p>Email and git. These are the two tools used during development.</p>  <p>"Linux Next:" a separate development tree that integrates all the changes destined for the next kernel release on a daily basis. This allows for continuous testing and identification of potential integration issues.</p>   QA and stable releases   <p>Linux Next: automated testing. This includes building and booting the kernel across various architectures and virtual machines.</p>  <p>KernelCI: a project that provides a more extensive continuous integration infrastructure, running tests on a wider range of real hardware contributed by different labs.</p>  <p>The testing process involves a mix of automated tests and real-world usage by developers and testers. The "zero-day bot" automatically tests patches submitted to mailing lists.</p>  <p>Stable kernel releases: these are maintained independently of the main development branch. After each major kernel release by Linus, a stable branch is forked.</p>  <p>Greg&nbsp;and Sasha Levin maintain these stable branches.&nbsp;They issue new stable releases weekly, incorporating bug fixes that have first been merged into Linus's tree. This ensures that stable branches do not diverge from the main development line.</p>    <p>Long-term stable (LTS) kernels: Greg picks one kernel per year and supports it for an extended period, initially two years, sometimes up to six years. Android phones, for instance, often run on these older LTS kernels, which still receive backported bug fixes. Greg and Sasha concurrently maintain multiple LTS kernels.</p>  <p>Maintaining older codebases is more challenging. This is due to the ongoing evolution of the kernel. Changes made in newer versions to fix bugs might be difficult to backport to older, significantly diverged code. Context is often lost over time, making even seemingly simple backports complex.</p>   Contributors   <p>About 80% of kernel contributors are paid – by their employer! Companies invest in Linux development because it's often more cost-effective to contribute features and fixes than to develop their own operating systems.</p>  <p>Contributing to the Linux kernel is a valuable way for developers to also invest in their careers. It demonstrates the ability to collaborate, work with existing codebases, and solve real-world problems.</p>  <p>Core maintainers meet annually to discuss and refine the development process.</p>   Rust support?   <p>Most of Linux is written in C, but Rust is gaining momentum. Approximately 25,000 lines of Rust code are already in the kernel, primarily for bindings but also for some functionality like generating QR codes on kernel crashes.</p>  <p>Introducing Rust aims to improve memory safety in certain parts of the kernel. However, writing drivers in Rust presents challenges due to the need for bindings to the extensive C codebase and the different memory management models of C and Rust.</p>  <p>Memory safety in Rust primarily refers to the safety of object lifecycles and memory ownership, not necessarily the elimination of all bugs. Logic errors and even memory unsafety can still occur in Rust code.</p>  <p>The adoption of Rust is also driving improvements in the existing C codebase, as the need to create Rust bindings encourages a re-evaluation of C code for better safety and clarity.</p>    <p>Will the Linux kernel add Rust support?</p>  <p>There is resistance to introducing new languages from some core kernel developers, who prefer to maintain a single-language codebase.</p>  <p>Efforts are underway to write more drivers in Rust, including experimental GPU drivers. Rust can be particularly well-suited for simpler hardware drivers.</p>  <p>Governments increasingly mandate the use of memory-safe languages, which is another factor driving the adoption of Rust in Linux.</p>  <p>That said, the Linux kernel community is also actively working on improving the safety of existing C code through techniques like bounds checking and compiler extensions.</p>     Why contribute to Linux, and how?   <p>Building and testing the kernel locally is a prerequisite for submitting changes.</p>  <p>Contributing, even a single patch, offers significant professional benefits. It strengthens a developer's resume by demonstrating the ability to collaborate and work with complex, established codebases.</p>  <p>Contributing provides valuable learning opportunities, exposing devs to different perspectives, coding practices, and challenging technical problems.</p>  <p>Newcomers can find entry points by working on less critical parts of the kernel, such as fixing coding style issues or removing dead code in older drivers.

<p>Missing Mike. My favorite songwriter and performer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cross_(musician)">Mike Cross</a>. He was headed to a career in law as an undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill when a music bug bit him, he learned to play fiddle and guitar, and then to perform in local bars and clubs. I couldn’t count how many times I went to hear him play. His songs were—and still are—fun, deep, wise, and catchy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzTvGYYO6lI">Uncle Josh</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMKOvdnBvTE">The Scottsman</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehsqtmTzULM">Elma Turl</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL962ytAVfQ">Nobby</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGpZYVzbMjs">Born in the Country</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRFa8qlEZlQ">The Lord’ll Provide</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7AcEzOUkNY">Bounty Hunter</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOmXpWywotw">Kentucky Song</a>. A few years ago Mike was bitten by a tick, got Lyme Disease, and has hardly been heard from since. I hope he’s well and can get back out there, showing the next few generations what an amazing gift he is to us all. Bonus fact: The album cover above is by my old friend and business partner <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2011/11/29/remembering-ray/">Ray Simone</a>. Gone thirteen years, I still miss Ray every day.</p>
<p>Drowning in Red. Fifty years ago, when I was <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2017/04/26/where-the-nickname-came-from/">getting my nickname</a> while working at <a href="https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/uawdbs2">WDBS</a>&nbsp;(a sweet little commercial radio station owned by Duke University in Durham, North Carolina), our slogan was “Let the music keep our spirits high”—a line from Jackson Browne’s “Before the Deluge.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SX-HFcSIoU">Give it a listen</a>. Take in the lyrics. Then think about the kind and generous purposes behind all the federal programs, agencies, and departments now being demolished. The abandoned alliances and international friendships. The dropped American support for people and organizations trying to do good throughout the world. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-listened-to_radio_programs">Voice of America</a>, silenced. Think about the new political corrections:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://grantwritingandfunding.com/banned-and-trigger-words-in-federal-grant-writing-in-the-trump-administration-2-0/">forbidden words</a>&nbsp;in grant applications, red flags now waving atop corporate giants, weather vanes vectored right. Think about the shaking trap doors under millions of federal employees—especially ones tasked with helping the weak, the old, the foreign, the oppressed, the dark, the gay, the oddly gendered. And then listen to the news. No, not the old bluestream news we still call main. I mean the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/11/16/the-redstream-media/">redstream</a> news that now predominates <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-still-ratings-viagra-cable-160000910.html">on TV</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/genre/1530">in podcasts</a>, <a href="https://barrettmedia.com/2025/01/09/barrett-news-media-top-20-of-2024-national-news-talk-radio-shows/">on radio</a>. What you will see and hear is one big amen corner for all of it. This is the deluge.</p>
<p>Sounding Good Everywhere. If you like old album rock and Americana rooted in North Carolina, the best thing on radio in&nbsp;Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill is <a href="https://www.thatstation.net/">That Station</a>, on 95.7 FM.&nbsp; Technically, the station translates (rebroadcasts) WRAL-FM/101.5’s HD2 stream, and rarely mentions its true callsign, which is <a href="https://radio-locator.com/info/W239CK-FX?loc=35.92042%2C-79.08393&amp;locn=Carrboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">W239CK</a>. What many listeners may not know is that the signal on 95.7 is only 250 watts from an antenna about 1100 feet up a tower near Apex, while the HD2 stream is coming from WRAL’s 98,000 watt signal pumping out of its antenna almost 2000 feet up a tower southeast of Raleigh. Compare the two signal footprints <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=W239CK&amp;service=FX">here</a> and <a href="https://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=WRAL&amp;service=FM">here</a> (thanks to the wonderful RadioLocator.com). Naturally, the station also has an app. That’s what I usually use here in Bloomington, Indiana, although right now I’m digging it on my computer, which has outstanding 2.1 Logitech speakers I picked up for $5 at a yard sale.</p>

<p>LIVE告知です。メタバース進化論の著者のバーチャル美少女ねむさんとYouTube Live を行います。</p>



<p>・配信日時：3月29日（土）21:00より1.5時間程度予定<br>・YouTube LIVEにて無料配信<br>・配信URL：<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tyUY9NpZeU">「分人経済革命」ねむ ✕ 崎村夏彦 徹底対談【次世代ネットの扉を開く革命の起こしかた】</a></p>



<p>バーチャル美少女ねむさんは、黎明期の仮想世界で生きる「メタバース原住民」にして、その文化を伝える「メタバース文化エバンジェリスト」として活動しておられます。「バーチャルでなりたい自分になる」をテーマに2017年から美少女アイドルとして活動している自称・世界最古の個人系VTuber。メタバースの革命性を論じた著書『<a href="https://amzn.to/4hDlXQ4">メタバース進化論</a>』（2022年、技術評論社）で「<a href="https://www.shoeisha.co.jp/campaign/award/2023/result">ITエンジニア本大賞2023</a>」ビジネス書部門”大賞”を受賞。国連の国際会議「<a href="https://www.soumu.go.jp/igfkyoto2023/">IGF京都2023</a>」でも登壇。MoguLive VTuber Award 2023では「<a href="https://www.moguravr.com/mogulive-vtuber-award-2024-vtuber/">今年最も輝いたVTuber</a>」に選出されています。2024年には定性調査レポート「<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/n9a4ca9f667a2">メタバースでのアイデンティティ（Nem x Mila, 2024）</a>」を発表。<a href="https://unit.aist.go.jp/harc/daax/d_cns_standardization.html">産総研「アバター国際標準化の国内検討委員会」</a><a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6797/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-6797" title="ISO IEC/JTC1/SC35専門委員会関連">4</a>委員にも就任されておられます。</p>



<p>ねむさんが課題として捉えられていることに分人経済が新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みがあります。たとえば、</p>



 
 バーチャルでアバターの形でしか会わない取引先にどうしてマイナンバーカードの表裏をコピーして郵送しなければならないのか？ 
 



<p>もちろん、適正な課税のためには税務当局がマイナンバーを使って支払いを把握することが必要であることは論を待ちません。しかし、だからといってマイナンバーカードのオモテ裏のコピーを郵送したりして身元確認情報を拡散させたり、望まない名寄せが行われるリスクをとる必要があるのでしょうか？多くのVTuberの方にしてみれば、「顔バレ」を含む「身バレ」は最大のリスクの一つです。こうしたリスクを抑えたうえで、ひとびとが経済活動を行い、一方税務当局は本人のマイナンバーを抑えることができて適正な課税をする仕組みはつくれないのでしょうか？これは実はVTuberだけでなく、ひろく一般の方々にかんしても言えることです。</p>



<p>こうしたことについて、目標1.5時間でいろいろお話をしたいと思います。</p>



<p>ねむさん曰く：</p>



<blockquote>
<p>次世代インターネットの扉を開くという「分人経済革命」とは果たして何なのか！？ 仮想空間「メタバース」ではアバターによって複数の自分（分人）を切り替え、自己の魂の在り方と社会との界面を能動的にデザインできる新時代が遂に実現しつつある。一方でそれを新たな経済圏に昇華するためのID認証・経済・納税の仕組みは全くの未整備なのが現状だ。インターネットにおけるデジタルアイデンティティの標準化に長年取り組んできたOpenID Foundation理事長「崎村夏彦」とメタバース住人にしてVTuber/作家「バーチャル美少女ねむ」が3/29にYouTube LIVEでこの問題を徹底対談！ 次世代インターネットの革命がここから始まる！？（出所：<a href="https://note.com/nemchan_nel/n/neac6dc0eee04">【告知】3/29「分人経済革命」ねむ ✕ 崎村夏彦 徹底対談【次世代ネットの扉を開く革命の起こしかた】</a>）</p>
</blockquote>



<p>それでは、当日おあいしましょう！</p>

<p>My first love was self-sovereign distributed data, where each person owns and controls their data, hosting it wherever they choose and permissioning it under their own terms. But I got lost in the complexity of building a robust distributed identity infrastructure. How can you give permission to someone if you can’t 'name' them in a way that is verifiable and resistant to subversion? There's no point in saying "only John can access this" if Tom can show up and convincingly say, "I'm John."</p><p>This issue isn’t theoretical—many modern digital problems stem from weak identity foundations. Take email, for example. SMTP, the core protocol, evolved without a strong sense of identity. Had we designed email with a robust identity layer—and maybe a little reputation—spam might have been less rampant. Instead, we've had to patch identity onto email systems, mostly at the DNS layer. Could better choices early on have changed the landscape of digital trust?</p><p>As we enter the era of AI and Personal AI, this challenge resurfaces. We will increasingly rely on agents to interact, assist, and even make decisions on our behalf. But how can we trust these agents? How do we know they are who they claim to be, and whose interests they truly serve? When I ask my AI how to unwind after a long day, it might suggest a refreshing Diet Coke. But is that suggestion rooted in understanding my preferences, or is it influenced by unseen commercial incentives?</p><p>Recognition and Identity in AI</p><p>In the animal world, intelligence is often measured by the ability to recognize oneself and others. The mirror test is a classic example—when an animal identifies itself in a reflection, it demonstrates a form of self-awareness. Similarly, recognizing specific others—distinguishing one individual from another—marks advanced cognitive development.</p><p>AI, in contrast, remains limited in this capacity. While AI excels at pattern recognition, it lacks the ability to form a persistent sense of identity, either of itself or others. This limitation restricts its ability to build trust and context in interactions. Without a foundation for recognizing specific entities, AI systems risk becoming tools of confusion or exploitation.</p><p>Embedding Identity Systems into AI</p><p>One solution is to deeply embed identity frameworks into AI architectures from the outset. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and similar systems could provide AI with a structured way to "recognize" and differentiate entities.</p>  <p>Persistent Identity Chains: AI could track verifiable chains of identity, ensuring that when it reports information—like "Brad says buy this stock"—it can verify that it truly came from the Brad you trust.</p>  <p>Verification of Origin: By leveraging cryptographically verifiable credentials, AI can ensure that information hasn’t been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.</p>  <p>Reputation Frameworks: Identity systems could incorporate reputation mechanisms, helping AI prioritize information from sources that consistently meet a trust threshold.</p>  <p>Chain of Custody: AI could provide transparency on how information was received and processed, ensuring that its recommendations are based on data with verifiable origins.</p>  <p>The Path to Trusted AI</p><p>Trustworthy AI isn’t about making machines socially aware; it’s about ensuring that humans can trust the chain of custody behind AI-generated insights. When AI states that "Brad recommends this action," it should be able to prove that the recommendation came from the right "Brad"—the person you trust, not an imposter or manipulated data source.</p><p>The real question is: How do we create systems where AI is not just technically accurate but verifiably trustworthy? In an era where decisions increasingly rely on AI advice, embedding identity systems at the core isn’t just beneficial—it’s fundamental.</p>

<p>GOV.UK One LoginはOpenID Connect (OIDC)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html&quot;>Sakimura, et al. OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>">15</a>に準拠したサービスです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/how-gov-uk-one-login-works/&quot;>How GOV.UK One Login works</a>">16</a>。OpenID Connectは、OAuth 2.0プロトコルの上に構築された認証レイヤーであり、OAuth 2.0を拡張して標準化された方法で認証情報を提供します。</p>



<p>具体的には、GOV.UK One Loginは以下の特徴を持っています：</p>



 
 OpenID Connect準拠: OIDCプロトコルを使用して、ユーザー認証と属性の共有を行います。 



 認証フロー: 標準的なOAuth 2.0/OIDC認証コードフローを実装しています。これには以下のステップが含まれます：
 
 <code>/authorize</code> エンドポイントへの認可リクエスト 



 認可コードの発行 



 <code>/token</code> エンドポイントでのトークン交換 



 IDトークンとアクセストークンの取得 



 <code>/userinfo</code> エンドポイントでのユーザー情報の取得 
 
 



 セキュリティ強化: JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6766/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-6766" title="<a href=&quot;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/&quot;>Sakimura, et al. JWT-secured OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request (JAR) (RFC9101)</a>">17</a>を使用して、認証リクエストパラメータのセキュリティを向上させています。 
 



<p>ちなみにですが、OpenID Connect も JAR もわたしが主著者なので、なんとも喜ばしいことです。</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By   <p><a href="https://sentry.io/pragmatic/?">Sentry</a> — Error and performance monitoring for developers.</p>  <p><a href="https://engguidebook.com/#buy">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a>: Written by me (Gergely) – now out in audio form as well.</p>  <p>—</p> In This Episode <p>In today’s episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I am joined by former Uber colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/">Gautam Korlam</a>. Gautam is the Co-Founder of <a href="https://gitar.ai/">Gitar</a>, an agentic AI startup that automates code maintenance. Gautam was mobile engineer no. 9 at Uber and founding engineer for the mobile platform team – and so he learned a few things about scaling up engineering teams.</p><p>We talk about:</p><p>• How Gautam accidentally deleted Uber’s Java monorepo – really!</p><p>• Uber's unique engineering stack and why custom solutions like SubmitQueue were built in-house</p><p>• Monorepo: the benefits and downsides of this approach</p><p>• From Engineer II to Principal Engineer at Uber: Gautam’s career trajectory</p><p>• Practical strategies for building trust and gaining social capital</p><p>• How the platform team at Uber operated with a product-focused mindset</p><p>• Vibe coding: why it helps with quick prototyping</p><p>• How AI tools are changing developer experience and productivity</p><p>• Important skills for devs to pick up to remain valuable as AI tools spread</p><p>• And more!</p>     Takeaways <p>Interesting parts of the conversation:</p><p>1. Submit Queue: Uber built a complex merge system to deal with the large number of commits, where each commit had to run long-running CI tests. It’s a problem that smaller and mid-sized companies don’t have, but Uber had: and so they scratched their own itch.</p><p>2. Local Developer Analytics (LDA): years ago, Uber started to measure the experience that devs had. Things like: how long did a build take, locally? How much CPU is used? They used this data to improve internal tooling.</p><p>3. Developer experience as a product team. Gautam’s team operated like a classic product team: except their customers were Uber’s internal developers. Gautam believes this is how all successful platform teams should work.</p><p>4. AI changing software development: this is happening. “Vibe coding” leads to faster prototyping. Gautam believes junior engineers will thrive with AI tools because they will hit the ground running faster, and will be free of biases that hold back more experienced developers.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/program-platform-split-uber?utm_source=publication-search">The Platform and Program split at Uber</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity?utm_source=publication-search">How Uber is measuring engineering productivity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-move-to-cloud?utm_source=publication-search">Inside Uber’s move to the Cloud</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-uber-built-its-observability-platform?utm_source=publication-search">How Uber built its observability platform</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes">Software Architect Archetypes</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=131s">02:11</a>) How Gautam accidentally deleted Uber’s Java Monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=340s">05:40</a>) The impact of Gautam’s mistake</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=395s">06:35</a>) Uber’s unique engineering stack</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=615s">10:15</a>) Uber’s SubmitQueue</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=764s">12:44</a>) Why Uber moved to a monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=990s">16:30</a>) The downsides of a monorepo</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1115s">18:35</a>) Measurement products built in-house</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1220s">20:20</a>) Measuring developer productivity and happiness</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1372s">22:52</a>) How Devpods improved developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1657s">27:37</a>) The challenges with cloud development environments</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1750s">29:10</a>) Gautam’s journey from Eng II to Principal Engineer</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=1920s">32:00</a>) Building trust and gaining social capital</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2177s">36:17</a>) An explanation of Principal Engineer at Uber—and the archetypes at Uber</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2707s">45:07</a>) The platform and program split at Uber</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=2895s">48:15</a>) How Gautam and his team supported their internal users</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3170s">52:50</a>) Gautam’s thoughts on developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3550s">59:10</a>) How AI enhances productivity, its limitations, and the rise of agentic AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=3840s">1:04:00</a>) An explanation of Vibe coding</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4054s">1:07:34</a>) An overview of Gitar and all it can help developers with</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4244s">1:10:44</a>) Top skills to cultivate to add value and stay relevant</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSrx9y7npyg&amp;t=4620s">1:17:00</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Uber's engineering culture and tools   <p>Gautam joined Uber in 2014 as an Android engineer. Back then, there were not even unit tests. Gautam wrote the first Android test, and set up Artifactory.</p>  <p>Uber built much of its engineering stack in-house because the cloud-native SaaS products were not built for their scale.</p>  <p>Even in the earlier years, Uber saw about one commit every minute – and the platforms at the time could not handle this (especially when considering that CI took 10-30 minutes to run!)</p>  <p>Build time was a problem. During the iOS and Android app rewrite in 2016, build times became very long. Gautam worked on getting it under control.</p>  <p>Submit Queue was a way to guarantee a green main. It serialised incoming commits to ensure they played nicely together. The company <a href="https://kagi.com/search?q=uber+submitqueue">published a paper</a> on this novel solution. Submit Queue tested changes and considered cross-dependencies between different commits. Machine learning models estimated potential failures and speculatively tried paths that might be green.</p>    <p>Monorepo: after starting as polyrepos, Uber moved to monorepos</p>  <p>Uber started with separate repos for Rider, Driver, and other apps (eg Eats). As the company grew, each team wanted its own repository, resulting in hundreds of repos. It became painful to upgrade and bump libraries.</p>  <p>The iOS team moved to a monorepo, followed by Android. The gains in productivity were massive because there was no need to bump libraries. This move really helped with standardisation.</p>  <p>The biggest initial pushback was that teams could no longer break an API without worrying about the consequences. There was concern about slower builds. In the end, the dev platform team solved these concerns.</p>     Developer experience and dev productivity   <p>Local Developer Analytics (LDA): an internal Uber system that ran on developers' machines and collected information about their systems. It integrated deeply into CLI tools and IDEs, tracked which files developers accessed most, and identified files with the most bugs. LDA helped identify bottlenecks in the development funnel.</p>  <p>Developer surveys: Uber ran these regularly. The dev tooling NPS went from negative 50 to positive 8 during Gautam’s tenure.</p>  <p>Things that made for a better developer experience: minimizing time to review code, time to build code, and reducing time spent in meetings.</p>    <p>DevPods: another internal Uber tool. These are basically cloud developer environments. They contain a container of code, build system artefacts and IDE indices in the cloud. DevPods make context switching quick.</p>  <p>Previously, onboarding involved running a bootstrapping script. The script was hard to maintain. Dev Pods moved the development stuff into a container. The containers can be huge.</p>     Career growth to Principal Engineer   <p>Going deep: getting into a niche and going deep can help over the long term, especially in areas others may not want to do.</p>  <p>Introspect regularly:&nbsp;Every two years, Gautam did some introspection to see if he was doing what he wanted and what could challenge him more.</p>  <p>Social capital and mentorship: these become very important at a big company. It helps to have connections. Helping people builds social capital. Gautam would drop everything to help people with their dev environment problems. He also held office hours on a regular basis, offering to help anyone who showed up.</p>  <p>Understand the business: Principal engineers need to understanding how engineering meets business, rather than just pure coding. It helps if you enjoy diving into this area – as well as if you like talking with people!</p>  <p>More of a peer relationship with your manager. As engineers grow in seniority, they become more like a peer to their manager and help their manager get stuff done. The relationship is more like a “peer” than a “boss”.</p>  <p>Tip for managers of senior+ devs: give them agency, check in often, and make sure they are unblocked.</p>     The impact of AI on software development   <p>Autocomplete: an obvious use case. It helps one type less and think more.</p>  <p>“Vibe coding”: AI allows you to explore more paths and experiment faster.</p>  <p>How AI impacts engineers</p>  <p>Controversial, but Gauam believes that junior engineers are going to thrive because they are coming up with new knowledge and new ways of working with AI tools. They do not have the biases of working a particular way.</p>  <p>The “generalist engineer” is going to be more in-demand, looking ahead</p>  <p>CS knowledge remains important.</p>  <p>When things go wrong, it is important to understand why they went wrong. This requires strong computer science fundamentals and system knowledge.</p>       <p>Where to find Gautam Korlam:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/kageiit">https://x.com/kageiit</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamkorlam/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Bypassing Large Diffs in SubmitQueue: <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/bypassing-large-diffs-in-submitqueue/">https://www.uber.com/blog/bypassing-large-diffs-in-submitqueue/</a></p><p>• Jenkins: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)</a></p><p>• Devpods: <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/devpod-improving-developer-productivity-at-uber/">https://www.uber.com/blog/devpod-improving-developer-productivity-at-uber/</a></p><p>• JetBrains: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">https://www.jetbrains.com/</a></p><p>• Cloud Development Environments: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environments">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cloud-development-environments</a></p><p>• Why are Cloud Development Environments Spiking in Popularity, Now?: <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/why-are-cloud-development-environments-spiking-in-popularity-now/">https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/why-are-cloud-development-environments-spiking-in-popularity-now/</a></p><p>• “The Coding Machine” at Meta with Michael Novati: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-coding-machine-at-meta</a></p><p>• Software Architect Archetypes: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes</a></p><p>• The Platform and Program Split at Uber: A Milestone Special: <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-platform-and-program-split-at">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-platform-and-program-split-at</a></p><p>• What is Vibe Coding?

<p>デジタル技術の進化により、私たちの個人情報やデータへの依存がますます高まっています。しかし、多くの政府提供IDシステムは、ユーザーのプライバシーや自由を十分に考慮していないことがあります。その中で、ユタ州の「<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SB260法案</a>」<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6848/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-6848" title="2025年5月7日施行">10</a>は、他のシステムとは異なるアプローチを取り、ユーザーのプライバシー保護とデータ管理の自主性を根底から強化していると話題になっています(<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/utahs-digital-id-law-sb260-is-the-new-frontier-for-user-controlled-identity/">Chang(2025)</a>他)。そこで、本記事では、その特徴と他のデジタルIDシステムとの差別化点について検討してみます。</p>



 



 SB260法案のユニークな特徴 



<p>SB260法案が他の政府提供IDシステムと大きく異なる点は、以下の特徴にあります。</p>



<p>個人の自主性を尊重<br>SB260では、「州が個人のアイデンティティを定義しない」と明確に規定されています (§ 63A-16-1202)。そして「州は特定の状況において、個人のアイデンティティを認識し承認することがある」とされています。従来の多くの政府IDは、政府が個人のアイデンティティを定義し、認識する権限を持っており、個人の存在は政府の承認に依存していました。これとSB260の新しいアプローチは根本的に異なります。SB260では、人間はすでに自分自身の権利で存在していることを認識し、州の役割は人間が認識され、法で規定された方法で州の承認を管理できるよう支援を提供する支援者という形になります。SB260は個人の自主性に重点を置いています 。前者のアプローチだと、政府に認識されないことによって存在が否定されうるのに対し、後者ではそれがおきません。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-4.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>監視とデータ共有の禁止<br>SB260では、デジタルIDが提示された際、政府機関やその他の関係者による監視や情報共有を厳しく禁止しています。例えば、提示されたID情報を、提示を受けた企業などがマーケティングや監視目的で使用することが許されません。このガイドラインは、ユーザーデータが不必要に共有されることを防ぎ、データ管理の透明性を促進します 。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>選択的な情報開示<br>多くの物理的な身分証明書では、住所や年齢といったすべての情報が開示されますが、SB260は「選択的開示」を可能にする技術を採用するとしています。例えば、年齢確認が必要な場合でも、実際の誕生日や住所を共有する必要がありません。これにより、個人情報が不必要に漏洩することを防ぎます 。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-6.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>デバイスの提供を強制しない<br>SB260は、デジタルアイデンティティ確認の際にモバイル端末を提供することを強制しないと規定しています。この規定は、法執行機関や他の政府関係者が端末へのアクセスを求める可能性を排除し、端末内の個人データの保護を保証します 。このあたりは、デバイスを確認者が預かって、あんなことやこんなことをできるような制度とだいぶ違うと言えます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-5.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>デジタルアイデンティティの利用は完全に任意<br>他のアイデンティティシステムとは異なり、SB260ではデジタルアイデンティティの利用が完全に任意であることが強調されています。政府機関はデジタルアイデンティティを強制したり、使用を推奨するためのインセンティブを提供することはできません。これにより、技術に不慣れな住民やデジタルツールの使用を望まない住民への配慮がなされています 。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/03/6848/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-6848" title="とはいえ、わたしはどちらかというとデンマークのような「デジタル代書屋」の提供で支援するようなアプローチのほうが良いと思っています。">18</a></p>



 



 他のIDシステムとの比較：何が違うのか？ 



<p>多くの政府提供IDでは、監視とデータ収集が懸念されています。一部のシステムでは、個人情報がマーケティングやデータ解析に利用される可能性がありますが、SB260はこれを明確に禁止しています。また、他のシステムではデジタルIDが義務化される場合があり、ユーザーには選択肢がありません。一方で、SB260は完全に任意のシステムであり、ユーザー中心の設計が際立っています。</p>



<p>その結果、SB260はプライバシーを優先し、ユーザーのデータ管理を完全に可能にする未来型のデジタルIDシステムとして注目されています。このユーザー主導型のアプローチは、アメリカ全土だけでなく、世界中のデジタルID開発にも影響を与える可能性があります 。</p>



 



 結論：デジタル時代の新しい参照点 



<p>ユタ州のSB260法案は、デジタルIDの未来を形作る重要な節目と言えます。ユーザーの自主性、プライバシーの保護、選択の自由を包括的に保証するこの法案は、他の政府提供IDシステムとは一線を画すものです。</p>



<p>文書の出来自体に関して言うと、Identityの定義が「”Identity” means any attribute used to identify or distinguish a specific individual.」になっていたり、「(a)each individual has a unique identity;」となっているところなど、規格的な見方をするといろいろと気になる点はあります。が、SB260は、個人の自由とデータ管理の新しい基準を設定するだけでなく、技術と法律が調和してユーザー本位の世界を実現するモデルとして広く認知され、今後デジタルIDを制度化していく各種法域において、デジタル時代における安心・安全なIDシステムということに関して、何らかの影響を与えていくことでしょう。これを受けて、アメリカの各州がどう動くか、目がはなせません。</p>

<p>Imagine you’re the cofounder of a startup hiring its first few software engineers, and there’s a candidate who smashes the technical interview, and is the only one to complete the full coding interview – doing so with time to spare. Their communication style is a bit unconventional, but this could be explained by language differences, and isn’t a red flag. So, the promising candidate gets a thumbs up, and pretty soon they’re on screen in a non-technical final interview with the other cofounder, via video.</p><p>Then things get weird. Your cofounder pings you mid-interview to report that the candidate from Poland speaks no Polish whatsoever, and also that there is something just not right about their appearance on screen. The recruitment of this candidate gets derailed by suspicious details which erode everyone’s confidence in making the hire. Soon afterwards, the same thing happens again with another candidate.</p><p>Later, you discover that two imposters hiding behind deepfake avatars almost succeeded in tricking your startup into hiring them. This may sound like the stuff of fiction, but it really did happen to a startup called <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/">Vidoc Security</a>, recently. Fortunately, they caught the AI impostors – and the second time it happened they got video evidence.</p><p>To find out more about this unsettling, fascinating episode from the intersection of cutting-edge AI and tech recruitment, the Pragmatic Engineer sat down with Vidoc cofounder, Dawid Moczadło. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>The first AI faker. Vidoc Security nearly made an offer to a fake candidate, but their back story raised too many questions.</p>  <p>The second AI faker. The next time a job candidate raised similar suspicions, the team was prepared and confronted the faker during the call – and recorded it.</p>  <p>How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates. Take the risk seriously, have applicants turn off video filters and verify that they do this, record interviews, and get firm proof of identity before any offer.</p>  <p>Foreign state interference? There’s evidence that many AI candidates could be part of a coordinated governmental operation targeting hundreds of western tech businesses. Full-remote workplaces are the most targeted.</p>  <p>Return of in-person final rounds? This looks an obvious consequence of these incidents.</p>  <p>New AI risks for tech businesses. Remote interviews may have to change, while devs also risk introducing security vulnerabilities by accepting AI suggestions without critique.</p>  <p>Hiring funnel. The story began with <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">this job posting</a> for a backend engineer. The startup shares its hiring funnel, giving a sense of how competitive full-remote startup positions are, currently. As context: from 500 applications, two hires have been made – and Vidoc is <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">still actively recruiting</a> for this position.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4184d0d-b473-4aeb-999c-e60dbd80396f_1600x750.png">          </a>Catching an AI imposter: the candidate (left) refused to place their hand in front of their face because it would blow their AI cover.

If you’re currently hiring, or plan to, the nature and sophistication of the fake-applicant scam targeting this startup provides food for thought.</p><p>For more tips in detecting fake applicants, you can also <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/ebook/ebook-detecting-fake-candidates-vsl.pdf">check this handy PDF guide</a>, created by the Vidoc engineering team.</p> 1. The first AI faker <p>Vidoc Security is a security provider offering automated code reviews to detect security issues. The idea for the company came from two security engineers and ethical hackers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-moczadlo/">Dawid Moczadło</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaudia-kloc-/">Klaudia Kloc</a>. Previously, they hacked top tech companies like Meta and then disclosed vulnerabilities to those places in order to collect bounties, and get on those companies’ ethical hacking leaderboards.</p><p>With the rise of LLMs in the past couple of years, Dawid and Klaudia spotted an opportunity to create a tool that works in the same way as they searched for security vulnerabilities: looking across the broader codebase, checking how components interact, which parts could be insecure, and more. Basically, an LLM can take their expertise about what works to hack well-designed systems, and build a tool with some of the same know-how.</p><p>Their idea attracted investors, and Dawid and Klaudia raised a $600K seed round in 2023, and a further $2.5M in seed funding in August 2024. With this seed funding in the bank: the company began hiring. They posted <a href="https://justjoin.it/job-offer/vidoc-security-lab-founding-backend-engineer---mid-senior-warszawa-javascript">a job ad</a> for a backend engineer, and started to interview candidates. (We share details on the exact hiring funnel and statistics below, in “The hiring funnel”)</p><p>One promising candidate was called Makary Krol. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">His LinkedIn profile</a> is still active:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62e47648-a4a7-4798-a498-bd89c59c25f7_1272x1552.png">          </a>Fake profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/makary-krol-336923317/">LinkedIn</a> <p>Below is a step-by-step summary of how the recruitment process for the imposter candidate went, based on Vidoc Security's records, including the bogus resume. By the end of step 5, the team were certain they were the target of a scam.</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅Resume looks solid:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbbb86dbc-8345-4c3f-b198-c38450d6a587_1260x1512.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 from the fake resume. The resume looked convincing  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe58fc44e-cebe-400b-a05a-075a1e01f73a_1206x1012.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of the fake, but convincing resume <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ A 15-30 minute call with Paulina, head of operations. It was a bit odd that the candidate did not speak any Polish, but was based there and graduated from Warsaw University of Technology. He spoke in broken English, and with a very strong accent that sounded Asian, but these weren’t warning big red flags, and the candidate sounded motivated.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview. ✅⚠️ The candidate was clearly well-rounded and a technical screening was the obvious next step. Dawid’s only “yellow flag” was that their communication skills were poor, but he figured a technical interview would be a chance to show their core coding and technical skills.</p><p>4. Technical interview. ✅✅The candidate absolutely smashed it, being the first to finish all coding tasks and follow-up questions in the allocated time of 2 hours, which hadn’t happened before. Dawid was surprised by how competent they were at coding and technical problem solving. The coding abilities of this candidate were definitely not fake: they were a seasoned, very capable engineer.</p><p>5. Final hiring manager interview. ‼️⚠️ This was a non-technical interview with cofounder, Klaudia, who dug into the specifics of their background and grew suspicious. The candidate gave some details about previous positions, but she increasingly found herself disbelieving their back story and resume, the more time she spent with the candidate. Dawid shared the suspicion and they became certain that the figure on screen was far from what they claimed to be.</p><p>By the end of the recruitment process, Vidoc believed they had nearly been played, and had come worryingly close to extending an offer to a fake candidate using a false identity in their documents, and an AI filter to mask their face on screen. However, they had no evidence of this, and didn’t record the interviews, so had only their impressions and notes.</p><p>When Dawid recounted this episode to peers, he was met with disbelief. Founder friends – along with most other people – thought the team were overreacting and misguided. Eventually, Dawid stopped sharing the story and began to doubt the team’s suspicions about the candidate.</p><p>After the incident, Vidoc added an onsite interview as a final step in the recruitment process, and held a retrospective to figure out how to avoid something similar again. Interestingly, there wasn’t much that could be done about the potential risks of remote interviews being taken by applicants pretending to be someone else.</p> 2. The second AI faker <p>Two months after the suspected fake job candidate episode, another promising applicant appeared, going by the name Bratislav Rakočević, located in Serbia, with a university education there. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">His LinkedIn</a> was pretty basic:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4a2dbe6-a267-4dd8-a255-120d74bd5182_1203x1600.png">          </a>Another entirely made-up profile. Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bratislavrako%C4%8Devi%C4%87-c197d9200/">LinkedIn</a> <p>This application looked good, so the company ran the usual recruitment process, below (including the candidate’s made-up resume):</p><p>1. Resume screening: ✅⚠️ Solid on technologies, but with too many buzzwords for their current, self-employed role. Of course, it’s not unusual that some devs don’t thrive at writing resumes. Their credentials merited a call, especially as the “candidate” had “worked” at HubSpot and Woosh:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76e0e250-ed67-43a6-b62b-b3d3ff9d7cf7_1222x1598.png">          </a>Page 1 of 2 of another resume that later turned out to be fake  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2e01c19-006c-4996-b754-cb5db9b033c5_1194x1600.png">          </a>Page 2 of 2 of another resume that turned out to be fake <p>2. First-round screening. ✅⚠️ Communication was a bit choppy — then again, we’re talking about a non-native English speaker. The candidate did not speak Serbian, despite graduating from the University of Kragujevac, in Serbia. Once again, they sounded motivated, so proceeded to the next round.</p><p>3. Hiring manager interview: AI filter exposed‼️‼️Dawid conducted this interview, and immediately felt that something was off about the candidate. First of all, Dawid felt the candidate on the call looked somewhat unlike their low-resolution LinkedIn profile:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b95aaad-1265-4ed0-9a23-ea14ff7850b0_1402x780.png">          </a>First suspicion: Dawid felt the interviewee looked dissimilar to their profile picture <p>As a rule, Vidoc never records interviews, but the team had been burnt once before and had faced scepticism about it from peers afterwards. So he hit record, and asked the candidate to make a simple gesture which bamboozles the current crop of AI filters:</p><blockquote><p>“Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face and cover it partially?”</p></blockquote> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1518cc3-4acc-4426-81ce-1921c97a2926_1104x444.gif">          </a>Candidate (on the left) declines to place hand in front of face as the interviewer requests (right) <p>The candidate refused, so Dawid ended the conversation. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/klaudia-kloc-_story-of-how-an-ai-generated-polish-politician-ugcPost-7300929611511611395-QUeq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAIk0KwBsmE3oBadWSg2ettxmEyKbqZKG34">Watch the full video of the encounter.</a></p><p>Later, several people pointed out that the AI mask looked uncannily similar to a prominent Polish politician named Sławomir Mentzen:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c1b4a8a-2e03-43f0-ac57-696ca0547ecb_1366x800.png">          </a>Was this deepfake trained on video footage of a Polish politician? <p>Looking back on these twin incidents, the team suspects the same individual may have been behind the AI disguises of both fake candidates because:</p>  <p>Their voices sounded almost identical</p>  <p>The second candidate answered questions with surprising confidence – almost like he’d been asked them before</p>  <p>…a hunch that they had spoken before</p>  <p>The AI filter for the second faker was of much lower quality than the first. The first candidate slipped through undetected through several interviews, despite almost certainly using an AI filter as well. Dawid said the second candidate’s filter looked obvious on the screen – but on that occasion the Vidoc Security team were on high alert for any possible deception. It’s worth remembering that AI filters improve with time, so spotting a good one won’t always be easy.</p> 3. How to avoid being tricked by AI candidates <p>How can tech companies hiring engineers protect themselves, and prevent AI-disguised candidates? Some suggestions:</p><p>This is not a drill; take the threat seriously: If you think your company is too small to fall victim, think again. Vidoc Security was just a two-person startup in February 2023 with no funding raised, when it was first targeted. The first fake profile cold emailed them on LinkedIn to ask if they were hiring.</p><p>It’s possible there is a large, state-level operation running a pool of bogus applicants who hide behind fake resumes and AI filters in video interviews. If this operation can find the smallest of startups to target, it’s safe to assume they could apply to any other company, as well.</p><p>Don’t assume all job seekers on local job boards are genuine. Vidoc posted on local job boards, like the one in Poland. But whoever was behind this operation figured out that it’s profitable to pose as Serbian, Polish, and other eastern European profiles, and to apply via small, low-profile job boards. I didn’t even know about the job board “<a href="https://justjoin.it/">JustJoinIT</a>” (popular in Poland) but the fakers were already active on it.</p><p>Ask candidates to turn off all filters – including background ones. Filters that blur or replace the background are ubiquitous these days. During a video interview, it’s fair to ask a candidate to turn off all filters. After that, if there are still unusual minor details on their face or the background, then it’s safe to assume that a candidate did not turn off their filters. In an interview for a full-remote position, this could be justification enough to terminate the call.</p><p>Ask the candidate to do things that AI filters cannot handle – yet, such as:</p>  <p>A face turning side to side</p>  <p>A hand in front of a face</p>  <p>standing up and walking backward from the camera, showing more body detail</p>  <p>In the circumstances, It should be justifiable to run through some or all of these tests, as well as asking for all filters to be turned off. Stu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4, <a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/north-korean-it-worker-threat-10-critical-updates-to-your-hiring-process">shared additional details</a> on what his company learned from hiring a North Korean worker with a false identity:</p>  <p>Do not rely on email references alone. For reference checks, also do phone calls or video calls with references.</p>  <p>Absence of a digital footprint is suspicious. If there’s no trace of a candidate anywhere online, it could be a flag.</p>  <p>Use a phone carrier lookup tool before calling a candidate. Many fake candidates provide a VoIP number. Treat any such number as a red flag and refuse to call candidates on it.</p>  <p>Conduct all interviews using video. Fake candidates can slip through written application processes more easily</p>  <p>Expect identity theft. In the case of KnowBe4, the identity of the person they hired was real and stolen, meaning that a background check came back clean.</p>  <p>Put better internal monitoring in place. Monitor access to systems by onboarded employees – and pay extra attention to new joiners.</p>  <p>When suspicious, ask lowkey “cultural” questions. For example, if a candidate claims to be from Seattle but there is reason to suspect otherwise, ask a question like, “'I see you are from Seattle, what's your favorite place to eat, and what do you usually get?” Faking this knowledge in a convincing way is hard for someone who has never been to Seattle, and doesn’t know the local cuisine.</p>  <p>Different shipping address for laptop. If a candidate asks for an onboarding laptop to be shipped to a different address from where they are supposed to be living or working, it’s a red flag.</p>  <p>Additional tips:</p>  <p>Record video interviews and save them for later. AI-disguised candidates might be hard to spot in a live scenario, but analyzing the video later could be helpful. Note that recording the interview will most likely require disclosing this to a candidate, and them agreeing to this.</p>  <p>Get notarized proof of identity. This advice <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">comes from Google</a>, after they saw hundreds of US companies fall victim to North Korean workers by hiring them for tech roles.</p>  <p>Vidoc also created a guide to detect fake candidates in your hiring pipeline: <a href="https://www.vidocsecurity.com/ebook/ebook-detecting-fake-candidates-vsl.pdf">see this PDF document here</a>.</p> 4. Foreign state interference? <p>So, who or what might be behind these two incidents at Vidoc; a lone individual or individuals, or something else entirely? </p>

<p>This is a clip I created (6 minutes) summarizing Protocol Lab’s Aleph project with Javier Milei, the guy who gave Musk the chainsaw at the CPAC gathering a few weeks ago. I get that it is difficult to navigate narratives and torrents of information. The current has been against the story I’ve been trying to tell for a decade. It simply didn’t stick, but I did try. I lost my old life in the process, but I gained a sunny yard filled with birdsong and time to read stacks of books on&nbsp;cosmology and consciousness. Until I pop in again, be well everyone.</p>

 AI時代におけるデータのアクセスおよび共有の促進<br>ー OECD理事会勧告「データアクセスと共有の促進」の付属文書 
 



<p>以下はその内容を大まかにまとめたものです。詳しくは原文を御覧ください。</p>



 概要 



 
 OECDのデータへのアクセスと共有の強化に関する勧告（EASD）は、権利保護を確保しながらデータの利益を最大化するための枠組みを提供します。 



 経済的、社会的、法的考慮を統合したデータガバナンスへの全政府的アプローチを強調しています。 



 この勧告は、OECDのメンバーおよびパートナーによる自発的な遵守を促し、責任あるデータ共有の実践を推進します。 
 



 データガバナンスの主要概念 



 
 データ価値サイクル: データの作成から削除までの全ライフサイクルをカバーし、アルゴリズムや人間のスキルなどの補完的リソースの必要性を強調します。 



 データオープンネスの連続体: 閉じたデータからオープンなデータまでのアクセスを分類する枠組みであり、リスクと信頼に基づいたカスタマイズされた共有の取り決めを可能にします。 



 データエコシステム: データホルダー、プロデューサー、中介者などのさまざまな利害関係者が相互作用し、価値を生み出すため、対立する利益のバランスを取るための協力と信頼が必要です。 
 



 データアクセスと共有の強化のための原則 



 
 信頼の強化: 利害関係者を相談や透明性を通じて関与させ、データガバナンスに対する信頼を築きます。 



 データへの投資: データ共有を促進するために市場ベースのアプローチや持続可能なビジネスモデルを推進し、イノベーションのための規制サンドボックスを含めます。 



 データの効果的な利用: データが見つけやすく、アクセス可能で、相互運用可能で、再利用可能（FAIR原則）であることを確保し、国境を越えたデータ共有を促進します。

<p>This post is a more technical follow-up to the <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">post announcing the passing of SB 260 in Utah</a>, establishing the principles for state-endorsed digital identity (SEDI). While SEDI does not mandate any particular technology, its mandated principles close the door for technologies that do not comply, and open the door for technologies that do. This article explores what SEDI makes technically possible, in compliance with SB 260 principles.</p><p>State-endorsed digital identity (SEDI) introduces numerous foundational principles for a government-sponsored digital identity system, several of which were covered in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/utah-blazes-new-trail-for-ssi-sedi-441d8ce65ab8">Utah Blazes New Trail for SSI:&nbsp;SEDI</a>:</p>  “Endorse” vs. “issue” and “identity” vs. “credential”  Sovereign control  Guardianship  Privacy &amp; no surveillance  State-of-the-art security  <p>This post explores more technical and security principles enabled by SEDI that will be of interest to digital identity&nbsp;experts.</p> “Autonomic” Identifiers <p>SEDI doesn’t mandate any specific technology stack, but it does specify capabilities that are simply unachievable for most digital identity technologies. One foundational example is the requirement in lines (73) — (77) of the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html">Utah bill</a>, that individuals must first bring their “identity” to the state, after which it can be endorsed.</p><p>What kind of “identity” might that be? That will be specified as the details of Utah’s future identity program are fleshed out. As a Utah citizen and as an outside expert invited to consult on these new identity policies, I will push for stringent minimum standards for the security, utility, privacy, and autonomy of a digital identity to qualify for state endorsement. Needless to say, your social media login — or even your bank login — should not&nbsp;suffice.</p><p>One “identity” that meets my preferred standard is an “Autonomic Identifier” or AID, as first described in Dr. Samuel Smith’s seminal paper: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI).</p><p>Some of the capabilities enabled by an AID-powered SEDI ecosystem include:</p><p>BYOID (Bring Your Own Identifier) — In the digital realm, for an identity to be self sovereign, it must begin with a unique identifier that is under the sovereign control of an individual. When a state endorses an identity, in practice they are endorsing an identifier that an individual has brought to the state that is provably under the individual’s control.</p><p>Persistent Identifiers — When that individual moves their residence to another state (within the U.S., for example), necessitating a new identity endorsement from the new state, the old state can revoke their endorsement of the same identifier that the new state will be endorsing; the identifier is persistent. This is a KERI capability that is very different from most PKI-based systems where the identifier is a public key that is discarded upon rotation or revocation.</p><p>Reputation — This persistence creates a continuity for the individual to retain and build their digital reputation independent from any particular government endorsement. In fact, it would be inclusive of every endorsement they have ever had, and all their provable behaviors using those endorsements, no matter how many states or countries have given them past endorsements of identity. And it would be inclusive of non-state endorsements such as educational, work, or anything else,&nbsp;too.</p> Putting It All&nbsp;Together <p>A simple depiction of SEDI built on AIDs might look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>AIDs enable true self-sovereignty as the foundation, right where it belongs and where it provides the greatest utility for all aspects of digital life. State endorsement is also situated right where it belongs: as only one of many endorsements an individual may receive through their digital lifetime.</p> State-Issued ‘Jenga’ <p>Conversely, building digital identity on top of a state-issued credential instead of a state-endorsed identifier lasts only until the state revokes that credential. An attached academic credential, for example, is lost when the individual moves from one state to another and obtains a new identity in the new state, and the old state revokes the now-obsolete issuance.</p><p>Look at this visually:</p><p>This is like a game of Jenga: pull out the state-issued ID — by moving from one state or country to another — and the whole stack falls down. When the state revokes the ID they’ve issued, you also lose everything cryptographically bound to it, and must start&nbsp;over.</p><p>Even if the old state kept their credential alive, there is no binding between old and new credentials, no way to build a growing, persistent reputation that connects a person to their cross-boundary behaviors in the digital world the same way a consistent legal name connects their behaviors across boundaries in the physical&nbsp;world.</p> Human-Friendly? <p>Autonomic identifiers cannot be human-friendly. Human-friendly namespaces require human management, recurring cost, and have scarcity problems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting">cybersquatting</a>, or missing the opportunity to register Timothy.com or timothy@gmail; the 1,000th Timothy won’t have much of a selection. AIDs are long random strings of letters and numbers, and are so incredibly random it would take a million computers a million years to guess one, which ensures universal uniqueness and brings a strong measure of security.</p><p>AIDs have cryptographic properties, so we can prove control over them in the digital realm and recover control when keys are compromised. And keys *will* get compromised (see “Expected Compromise” below). Without these special mathematical properties, they’d be just letters and numbers anyone can copy and use to impersonate, like a social security&nbsp;number.</p> Many Identifiers <p>In real life, we have identifiers that are public — our legal names — that typically remain constant throughout our lives. We use these identifiers to build reputations over time, as patterns of behaviors accumulate that are associated with them. With SEDI, the identifier that is endorsed by the state will work in the same manner: it will be persistent, and as public as one chooses to make it, used and disclosed (always under the hood) whenever one might disclose their legal&nbsp;name.</p><p>In digital situations where one prefers to not use their legal name, there’s nothing in SEDI preventing that individual from using a completely different identifier, unrelated to their endorsed one. In fact there is no limit on how many different unique identifiers one may create and use for whatever purpose they choose; and each state can choose whether or not only one at a time can be officially endorsed (Utah allows only one physical identity at a time, and may do the same digitally).</p> Potential Security Advantages <p>SEDI’s architecture enables numerous critical security advantages that could be implemented:</p><p>Zero Trust — ”Never trust, always verify” is the ideal of zero trust. SEDI can not only embrace zero trust, it can enable true zero trust, which does away with all shared secrets, described briefly&nbsp;below.</p><p>No Shared Secrets — SEDI doesn’t employ bearer tokens, symmetric keys, or phishable passwords, unless they are used in conjunction with digital signatures. (Pins and passwords can be helpful when used in addition to digital signatures or physical&nbsp;keys)</p><p>Anti-fragile — A breach of one person or system does not facilitate the breach of the entire system or another connected one, as with most current digital identity systems, which are predicated on shared secrets and perimeter security. With SEDI, most breaches can be detectable, preventable, and recoverable.</p><p>Expected Compromise — Key compromise should be expected and anticipated — and not surprising and catastrophic — in addition to robust prevention and detection capabilities, bringing powerful means for recovery.</p><p>Multi-signature — Keys and credentials can be protected with m-of-n weighted multi-signature capabilities, enabling creative familial, professional, and social protection and recovery&nbsp;schemes.</p><p>Mutual authentication — Individuals could authenticate each other, in any setting. For example, a citizen could authenticate a police officer as readily as a police officer can authenticate the citizen. Any person, organization, or thing claiming authority from the state could be instantly verified to have the claimed authority.</p> Artificially Intelligent Agents (“Agentic AI”) <p>IBM predicts that 2025 may be “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-agents-2025-expectations-vs-reality">the year of the AI agent</a>”, and the CEO of Microsoft predicts that agentic AI will “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=satya+nadella+agentic+ai">replace all software</a>.” Whether that happens or not, AI agents are coming and will soon affect the way we interact with organizations of all kinds. This can take the form of you interacting with some organization’s agent, some organization interacting with your agent, or two AI agents interacting with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>SEDI paves the way for verifying that an AI agent has the delegated authority it claims to have, and constraining what an agent is authorized to do. SEDI enables authority to be delegated to people, organizations, and things, and AI agents are things. SEDI is uniquely well suited for controlling, securing, and navigating a world of ubiquitous AI&nbsp;agents.</p><p>Many don’t like the idea of having to deal with AI agents in any form, and I can’t blame them. But like the digital transformation itself, that world is coming whether we like it or not, and the more controls and constraints we can have for it, the&nbsp;better.</p> Comprehensive Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In sum, SEDI enables a cohesive, comprehensive digital identity system for a state or for any other ecosystem. It requires no proprietary platforms, products, or providers, though it doesn’t preclude their participation, and requires no shared or trusted intermediaries or blockchains. Through robust guardianship, delegation, and multi-sig, it extends digital capabilities to populations that have been previously excluded: minors (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, migrants, and any other population. And it does this while maximizing individual autonomy and control over one’s data, with powerful means for consent, and numerous breakthroughs in security.</p><p>In short, SEDI heralds a new era of utility, security and autonomy for comprehensive digital identity ecosystems, and I am proud of my home state of Utah for introducing it to the&nbsp;world.</p>

 Finally! <p>On March 4, 2025, the Utah legislature unanimously passed <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html">SB 260</a>, a groundbreaking digital identity bill that carries this description:</p><p>“This bill enacts provisions related to a state-endorsed digital identity” (SEDI).</p><p>Now it’s off to the governor for signature, who has been publicly positive about it. Huge credit to Sen. Cullimore, the bill’s sponsor, and Christopher Bramwell, the state’s Chief Privacy Officer, who helped draft and guide its content. SB 260 will likely soon become the law in Utah, and with it the possibility of an exciting new era for self-sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>Passage of SB 260 is the partial realization of a dream I’ve had for more than a dozen years, since co-founding <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> with Jason Law in 2012. It is not the complete realization of that dream, but it lays the necessary groundwork and carries with it momentum to go the distance over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>SB 260 does not call for the creation of a new identity system for the state of Utah — yet — that will be done later, hopefully in next year’s session. This bill establishes the principles Utah politicians stand behind — unanimously — that any future Utah statewide identity system must adhere to. If you are an SSI aficionado, you will recognize and love the principles in this&nbsp;bill.</p> Is State-Endorsed Identity (SEDI) Still&nbsp;SSI? <p>For some in the SSI community, the concept of SSI does not involve a state actor — at&nbsp;all.</p><p>To these SSI purists, SSI becomes trustworthy through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> that replaces the need for a state actor as a root of trust. While theoretically possible — and still a worthwhile end-goal — this ideal vision of SSI isn’t feasible anytime soon. In the meantime, the credibility of government can help accelerate SSI toward an end-goal of not needing government. How? By making ubiquitous the technologies and ceremonies necessary for a web of trust to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>At the end of the day, if independent control of strong digital identity rests fully with the individual, with no visibility by the state for if, how, or when it is used, then advocates of SSI should be in favor of SSI strengthened by a state endorsement. That is how physical identity works today and how digital identity should work, too. And there’s no reason other, non-government flavors of SSI can’t continue to develop and&nbsp;coexist.</p> State-Endorsed Digital Identity&nbsp;(SEDI) <p>The words “state-endorsed” used throughout this bill carry a lot of meaning; most emerging digital identity systems use the word “issue“ instead of “endorse”. This is a distinction with a profound difference.</p><p>In real life, does a state issue identity or endorse it? When a baby is born, who gives the baby its identifier, its name? The parents do. The state waits for parents to pick a name, puts the name into a certificate, endorses the certificate, then gives it to the parents. Parents determine identity, the state endorses&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple months ago, a 60 year-old friend of mine decided to change her last name. The decision was hers alone to make, but her new name would not be believable or provable to third parties until she has an endorsement of the new name from the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In real life the state issues credentials, not identity. In this bill Utah acknowledges this reality and explicitly states that individuals first assert identity and only then can the state endorse it. That will be the guardrails for any future state-endorsed digital identity system. (See “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity Nerds</a>” for more&nbsp;info.)</p><p>Through SEDI, SB 260 codifies several foundational SSI principles:</p> Control <p>In lines (65) and (120), it is explicit that the individual is in control of their digital identity.</p> Guardianship &amp; Age Verification <p>Lines (35–40) and (97–98) lay the groundwork for digital guardianship, bringing broad digital capabilities for the first time to dependent populations such as children (including infants), the elderly, disabled persons, homeless persons, and&nbsp;more</p><p>Of particular note in Utah, digital guardianship is how age verification can work for all ages and capabilities, something Utah has been on the forefront of, policy-wise. In the future, guardianship could even work for animals and things,&nbsp;too.</p><p>See “<a href="https://libertas.institute/privacy/finally-a-path-forward-for-online-age-verification/">Finally, a Path Forward for Age Verification</a>” by the Libertas Institute for more info about how SB 260 could facilitate age verification.</p> Privacy &amp; No Surveillance <p>SB 260 is explicit that individuals have the right to not be surveilled. This means that SEDI cannot have any form of “phone home”, which differentiates it from the mobile drivers license (mDL) systems based on ISO 18013, and from the federated identity systems now being implemented in Europe and Australia, which all have inherent phone-home surveillance capabilities.</p><p>In lines (78–79), (84–96), (99–102), (116–117), (122–125), and (128–139) the bill details the principles of privacy and autonomy that must guide any future state-endorsed digital identity system in&nbsp;Utah.</p> State-of-the-Art Security <p>Line (113) stipulates that Utah SEDI must incorporate “state-of-the-art safeguards” for protecting identity. Current industry standards are not good enough, and in fact are unacceptably fragile in my view. My interpretation of “state-of-the-art” means something akin to KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), where breaches are preventable, detectable, and recoverable in ways that current identity standards cannot do, and which is quantum-resistant. (See the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">Details for Nerds</a>’ for more details about security.)</p> Now the Work&nbsp;Begins <p>In some ways SB 260 is the end of a long, hard journey for me, and the partial realization of an audacious dream. In reality it’s one bill, in one state, that establishes the principles and guardrails for a future identity system without creating one&nbsp;today.</p><p>In any case, it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to true self-sovereign identity being officially and legally embraced at a significant level, an entire state of the United States. The next step is far harder: turning concepts into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>For more technical information, see <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/sedi-details-for-identity-nerds-e1949af5cc30">SEDI Details for Identity&nbsp;Nerds</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago I abandoned Twitter in favor of Mastodon. Recent events validate that choice and underscore the strategic importance of a decentralized fediverse that can’t be owned by a single corporate or state actor. But while Mastodon meets my needs, much of the Twitter diaspora has gone to Bluesky. That’s fine for now but might not always be. In an article titled “Science Must Step Away From Nationally Managed Infrastructure,” Dan Goodman writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many scientists put huge efforts into building networks to communicate with colleagues and the general public. But all that work and the value in those networks was lost when many scientists felt compelled to leave following Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform (now X). The process of rebuilding on Bluesky is underway, but it will take years and may never reach the same critical mass. Even if the transition is successful, the same thing may happen to Bluesky in a few years.</p></blockquote>
<p>How can we prepare for a future migration from Bluesky to Mastodon? Bridgy Fed — a service that enables you to connect together your website, fediverse account and Bluesky account — will help. But Bridgy Fed needs to be easier to use. So I recruited Claude’s new Sonnet 7 model to do that.</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent, Microsoft cutting AI data center investment, EA releases Red Alert code, developers don’t want GPUs, DeepSeek keeps open sourcing innovation, and a US DOGE software engineer forgets to make their GitHub account for work private.</p>  <p>Ads startup demands a lot &amp; offers little → struggles to hire. An adtech startup using AI to generate ads seeks a founding engineer who will devote their heart and soul – and most of their awake time – to the company, and is struggling to hire. They’re now offering a $50K (!!) referral bonus. Feels like a classic case of overlooking that hiring is a two-way street: most standout devs don’t want to work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>  <p>Cloudflare’s self-critical, transparent postmortem. The leading content delivery network recently had its object storage go down for an hour, and only a day later published a detailed incident review, with the CEO personally taking responsibility for fixing the systemic issues which triggered the downtime. Clouflare is a refreshing exception for promptly sharing incident summaries, and showing it’s serious about continuously improving reliability.</p>  <p>More signs of “cutthroat” Big Tech. Google hints at a 60-hour workweek for workers in its AI group, and Meta fires 20 people for leaking internal information.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Claude Code quietly becoming the best AI coding agent? <p>Anthropic lowkey launched <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, an agentic coding tool, recently. Feedback I’ve seen from engineers is that the tool is pretty good, with capabilities on par with other AI agents – including Devin (which costs $500/month).</p><p>Until now, Anthropic has built the best LLM for coding (Sonnet 3.5 and Sonnet 3.7). In hindsight, it was only a matter of time until they expanded by building an agentic coding tool that’s at least equal to what other startups offer. After all, most startups will build their agents on top of Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7, as well.</p><p>A criticism is that Claude Code <a href="https://x.com/sirjoeldean/status/1897493893358264453">is expensive</a>, which should not be that surprising because AI agents are much more compute-intensive to run than LLMs. I’ll reserve judgement, Anthropic could turn into a major dev tools company if they keep building AI coding tools like this.</p> Is Microsoft really cutting AI data center investment?

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By   <p><a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a> — The modern identity platform for B2B SaaS.</p>  <p><a href="https://engguidebook.com/#buy">The Software Engineer’s Guidebook</a>: Written by me (Gergely) – now out in audio form as well</p>  <p><a href="http://augmentcode.com/pragmatic">Augment Code</a> — AI coding assistant that pro engineering teams love</p>  <p>—</p> In This Episode <p>Not many people know that I have a brother: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz">Balint Orosz</a>. Balint is also in tech, but in many ways, is the opposite of me. While I prefer working on backend and business logic, he always thrived in designing and building UIs. While I opted to work at more established companies, he struck out on his own and started his startup, Distinction. And yet, our professional paths have crossed several times: at one point in time I accepted an offer to join Skyscanner as a Principal iOS Engineer – and as part of the negotiation, I added a clause to my contrac that I will not report directly or indirectly to the Head of Mobile: who happened to be my brother, thanks to Skyscanner acquiring his startup the same month that Skyscanner made an offer to hire me.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa58007dd-d7cc-44b8-b233-5bbabe719845_872x572.png">          </a>The Orosz brothers: both of us are working in tech, and have had professional overlaps. Like this podcast episode! <p>Today, Balint is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a>, a beloved text editor known for its user-friendly interface and sleek design – an app that Apple awarded the prestigious Mac App of the Year in 2021.</p><p>In our conversation, we explore how Balint approaches building opinionated software with an intense focus on user experience. We discuss the lessons he learned from his time building Distinction and working at Skyscanner that have shaped his approach to Craft and its development.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Balint’s first startup, Distinction, and his time working for Skyscanner after they acquired it</p>  <p>A case for a balanced engineering culture with both backend and frontend priorities</p>  <p>Why Balint doesn’t use iOS Auto Layout</p>  <p>The impact of Craft being personal software on front-end and back-end development</p>  <p>The balance between customization and engineering fear in frontend work</p>  <p>The resurgence of local-first software and its role in modern computing</p>  <p>The value of building a physical prototype</p>  <p>How Balint uses GenAI to assist with complicated coding projects</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>Design-focused engineers find it harder to fit in. Engineers who focus on backend and distributed systems can usually verbalize their impact clearer, and could see faster career growth – including getting into leadership positions. This creates a reinforcing cycle: as most engineering executives have a backend engineering background: they will recognize and reward backend contributions more.</p><p>Balint didn’t like how he didn’t “fit in” as an engineer focused on design and UI: but he just kept building things he believed in – and years later, building up that “design muscle” helps him build products that backend-focused engineers might struggle in putting together.</p><p>Amazing companies cannot have a single engineering culture. Balint observed how every standout company that has a single engineering culture inherently biases towards either a backend-heavy engineering culture (e.g. Google, Amazon) or a UI-heavy one (Apple). For a company to be truly standout – more so than these Big Tech giants – it needs to have several engineering cultures: prioritizing both backend and UI excellence. This is what Craft is aiming to do internally.</p><p>To build something better than most other products: you might need to take a different approach. Craft does not use Apple’s UI components: they don’t use SwiftUI or Autolayout – something that 95% or more of iOS apps all take advantage of.</p><p>Craft, instead, built their own components from scratch, and came up with their own layout and animations system. This is a lot more work at first: but it’s how Craft can do smooth animations that most apps are unable to do so – and it’s a reason engineers at Apple have asked the team “how are you able to do such a smooth animation on the navigation bar?” (The native iOS navigation bar cannot be animated like Craft does it) Craft can do all this thanks to building and maintaining their own components. It’s simpler to do than most would assume: in the episode, we look at actual code.</p><p>A shared codebase is an underrated advantage for speed, consistency and efficiency. Craft has a total of 4 engineers building the respective apps for:</p>  <p>iOS</p>  <p>iPad</p>  <p>MacOS</p>  <p>VisionOS</p>  <p>They can do this, because it’s a single codebase! A single codebase also means that all features built on one platform immediately work on all others.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/hackathons">The AI hackathon at Craft Docs</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-career-paths">Engineering career paths at Big Tech and scaleups</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer">Thriving as a Founding Engineer: lessons from the trenches</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-past-and-future-of-backend-practices">The past and future of modern backend practices</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=133s">02:13</a>) What it’s like being a UX-focused founder</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=540s">09:00</a>) Why it was hard to gain recognition at Skyscanner</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=792s">13:12</a>) Takeaways from Skyscanner that Balint brought to Craft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1010s">16:50</a>) How frameworks work and why they aren’t always a good fit</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1235s">20:35</a>) An explanation of iOS Auto Layout and its pros and cons</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1393s">23:13</a>) Why Balint doesn’t use Auto Layout</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1463s">24:23</a>) Why Craft has one code base</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1666s">27:46</a>) Craft’s unique toolbar features and a behind the scenes peek at the code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=1995s">33:15</a>) Why frontend engineers have fear around customization</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2231s">37:11</a>) How Craft’s design system differs from most companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2553s">42:33</a>) Behaviors and elements Craft uses rather than having a system for everything</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2652s">44:12</a>) The back and frontend architecture in building personal software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=2891s">48:11</a>) Shifting beliefs in personal computing</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3015s">50:15</a>) The challenges faced with operating system updates</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3048s">50:48</a>) The resurgence of local-first software</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3151s">52:31</a>) The value of opinionated software for consumers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3330s">55:30</a>) Why Craft’s focus is on the user’s emotional experience</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3410s">56:50</a>) The size of Craft’s engineering department and platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3560s">59:20</a>) Why Craft moves faster with smaller teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3686s">1:01:26</a>) Balint’s advice for frontend engineers looking to demonstrate value</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=3875s">1:04:35</a>) Balint’s breakthroughs using GenAI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4070s">1:07:50</a>) Why Balint still writes code</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVQoh0CIVFs&amp;t=4184s">1:09:44</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Design-first engineering: less recognition?   <p>Balint has been writing code since he was 12. He’s always had a pull towards interactivity, animation, and found himself in the intersection of code and design.</p>  <p>Backend engineering is much easier to quantify than UI/UX work. Balint always felt that backend engineering was easier to quantify in impact – like saving millions in infrastructure costs or scaling to billions of users. How do you quantify that the UI is smooth and delightful?</p>  <p>Balint always felt that "hardcore engineers" did not consider him one of them – as his focus was on UX and UI – like making interactions faster, and animations smoother, and not on distributed systems or scalable algorithms. But designers and product managers also didn’t look at him as equals.</p>  <p>There’s a pull for engineers to move towards the backend and distributed systems. Exactly because these areas are seen as having hard problems to solve and are often more measurable in terms of impact.</p>     Engineering culture at Craft   <p>Craft started off as a text editor for mobile use. When starting to code the product, Balint didn't believe that established engineering patterns, code coverage, or even design components would be the right approach.</p>  <p>Principles in building craft:</p>  <p>Data principles: efficiency and zero data loss are both non-negotiatble. There’s not much to innovate in this area – it’s very well understood! Just refine the existing state of the art.</p>  <p>Fluency. Craft is designed to be used for hours each day, so it needs to feel snappy and fluent.</p>    <p>Having just one engineering culture is not enough. To create an amazing product, you cannot have either frontend or backend engineering principles dominate:</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is UI-first: Apple is a good example. Apple builds delightful user experiences. However, their backend systems and web products are lacking.</p>  <p>When the dominant engineering culture is backend-first: Amazon and Google are good examples. Both focus on system design and backend engineering principles – in return their UIs don't feel as comfortable.</p>    <p>Craft uses the same codebase across 4 platforms: iOS, iPad, MacOS (desktop), and Vision Pro. 99% of the code is common, with some additional native bindings for each platform. Why the same codebase? Balint wanted the desktop app to always do the same thing as the mobile app, and a shared code base was the best way to do it.</p>   Team structure   <p>Craft's product engineering team is around 20 people. This includes product engineering, design, and QA.</p>  <p>They are split into a platform team, which means they have a web team, a native app team, and a backend team. Each of those teams has three to four people.</p>  <p>Balint observed that teams with more than 5 people start to have communications issues</p>   Architecture choices   <p>Prioritize control over abstractions and trends. Using core language patterns and framework elements gives you more control over what you want to do. High-level abstractions and frameworks require more time figuring out the bugs and what those frameworks allow or disallow.</p>  <p>Everything is a canvas. Craft treats everything as a canvas that they draw on. This allows building toolbars that look exactly like a Mac toolbar on the Mac and an iOS toolbar on the iPhone. However, Craft now has more control over these components than if they used the native ones.</p>  <p>Avoiding AutoLayout and SwiftUI. Every time Craft hires a new iOS engineer, the new joiner inevitably asks them why they don't use new technologies like AutoLayout or SwiftUI. Balint shows them one of their transitions and asks them to implement it with the same performance in AutoLayout – and if they can succeed, they’ll move over. So far, no one has managed: but it’s a good exercise to help understand that decisions are not arbitrary, but are following practical purposes.</p>  <p>AutoLayout promises that you no longer need to think in rectangles; you can just say it should be at the top and it can automatically grow. However, when you keep adding more things, the complexity increases and when you want to do something more sophisticated, it can become very performance-intensive.</p>  <p>With AutoLayout, you are trading off easier definition and work as a developer for more complexity on the device and less control when you want to do more advanced animations.</p>       Principles for personal software   <p>“How it makes me feel” matters more. When it comes to personal software, consumers choose a lot more on which one they feel resonates with them. Thus the best personal software is a lot more opinionated than B2B software is</p>  <p>Craft is aiming to build what Visual Studio Code is for engineers – Craft aiming to do the same for knowledge workers. Visual Studio Code feels lightweight and is a fresh breath of air because it's responsive, fast, and does everything you need.</p>  <p>A different take on design systems.</p>  <p>Most companies create an “atomic design system:” starting with base colours as atoms, then buttons that combine colors and shapes as components, and then building up from here.</p>  <p>Craft, instead, has systems for animation. They have an animation engine and library that synchronizes everything across everyone and they enforce usage of that.</p>     A local-first approach   <p>New technologies emerge on the server side. When you're dealing with personal software, the amount of content you're dealing with can fit on the user's device. A lot of the compute can be done locally.</p>  <p>Craft’s architecture is preparing for local-first approaches. They architected components so they can replace them with local or remote components anytime they decide it’s now possible to do so.</p>  <p>An example is search: instead of having a big elastic search cluster, they are looking at having 2 million search indexes on a disk in the cloud. Every time somebody does a search, they can either download that search index locally and use it there to execute the search, or a Lambda or serverless function can just read the search index.</p>    <p>The industry keeps swinging between cloud and local compute.</p>  <p>There is a new wave of personal computing powered by processors getting faster. The M4 Pro is a faster processor than anything you can buy on an AWS cloud.</p>  <p>Eventually, people will get tired of their personal computers holding them back and they’ll appreciate server-side components working faster. After a while, they will then start to get annoyed about how much the server-side project costs… and the pendulum keeps swinging</p>  <p>Local-first is experiencing a comeback because people are starting to travel again. It gets inconvenient when you need something badly, with poor connection – and you cannot access it.</p>    <p>Where to find Balint Orosz:</p><p>• X: <a href="https://x.com/balintorosz">https://x.com/balintorosz</a></p><p>• LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/balintorosz/</a></p><p>Mentions during the episode:</p><p>• Craft: <a href="https://www.craft.do/">https://www.craft.do/</a></p><p>• Skyscanner: <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/">https://www.skyscanner.com/</a></p><p>• Flash: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash</a></p><p>• Shader: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader</a></p><p>• Understanding Auto Layout: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html</a></p><p>• Mac Catalyst: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/</a></p><p>• Apple M1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1</a></p><p>• Elasticsearch: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch</a></p><p>• The Cloud Is a Prison.

<p>Hi – this is Gergely with the monthly, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover challenges at Big Tech and startups through the lens of engineering managers and senior engineers. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about">subscribe here</a>.</p><p>The most-frequently cited article I’ve ever written is still <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">The trimodal nature of software engineering salaries in the Netherlands and Europe</a> – which is a deepdive published back in 2021. At the time, I had recently left my engineering manager job at Uber, and was trying to understand how tech compensation really works. At Uber in Amsterdam, I saw that comp for senior software engineering positions was 2-5x higher than for most “local” senior roles. </p><p>To find out why this gap exists, I gathered hundreds of data points and talked with dozens of recruiters and managers; was this comp gap a symptom of “bimodal” distribution, as Daan Luu <a href="https://danluu.com/bimodal-compensation/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com">posted</a> in 2016? After researching, I felt confident enough to say that tech compensation in the Netherlands and Europe was trimodal:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b8ae313-ab32-494a-abac-728b3b895ff6_1456x1031.png">          </a>High-level overview. “$X” varies per country and region, but trends are international <p>Last year, we returned to this topic in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">The Trimodal nature of tech compensation revisited</a>, which validated the distribution by using more than 1,000 data points from the Dutch market, and quotes from engineering leaders and software engineers in the US, UK, Canada, and Japan, which suggested that a “trimodal” model is real. Even so, this was partly anecdotal and in need of hard data to confirm it.</p><p>Today, we finally have the numbers, thanks to the <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Booking.com,ING,Miro&amp;track=Software%20Engineer">Levels.fyi</a> team,, and this article dives into the findings by region, covering:</p>  <p>US: entry-level software engineers. Categorizing the three tiers of compensation bands, based on 5,601 data points.</p>  <p>US: senior software engineers. More Tier 2 and 3 offers are at least twice as big as the Tier 1 median, based on 9,509 data points.</p>  <p>Best-paying US companies by tier. Hedge funds, top scaleups, and Big Tech lead the pack – with companies like Roku, MongoDB and Dropbox also ranking high.</p>  <p>UK numbers, tiers, and best-paying companies. Hedge funds and finance companies lead, with Stripe, Confluent, and BP also making it to the top 10, based on 6,219 data points.</p>  <p>India numbers and tiers. Rippling, Stripe, Uber, Coinbase, Atlassian, Broadcom, and LinkedIn, offer ₹1 crore-or-above packages for senior engineers ($118K and up), based on 2,078 data points</p>  <p>Note on equity. Startups and scaleups may offer more in total compensation than publicly traded companies, but equity in not-yet-public companies comes with risk.</p>  <p>The data on the US, UK, and India reveals a complex regional picture united by a trimodal model. See below:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae2bd5fc-3935-41ba-843b-37fadfed5fa5_1616x780.png">          </a>Three “tiers” in the US data.

They offer <a href="https://levels.fyi/services/resume/">resume review</a> and<a href="https://levels.fyi/services/"> salary negotiation services</a> with Big Tech recruiters. A neat feedback loop of this is that information from their salary negotiation services helps the team ensure that submitted data really is valid. Levels.fyi also has a<a href="https://levels.fyi/jobs"> job board</a> and provides <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/offerings/data/">compensation benchmarking services</a> for businesses.</p><p>Some stats about Levels.fyi:</p>  <p>2.5 million visitors per month</p>  <p>20,000 new data points added per month, on average</p>  <p>$100M: total value of increased comp offers achieved with its <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/services/reviews.html">compensation negotiation service</a> – not including raises negotiated by candidates using the site ad-hoc for comparison.</p>  <p>A team of 13 people is behind the site and app, and I recently grabbed coffee with several of them in San Francisco.</p><p>This article covers “total compensation” (TC), not only salary. TC includes all forms of annual comp:</p>  <p>Base salary</p>  <p>Cash bonus, or the cash bonus target of companies that share this information</p>  <p>Value of equity vested</p>  <p>For example, a $300K TC package might look like this:</p>  <p>$175K base salary</p>  <p>Plus $25K target bonus</p>  <p>Plus $100K in equity vesting over the first year (typically $400K vested over 4 years, with $100K vesting each year)</p>  <p>Equity is a tricky topic but also a key one, more on which is in the “Note on equity” section near the foot of this article.</p> 1. US: entry-level software engineers <p>Let’s start with entry-level software engineer offers submitted to <a href="http://levels.fyi">Levels.fyi</a> in the past year for the world’s biggest tech market. Here’s how these data points were filtered:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date between 1 Jan 2024 and 1 Jan 2025</p>  <p>Years of experience: between 0 and 2</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. This means we look at new offers, not existing employees’ comp changes at their current workplaces</p>  <p>We have 5,601 entry-level US data points after applying the filters. A visualization:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F438d619b-ea5d-4ffa-9f45-290c98d2537e_1600x732.png">          </a>5,601 entry-level software engineering offers in the US, visualized <p>At first sight, this distribution fits what looks more like a bimodal distribution, with a first peak at $100-110k, and a second peak at $170-180k:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1197426d-ef54-4132-8a9c-0515fde40d78_1600x796.png">          </a>Comp distribution has twin “local maximum” peaks <p>However, after sifting through the data and manually tagging companies by common traits, we find the data organizes itself differently. The chart below takes the same data and organizes it based on the assumption behind the original trimodal distribution: that companies compensate based on the market they compete in. We use three categories of business type:</p>  <p>Big Tech. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Netflix, alongside publicly traded, large tech companies competing with them, like Uber, Snap, and Pinterest</p>  <p>Top scaleups and hedge funds. Late-stage startups backed by well-known VCs that have not gone public, or IPOed only very recently. Plus hedge funds, and quantitative trading firms (quant)</p>  <p>Everyone else. startups, privately owned companies, and “traditional” ones</p>  <p>Here’s how the same data looks when broken down into these categories:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb0d0b53d-b55e-493d-852a-a4c2e8618e20_1600x732.png">          </a>Segmenting the data by three tiers <p>Now, let’s check each segment.</p> Tier 1: Everyone else <p>This category consists mainly of companies competing for local talent, which often are not driven by their engineering talent or digital products.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb1be272-60b0-448c-b6c8-c1b56bd9f6c9_1600x732.png">          </a>Distribution of the “everyone else” category: 3,262 data points (58% of total). Median: $105K, 75th percentile: $130K <p>This resembles the lowest tier (“Tier 1”) of the trimodal model. It’s interesting how drastically the distribution changes by removing Big Tech, top scaleup, and hedge fund data points!</p> Tier 2: Big Tech  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffad56830-433d-4e87-963c-4aaf176f45ab_1600x732.png">          </a>Big Tech. 1,914 data points (34% of all data). Median: $180K, 75th percentile: $203K <p>The largest publicly traded tech companies compensate engineers with increasingly large equity packages up the career ladder. I split this category for two reasons:</p>  <p>Commonly referenced. The terms “FAANG” and “Big Tech” are frequently their own category, and benchmarks for other companies’ offers.</p>  <p>Industry-leading comp. It’s hard to find bigger liquid compensation offers than this group offers. Later, we see it’s possible to win higher illiquid comp offers at not-yet-public scaleups, and some hedge funds can top what Big Tech offers.</p>   Tier 3: Top scaleups and hedge funds  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F65758d28-0944-460c-aa01-56e391374a90_1600x732.png">          </a>Top scaleups and hedge funds, based on 493 data points (8% of all data). Median: $208K, 75th percentile: $247K <p>This is a very interesting category with a lack of high-quality data, outside of Levels.fyi, for two reasons:</p><p>Private scaleups issue not-yet-liquid equity. Many assume Big Tech companies offer the most, compensation-wise. And this is true in terms of liquid equity; shares that can be sold for cash is an area where Big Tech is near-impossible for scaleups to match.</p><p>However, top-tier startups and scaleups can – and do – offer more total compensation than Big Tech. But there’s a catch: their equity cannot be sold until a liquidity event happens like an IPO, or stock buyback. Scaleups which out-offer Big Tech in total comp include <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/databricks/salaries">Databricks</a> and <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/openai/salaries">OpenAI</a>.</p><p>It makes sense for late-stage scaleups to make bigger total comp offers than Big Tech because they target the same talent and must compensate for the fact their equity grants are illiquid, and may not become convertible to cash any time soon. Plus, there’s also the risk of a grant losing value like at Foursquare, where employees’ stock options <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-private-tech-company-that-let-employee-stock-grants-evaporate">ended up as worthless</a>.</p><p>Hedge funds are notoriously secretive. Places like <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/companies/two-sigma/salaries">Two Sigma</a> want to keep their compensation details as confidential as possible. Levels.fyi has accurate data points, but not enough to make this group into its own category. So, they’re included with scaleups here.</p><p>The compensation philosophy of hedge funds is very different than at Big Tech and scaleups:</p>  <p>No equity: hedge funds do not issue equity, even though this element is almost always what makes Big Tech and scaleup compensation packages standout</p>  <p>Large cash bonuses: instead, hedge funds award hefty end-of-year bonuses, of up to 100% of annual salary. Hedge funds are the only category of company offering more liquid compensation than Big Tech and some scaleups. At the same time, hedge funds hire a lot less frequently</p>   Overlapping categories <p>Let’s look at all three categories of employer in a single graph:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fda2b5d-8bfd-4896-83ba-789ac92258e9_1600x798.png">          </a>All entry-level compensation data points, split into categories <p>And also let’s check out the median and 75th percentile total compensation packages of each category:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70750922-ac38-4b5b-9ff5-be4ca13f1b1d_1236x684.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>There are a few interesting points about this distribution:</p>  <p>~2x difference between Tier 1 and 3. Tier 2 and 3 companies pay around 2x as much at the 50th and 75th percentiles than Tier 1 does. Tier 2 (Big Tech) is a lot closer to Tier 3 in TC. The 75th percentile of Tier 1 still doesn’t come close to the 50th percentile of Tier 2</p>  <p>Overlap from Tier 1 into Tier 2. The highest Tier 1 offers – at around the 90th-95th percentiles – do reach up to $200K, which is near the median range of tiers 2 and 3</p>  <p>Tiers 2 and 3 overlap a lot. The only real difference between Tier 2 and Tier 3 is that there are much more Big Tech data points in the sample. This could indicate a bias in user submissions towards Big Tech, or that scaleups and hedge funds hire far fewer entry-level engineers in the US</p>   2. US: senior software engineers <p>Compensation differences tend to grow with seniority, so let’s look at senior-and-above software engineers by adjusting the filters:</p>  <p>“Software Engineer” submissions</p>  <p>Offer date in the last 3 years (between 1 Jan 2022 and 1 Jan 2025)</p>  <p>Experience: 5 years minimum</p>  <p>Region: US</p>  <p>Years at company: 0. Similar to before, we only look at new offers</p>  <p>Let’s see how the same three categories map when looking at senior software engineers, split across the same tiers:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F800a878e-7f2b-4f3b-952e-a6999b896182_1600x775.png">          </a>All senior-and-above engineer compensation data points by category. Total number of data points: 9,509 <p>Here’s what these tiers look like in the median and 75th percentile compensation bands:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b63cf3a-9661-4065-b7e7-2e4742fee6db_1230x658.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>The tiers are more distinct for seniors than for entry-level engineers. Some observations:</p>  <p>Tier 1 (everyone else): this category has the most data points (53% of the total). Also, while the median of this tier is significantly below the other two categories, there is overlap at the 75th and 90th percentiles. Simply put, it’s possible to earn as much in this group as in Big Tech, but it’s harder to do.</p>  <p>Tier 2 (Big Tech): compensation spread is very wide, starting from around $100K, all the way to $600K and above. This indicates the median value is less important, and things like career level, the specific company, and negotiation, could all matter more.</p>  <p>Tier 3 (top scaleups and hedge funds): this overlaps with Big Tech, and its top end goes even further. Also, there is far less data for this category, suggesting that these companies hire significantly fewer staff than Big Tech does, as mentioned above.</p>  <p>Outliers: these are much more distinct at the senior level, compared to the entry-level tier distribution</p>  <p>Big Tech and scaleups+hedge funds have many outliers. The median entry-level Tier 1 compensation package was $105K – and there were few offers in tiers 2 and 3 that offered twice as much ($200K and above.) The median senior Tier 1 compensation was $180K, but now there are far more offers in tiers 1 and 2 worth double that ($350K and above).

It feels like two tiers might be coupled here, based on the midpoint of the graph having several local maximums: £100K ($126K), around £125K ($158K), and circa £150K ($190K). I’d assume that if we split up Big Tech, the top scaleups+hedge funds, and everyone else, we’d see two distinct tiers. Still, it is US-HQ’d companies that offer the most comp to senior software engineers.</p>  <p>Like the US, the UK has hedge funds that offer as much – or more – than Big Tech. These firms are all based in London, often with offices in New York. This is the first time I’ve seen it broken down like this.</p>  <p>UK, but not US or UK-headquartered, are similar. The medians and 75th percentiles of these categories are almost the same. Non-US, non-UK HQed companies simply have fewer data points.</p>  <p>The data is likely to overrepresent US-HQ’d companies. It would seem there are more US-based companies employing software engineers in the UK, than UK-headquartered ones do. However, based on my understanding of the market this is incorrect: in reality, a lot more UK-based companies employ software engineers than US-based ones, but the data currently biases towards US-HQ’d companies.</p>  <p>My sense is that for the UK, the real three tiers are those <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">previously discussed</a>:</p>  <p>Tier 1: local market, meaning most UK HQ’d companies</p>  <p>Tier 2: startups and scaleups targeting the top of the local market.

As in the UK, India has more local companies based in the country and employing software engineers. For example, Tata Consultancy services <a href="https://www.nucamp.co/blog/coding-bootcamp-india-ind-top-10-tech-companies-to-work-for-in-india-in-2025">alone employs</a> more than 600,000 IT professionals – many of them software engineers.

You can help the data become more accurate by <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">submitting your compensation</a>.</p>  <p>India-HQ’d companies rarely offer standout compensation. As per this data, it is mostly companies headquartered abroad that offer above $100K in total compensation (₹87 lakhs or more).</p>  <p>US-HQ’d companies pay very well. While the median compensation for these companies is $63K (₹52 lakh,) the 90th percentile is at $133K (₹1.1 crore!) This is surprisingly high!</p>  <p>Big Tech offers are very strong. A select few senior+ engineers can make in the range of $200K per year (₹1.7 crore) at the very top of the range, which is close to 4x the median compensation of the India-HQ’d tier.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b77a748-690a-45ed-8c8f-05458ea79ec1_1292x800.png">          </a>Data points for each category <p>Companies that pay the most in India, as per the data:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0926dc9a-1696-4fce-9fb2-aeb1acebf097_1312x1274.png">          </a>Companies offering top 50th percentile comp in India <p>One surprise is Google not making the top 10; it comes in at number 14 overall, with median senior engineer compensation at $98K (₹85 lakh) – not far away from the top 10.

Note on equity <p>The bigger a Big Tech or VC-funded startup comp package is, the larger the share of equity. For example, here’s a visualization of the comp split for senior software engineers in the US, over the past year:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2748274-0075-438e-9f2e-1adf5d506f66_1600x655.png">          </a>Visualizing the TC split of engineers. The higher the TC, the bigger the equity and cash bonus, compared to base salary. Based on 796 data points <p>You might wonder how the largest packages have no equity component and a very large cash bonus. It’s because these are hedge funds which don’t issue equity and award cash bonuses of nearly 2x the annual salary.</p><p>Non-liquid equity comes with additional risk. Let’s take two compensation packages: one with a TC of $475K, and one with $423K. Which is better? It seems like $475K is clearly bigger, but some extra context is needed. The $240K package is from Rippling, a scaleup that is not yet publicly traded:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3443bf37-4796-47bd-ab75-11cd6011c56b_1600x398.png">   </a>A $475K package at Rippling.

By doing so, they earn $423K worth of liquid compensation in the first year. At Rippling, the liquid compensation will be $335K ($240K in base salary and $85K bonus target), and equity can only be sold if and when a liquidity event occurs, such as:</p>  <p>Rippling organizes a secondary offer and allows employees to sell some stock. This usually happens with oversubscribed fundraising events</p>  <p>Rippling goes public. In this case, employees can sell their vested stock after a lockup period of around 6 months</p>  <p>Rippling is acquired and the buyer pays for employees’ stocks</p>  <p>For private companies, the big questions are when will equity become liquid, and how much will it be worth.</p><p>It’s worth remembering stock prices change, which makes equity compensation volatile. In 2022, we covered how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/51386866/stock-price-woes-and-attrition">this can lead to compensation woes</a>. At the time, tech stocks like Stitch Fix, Redfin, and Zoom, dropped 50-80% in 12 months. At the same time, companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and Apple, saw 50-100% stock price growth. Compensation packages for people working in the former group dropped significantly, while the latter group saw major increases.

It’s enabled us to visualize compensation distribution and tiers across international labor markets.</p><p>Levels.fyi gives free access to its compensation data points, and relies on users sharing their comp numbers. If you’ve gotten value out of this article, please consider <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add">submitting the comp details of your current position</a>; this lets the site provide fresh, data-backed insights, like in this deepdive.</p><p>My biggest takeaways:</p><p>The US is unique in having a tier above Big Tech. Across the UK, India, and in the Netherlands, the highest compensation tier (Tier 3) is Big Tech. So it’s a surprise to learn there’s an even higher tier that exists only in the US. Hedge funds, quant firms, and top scaleups can pay more than the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, etc, with two important caveats:</p>  <p>At top scaleups, bigger-than-Big-Tech comp packages are usually reserved for workers already in Big Tech, who would not switch jobs for an illiquid TC package unless it exceeds their current, liquid one.</p>  <p>Hedge funds and quant firms seem like a different world. Switching between Big Tech and these companies looks harder to do, and happens less often than moving between Big Tech and scaleups.</p>  <p>US-HQ’d companies tend to pull up markets outside the US. Among tier 3 companies <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/trimodal-nature-of-tech-compensation">in the Netherlands</a>, 95% of those which I know are US-headquartered, and the data shows this is also the case in the UK and India.</p><p>Higher-tier companies come with downsides. These workplaces pay more, but usually operate with a <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/">“Silicon Valley-style” engineering culture</a>: they expect a lot more in terms of autonomy, taking on product, DevOps, and testing work, and working longer hours – especially when collaborating with overseas teams. Adjusting to this can be tough if you’ve never worked in such an environment. Vice-versa, it can also be challenging to swap this pattern for a more traditional, hierarchical workplace.</p><p>Meanwhile, work stress can actually be higher at Tier 2 and Tier 3 companies, as covered in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146208867/tier-and-realities">part 2 of the Trimodal series</a>.</p><p>Today’s job market is a lot tougher than previously, and it’s harder to get into top-tier companies. In this deepdive, we’ve looked closely at the top tiers across several markets. With the job market tightening up, there are more qualified candidates than ever, and this can affect the size of offers. So, if you’re in the job market, I would not treat the numbers in this article as concrete and immovable. Instead, just focus on performing well in interviews, and getting an offer. Then these figures might be helpful in the negotiation phase.</p><p>Compensation is not everything; it’s just what is easiest to measure and make comparisons with, but there’s more to a job than the pay alone.

<p>Emil Lundberg and I have published the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-lundberg-cose-two-party-signing-algs/">COSE Algorithms for Two-Party Signing</a> specification.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when the signing operation is performed cooperatively between two parties. When performing two-party signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and the second party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be useful when communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs over a limited-bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting signatures are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified using the same verification procedure without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A motivating use case for this is for WebAuthn/FIDO2 Authenticators to use when signing application data, as described in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/2078">proposed WebAuthn signing extension</a>.  Parts of this spec’s content were previously in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bradleylundberg-cfrg-arkg/">Asynchronous Remote Key Generation (ARKG) algorithm</a> spec, which we’ve also been updated.</p>
<p>I plan to talk about the spec during <a href="https://www.ietf.org/meeting/122/">IETF 122 in Bangkok</a>.  I hope to see many of you there!</p>
<p>The specification is available at:</p>

Symbolic representation of Web Security applied to&nbsp;SSI.<p>Many children in Europe grew up with the tales of Baron Münchhausen, who claims to have lifted himself and his horse out of a mire by pulling his own hair. The image is so powerful because the problem of the circular dependency is so clearly visible. In real life, circular dependencies are often far less&nbsp;obvious.</p><p>Which is why the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">first article</a> in this series was primarily focused on looking behind the SSI smoke and mirrors around Web based identifiers and communication protocols. The resulting discussions in the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Of Trust (RWOT)</a> community were quite enlightening, and included a deeper look at the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Digital Identity Wallet Technical specifications</a>.</p><p>One of the mirrors basically broke when claims of OpenID4VC supporting decentralized identifiers were shattered when someone pointed out that while the EU Wallet is marketed on digital sovereignty and privacy, but in reality does not <a href="https://github.com/openid/federation-wallet/issues/43#issuecomment-2539862593">does not allow decentralized identifiers</a>:</p>The current EUDI approach: No decentralized identifiers allowed<p>So while it was clear that OpenID4VC and did:web* do not qualify as decentralized, Self-Sovereign Identity, some people advocated to just embrace the false marketing in the hope that it would create wider acceptance and the appearance of adoption for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>But has that approach ever really&nbsp;worked?</p><p>More often this kind of “sovereignwashing” appears to run a high risk of creating false expectations, disappointment. Which would ultimately cement the status quo of the federated platform identity lock-in for the next 20 years. As a community we should focus on building actual decentralized identifiers, communication protocols, and applications.</p><blockquote>Because the true social and economic value of SSI is not just in the identity layer itself, it is in the decentralized applications enabled as a&nbsp;result.</blockquote><p>Some of which would be in direct competition to the champions of the platform age, who are investing their financial and political capital into OpenID4VC and Web based identifiers to prevent that competition from ever getting off the ground. A classic “old industry vs new technologies” battle.</p><p>There are real opportunity costs across most of economy and society if the old encumbents manage to postpone or kill innovation.</p>Symbolic representation of eIDAS 2.0 after successful lobbying by the platforms and trust intermediaries Security and privacy for a globally networked society <p>Technology and corresponding security have been head to head in a special kind of race for a long time, dating back to an Egyptian inscription around 1900 BC in the main chamber of the tomb of Khnumhotep II, over Julius Caesar using a ROT-3 cypher in 100 BC, all the way to the famous Enigma machine used in World War II. The more people potentially had access to a message, the harder the encryption had to&nbsp;become.</p><p>The encryption used by Julius Caesar was not particularly strong, because it relied on a supposedly secret algorithm. Once parties know the secret, encryption and decryption become trivial. Over time this moved to well-known algorithms using shared secrets. And even though the shared secrets are more complex on today’s internet, this fundamental principle hasn’t&nbsp;changed:</p><blockquote>If you know the shared secret, and can intercept the encrypted message, you will be able to read, and also impersonate and falsify communication.</blockquote><p>In contrast, Engima was quite strong for its day because it combined a rotating cypher with a codebook that was famously carried by U-Boats allowing them to choose the correct settings. Literally handed over to the commander of the boat by hand in a secure location before departure, these code books effectively represented a cryptographic key, shared over a second channel — the physical handover.</p><p>Which makes any well-designed encryption system almost impossible to break. Unless, of course, you have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the rotating cypher, and can guess certain messages, like weather reports, to then use brute force to arrive back at the settings for the day. Those settings then allowed to read other messages, which would otherwise have been unbreakable.</p>Digital identity should be based on an&nbsp;advance<p>In other words: The cryptography of the Enigma machine itself was solid, and essentially unbroken. But the Allied Forces were able to exploit structural weaknesses designed into the operation of Engima to attack the key generation for the&nbsp;day.</p> Security in Swiss Healthcare <p>That particular race accelerated when the Internet was born. In 1996, when the internet was still young, the US Congress deliberated and passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That same year, the <a href="https://www.fmh.ch/">Swiss Medical Association (FMH)</a>, realized patient data had to be better secured on the internet, leading to the creation of <a href="https://hin.ch">Health Info Net (HIN)</a>. Starting from encrypted email, Swiss doctors have relied on HIN for decades to keep their patient data&nbsp;safe.</p><p>But technology years are a lot like dog years. And 28 years is a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>HIN is constantly working to innovate and improve its solutions. Which is how <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a>, working closely with our partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/more-than-bits-gmbh">More than Bits</a>, started to run some POCs with HIN in 2023, and ended up working all of 2024 almost exclusively for the Swiss healthcare sector.</p><blockquote>Our challenge: Design a system that starts from what today’s users are used to, while re-thinking the system architecture using SSI and modern data ecosystem architectures, based on the work we had done for&nbsp;Gaia-X.</blockquote><p>The starting point was obvious: Email is the world’s largest distributed identity database and communication protocol. It is the use case with which HIN started, and it is the singular product that all users rely on mutliple times each day to communicate with colleagues, laboratories, and patients.</p><p>Email is also facing challenges of concentration and capture by the large, federated platforms. And its lack of an identity layer has made it a fertile ground for attacks by malicious governments, corporations, and common criminals.</p><p>Vereign showcased its first prototype to harden email using SSI in 2019, which earned us a nomination as the hottest new innovation for the Swiss <a href="https://www.digitaleconomyaward.ch/">Digital Economy Award</a> in Zurich. COVID-19 had other plans, but our experience proved invaluable when working on the POCs with&nbsp;HIN.</p><p>This time, we built out peer to peer email exchange via <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a>. Secure, encrypted, authentic and designed in a way that it can be plugged into any legacy email system to gradually switch to a new, identity verified transport layer reaching all the way to the people themselves.</p> From prototyping to production: Quest for the identifier <p>We built these prototypes using did:web, because it is a great placeholder to stand in for decentralized identifiers while rapidly prototyping around user flow and experience.</p><p>But from the onset it was clear that did:web would not be the choice for production, because for all the reasons also <a href="https://medium.com/@ggreve/self-sovereign-identity-over-before-it-started-661b4b0dbdc6">highlighted in the last&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>Web based identifiers must never be used for personal identity.</blockquote><p>Our preferred choice would have been <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> due to its robust security and privacy architecture. But with the official implementation being Python only, we had concerns about efforts required in supporting a secure, long term solution across the range of platforms we anticipated.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">Rust implementation</a> by the Human Colossus Foundation fared better on that front. But there seems to be a rift in the community, causing concerns of diverging implementations, as well as long-term support. Which are exacerbated by the choice for European Public License&nbsp;(EUPL).</p><p>We could not find information about adoption, nor community. And finally, the security of KERI as a concept critically depends on the networks of Witnesses and Watchers, for which we could not find information about size, health and long term viability of these networks for either implementation.</p><p>Had we chosen KERI in February 2024, we would not have been able to go productive before these issues had been resolved. And our time line dictated we had to be ready for initial production by late 2024. As a result, KERI was a non-starter.</p><p>Other methods, such as did:indy, have been in decline for some time, and Sovrin is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sovrin-foundation_to-the-sovrin-community-after-seven-years-activity-7253082729443930112-069C?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">shutting down</a> in just a couple of weeks. Methods like did:peer on the other hand are not great in scenarios where long-lived connections are desirable.</p><blockquote>So in the end, our search for production ready decentralized identifiers that could safely be used for natural persons left us empty&nbsp;handed.</blockquote>A classic. And good&nbsp;advice. Ignoring XKCD <p>The <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a> comic by XKCD is a classic. As far as rules go, it is a good one. But there are no rules without exceptions. Having exhausted every other path, we decided to ignore XKCDs’ best practice. Only, we did not aim to create the universal solution — that’s KERI — but to create the simplest possible, yet still sufficiently safe identifier for the requirements of our specific use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Like any good design, it should build on existing technologies as much as possible, be simple enough to be implemented within a reasonable time frame, and to be supportable for at least 5–10 years, when potentially it would be replaced by something better.</p> Designing a decentralized identifier <p>Our requirements asked for an identifier that was truly secure and private. We explicitly sought to minimize dependencies on infrastructure such as DNS, Web Servers and Certificate Authorities. Blockchain would have fit these criteria, but we do not require a global consensus. All we needed was a decentralized storage system that would guarantee integrity and availability of&nbsp;records.</p><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> might have been an option. It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-Addressable Storage</a>, so objects are referenced by their hash, any modification creates a new object. But Git would add unnecessary overhead, and there is a central repository. The <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</a> on the other hand is built for peer to peer distribution between nodes without a central&nbsp;server.</p><p>Like Git, IPFS is built on Content-Addressable Storage (CAS). Objects are referenced by their sha256 hashes. Users can request data at any node, and if that node does not have this particular object, it will use peer-to-peer network connectivity between nodes to obtain a copy of the data and provide it to the user. It is open, verifiable, and resilient.</p><blockquote>Its function allows DID documents to be uploaded onto any node and be referenced by their hash on any node in the network. Modifications to the document modify the hash, so documents are integrity protected by design. Simultaneously, the entire DID storage and distribution mechanism is robust regarding the well-known attacks against Web based identifiers.</blockquote><p>In addition, the hash for the document contains no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and unless we’d make the mistake of adding PII to the DID documents themselves, our design would not expose any kind of PII anywhere.</p><p>Of course we were not the first, nor the only ones to realize the potential of IPFS for decentralized identifiers. There has been a prior attempt at using IPFS for DID documents, the <a href="https://did-ipid.github.io/ipid-did-method/">IPID DID Method</a>. But it never got much traction, and its use of the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/">InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)</a> made it less robust. Also, it did not have provisions for the rotation of keys, which is crucial for long-term connections with the same identifier, as well as the ability to switch wallets or upgrade crypto algorithms.</p>Swiss Healthcare: Innovating together toward the gold standard of decentralized, secure, private identity and applications An identifier for Sovereign Data Exchange&nbsp;(SVDX) <p>The result is did:svdx, our DID method for Sovereign Data Exchange.</p><p>Agents generate their active key locally, as well as a key that can be used for the update of the identifier later. The public key of the first key is used as the persistent identifier, creating a persistent Autonomous Identifier (AID).</p><p>The second key, which is used for the update of the identifier, is never shared. Only its hash is declared in the document as a next key commitment. Because this key is never actively used until it is time to rotate, it is well protected against being compromised.</p><p>Each revision of the decentralized identity documents representing a Decentralized Identifier has a Content Identifier (CID) when stored in IPFS, so the resulting identifier is always the combination of the AID with the CID of the latest revision of the identifier.</p><p>Since each revision of the identifier refers back to the previous version by its CID, the result is a sha-256 hash based Key Event Chain of IPFS objects, all the way back to the inception document, the root of the AID in question.</p><p>did:svdx:z6MknHKiY477mH97qryHv3zjuHaTLvBbbp6tHS5SvZv67uR4:QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</p><p>Because the identifier also contains the CID of the current state, starting verification of the Key Event Chain is trivial: Just pull the corresponding object out of IPFS and verify. Check for ancestor, rinse and repeat until you’re at the beginning of the chain. Check whether the AID matches the initial key.&nbsp;Done.</p> Trivial to implement in web based tool&nbsp;chains <p>No native IPFS support? No problem. Just pick one of the <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS gateways</a>, and with a single request pull the DID document, e.g. <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecqVGBxvW7gjffxmYTGFZNPmJcWmYPdD8azB1cZYaY6F</a>.</p><p>Thanks to content based addressing, you will get the same document no matter which gateway you use. And you’re welcome to use as many of them as you would like to compare. Although for production use cases it is highly recommended to run your own, which is&nbsp;trivial.</p><blockquote>In other words, IPFS allows to integrate classic web based tool chains with decentralized storage and delivery of integrity protected DID documents. It’s as easy as any of the did:web* methods to work with, but does not suffer from the attack surfaces of DNS, TLS and Certificate Authorities.</blockquote><p>In addition, it is robust against a number of DDOS scenarios, allows for low impact self-hosting, and eliminates the web server as a central point of attack, surveillance and compromise.</p><p>Also, it plays well with DIDComm and other communication protocols, but if you really require web based interaction protocols, they can also be encoded into the identifier. But unlike web based identifiers, exchanging key material via did:svdx mitigates a substantial number of attack scenarios for web connection protocols.</p> Layering trust <p>By design did:svdx contains zero personal information. It is deliberately focused on secure key exchange of an Autonomous Identifier, only.</p><p>So any relationship starts from a reliable assumption the AID controllers have a strong connection to one another and can maintain it over a longer period of time, including throughout key rotation and changes in cryptography. But they start from zero trust in one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Trust is built gradually, through Verifiable Presentations securely exchanged over the connection. Similar to what Christopher Allen describes as “<a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/progressive-trust/">Building Trust in Gradients</a>.”</p><p>For SVDX, given it is built for a true P2P, decentralized ecosystem, we surmise that the party initiating a connection first authenticates itself toward the recipient of the connection request before requesting reciprocal information. That should also make data mining or identifier scraping much&nbsp;harder.</p> Limits of&nbsp;did:svdx <p>For any design, it is crucial to know its limits. Firstly, the identifier specification does not contain any of the multi-signature capabilities of systems like KERI. Because we did not require it for our use case at hand, we pushed that complexity, along the complexity of secure restore and key rotation, onto the clients — which we control for the use case at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Also, while IPFS plays a role similar to that of Witnesses in KERI, there are no Watchers. So there is no built-in detection of duplicity, as Sam Smith calls it. And while parties can update each other on key rotations using DIDComm, allowing each other to verify they are still talking to the same party, the design has no built-in protections against a controller forking their identity.</p><p>For our use case this was not an issue, because there is a central catalogue for the ecosystem to allow looking up the latest, known version of an AID. Which is not ideal for some scenarios. But we considered the solution good enough for what we needed to achieve, given that all controllers need to also maintain their identity and trustworthiness with HIN as the central ecosystem fiduciary.</p><p>That said, it should be possible to design a robust duplicity detection on top of did:svdx, and there may even be scenarios where duplicity is not a primary concern as long as agents always ensure to only consider the latest version of an AID authoritative.</p><blockquote>So did:svdx is not a replacement for KERI. But it is a replacement for web based DID methods, offering far better security, and similar efforts of adoption and support. From our own experience we know it took around 6-8 weeks to implement in JavaScript.</blockquote> What’s next? <p>The first application using did:svdx in production will have ramped up by April&nbsp;2025.</p><p>By mid 2025 we expect hundreds of thousands of production messages sent each month containing verifiable credentials backed by did:svdx. Our roadmap has us building out additional applications until all the institutions and eventually all the patients in Switzerland will have identifiers within the next 2-3&nbsp;years.</p><p>We have already Open Sourced the initial implementation and will continue to add additional implementations. Also, we would love to finalize the specification so that it can be maximally useful to others. And there may be features that would be required for additional use cases, as well as community-based methods for duplicity detection.</p> Open questions   Where is the right place to finalize, publish and maintain did:svdx?  Who would be interested in participating?  What are the critical capabilities that may still be&nbsp;missing?  What kind of best practice operational RFCs should we develop as a community?  <p>If you’re at <a href="https://diceurope.org/">DICE in Zurich</a> this year, I’d love to sit down and discuss these questions with you — alongside everything else you would like to know about our vision for the Sovereign Data Exchange.</p>

<p>This post shows how to implement phone (SMS) verification and two-factor authentication (2FA) using ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution integrates phone-based verification and 2FA mechanisms. The implementation uses ASP.NET Core Identity’s extensibility to incorporate SMS-based verification during user registration and login processes. SMS is no longer a recommended authentication method due to security risks but does provide a good solution for some business cases or user flows like onboarding phone users or phone applications, frontline workers with no desktop or other such solutions with limited security possibilities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityOidcPhone2fa">https://github.com/damienbod/IdentityOidcPhone2fa</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core Identity application integrates the SMS provider using the Identity PhoneNumberTokenProvider and an SMS verification service. </p>


  builder.Services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
	options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

builder.Services.Configure&lt;EmailSettings&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection("EmailSettings"));
builder.Services.AddTransient&lt;IEmailSender, EmailSender&gt;();

builder.Services.Configure&lt;SmsOptions&gt;(builder.Configuration.GetSection("SmsOptions"));

var authorization = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
	$"{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Username"]}:{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Password"]}"));

builder.Services.AddHttpClient(Consts.SMSeColl, client =&gt;
{
	client.BaseAddress = new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["SmsOptions:Url"]}");
	client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", authorization);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;SmsProvider&gt;();

builder.Services.AddIdentity&lt;ApplicationUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
	.AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;DataProtectorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(TokenOptions.DefaultProvider)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;AuthenticatorTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(TokenOptions.DefaultAuthenticatorProvider)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;PhoneNumberTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(Consts.Phone)
	.AddTokenProvider&lt;EmailTokenProvider&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;&gt;(Consts.Email);
  


<p></p>



<p>The ApplicationUser needs some new properties to support multiple authentication methods. The properties are used to allow a user to use the selected authentication method or force an authentication on a OpenID Connect client.</p>


  public bool Phone2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool Email2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool AuthenticatorApp2FAEnabled { get; set; }
public bool Passkeys2FAEnabled { get; set; }
  


<p></p>



<p>An SMS service are used to integrate the SMS, the SmsProvider class. In this demo, the <a href="https://ecall-messaging.com/">eColl</a> messaging service is used to send SMS. The implementation and the configuration would vary if you use a different service.</p>



<p>The SmsProvider is used to verify a phone number, to enable SMS 2FA and to force SMS 2FA. The service uses a HttpClient to access the SMS service rest API. </p>

        }

        return (true, messageResult);
    }
}

 Flow 1: Verify phone 



<p>Once a user has authenticated with email and password, the user can verify a phone. To verify the phone, the user MUST be authenticated. If not, a malicious program may send multiple SMS and cause financial harm.   The Add phone number link can be used to start the verification process.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyPhone Razor page allows the user to enter an mobile phone number to send the SMS. This should be validated for real phone numbers at least. The StartVerificationAsync method is used to send the SMS. The ASP.NET Core Identity method GenerateChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to generate the challenge for the verification.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
    return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var result = await _client.StartVerificationAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber);
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI is not styled, just uses the standard bootstrap styles.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The confirm Razor Page accepts the verification code which was sent to the phone and uses the VerifyAndProcessCode method to validate. The ASP.NET Core Identity VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync method is used to validate the code.</p>


    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()
  {
      if (!ModelState.IsValid)
      {
          return Page();
      }

      try
      {
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != null &amp;&amp; Input.VerificationCode != null)
          {
              return await VerifyAndProcessCode(Input.PhoneNumber, Input.VerificationCode);
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "Input.PhoneNumber or Input.VerificationCode missing");
          }
      }
      catch (Exception)
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the code, please check the verification code is correct and try again");
      }

      return Page();
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; VerifyAndProcessCode(string phoneNumber, string code)
  {
      var applicationUser = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);

      if (applicationUser != null)
      {
          var validCodeForUserSession = await _client.CheckVerificationAsync(applicationUser,
              phoneNumber, code);

          return await ProcessValidCode(applicationUser, validCodeForUserSession);
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "No user");
          return Page();
      }
  }

  private async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ProcessValidCode(ApplicationUser applicationUser, bool validCodeForUserSession)
  {
      if (validCodeForUserSession)
      {
          var phoneNumber = await _userManager.GetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser);
          if (Input.PhoneNumber != phoneNumber)
          {
              await _userManager.SetPhoneNumberAsync(applicationUser, Input.PhoneNumber);
          }

          applicationUser.PhoneNumberConfirmed = true;
          var updateResult = await _userManager.UpdateAsync(applicationUser);

          if (updateResult.Succeeded)
          {
              return RedirectToPage("ConfirmPhoneSuccess");
          }
          else
          {
              ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code, please try again");
          }
      }
      else
      {
          ModelState.AddModelError("", "There was an error confirming the verification code");
      }

      return Page();
  }
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI displays the input for the code and the number it was sent to.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 2: Enable phone 2FA 



<p>Once the phone is verified, it can be used for an SMS 2FA. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The EnableSms2FaAsync method is used to enable the SMS 2FA.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
 return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

if (user.PhoneNumber != Input.PhoneNumber)
{
 ModelState.AddModelError("Input.PhoneNumber", 
	"Phone number does not match user user, please update or add phone in your profile");
}

await _smsVerifyClient.EnableSms2FaAsync(user, Input.PhoneNumber!);

return RedirectToPage("./VerifyPhone2Fa", new { Input.PhoneNumber });
  


<p></p>



<p>The EnablePhone2Fa Razor page is used to validate the phone number before activating the 2FA.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync is used to validate and the 2FA is activated.</p>


  var user = await _userManager.GetUserAsync(User);
if (user == null)
{
	return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
}

var verificationCode = Input.Code.Replace(" ", string.Empty).Replace("-", string.Empty);
var is2faTokenValid = await _userManager
	.VerifyChangePhoneNumberTokenAsync(user, verificationCode, user.PhoneNumber!);

if (!is2faTokenValid)
{
	ModelState.AddModelError("Input.Code", "Verification code is invalid.");
	return Page();
}

await _userManager.SetTwoFactorEnabledAsync(user, true);
  


<p></p>



<p>The Verify Phone 2FA Razor page displays the input field for the code.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once activated, the user should persist some recovery codes.</p>







<p></p>



 Flow 3: SMS 2FA using phone 



<p>Next time the user authenticates, the SMS 2FA is required. The user can use multiple authentication methods, not only SMS. If possible, passkeys or strong authentication should be used.</p>


  if (user.Phone2FAEnabled)
{
 IsPhone = true;
 if (!user.AuthenticatorApp2FAEnabled)
 {
	 await _smsVerifyClient
		.Send2FASmsAsync(user, user.PhoneNumber!);
 }
}
  


<p></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a> and I led a discussion on The Cambrian Explosion of OAuth and OpenID Specifications at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2025">2025 OAuth Security Workshop</a> in Reykjavík.</p>
<p>The abstract for the session was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The number of OAuth and OpenID specifications continues to grow.  At present there are 30 OAuth RFCs, two more in the RFC Editor queue, 13 OAuth working group drafts, and another eight individual OAuth drafts that may advance.  There are nine JOSE RFCs and seven working group drafts.  There are four SecEvent RFCs.  On the OpenID side, there are 12 final OpenID Connect specs, three final FAPI specs, one final MODRNA spec, three final eKYC-IDA specs, and 24 Implementer’s drafts across the OpenID working groups, plus another ten working group drafts.</p>
<p>The number of possible combinations boggles the mind.  And there’s no end in sight!</p>
<p>What’s a developer to do?  How have people and companies gone about selecting and curating the specs to implement in an attempt to create coherent and useful open source and commercial offerings?  And faced with such an array of combinations and choices, how are application developers to make sense of it all?  How can interoperability be achieved in the face of continued innovation?</p>
<p>This session will prime the pump by discussing choices made by some existing open source and commercial offerings in the OAuth and OpenID space and lead to an open discussion of choices made by the workshop attendees and the reasoning behind them.  It’s our goal that useful strategies emerge from the discussion that help people grapple with the ever-expanding sets of specifications and make informed implementation choices, while still fostering the innovation and problem-solving that these specifications represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The slides used to queue up the discussion session are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OSW_2025_The_Cambrian_Explosion_of_OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications.pdf">PDF</a>.  Also, see the <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OAuth_and_OpenID_Specifications_February_2025.docx">list of 101 OAuth and OpenID-related specifications</a> referenced during the discussion.</p>
<p>The topic seems to have touched a chord.  Many people were clearly already thinking about the situation and shared their views.  Some of them were:</p>
 
 Nobody actually expects everyone to implement everything. 
 Stopping things is super hard.  But sometimes it’s necessary (as Brian Campbell put it, “when they’re wrong”). 
 Timing can be fickle.  What may not be useful at one time can turn out to be useful later. 
 Some specs are highly related and often used together. But those relationships are not always apparent to those new to the space. 
 We need better on-ramps to help people new to the space wrap their arms around the plethora specs and what they’re useful for. 
 Well-written profiles are a way of managing the complexity.  For instance, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0.html">FAPI 2</a> limits choices, increasing both interoperability and security. 
 The amount of innovation happening is a sign of success! 
 
<p>Thanks to the organizers for a great tenth OAuth Security Workshop!  And special thanks to the colleagues from <a href="https://www.signicat.com/">Signicat</a> who did a superb job with local arrangements in Reykjavík!</p>

 AIエージェントによる顧客の代理に注目が集まり始めている。 



 これに対応するために、Customer and Agent Identity Management (CAIM)という新しいアイデンティティ管理上の概念が浮上しつつある。 



 Customer and Agent Identity Management (CAIM) とは、AIエージェントと人間ユーザーのアイデンティティ管理を統合・最適化するソリューションである。 



 AIエージェントが業務を自律的に行う中で、セキュリティ、透明性、コンプライアンス を確保するために設計されており、以下の3つの主要コンポーネントを含むとされる。
 
 AgentLogin：AIエージェント専用の安全なログイン機構 



 AgentGuard：事前定義された権限・セキュリティポリシーの厳格な遵守を確保 



 AgentTrace：AIエージェントの認証や行動を記録し、監査可能なログを作成 
 
 



 このソリューションにより、AIエージェントを活用する企業が安全かつ効率的に業務を推進できる環境を整備 される。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2025/02/6772/#easy-footnote-bottom-30-6772" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.scworld.com/feature/identity-management-solutions-for-the-next-generation-of-cybersecurity&quot;>https://www.scworld.com/feature/identity-management-solutions-for-the-next-generation-of-cybersecurity</a>">30</a>

<p>3月4日(火) 10:00-12:40に「FAPIとVCの世界動向　～FAPI2.0 &amp; Verifiable Credentials~」と題されたセミナーがFINOLABイベントスペースで開催されます。私もちょっとだけでます。</p>



<p>金融機関におけるKYC等にそれらデジタル資格証明を利用するとした場合の様々な考慮事項の検討や、世界のオープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0についての解説を聞くことができます。前者の話題としては、富士榮さんたちの論文「<a href="https://dal.sfc.keio.ac.jp/ja/TR/management-requirements-for-digital-credentials/">デジタルクレデンシャルの利用用途に応じた管理要件に関する考察</a>」の解説も聞けるかも？！</p>



<p>ぜひお越しください。</p>



 セミナー概要 



<p>Japan FinTech Week期間中に開催される今回のセミナーでは、「FAPI」と「Verifiable Credentials」をとりあげ、世界の最新動向を紹介するとともに、今後の業務での実装について議論させていただく予定ですので、是非ご参加ください。<br><br>◆日時　　：2025年3月4日(火) 10:00-12:40（開場　9:40）<br>◆会場　　：<a href="https://finolab.tokyo/jp">FINOLAB</a>イベントスペース<br>　　　　　　東京都千代田区大手町1-6-1 大手町ビル4F<br>　　　　　　　※大手町ビルは東西に長いビルで入口は東端、東京駅側にあります。<br>◆使用言語：日本語（英語資料も提供）<br>◆参加費用：無料　<br>◆主催　　：株式会社Authlete／伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社<br>◆後援　　：株式会社FINOLAB<br></p>

 10:00₋10:05　開会のご挨拶<br> 



 10:05-11:00　デジタル資格証明のガバナンス　鈴木 茂哉氏（慶応義塾大学）　富士榮 尚寛氏（伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ）　　 



<p>Verifiable Credentialsなど持ち運び可能なデジタル資格証明と関連技術に注目が集まっていますが、例えば金融機関におけるKYC等にそれらデジタル資格証明を利用するとした場合、様々な考慮事項があります。慶應義塾大学SFC研究所と伊藤忠テクノソリューションズ株式会社はEUや欧米の最新動向を踏まえ、デジタル資格証明の管理要件やガバナンスについて共同研究を行ってきました。本セッションでは両者が共同で発行したディスカッションペーパー「デジタルクレデンシャルの利用用途に応じた管理要件」についてご紹介しつつ、今後デジタルクレデンシャルを金融サービス等に適用していく上で必要な論点について考察していきます。</p>



<p></p>



 11:00-11:55 オープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0　　川崎 貴彦氏（Authlete） 



<p>2010年代中頃、金融業界の競争活性化を主目的としたオープンバンキング政策が英国で開始されました。この政策によりコンピュータプログラムから金融サービスへアクセスする仕組みが構築された結果、多様な金融サービスが生まれ、人々の生活はより便利になりました。今となっては世界中に広がったこのオープンバンキングムーブメントですが、それを技術的に支えているのがFAPIと呼ばれる世界標準技術仕様です。そのFAPIも、今年2月にFAPI 2.0最終版が承認され、大きな節目を迎えました。このセッションでは、FAPI 2.0仕様の著者達が所属するAuthlete社が、オープンバンキングとFAPI 2.0について解説します。</p>

<p>The Pulse is <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/s/the-pulse">a series</a> covering insights, patterns, and trends within Big Tech and startups. Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. Amazon launches Alexa+, VS Code pulls “epic” but malicious theme, Meta cuts stock awards by 10%, Humane sells to HP, and more.</p>  <p>Swarm of AI coding tool launches. Anthropic launches Sonnet 3.7 (a supposedly even more capable LLM for coding) and Claude Code. GitHub ships Copilot Code Reviews, and Google makes Gemini Code Assist free for individual users (from $22.80 per month). Us devs are showered with new tools that all aim to improve workflows.</p>  <p>DeepSeek triggers higher GPU demand? It’s been predicted that more efficient LLMs will decrease demand for GPUs, but DeepSeek is 4-5x as efficient as some current LLMs, and appears to be driving up demand. Also, a look at the very clever “hacks” DeepSeek uses to boost performance on NVIDIA GPUs.</p>  <p>VC funding down, AI funding up. VC firms are increasingly shutting down, with overall funding levels dropping. AI-related funding is up – along with competition among startups to get funded. We <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">predicted</a> VC funding could dry up <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/zirp">due to interest rate changes</a>, and the data seems to show this happening.</p>  <p>What does “zero” mean for dates in COBOL? A reminder that “0” and “null” might not mean what you expect in some programming languages and systems.</p>   1. Industry Pulse  Amazon launches Alexa+ <p>A year ago, I analyzed how Alexa <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/146756242/how-did-alexa-get-left-behind-in-conversational-ai">had become left behind</a> in the conversational AI race by missing the LLM wave, despite Amazon Alexa being a great use case for an integrated LLM, in order to provide better conversational experiences and new capabilities.</p><p>Well, 12 months later, Amazon seems to have caught up. This week, the online retail giant <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">announced</a> Alexa+, which is a revamped, more capable conversational assistant. It promises to make reservations or book rides by using apps like OpenTable and Uber, buy things on Amazon (obviously), manage smart speakers in the home, discover new music, and more.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1894771550718484863">launch demo</a> looks very polished and capable. But then, Apple’s glossy launch demos for Apple Intelligence didn’t stop the feature still <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/156613118/apple-intelligence-half-baked">feeling half-baked</a> months later.</p><p>Under the hood, Alexa is partially <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-and-alexa-plus">powered by Claude</a>, which Amazon didn’t announce, and Anthropic did. This suggests Anthropic’s models are ahead of Amazon’s own <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/155552919/amazons-ai-models-fail-to-impress">Nova models</a>. Still, Amazon is clearly creating optionality for itself by not advertising Alexa’s dependence on Claude; when and if the Nova models are good enough, Amazon could replace Anthrophic’s solution with its own.</p><p>The Amazon+ pricing is puzzling: Alexa+ is free for Amazon Prime members ($14.99 monthly), and $19.99 per month for everyone else. This seems to make little sense; why charge so much more for a standalone subscription than for a bundle? Is it because Amazon wants to dis-incentivize customers just subscribing to Alexa+?</p><p>Either way, Amazon is making a stronger-than-ever case for customers to choose Amazon Prime for $14.99: which is probably the goal of upgrading Alexa.</p> VS Code pulls “epic” malicious theme

For today’s episode, I sat down with him, to go through more comics, why he created them, and the deeper meaning behind several of these.</p><p>Manu spent over a decade at Google, doing both backend and frontend development. He also spent a year and a half at Twitter before Elon Musk purchased it and rebranded it to X. But what Manu is most known for are his hilarious internet comics about the tech world, including his famous org chart comic from 2011 about Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p><p>In today’s conversation, we explore many of his comics, discuss the meaning behind them, and talk about the following topics:</p>  <p>The viral org chart comic that captured the structure of Big Tech companies</p>  <p>Why Google is notorious for confusing product names</p>  <p>The comic that ended up on every door at Google</p>  <p>How Google’s 20% time fostered innovation—and what projects came from it</p>  <p>How one of Manu’s comics predicted Google Stadia’s failure—and the reasons behind it</p>  <p>The value of connecting to users directly</p>  <p>Twitter’s climate before and after Elon Musk’s acquisition and the mass layoffs that followed</p>  <p>And more!</p>      <p>This is an unusually visual episode, offering the story behind several comics about Big Tech, Google and Twitter that you might have seen. With Manu, we discuss the deeper meaning behind several of these — ones that are pretty obvious to those who worked inside these companies, but might be less intuitive if you’re only seeing them for the first time.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/manu">How Manu creates comics</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/consolidating-technologies">Consolidating technologies</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/is-big-tech-becoming-more-cutthroat">Is Big Tech becoming more cutthroat?</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=121s">02:01</a>) Manu’s org structure comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=430s">07:10</a>) Manu’s “Who Sues Who” comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=555s">09:15</a>) Google vs. Amazon comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=850s">14:10</a>) Confusing names at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1200s">20:00</a>) Different approaches to sharing information within companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1340s">22:20</a>) The two ways of doing things at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1515s">25:15</a>) Manu’s code reviews comic</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1665s">27:45</a>) The comic that was printed on every single door of Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=1855s">30:55</a>) An explanation of 20% at Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2160s">36:00</a>) Gmail Labs and Google Stadia</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2496s">41:36</a>) Manu’s time at Twitter and the threat of Elon Musk buying</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2827s">47:07</a>) How Manu helped Gergely with a bug on Twitter</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=2945s">49:05</a>) Musk’s acquirement of Twitter and the resulting layoffs</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3540s">59:00</a>) Manu’s comic about his disillusionment with Twitter and Google</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXoJ0qOavhs&amp;t=3757s">1:02:37</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The org chart comic   <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/62">this comic</a> in 2011 featuring the org charts of big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft.</p>  <p>Manu almost didn't publish the comic because he didn't find it funny by the time he finished drawing it. The punchline was Oracle having a large legal department and a tiny engineering department.</p>  <p>The comic became very popular and has been referenced heavily.</p>     The culture inside Google   <p>Google has a problem naming things, which Manu attributes to its bottom-up culture and engineers starting competing projects.</p>  <p>There isn't much top-down pressure to consolidate efforts, leading to consumer confusion.</p>  <p>An example of Google's naming issues is the evolution from Google Wallet to Android Pay to Google Pay, with logo changes causing confusion for partners like Uber.</p>    <p>Manu created <a href="https://goomics.net/207">a comic about this</a>: how confusing it is to interact with Google products due to the different names.</p>  <p>The “<a href="https://goomics.net/291">Google Graveyard comic</a>” was prophetic: it predicted that Google's cloud gaming console Stadia would eventually be killed.</p>   Google vs Amazon   <p>Manu created a comic <a href="https://goomics.net/329">contrasting Google and Amazon</a> in their engineering culture, and how they treat customers</p>  <p>Amazon is known for bending over backwards for customers, including AWS clients.</p>  <p>Google focuses on building useful features but lacks strong customer service.</p>  <p>Amazon's on-call practices are tough, while Google's are more relaxed, with SREs taking on much of the on-call load.</p>     Google’s engineering culture   <p><a href="https://goomics.net/50">The comic about migrations</a> at Google: shows the challenges of adopting new systems before they are ready. One Google exec said, "There's two ways to do things at Google. There's the deprecated way and there's the way that doesn't work yet".</p>  <p>One on code reviews: shows the software engineer trying to replace a light bulb while being critiqued on how to screw it in.</p>  <p>Another comic depicts the author of the change who says, "Oh, I don't need to be too cautious about my code. If there's some problem, the reviewer will catch it," and the reviewer who says, "Oh, I don't need to review this too carefully if the author must've know what he's doing or what she's doing".</p>  <p>Google used Manu's "Beware the Tailgator" comic on office doors to prevent theft by reminding employees not to let unverified people into the building.

<p>Today, there’s an ever-growing number of startups, scaleups, and established companies like Boston Dynamics producing increasingly capable robots, including ones that look humanoid. Tech giants like Tesla have been building humanoid robots, and Meta is expected to invest billions in the technology. These and other factors point to the possibility that, after artificial intelligence, robotics could be the “next big thing” in tech.</p><p>But what’s the process of building intelligent robots, and what’s it like as a day-to-day job for the developers who do? It’s not always easy to find this out because robotics startups are famously shrouded in secrecy – and with such cutting-edge technology, it’s unsurprising.</p><p>Academia is often a bit more open, so I turned to MIT Robot Learning Researcher, <a href="https://sandorfelber.github.io/">Sandor Felber</a>. He’s a Humanoid Robot Learning Researcher at MIT in Boston, Massachusetts, and previously led a team that built a self-driving race car. Sandor’s also been a robotics intern at Tesla in Palo Alto, California, and a robotics R&amp;D engineer at the Edinburgh Center of Robotics.</p><p>Today, he takes us through:</p>  <p>Getting into robotics. From personal interest at high school in electric motors, through studying electrical and mechanical engineering at university, building a driverless race car, interning at Tesla, and researching humanoid robots at MIT.</p>  <p>Robotics industry overview. Industrial robots are becoming more widespread, academia focuses on smaller “long-shot” bests, and industry (the commercial sector) executes on proven concepts.</p>  <p>Planning a robotics project. This is similar to most projects: start with a vision, make a plan, and break it down into steps. It’s always useful to be clear on “critical” vs “nice-to-have” features.</p>  <p>Development phase. Control strategies (model-based control vs learned controllers), simulation and hardware deployment differences, and techniques to make simulations more realistic.</p>  <p>Tech stack and tools. Python, C, C++, and Rust are popular programming languages. A list of tools for experiment tracking and simulation.</p>  <p>Testing, demoing, and shipping. Common reasons why robot deployments fail, an example of deployment of an industrial robot, and why ongoing customer support is a baseline expectation.</p>  <p>Day-to-day as a robot builder. There’s a big difference between academia and industry, and Sandor shares an overview of both.</p>  <p>This topic is intriguing because it combines software, hardware, and cutting-edge tech: </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4e97497-eb69-43bc-a6cc-35a446302309_1204x1248.png">          </a>Robotics as a field, and where generative AI techniques and autonomous decision-making fit in.

Getting into robotics, a personal account <p>My interest in robotics began in high school, where I wrote the junior equivalent of a dissertation on characterization methods for how electric motors behave under different conditions. This led me to pursue a degree in electrical and mechanical engineering at the University of Edinburgh, home to numerous renowned robotics and AI researchers.</p><p>Building a driverless electric race car was one of my bigger projects. At uni, I joined the Edinburgh University Formula Student (EUFS) team, where we designed, built, and raced a driverless electric race car. From a roboticist’s perspective, this is considered a wheeled mobile robot.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13984217-0029-431e-8314-60934e584fe1_1600x900.jpeg">          </a>My team’s driverless (but also human-drivable) electric vehicle, SISU23D, at launch.

The team is celebrating defending our championship title in the FS-AI category of FSUK. Source: Nikita Jegorovs <p>Along the way, I discovered a passion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>. Control systems engineers tend to concern themselves with crafting control strategies that ensure optimal performance, from spacecraft trajectories to insulin delivery in diabetics.</p><p>In robotics, you could think of control theory as the invisible puppeteer of a robotic arm, except that instead of pulling strings, it's using mathematics to orchestrate every joint's motion in real time. As a robotic arm needs to smoothly pick up an egg without crushing it, control theory provides the mathematical "muscle memory" that turns crude motor commands into precise, graceful movements. It does this with constant sensor feedback and adjustments, with the approach adjusted depending on how sensitive the control system is to the various feedback signals.</p><p>My interest in control theory and background in batteries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain">powertrains</a> (vehicle motors), and electrical control systems from previous internships landed me one at Tesla's robotics department. Since then, I’ve worked with academic and industrial stakeholders on projects ranging from quadruped (quad- as in four, and -ped as in legged) dog-like robots, to humanoid systems.</p><p>I’m currently at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), focusing on teaching humanoid robots to perform complex, real-world tasks using learned controllers, powered by neural networks. I’m particularly interested in embedding intelligence into robots by leveraging various types of learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, offline and online deep reinforcement learning, and imitation learning.</p><p>I use these approaches for humanoid robot locomotion, manipulation, whole-body control, and teleoperation (remotely controlling the robot).</p> 2. Robotics industry overview <p>Robotics companies are raising more money than ever before. In the first eight months of 2024, global robotics companies <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/from-surge-to-sobriety-the-state-of-robotics-investment-in-2024/">attracted</a> a record amount of $10.8 billion in funding, averaging $1.2 billion per month! What’s all the hype fuelling this surge of capital?</p><p>In public debate, there’s no shortage of focus on labor shortages and stagnating productivity, which reduce growth and competitiveness. The US economy is <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">estimated</a> to be missing up to 4.6 million workers annually needed to maintain levels of supply and demand, according to <a href="https://www.conference-board.org/topics/global-labor-market-outlook/press/global-labor-market-outlook-2024">a recent study</a>. That number equates to 2% of the current US population. The same study suggests Germany needs to find an additional 1.6 million workers to keep current economic levels; 3% of its population.</p><p>This is one driver of industrial robots’ increased adoption, which shows no sign of slowing down. Sustaining economic growth amid shrinking labor pools is one viable path for robotics which is getting a lot of attention, as evidenced in the increased adoption of industrial robots, with global installations reaching nearly 600,000 units in 2024, as per <a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/world_robotics_report_2023_shows_ongoing_global_growth_installations_finds_ifr">the World Robotics Report</a>. This figure surpassed previous benchmarks and shows that industries struggling with labor shortages can return to growth.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a02585a-17a1-4a22-8185-f673cda48fe9_800x450.png">          </a>Industry robots are reshaping the automotive industry as key parts of assembly lines traditionally operated by humans. Source: <a href="https://www.wevolver.com/article/automotive-robots">Wevolver</a> <p>If robots become ubiquitous, what will humans do? This is the most common concern I hear when I talk about my work. The question is an old one: on the New York subway, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/holidaynostalgiarides/">Holiday Nostalgia Ride</a>, which offers a trip in an old subway car from between the 1930s and 1970s. My coach looked like it was from the 1960s, and inside was an advert about upskilling for “tomorrow’s jobs:”</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bf4a0e4-4966-478d-91d9-cfe88313b373_1334x1334.jpeg">          </a>A poster on the New York subway in the 1960s <p>The world has changed massively since then, thanks in part to automation, without which our standards of comfort wouldn’t be possible or affordable; think of the dishwasher that automates the washing up and helps canteens to offer a cheaper menu, than if they had to hire extra people to wash dishes and pay for excess water (new dishwashers are very efficient).</p><p>Acquiring new skills in a quickly-changing world is as least as necessary today as it was back then; as illustrated by that subway ad from the mid-20th century.</p> Industry vs academia <p>Approaches to research and development have always differed between industry and academia. Having worked in both environments, here’s how I see them compare in robotics:</p><p>Academia: smaller “long-shot” bets, developed on a budget. Many projects take years to mature, due to the limited effort that a couple of post-docs, PhD students, and undergrads can dedicate.</p><p>Industry: execute on proven concepts with substantial backing. Industry prioritizes execution on feasible concepts. Once a concept is assumed to work – as usually verified by a proof-of-concept (POC), also known as a “minimum viable product” in startup lingo – industry players can raise vast amounts of money to build it.</p><p>Modern robotics may have reached an inflection point, where enough academic “long-shot” bets are delivering results, with feasible paths to building practical robots, including humanoid ones. Examples of bets made on robotic hardware:</p>  <p>Tesla’s Optimus humanoid prototype</p>  <p>Boston Dynamics bidding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EM5_VFlt8">farewell to hydraulics </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ECwExc-_M">welcoming electric actuators</a> on its all-new humanoid platform, Atlas</p>  <p>1X building a humanoid robot, <a href="https://evjang.com/2024/08/31/motors.html">NEO</a></p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F063c47db-e26d-4dc0-a597-637cd6737783_1600x966.png">          </a>Three humanoid robots: These are calculated bets with significant investment  3. Planning a robotics project <p>Here’s how I’ve seen robotics projects get done.</p><p>Vision for a demo: many robotics projects start with the question: “What should the robot achieve when completed?” Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak’s “coffee test” is one such vision, now frequently referred to as the “New Turing Test.” <a href="https://koopingshung.com/blog/turing-test-is-obsolete-bring-in-coffee-test/">His definition</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“A machine is required to enter an average American home and figure out how to make coffee: find the coffee machine, find the coffee, add water, find a mug, and brew the coffee by pushing the proper buttons."</p></blockquote><p>In practice, on most projects I’ve seen, the vision gets watered down or descoped as deadlines approach, and material or human resources become limiting factors. However a demo that passes the test above could well serve as a benchmark for artificial general intelligence (AGI). As part of that test, a physically-embodied machine must demonstrate intelligence by entering a random home and successfully making a cup of coffee with tools available in a previously unseen kitchen.</p><p>After the vision is set, the next steps are:</p><p>Planning: goals, demoable outcomes, and target applications or target environments. The requirements of a good demo in a target environment can be very high!</p><p>Break things down. Translating deliverables into functional requirements. For each functional requirement, one or more features that show successful fulfillment need to be identified. When breaking things down, features are often separated into at least two subsets:</p>  <p>Critical: those that must be present in the final product. If missing, the project is considered a failure. An example is a humanoid robot weighing 50kg that is deployed in warehouse automation, that needs to carry 10kg payload per arm. If the electric motors moving the arms are too weak, or the ankles suddenly overheat, when operating at 68kg in total, then a client won’t be happy with the product or service (RaaS, or Robot-as-a-Service is a thing now). Therefore, this feature likely requires robust engineering all the way to the very left side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-model">V-model</a>. Identifying such interdependencies and making engineering design calls that aid the design, based on engineering intuition, is challenging and part of what makes for great technical leaders.</p>  <p>Nice-to-have: features that a final project could ship without, such as a higher control frequency in order to achieve smoother, less jittery motion. Note, these cannot be fully neglected but can be considered soft constraints, in contrast to critical features which tend to be hard constraints. A robot that gets the job done, even if not as smoothly, could still be counted as a success with room for improvement.</p>  <p>Critical vs nice-to-have thresholds can change over time. Hard constraints (“critical”) vs soft ones (“nice-to-have”) are often linked, and the difference lies in arbitrary measures of quantity and quality.</p><p>Being clear about the “minimum needed” (critical) and “nice-to-have” requirement thresholds is good practice in robotics projects. These can change as the project develops, turning nice-to-haves into critical ones. As long as everyone on the project is notified and on-board when changes happen, then a project should progress without hiccups.</p> 4. Development phase <p>During development, robotics engineers need to balance proof-of-concept experiments with the scaling of a project, including the supporting infrastructure. For example, one proof-of-concept experiment could be verifying that a parallel jaw gripper (the robot’s hand) can grasp a mug in specific setups.</p><p>Scaling can be hard because there are lots of problems in the real world to solve. Scaling the above example of holding a mug can be seen as:</p>

<p>Die scheidende EU-Bürgerbeauftragte Emily O’Reilly hat es auf die Beschwerde des ehemaligen Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei Patrick Breyer als “Missstand” <a href="https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/decision/en/200017">bewertet</a>, dass ein Europol-Beamter trotz potenzieller Interessenskonflikte ohne jegliche Auflagen zum Chatkontrolle-Dienstleister Thorn wechseln und zuvor noch zwei Monate bei Europol in derselben Funktion weiter arbeiten durfte. “Europol hat es versäumt, den oben genannten Interessenkonflikt zu lösen, wodurch die Integrität und Unparteilichkeit seiner Maßnahmen gefährdet wurden”, heißt es in der Entscheidung der Bürgerbeauftragten. Der Beamte hatte bei Europol an einem KI-Pilotprojekt zur CSAM-Erkennung gearbeitet und war nach seinem Wechsel<a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/29/europol-sought-unlimited-data-access-in-online-child-sexual-abuse-regulation/"> beim Bundestag als Lobbyist für Thorn registriert und fuhr in seiner neuen Funktion zu einem Europol-Treffen mit seinen ehemaligen Kollegen für eine Produktpräsentation. </a>Europol verspricht ab 2025 nun zusätzliche Maßnahmen zur Vorbeugung von Interessenskonflikten wie Versetzungen, veränderte Aufgaben und den Einzug von Informationszugang für wechselwillige Mitarbeiter.<br><br>Breyer begrüßt das Ergebnis: „Wenn ein ehemaliger Europol-Bediensteter sein internes Wissen und seine Kontakte verkauft, um ihm persönlich bekannte Mitarbeiter der EU-Kommission zu lobbyieren, ist dies genau das, was es zu verhindern gilt. Seit der Enthüllung des ‘<a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/anlasslose-massenueberwachung-recherchen-decken-netzwerk-der-chatkontrolle-lobby-auf/">Chatcontrol-Gate</a>‘ wissen wir, dass der EU-Vorschlag zu Chatkontrolle letztlich ein Produkt der Lobby eines internationalen überwachungsbehördlich-industriellen Komplexes ist. Damit so etwas nie wieder passiert, muss der Überwachungslobbysumpf trockengelegt werden.“</p>



<p>Hinweis: Die Entscheidung der EU-Bürgerbeauftragten ist <a href="https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/decision/en/200017">hier</a> abrufbar. Der hochkontroverse EU-Vorschlag zur Chatkontrolle steckt fest, weil es <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#WasTun">weder für die Aufhebung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und die Zerstörung sicherer Verschlüsselung eine qualifizierte Mehrheit unter den EU-Staaten gibt</a> <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2025/internes-protokoll-mehrheit-der-eu-staaten-beharrt-auf-verpflichtender-chatkontrolle/">noch eine Mehrheit für die Streichung der Chatkontrolle aus dem Vorschlag</a>.<br></p>

<p>In October 2023, my wife emerged from the bathroom one morning to report that we had no hot water. I found that our gas-fired, on-demand water heater had failed and was leaking a small amount. I called our plumber, who confirmed we needed a new water heater.</p>



<p>We immediately faced the following decision: Should we replace our water heater with a similar gas-fired on-demand unit or change to an electric heat pump water heater? We have been hearing a great deal about the efficiency and ecological benefits of heat pump water heaters, and on-demand gas units like the one we had are said to emit considerably more carbon than even gas-fired tank units.</p>



<p>Placement for a heat pump water heater would be a challenge. The water heater had been located in the attic, and the heat pump water heater was somewhat taller than even the gas-fired tank unit that was installed at the time we bought the house. That meant it could not fit in the attic and would need to be installed in the garage. We found a reasonable location, although we would lose storage space in the garage. It also meant that the loop for our hot water recirculating system needed to be extended down to the garage, making the loop longer.</p>



<p>The plumber said that he could replace the on-demand gas unit with a similar one in a couple of days, but it would take a week or so to obtain a heat pump unit, which would also cost considerably more. We had to make a snap decision because we didn’t want to be without hot water any longer than necessary. Wanting to be good ecological citizens, we opted for the heat pump unit despite the cost, complexity, and delay in installation.</p>



<p>As promised, the plumber obtained the heat pump water heater, an <a href="https://americanstandardwaterheaters.com/product/hybrid-heat-pump-water-heater/">American Standard</a> 50-gallon unit (model ASHPWH-50). Installation took about two days and involved running a considerable amount of pipe from the old location in the attic to the new location in the garage, installing a new 30-ampere 220-volt electrical circuit at the heater, and bracing against earthquakes. The installation went well, except a defective water leak sensor had to be bypassed.</p>



 First Impressions 



<p>The first thing I noticed about the new water heater was its significant noise. The specification sheet listed it as emitting 40.1 dBA, which is about the same as a refrigerator’s (and also an implausibly specific value). However, the water heater was much louder than this.</p>



<p>The on-demand water heater spoiled us: we never ran out of hot water. We soon found that not to be the case with the new water heater, and I turned the water volume for my showers much lower than before. Perhaps scarcity is a good thing.</p>



<p>The new water heater is a “hybrid” unit with a heat pump and also a conventional heating element. It has several modes: </p>



 
 Green (heat pump only) 



 Comfort (“rational use of the heat pump and, if necessary, the heating element”) 



 Fast (heat pump + heating element) 



 i-Memory (“learns your habits and replicates them autonomously”) 



 Electric (heating element only) 
 



<p>There’s also a Boost mode, which is like Fast, but reverts to the previous mode when it gets up to temperature. Initially, it was set for Comfort, but I couldn’t understand when it was and wasn’t running the heating element. I asked product support and the installer, but I still couldn’t make sense of Comfort mode, so we changed to Green. I manually turn on the Boost feature when we need extra hot water.</p>



 The noise issue 



<p>The noise generated by the water heater was bothersome, especially since it was noticeable in my office adjacent to the garage. I downloaded a sound level measurement app on my phone. I sent a video to American Standard (actually Ariston) product support. They told me I had not measured it under the right conditions. Of course, my garage is not an anechoic chamber.</p>



<p>I consulted “the internet” and found conflicting answers about the noise generated by heat pump water heaters. Some comments described them as very noisy, and others found them quite acceptable. I tried to find others locally with similar water heaters for comparison and failed. In late 2024, the behavior of the water heater changed: sometimes it had a loud “whirr,” and sometimes it didn’t. This prompted me to make several recordings of the sound (and analyze it with a spectrum analyzer app) and determine that much of the excess noise was coming from the fan in the heat pump. I again contacted product support, and they agreed to ship me a replacement fan. My plumber replaced it, and the noise is much better now.</p>



 The app 



<p>Like many new devices, the water heater connects to the internet through my WiFi and, through a cloud service, allows an app on my phone to control and monitor it. The app, called Comfort Link, is acceptable but less than excellent.</p>



<p>Good:</p>



 
 Allows me to remotely control the water heater, including turning on Boost mode when needed and turning off the water heater when we’re on vacation 



 Displays the water heater temperature so I can judge whether to take a shower 



 Shows the history of power usage by the water heater by month, day, and hour 
 



<p>Not so good:</p>



 
 The water heater has an icon that appears when it judges when it’s OK to shower. This isn’t on the app, but it would be very useful. 



 The water heater temperature shown on the app doesn’t agree with that shown on the water heater. The support people explained that the water heater has several temperature sensors, and the app displays (I think) the average between the tank top and tank bottom temperature. But that doesn’t explain why the front panel displays something different. 



 Limited history of power usage data (e.g., daily data for only the current and previous month) 



 Poor resolution of power usage data. Measurements seem only to be taken only once per hour, so the heating element usage is reported in 4.5 kWh increments and the heat pump in 0.5 kWh increments. 



 There seems to be no API to download data other than through the app. 
 



 Efficiency 



<p>The heat pump is indeed more efficient than the electric heating element. This is suggested by the usage graph, where the orange bars represent energy usage from the heating element:</p>



<a href="https://altmode.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/img_1319.jpg"></a>



<p>But of course, the days we used the heating element are also days where I turned on Boost mode because we were using more hot water, which exaggerates the difference. I measured the tank temperature over time as it heated up:</p>



 
 Heating element (4.5 kW): temperature rise 68.9°F/hr = 15.3°F/kWh 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 17.3°F/hr = 38.7°F/kWh (77°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.9°F/hr = 26.5°F/kWh (61°F ambient) 



 Heat pump (0.45 kW): temperature rise 11.4°F/hr = 25.3°F/kWh (57°F ambient) 
 



<p>As expected, the heat pump’s efficiency depends on the ambient temperature, which determines the amount of heat the heat pump can “harvest” from the air. Compared with the heating element, the heat pump’s overall efficiency ranges from a factor of 1.65 to 2.53.</p>



 Operating cost 



<p>The heat pump water heater is efficient, but is it more cost-effective than our previous gas water heater? As noted above, it isn’t possible to make an exact comparison because we don’t know how our usage may have changed. If we make the worst-case assumption that our usage hasn’t changed, we are now using an average of about 5.3 kWh per day (153 kWh/month divided by 29 days). At an off-peak rate of $0.44/kWh, that works out to $2.33/day. Counting only those days where we used only the heat pump, that’s about 4 kWh/day or $1.76/day. Before getting the new water heater, our gas usage was about 8 therms/month, virtually all of which was for hot water. At our current rate of about $2.50/therm, that works out to $20/month or $0.67/day.</p>



<p>As our plumber had hinted when we installed the new water heater, gas is relatively inexpensive compared to electricity at current prices (unless you’re generating your own electricity). While an electric heat pump water heater is efficient and ecologically responsible, don’t expect it to save you money at current rates.</p>

<p>Client assertions is a method of client authentication which can be used in OpenID Connect. This provides an alternative to client secrets. This approach enhances security by using signed tokens (JWTs) to authenticate clients during the token request process or the OAuth PAR request. In ASP.NET Core, client assertions is not supported per default, a small implementation is required.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>A client assertion can be added to the token request which is sent from the ASP.NET Core backend to the OpenID Connect server. This is sent instead of the a client secret. The client is authenticated using the assertion. If using OAuth, the assertion is sent in the PAR request.</p>







<p></p>



 Create client assertion JWT 



<p>The application uses Microsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server and the identity provider. The assertion was created using the Microsoft documentation.</p>



<p>Original src: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/web-apps-apis/confidential-client-assertions#crafting-the-assertion</a></p>



<p>A X509Certificate2 is used to create the certificate and validate the certificate. The audience, the clientId and the sub claims are sent in the JWT client assertion as well as the standard claims signed with the private key of the certificate used to validate the assertion in Microsoft Entra ID. As always, if using this against a different OpenID Connect server, JWT will be validated differently. Microsoft Entra ID requires a RSA key size 2048. </p>


  
public static class CertService
{
    public static string GetSignedClientAssertion(
          X509Certificate2 certificate, string aud, string clientId)
    {
        // no need to add exp, nbf as JsonWebTokenHandler will add them by default.
        var claims = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;()
        {
            { "aud", aud },
            { "iss", clientId },
            { "jti", Guid.NewGuid().ToString() },
            { "sub", clientId }
        };

        var securityTokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
        {
            Claims = claims,
            SigningCredentials = new X509SigningCredentials(certificate)
        };

        var handler = new JsonWebTokenHandler();
        var signedClientAssertion = handler.CreateToken(securityTokenDescriptor);

        return signedClientAssertion;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Using Micrsoft Entra ID as the OpenID Connect server, the client assertion is created using the token endpoint. In production, the certificate can be generated using Azure Key Vault. The certificate can also be read from the operating system store. This can all be set in the app.settings.</p>


          // single tenant
        var aud = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]!}/oauth2/v2.0/token";

        var clientAssertion = CertService.GetSignedClientAssertion(
            X509CertificateLoader.LoadPkcs12FromFile("cert_rsa512.pfx", "1234"),
            aud,
            builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"]!);
  


<p></p>



 Use the client assertion in the OpenID connect client 



<p>Once ready, the OnAuthorizationCodeReceived event can be used to added the assertion in the OpenID Connect client. If using PAR, the par event is used.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
    .AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, oidcOptions =&gt;
    {
        oidcOptions.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OpenIdProfile);
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add("user.read");
        oidcOptions.Scope.Add(OpenIdConnectScope.OfflineAccess);
        oidcOptions.Authority 
         = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{builder.Configuration["AzureAd:TenantId"]}/v2.0/";
        oidcOptions.ClientId = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientId"];
        //oidcOptions.ClientSecret = builder.Configuration["AzureAd:ClientSecret"];
        oidcOptions.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
        oidcOptions.MapInboundClaims = false;
        oidcOptions.SaveTokens = true;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.NameClaimType 
          = JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Name;
        oidcOptions.TokenValidationParameters.RoleClaimType = "role";

        oidcOptions.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
        {
            // Add client_assertion            
            OnAuthorizationCodeReceived = context =&gt;
            {
                context.TokenEndpointRequest!.ClientAssertion = clientAssertion;
                context.TokenEndpointRequest.ClientAssertionType 
                 = "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer";
                return Task.FromResult(0);
            }
        };
    });
  


<p></p>



 Setup Entra ID App registration 



<p>An Azure App registration is used to authenticate using Micrsoft Entra ID. The public key of the certificate can be uploaded to to the App registration. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Client assertions can be used for any OpenID Connect confidential client if the OpenID Connect server supports this. The assertion can be sent in the token request or in the PAR request depending on the flavor of the OpenID Connect code flow used.</p>



 Creating the certificate 



<p>The github <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-client-assertion/blob/main/CreateSelfSignedCertsConsole/Program.cs">repository</a> linked at the top, provides an example to create your own certificate which can be used in this flow. You can also use Azure Key vault or any other tool to create the certificate.</p>

See the episode transcript at the top of this page, and a summary at the bottom.</p> Brought to You By <p>• <a href="https://getdx.com/?utm_source=pragmaticengineer">DX</a> — An engineering intelligence platform designed by leading researchers.</p><p>• <a href="https://sentry.io/pragmatic/?">Sentry</a> — Error and performance monitoring for developers.</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>We’ve previously covered a lot on the surprisingly slippery topic of developer productivity: from how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity">Uber measures it</a>, how <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linkedin-engineering-efficiency">LinkedIn does it</a>, an overview of the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework">innovative DevEx framework</a>, and a deepdive of dev productivity metrics <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-bae">used by Google, LinkedIn, Peloton, Amplitude, Intercom, Notion, Postman, and 10 other tech companies</a>.</p><p>Every time developer productivity comes up: DORA and SPACE are almost certainly mentioned. So I could not be more excited to have Dr. Nicole Forsgren on the podcast. Nicole is the creator of the widely adopted DORA and SPACE frameworks, co-author of the award-winning book Accelerate and the DevOps Handbook (2nd edition), and author of the State of DevOps reports. She is currently a Partner at Microsoft Research, leading developer productivity research and strategy, and is currently working on a book about developer experience with Abi Noda. It’s safe to say that Nicole is one of the foremost experts in developer productivity — if not the foremost expert.</p><p>In this episode, we discuss:</p>  <p>Why PRs and Diffs are incomplete as a solo metric and how to view them in context</p>  <p>The importance of a holistic set of metrics for evaluating productivity</p>  <p>An overview of DORA’s four key metrics, its strengths, and its limitations</p>  <p>The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p>  <p>What developer experience is—and concrete ways to improve it</p>  <p>Common characteristics of highly productive engineering teams</p>  <p>How faster onboarding might challenge Brook’s Law</p>  <p>How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity and best practices for experimentation</p>  <p>And much more!</p>       Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. Measuring the number of PRs is controversial for a good reason. Measuring any single one “output” can be misused: and when devs know it is being measured, they will optimize for it.</p><p>However, measuring PRs is important: but to do it well, don’t look at it as an individual performance metric. Instead, use it to understand how well (or not well) systems across the team and company are working. For example, what systems are getting in the way of PRs taking long to merge?</p><p>2. DORA and SPACE both have their own limitations. DORA is very well-defined in the metrics it measures. However, a massive limitation it has is how it only measures from commit to production.</p><p>SPACE can be used to measure the complete developer workflow – including e.g. planning, coding, and even post-release. In turn, it is a more vague framework where you need to put in more effort to make it useful for your envirnment.</p><p>3. AI developer tools don’t change DevEx fundamentals. DORA and SPACE are still relevant. AI tools might be able to improve iteration speed, or make certain tasks more helpful. It’s really an open question how exactly this will play out. There’s a fair chance these tools significantly change how we do development. So if you’re a dev: experiment with them!</p><p>4. Developer experience (DevEx) is not necessarily great at large companies and poor at startups. Google is known to have standout developer experience thanks to so much investment it put into systems – but not all large companies are like this!</p><p>Startups have less resources to invest specifically in improving DevEx: but then again, they have less infrastructure in-place! The more custom infrastructure you have, the more painful DevEx tends to be (and the more in-house tools need to be built to mitigate this)</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode   <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-bae">Measuring Developer Productivity: Real-World Examples</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework">A new way to measure developer productivity – from the creators of DORA and SPACE</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/linkedin-engineering-efficiency">Measuring Engineering Efficiency at LinkedIn</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/uber-eng-productivity">How Uber is Measuring Engineering Productivity</a></p>  <p><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-productivity">Measuring software engineering productivity</a></p>   Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=123s">02:03</a>) PRs and Diffs and how to view them in the right context</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=462s">07:42</a>) EngThrive at Microsoft</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=626s">10:26</a>) The importance of having a holistic set of metrics in evaluating productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1020s">17:00</a>) The four key metrics of DORA</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1437s">23:57</a>) The evolution of processes and tools since DORA, including SPACE</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1600s">26:40</a>) An explanation of developer experience — and ways to improve it</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=1844s">30:44</a>) Devex at startups vs. larger companies</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2060s">34:20</a>) Why measuring developer productivity is so difficult</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2345s">39:05</a>) How to make a case for platform teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=2674s">44:34</a>) Common characteristics of highly productive teams</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3061s">51:01</a>) Brook’s law and how faster onboarding might make it irrelevant</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3169s">52:49</a>) Onboarding for internal transfers</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3258s">54:18</a>) Shifting culture towards technology first</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3516s">58:36</a>) How middle management can improve engineering culture</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=3816s">1:03:36</a>) How AI tooling is impacting developer productivity</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4002s">1:06:42</a>) Potential use cases for AI</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4120s">1:08:40</a>) A case for experimenting with AI coding tools and how to maintain flow state</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufjP_WRnPM&amp;t=4530s">1:15:30</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  Measuring Developer Productivity   <p>PRs and diffs can be both good and bad signals when measuring developer productivity. Many leaders focus on the traditional economic definition of productivity: the rate of output or output per input.</p>  <p>PRs can give a view into the work being done, but senior engineers may have lower PR output due to other responsibilities like unblocking others, architecture, mentoring, and recruitment. It's important to consider the context and who is being measured.</p>  <p>A constellation of metrics is better than a single metric for a holistic view. So yes: it can be helpful to get data on PRs – as long as you get a lot more other data points as well!</p>    <p>Microsoft's EngThrive: this framework (which Nicole works on) uses multiple metrics across dimensions, inspired by the SPACE framework, alongside qualitative feedback.</p>  <p>Easy-to-operationalise measures can be useful. However, they only show a few things and may ignore important aspects.</p>  <p>SPACE: a framework that groups metrics into:</p>  <p>Satisfaction</p>  <p>Performance</p>  <p>Activity</p>  <p>Communication</p>  <p>Efficiency.</p>  <p>Nicole is a co-author of the framework. It’s one that is getting a lot wider adaptation. See <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/122054454/dora-space-and-the-need-for-a-new-approach">an overview of the SPACE framework</a></p>    <p>Absent engineering leadership is unhelpful. No matter what metrics you use: if engineering leadership is not connected with the work, outcomes are likely to be a lot worse.</p>  <p>Metrics collected in a holistic way, on the other hand, can guide decisions about company-wide blockers.</p>   DORA frameworkand its evolution   <p>Nicole is the co-creator of DORA</p>  <p>DORA can refer to the entire research program. More frequently though, people tend to refer to the 4 DORA metrics:</p>  <p>Deployment frequency</p>  <p>Lead time for changes</p>  <p>Change failure rate,</p>  <p>Time to restore service</p>    <p>These 4 metrics are a good indicator of how well a development pipeline is working</p>  <p>DORA can be adapted for different environments, such as air-gapped systems, by redefining the scope of the deployment pipeline.</p>  <p>DORA does not show the full picture. DORA metrics serve as a signal for how well a team is doing, but it does not show the complete picture. DORA focuses on commit to production. This is a part of the engineering process that can be made pretty efficient.</p>  <p>Fast feedback is important, as is the ability to set up environments and provision resources quickly.</p>  <p>SPACE evolved from DORA. SPACE considers the entire end-to-end toolchain. SPACE metrics can be applied to specific components, like PRs. DORA is essentially one of many instances of SPACE.</p>   Developer Experience   <p>Developer experience is a developer's lived experience. This can be “good” – it can also be “bad!”</p>  <p>A good developer experience minimises friction, blockers, and confusion</p>  <p>Security and compliance: these are important! However, automation can minimise manual processes for developers. A secure and compliant dev process does not need to be cumbersome.</p>  <p>Delays and cognitive load from inefficient processes negatively affect developer experience.</p>  <p>Both large and small companies can have good or bad developer experiences. Large companies have more resources but may struggle with legacy systems and bureaucracy. Startups can move fast but lack infrastructure. Google has an exceptional developer experience because they invest in it and don't tolerate friction.</p>   Improving Engineering Teams   <p>Most work in software is invisible, and systems are increasingly complex.</p>  <p>Leaders and executives often don't feel the pain of developers.</p>  <p>To make a case for investment in tooling: use both data and stories. Present the trade-offs realistically.</p>  <p>Acknowledge that there's a tipping point where further investments won't deliver much more progress.</p>  <p>Frame requests in terms of trade-offs and potential for repurposing teams.</p>    <p>High-performing teams:</p>  <p>Exhibit psychological safety, curiosity, and openness to better ways of doing things.</p>  <p>Onboarding time is a great indicator of team efficiency.</p>  <p>A “dummy pull request” early during the onboarding phase (e.g. day 1!) can significantly increase productivity.

<p>It’s the end of an era: after eight incredible years, it felt like the right time to close the chapter on my story at <a href="http://www.uniken.com">Uniken</a>. When <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Press+Releases/Uniken+Announces+Nishant+Kaushik+as+Chief+Technology+Officer/12739642.html">I joined as CTO</a>, Uniken was an ambitious startup with a unique core technology and a vision to make a global impact. What made the ensuing journey so rewarding was the team – exceptionally talented, deeply committed, and relentlessly innovative. Together, we navigated complex challenges, scaled through uncertainty (including a global pandemic), and built Uniken into a global cybersecurity leader with customer engagements on every continent (except Antarctica, because sadly it would appear that penguins aren’t really concerned about digital trust).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am incredibly proud of the team, and the platform we built – one that empowers businesses to engage securely and seamlessly with their customers, and creates lasting value for our customers and partners.&nbsp; I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues and partners at Uniken. Our collaborative efforts transformed the company and positioned it for long-term success, and I look forward to seeing you scale new heights.</p>

<p>Last week, we looked into data from global hiring agency Indeed that found software development job listings are <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pulse-124">at a five-year low</a>. To check how representative (or not) these numbers are of the tech jobs market, I pinged some tech recruiters. The response was not what I expected:</p><blockquote><p>“I can only talk about our own niche from seed-stage to Series C engineering recruitment, but we’ve never had so many positions to fill as in 2024.” – Asher Hoffman, cofounder of <a href="https://www.coastalrecruiting.co/">Coastal Recruiting</a></p><p>“In 2024, every month was a step up in the number of job searches we did for CTO, VP of engineering, director of engineering and product leadership positions. It just kept going up. 2024 was our second-best year ever for the number of searches done: only 2021 was better, and that was an incredible year; the peak of the job market.” – Glenn Murphy, managing partner at <a href="https://www.rivierapartners.com/">Riviera Partners</a></p></blockquote><p>These data points stick out and I was eager to learn more; after all, they’re bucking the trend in Indeed’s figures, with rising demand for tech professionals! I met Asher and Glenn to get their perspectives, and they also offered some tactics for engineers and engineering leaders to use when seeking new opportunities. Today, we cover:</p>  <p>What are boutique recruiters? Also, the differences between contingent and retained ones.</p>  <p>Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups. Fifty percent of hires are backend, 25% fullstack, 10-15% AI/ML, and 5% are frontend. A big surprise is virtually no demand for native mobile developers, or for the .NET and Java tech stacks. Also, very few mentions of Angular or Vue.</p>  <p>More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera. Both recruitment businesses are seeing more engineering jobs to be filled coming their way.</p>  <p>Changes across the market. More money and demand from early-stage VC-funded startups, and private equity becoming more dominant in driving demand for engineering executive hiring.</p>  <p>Startups want ‘cracked’ engineers. These are professionals with a track record of ownership, curiosity, and the ability to “grind.” Length of experience doesn't matter after around the 2-year point.</p>  <p>Demand for engineering leadership positions. Data indicates that large parts of the job market are struggling more than the senior role segment, with director of engineering roles hardest to fill.</p>  <p>What search processes look like. Recruitment experts explain how a typical software engineer search and engineering executive search plays out.</p>  <p>For updates on how these two recruiters see the market, follow <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asherhoffman/">Asher Hoffman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glennmurphy24/">Glenn Murphy</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p>A quick programming note: there will be no The Pulse on Thursday — I’m taking a short winter break. More details in my <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about#§publishing-schedule-and-holidays">publishing schedule</a>.</p> 1. What are boutique recruiters? <p>Coastal Recruiting and Riviera Partners are specialized recruitment agencies; also known as "boutique search”, “contingent”, “retained”, or “executive” recruiters.</p><p>“Boutique” and “specialized” refer to recruiters which focus on a niche within tech, such as:</p>  <p>Software engineer and AI+ML engineer hiring for early-stage startups (Coastal Recruitment)</p>  <p>Director-and-above engineering leadership, and product/design leadership for scaleups and larger companies (Riviera Partners)</p>  <p>Executive recruitment is a subset of boutique recruitment. These companies recruit for executive roles like director of engineering, VP of engineering, head of engineering, CTO roles, etc. In the US, high-profile firms can charge $100K or more to recruit a key position like CTO for a late-stage scaleup.</p><p>Executive recruitment firms can also focus on individual contributor (IC) roles. Glenn Murphy advises that this usually happens only in the US at their firm, and comes with tradeoffs. For example, the cost becomes justifiable only when the vacancy’s comp package is several times higher than the search cost; usually $500K and above. It is this niche area in which an expert executive recruiter can make the most impact by finding truly standout candidates.</p><p>Within the boutique search sector, there are two main types of recruiter:</p> Contingent recruiters <p>These companies work on a “no hire, no fee” basis, and only get paid for successfully filling a position; usually 10-40% of the role’s first-year salary. This service is an easy sell; it’s low risk financially for an employer to work with a contingent recruiter due to no-hire-no-fee. Contingent recruiters also often have more clients than retained ones do.</p><p>Coastal Recruiting mostly does contingent recruitment, with a couple of retained contracts. This company specializes in hiring software engineers from the first hire to engineer number 20 to 30 at early-stage startups. In 2024 they worked with around 100 different startups.</p> Retained recruiters <p>Most executive recruitment companies operate a retainer model and charge upfront, regardless of whether a hire is made. Payment comes in a fixed number of instalments, perhaps in this order:</p>  <p>Initial retainer: the first third of the fee, paid at the start.</p>  <p>Progress retainer: second payment, usually tied to milestones being hit, such as:</p>  <p>Presenting a shortlist of qualified candidates who are ready to engage</p>  <p>Completing screening interviews and drawing up a interview shortlist of preferred candidates</p>  <p>Final interviews scheduled or completed</p>    <p>Final payment: upon successful placement. Depending on the agreement, there may be no payment if a candidate isn’t hired</p>  <p>A search company may also be paid monthly while conducting a search. Total retainer fees are usually 25-50% of the value of the successful candidate’s comp, which increases the more challenging the search is. For example, it’s challenging to find a new CTO for a 300-person scaleup growing at a 10x pace, who is hands-on, has worked with AI / machine learning (ML) before, and who has experience at a hypergrowth company, and also in Big Tech. There aren’t too many people who fit this profile, and not many of them may be interested in switching jobs.</p><p>Guarantee periods can also be an important part of retained searches, under which a portion of the fee may be refunded should a successful candidate quits shortly afterwards.</p><p>Retained recruiters are a lot more expensive than contingent ones, and are the go-to choice for executive recruitment where vacancies may not even be publicly listed by an employer.</p><p>Riviera Partners is one of the best-known executive recruiter companies. They hire for director+ roles in engineering, product and design. In our deepdive <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/43780977/engineering-leadership-positions">Finding the next company to work at</a>, they were the most recommended exec recruiter firm by engineering leaders.</p><p>Seed-stage and early-stage startups typically only use executive recruiters to hire for VP-and-above positions which report to the CEO. Later-stage startups also hire for director positions, and may pay for a search for senior-and-above hires and ICs. However, the cost means this is rare, happens mainly in the US, and by funded scaleups with very specific needs.</p><p>Given this process can be so expensive, it may not be immediately obvious what the upside is. Glenn explains:</p><blockquote><p>“We have 21 years worth of data and information on who has been successful, people’s interests and nuance that isn’t available on a LinkedIn profile.</p><p>We save companies a lot of time, in the end. This is due to the insights we have and our reach across the USA and Europe. We know what’s needed at Series A, all the way through to which profiles tend to succeed at publicly traded companies. We also have the know-how on how to interview people to assess if they’re up for the challenge.”</p></blockquote><p>Riviera’s pricing is atypical, compared to many other retained recruiters. Glenn shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We have time-based milestones as opposed to shortlists or incentives, which can be adjusted sometimes. However, for the most part, the fee is fully paid within 90 days.”</p></blockquote> 2. Hiring by tech stack at early-stage startups <p>At Coastal Recruiting, Asher hires early engineering teams at early-stage startups: from seed-stage startups to Series B and Series C companies. They work with some of the largest US VC investors (like a16z, Y Combinator, Sequoia, Index, Lightspeed, Founders Fund and others).</p> Types of engineers and tech stack <p>Asher sees the hiring demand split like this:</p><p>‘50% of hires we make are backend engineers. I don’t think this will always be the case for startup engineering. The first 3 hires for a company with technical cofounders are almost always backend engineers. It’s a bonus if they have some frontend skills, but I’d peg it at 80% backend, 20% frontend.</p><p>‘For backend tech stacks, these are the languages founders use, which candidates would be expected to pick up quickly. By popularity:</p>  <p>Typescript: easily the most common.</p>  <p>Python: surprisingly popular, usually with another language like Typescript or Go. I assume it’s because so much AI and ML work can be done with it, and it’s a generally useful language</p>  <p>Go: This has gotten somewhat more popular, over time</p>  <p>Rust: especially popular with crypto companies. About 15% of our portfolio is crypto, and Rust is very popular. We’re on the lookout for people with hands-on experience in Rust</p>  <p>Ruby: Out of around 100 clients in the past year, only 2 used Ruby; both of them are pretty big names. They told us “find us anyone who has touched Ruby or Ruby on Rails, and is good.”</p>  <p>Few to no mentions:</p>  <p>Flutter: we’ve gotten a single Flutter role in the past year</p>  <p>Elixir: once in a while, we have a startup that uses this and needs folks with experience with it. But it’s less common than Ruby.</p>  <p>Java / Scala: we don’t get any requests for this stack, at all. However, if someone has Java or Scala experience, and is open to working in Python, we usually move forward with them</p>  <p>C# / .NET: we’ve only come across a single hardware company asking for this in several years.</p>  <p>PHP: almost zero PHP these days</p>  <p>Haskell: it’s been a couple years since any company asked for this.</p>    <p>‘25% percent are fullstack. These roles almost exclusively employ the following technologies:</p>  <p>React for the frontend. React frameworks like Next or React Router are usually relevant. Overall, 95% of framework mentions are for React.</p>  <p>Typescript as the programming language. Of course, JavaScript is a given</p>  <p>Node as the backend framework</p>  <p>Python is often mentioned</p>  <p>React Native is by far the most popular mobile technology we see, often requested by mobile-first startups that build their app with it.</p>  <p>Angular / Vue: a combined 5% or less.</p>  <p>‘AI and ML is 10-15%,” says Asher. “This hire is almost always one of the first 10, and doesn’t need to be an “in-depth” ML specialist. They usually fit this profile:</p>  <p>Backend generalist</p>  <p>Has worked in an ML or AI-driven company</p>  <p>Is deep into what is going on in AI and how to use LLMs, practically</p>  <p>Hacked AI side-projects themselves. They probably hack on the side, and might use things like LangChain, LangGraph, and other popular LLM tools to play around with.</p>  <p>‘Someone we recently hired for such a role had worked for a year as an AI/ML engineer, not an in-depth, “research-caliber” ML candidate.</p><p>‘As startups grow and mature, eventually they tend to hire more in-depth ML and AI people. However, early-stage companies look for builders who can use AI tools effectively.</p><p>‘5% are frontend engineers. Almost universally, the seventh or eighth hire at a startup is the first frontend engineer. The reason almost always is – and I kid you not! – that the founder is fed up with owning the frontend themself, and is ready to bring in a frontend specialist.</p><p>‘Ironically, this role is one of the hardest to fill because technical founders whom we work with typically expect two things:</p>  <p>Be a great frontend person – this is easier to find</p>  <p>Be great at computer science basics – such as algorithms and CS fundamentals. This is why most people who pass #1 get rejected!</p>  <p>‘Another reason this role is so hard to fill is that the founder often looks for a staff-level frontend engineer. This person might be the first frontend hire, but they ideally want someone who will head up the frontend team, as it grows. It’s difficult to convince people with staff-plus frontend jobs at stable companies and who head up teams, to come and join an early-stage startup where they would be the only frontend person – at least at first!</p><p>‘The best startups are embracing AI – and look for devs who do the same. AI coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot are used by all the best startups we recruit for. Founders at these startups often mention that mastering these tools can 10x the productivity of their engineers with faster iteration and the ability to parallelize work.</p><p>‘We don’t see demand for native mobile engineers at all; only React Native. We work with a few “mobile-first” startups who have built impressive mobile apps. All use React Native and look to hire for such experience.</p><p>‘I would assume native hires might become more important after the Series B or Series C rounds. In the early-stage in the US, they are absent – or at least, we see no such demand.’</p><p>Startups don’t care that much if you’ve used their exact stack before. Asher told me:</p><blockquote><p>“I hear over and over again, that a great engineer is a great engineer - and if you don't have experience in the companies current stack - as a talented engineer, you shouldn't have much trouble picking it up quickly. Thus - if your stack doesn't align perfectly with the above most used, it's okay - you can still get the role!”</p></blockquote> 3. More demand than before at Coastal and Riviera <p>Both recruitment companies are seeing record, or near-record business in terms of the number of searches executed.</p><p>More demand from early-stage, VC-funded startups. Asher says:</p><blockquote><p>“In my niche, I’m seeing more hiring than in recent memory.</p><p>I'm seeing many “cracked” engineers with 5+ offers on-hand, and well-funded startups forced to compete by upping their offers to hire the best of the best. I’m seeing higher total comp packages in the early stage space than ever.”</p><p>As we’ll detail below, “cracked” refers to someone with a track record of ownership, who displays curiosity and the ability to grind when needed.</p><p>Asher: “It feels like this is a great time for many folks to leave Big Tech and take a gamble – but not too big a pay cut. Big Tech has done many layoffs and the startups I work with offer similar pay, with a massive equity upside.</p><p>The risks an engineer used to have to take when joining a startup are shrinking in this new market. Well-funded startups are meeting engineers with competitive salaries, health and wellness, and equity. Also, founders are being much more upfront with recruits about their ARR (annual recurring revenue) and progress towards PMF (product-market-fit) than before.</p><p>A disclaimer: I recruit in just the VC-funded, early-stage start-up space, with startups founded by technical founders and backed by well-known VC firms. These are companies that have the money to hire, and a bold vision to build a billion-dollar company. It’s a narrow view of the market.”</p></blockquote><p>Will more companies increase recruitment? At Riviera partners, Glenn Murphy does engineering leadership searches for startups and scaleups. He shares:</p><blockquote><p>“We signed up 58% more searches in 2024 than in 2023 for the US. In Europe, the growth was 61%. The most common search assignment in both continents was for VP Engineering. It feels to me this alone signals a return to a focus on growing teams, as VPs of engineering are hired in preparation to scale up the team’s headcount.”</p></blockquote> 4. Changes across the market <p>I asked both Asher and Glenn what changes have been surprising in their part of the tech hiring market.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows. In the previous post, the UI was customized per client, this post customizes inside a single client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant">https://github.com/damienbod/duende-multi-tenant</a></p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Multiple client sign-in customizations using Duende identity provider</a> 



 Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible. The shop client can be further customized using authentication parameters sent in the OpenID Connect redirect.</p>







<p></p>



 OIDC client implementation 



<p>In ASP.NET Core the OpenID Connect flow implementation provides multiple events which can be changed or extended. The OnRedirectToIdentityProvider can be used to send custom parameters to the OpenID Connect server. The OAuth Pushed authorization request on top of OpenID Connect Core is used used per default in .NET 9, if the OpenID Connect server supports this.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
    options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    // other options ...

    options.Events = new OpenIdConnectEvents
    {
        OnRedirectToIdentityProvider = context =&gt;
        {
            context.ProtocolMessage.SetParameter("showadminsignin", "false");

            return Task.FromResult(0);
        }
    };
});
  


<p></p>



 Duende sign-in customization 



<p>In the previous post, a new sign-in UI was created for each client. The shop client has further customization. In this demo, the admin external provider can be hidden or displayed depending on what the client requests. The UI is implemented using ASP.NET Core Razor pages and a BindProperty is used for this.</p>


  [BindProperty]
public bool ShowAdminSignIn { get; set; } = true;
  


<p></p>



<p>When processes the authentication using Duende and ASP.NET Core Identity, the GetAuthorizationContextAsync method can be used to get the client requested parameters.</p>


  var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
ShowAdminSignIn = !(context?.Parameters["showadminsignin"] == "false");
  


<p></p>



<p>The UI can implement any display logic using the client parameters sent in the request. In this demo, the admin UI is hidden or displayed using the client request data.</p>


  @foreach (var provider in Model.View.VisibleExternalProviders)
{
 if (!(!Model.ShowAdminSignIn &amp;&amp; 
	(provider.AuthenticationScheme == "AdminEntraID")))
 {
	 &lt;li class="list-inline-item"&gt;
		 &lt;a class="btn btn-secondary"
			asp-page="/ExternalLogin/Challenge"
			asp-route-scheme="@provider.AuthenticationScheme"
			asp-route-returnUrl="@Model.Input.ReturnUrl"&gt;
			 @provider.DisplayName
		 &lt;/a&gt;
	 &lt;/li&gt;
 }
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This is an easy approach to implement UI customization on a per client basis. The is UI logic and not authorization. The different options  are just hidden or removed from the UI using the client parameters, the logic MUST not work if this is a security requirement. This is not authorization.</p>

Notice an interesting event or trend? <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/contact/">Send me a message</a>.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p>  <p>Industry pulse. OpenAI struggles to shed nonprofit status, Anthropic bans AI from job applications, cuts at Workday, GitHub Copilot releases an agentic mode, and Linus Torvalds tells Linux contributors that social media pressure is bad for development.</p>  <p>Software engineering job openings hit five-year low? There are 35% fewer software developer job listings on Indeed today, than five years ago. Compared to other industries, job listings for software engineers grew much more in 2021-2022, but have declined much faster since. A look into possible reasons for this, and what could come next.</p>  <p>OpenAI responds to DeepSeek threat. Fresh off the shock of a relatively unknown Chinese company dethroning ChatGPT as the most-downloaded AI app on iPhone and Android, OpenAI has shaken itself up, promptly copied DeepSeek’s visualization of how its reasoning model “thinks”, and has shipped Deep Research.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff54b9bde-a363-4237-8209-89d04a15e62a_1600x738.png">          </a>A glimpse from the section “Software engineering job openings hit five-year low?”  OpenAI struggles to shed nonprofit status <p>Yet more drama at OpenAI, where cofounder Elon Musk has made a $97 billion dollar bid to take over the OpenAI nonprofit. A few details to unpack:</p>  <p>Yes, Musk really is one of the several cofounders of OpenAI. In 2015 it was he, Sam Altman, and 9 others (Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, John Schulman, Wojciech Zaremba, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung, Andrej Karpathy, Durk Kingma, and Pamela Vagata)</p>  <p>Musk contributed around $45M to OpenAI as a donor, as <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/">confirmed</a> by OpenAI.</p>  <p>In 2017, things got messy and Musk eventually left OpenAI. This was the year when OpenAI decided to create a for-profit entity, controlled by the nonprofit. As <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/">shared by</a> OpenAI, Musk wanted control over the for-profit part, and then later wanted to merge it into Tesla.</p>  <p>Musk created rival X.AI in 2023, and this company has raised $6B of funding.</p>  <p>OpenAI is worth a lot more than $97B; its latest valuation was at $157B <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/149770356/openai-biggest-ever-fundraise-as-key-people-keep-quitting">in October</a>, and there are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/technology/openai-softbank-investment.html">rumors</a> of a new raise at or above $300B!</p><p>Here’s where OpenAI’s tricky corporate structure comes into play. OpenAI published a diagram showcasing the structure, but leaving out ownership stakes. Here’s my interpretation, focusing on ownership stakes and control:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76dfe414-3767-42e7-883a-63a629ecbba0_1548x1182.png">          </a>OpenAI’s ownership structure. It’s messy. <p>Musk is offering to buy the nonprofit entity, not the for-profit one. Musk’s offer at $97B for a 51% controlling share values OpenAI at around $195B, which is higher than OpenAI’s last valuation of $157B. The company’s board has a fiduciary duty to consider the offer. However, OpenAI is officially a non-profit, so this duty may not apply.</p><p>It’s likely that this episode’s main impact will be to highlight the ridiculous, convoluted, corporate structure of the world’s most valuable private company. I wonder if investors may opt against investing more until this structure is tidied up, with the for-profit entity controlled by investors, and not the nonprofit, with ` investors receiving an ownership stake as well.</p> Anthropic bans AI from job applications

 実際のセッションの概要：AIメタバース時代のアイデンティティ 対談メモ 



 概要 



 
 イベント名: デジタルスペースカンファレンス2025の一環 



 日時: 2025年2月27日 



 場所: 東京ミッドタウン（現地）およびYouTubeライブ配信 



 出演者:

 崎村夏彦氏（OpenID Foundation理事長） 
 
 



 テーマ: AIメタバース時代のアイデンティティ 
 



 主要ポイント 



 1. メタバースの現状と可能性 



 
 メタバース環境の説明:
 
 VRゴーグルとフェイストラッカー等を使用した没入型体験 



 物理的制約を超えた活動が可能（サイズ変更、重力無効化など） 



 実際の書斎のような環境をVR上につくり、その中でも様々な活動が可能 



 Meta Quest 3s等の低価格ヘッドセットの登場により普及が加速 



 「魔法が使える世界」として例えられる（瞬間移動、物の生成など） 
 
 



 VRの技術的利点:
 
 光学的には遠くを見る状態になるため、目の疲れが少ない 



 物理的な制約にとらわれない創造性 



 複数のアバターを使い分け、異なる自己表現が可能 
 
 



 日本のVR人口:
 
 過去1年で約倍増 



 世界的に見ても日本人ユーザーの成長の割合が高い 
 
 
 



 2. デジタルアイデンティティと複数人格（分人） 



 
 アバターの種類と選択理由:
 
 人間型アバターは現実との近さで没入感を求める人が選択 



 ファンタジー系は現実では表現できない特性を求める人が選択 



 時間経過と共に人間型が減少し多様なアバターが増加傾向 
 
 



 デュアル・アイデンティティ:
 
 約57%のユーザーがバーチャルIDと現実の自分を意図的に分けている 



 分ける理由：偏見を避ける、現実と仮想を区別したい 



 公開する理由：ネットワーク拡大、現実と仮想の繋がりを求める 
 
 



 「分人（ぶんじん）経済」の概念:
 
 一人の人間が複数の人格・アイデンティティで活動する経済構造
 
 ちなみに、2011年に発行されたISO/IEC 24760-1ではすでに人々がコンテキストごとのアイデンティティを使い分けるとして、identity と partial identity を同義語として定義している。 
 
 



 現在は約13%がVR内のアイデンティティをメインと考え、27%が将来メイン化を望む 



 アイデンティティ切り替えによる自己表現と心理的効果 
 
 
 



 3. デジタルアイデンティティとプライバシーの課題 



 
 IdP（Identity Provider）の役割:
 
 オンライン認証の標準化（OpenID Connect等） 



 コンテキスト毎の適切なアイデンティティ管理 



 「混ぜるな危険」の原則：異なるアイデンティティは分離すべき 
 
 



 現在の制度的課題:
 
 バーチャルアイデンティティでの経済活動の困難さ（確定申告、金融取引など） 



 プライバシー保護と本人確認のバランス 



 全方位的アイデンティティの強制が問題 



 理想は「コンテキストごとの関係性に応じたアイデンティティの使い分け」 
 
 



 解決策の方向性:
 
 関係者に見える情報を必要最小限にする仕組み 



 事業者別識別子を国税庁にわたして税務用アイデンティティ（識別子はマイナンバー）に変換して処理する仕組み 



 パーソナルAIによる自動処理の可能性 
 
 
 



 4. 日本の可能性と今後の展望 



 
 日本の優位性:
 
 クリエイティブ活動への低いバリア（同人文化等） 



 VTuber文化やメタバース活動への高い受容性 



 メディアでのバーチャル存在の可視性が高い 
 
 



 今後の展望:
 
 技術的には実現可能な仕組みの社会実装 



 立法・行政への働きかけの必要性〜それには選挙民の声が必要 



 高齢化社会における新たな社会参加の形態 



 IDの仕組みの抜本的見直しによる新たな経済発展 
 
 
 



 結論 



<p>メタバースにおける複数アイデンティティ（分人）は技術的に既に可能だが、それを経済活動や社会制度と結びつけるための実装と法制度の発展が必要。日本はVR文化への親和性が高く、この分野でリーダーシップをとる可能性がある。メタバースを通じて「より自分らしく生きる」ための環境整備が今後の課題となる。</p>

Use the code PRAGMATIC to get one month free.</p><p>• <a href="http://augmentcode.com/pragmatic">Augment Code</a> — AI coding assistant that pro engineering teams love</p><p>—</p> In This Episode <p>How do you architect a live streaming system to deal with more load than any similar system has dealt with before? Today, we hear from an architect of such a system: Ashutosh Agrawal, formerly Chief Architect of JioCinema (and currently Staff Software Engineer at Google DeepMind.) In May 2023, JioCinema set the live-streaming world record, serving 32 million concurrent viewers tuning in to the finale of Indian Premier League (a cricket game.)</p><p>We take a deep dive into video streaming architecture, tackling the complexities of live streaming at scale (at tens of millions of parallel streams) and the challenges engineers face in delivering seamless experiences. We talk about the following topics:</p><p>• How large-scale live streaming architectures are designed</p><p>• Tradeoffs in optimizing performance</p><p>• Early warning signs of streaming failures and how to detect them</p><p>• Why capacity planning for streaming is SO difficult</p><p>• The technical hurdles of streaming in APAC regions</p><p>• Why Ashutosh hates APMs (Application Performance Management systems)</p><p>• Ashutosh’s advice for those looking to improve their systems design expertise</p><p>• And much more!</p>     Takeaways <p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p>1. The architecture behind live streaming systems is surprisingly logical. In the episode, Ashutosh explains how the live streaming system works, starting from the physical cameras on-site, through the production control room (PCR), streams being sliced-and-diced, and the HLS protocol (HTTP Live Streaming) used.</p><p>2. There are a LOT of tradeoffs you can play with when live streaming! The tradeoffs between server load, latency, server resources vs client caching are hard decisions to make. Want to reduce the server load? Serve longer chunks to clients, resulting in fewer requests per minute, per client… at the expense of clients potentially lagging more behind. This is just one of many possible decisions to make.</p><p>3. At massive video streaming scale, capacity planning can start a year ahead! It was surprising to hear how Ashutosh had to convince with telecoms and data centers to invest more in their server infrastructure, so they can handle the load, come peak viewership months later. This kind of challenge will be nonexistent for most of us engineers/ Still, it’s interesting to consider that when you are serving a scale that’s not been done before, you need to worry about the underlying infra!</p><p>4. “Game day” is such a neat load testing concept. The team at Jio would simulate “game day” load months before the event. They did tell teams when the load test will start: but did not share anything else! Preparing for a “Game day” test is a lot of work, but it can pay off to find parts of the system that shutter under extreme load.</p> The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode <p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architect-archetypes">Software architect archetypes</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/engineering-leadership-skillset-overlaps">Engineering leadership skill set overlaps</a></p><p>• <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/software-architecture-with-grady-booch">Software architecture with Grady Booch</a></p> Timestamps <p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=0s">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=88s">01:28</a>) The world record-breaking live stream and how support works with live events</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=357s">05:57</a>) An overview of streaming architecture</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=1308s">21:48</a>) The differences between internet streaming and traditional television.l</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=1346s">22:26</a>) How adaptive bitrate streaming works</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=1530s">25:30</a>) How throttling works on the mobile tower side</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=1666s">27:46</a>) Leading indicators of streaming problems and the data visualization needed</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=1863s">31:03</a>) How metrics are set</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2018s">33:38</a>) Best practices for capacity planning</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2150s">35:50</a>) Which resources are planned for in capacity planning</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2230s">37:10</a>) How streaming services plan for future live events with vendors</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2461s">41:01</a>) APAC specific challenges</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2688s">44:48</a>) Horizontal scaling vs. vertical scaling</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2770s">46:10</a>) Why auto-scaling doesn’t work</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2850s">47:30</a>) Concurrency: the golden metric to scale against</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2897s">48:17</a>) User journeys that cause problems</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=2999s">49:59</a>) Recommendations for learning more about video streaming</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=3071s">51:11</a>) How Ashutosh learned on the job</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=3321s">55:21</a>) Advice for engineers who would like to get better at systems</p><p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXJ3S3T3xJY&amp;t=3610s">1:00:10</a>) Rapid fire round</p> A summary of the conversation  The Live Streaming Pipeline   <p>The journey of a live stream starts with the cameras at the event’s venue. These cameras are connected by fiber to a Production Control Room (PCR).</p>  <p>In the PCR, a director selects which camera feeds to use, much like in a movie production.</p>    <p>Source feed (or production feed) is then sent to a contribution encoder. This encoder compresses the high-bandwidth source feed to a more manageable size.</p>  <p>The compressed feed is then transmitted to the cloud using a private peer-to-peer link.</p>    <p>Distribution encoder: prepares the stream in various formats for end-user consumption, such as HLS and DASH.</p>  <p>Over 100 stream variants can be generated for various devices – and up to 500 (!) when different languages are included.</p>    <p>Orchestrator: the one managing the pipeline, from the contribution encoding to the cloud infrastructure. The orchestrator decides which endpoints to push to, the configuration of the distribution encoder, and the CDN endpoints.</p>  <p>Playback URLs: generated by the orchestrator. URLs are specific to the device and format being used.</p>    <p>When a user clicks play, a separate playback system takes over. This system verifies user authorization, deals with encryption, and handles Digital Rights Management (DRM). The playback system then provides the client app with an encrypted URL to stream the content.</p>  <p>Live streaming systems are more complex than Video on Demand (VOD) systems because of the need to manage multiple real-time streams and user authentication and authorization for those streams, all while keeping latency low.</p>   Content Delivery   <p>Content delivery relies on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).</p>  <p>The core technology used is HLS or DASH, where the video is broken down into segments.</p>  <p>HLS uses a master manifest file (e.g., master.m3u8) that lists different video quality levels. Each quality level refers to a child manifest.</p>  <p>Child manifests list individual video segments. These segments are typically between four to six seconds long.</p>  <p>The client player requests a child manifest every segment duration and the segments that it lists.</p>    <p>CDN: works at the segment level rather than at a millisecond level.</p>  <p>Correctly setting up CDN configurations, such as the Time To Live (TTL) values for the cached segments, is crucial to ensure a smooth stream without stale data.</p>    <p>Latency is introduced at various stages of the live-streaming process. This includes encoding, network transmission, and client-side buffering.</p>  <p>Encoding techniques: using a look-back period, or Group of Pictures (GOP) are used to achieve more efficient compression. The GOP might be 1, ,2 or 4 seconds long.</p>  <p>Client-side buffering is used to give a smoother streaming experience, even if there are small network issues. This means the user might be watching the stream a few seconds behind the real-time live point.</p>  <p>There are trade-offs between latency, smooth playbac,k and infrastructure demands. Reducing the segment duration increases calls to the CDN, impacting infrastructure needs.</p>  <p>Adaptive bitrate streaming is used to adjust the video quality in response to the user's network conditions.</p>  <p>The client-side player measures the download speed and chooses an appropriate video quality level, matching the user's network capacity.</p>  <p>If the network speed slows down, the client can switch to a lower-quality video (e.g., from 720p to 240p).</p>  <p>The server can also degrade the user's stream by limiting the number of available video quality options, for example during very high load. The server can also adjust the segment length in response to system load.</p>    <p>The client player is always starting playback a few seconds behind the live point, to avoid any interruption in playback if a segment is missed.</p>  <p>If a segment is missed on a TV, the TV will continue playing at the live point. However, on the internet, the client is using a buffer and will try to avoid missing a segment.</p>   Monitoring, Metrics, and Scaling   <p>Monitoring is based on leading and trailing indicators.</p>  <p>Leading indicators help to identify potential problems in realtime. Examples include buffer time and playback failure rates. These leading indicator metrics are given priority in the system.</p>  <p>Trailing indicators are used to perform a detailed analysis of issues after they occur.</p>  <p>Client-side metrics are collected and quickly processed by the server in less than a minute or sometimes within 30 seconds.</p>  <p>Server-side metrics, such as bandwidth, the number of requests, and latency, are also tracked.</p>  <p>The frequency of data collection is adjusted based on the system load. When there is higher traffic, the amount of data collected is sampled to manage the volume of data collected and processed.</p>    <p>Capacity planning is a very complex process involving infrastructure, network, and power, and is started at the end of the prior year, for the next year.</p>  <p>Capacity planning involves coordination with several infra providers to make sure they can scale their infrastructure for the events.</p>  <p>The planning focuses on metrics such as compute, RAM, disk, and network usage. The main metric that becomes the limiting factor is vCPUs.</p>    <p>Cloud resources are not infinite at the scale required for major live events. There is a finite amount of resources in a given location – at this scale of streaming, that is!</p>  <p>Providers need to purchase real estate, install links, and deploy servers.</p>  <p>Horizontal scaling is preferred for compute resources as it is easy to add boxes to the pool.</p>  <p>Databases and caches are scaled preemptively to avoid the need to scale them on the fly during events.</p>    <p>Auto-scaling is not effective for live events because it is too slow to respond to the rapid changes in traffic. Custom scaling systems are preferred.</p>  <p>The custom scaling system uses a concurrency metric, that is the number of users watching the stream, to scale services. All systems are scaled against a common concurrency metric.</p>  <p>The custom scaler also looks at user journeys, such as when users press the back button and return to the home page. This can cause a spike in traffic to the home page API.</p>     APAC-specific live streaming challenges   <p>Mobility is a significant challenge because most users in India watch live streams on mobile devices and are often on the move. This means that users are constantly switching between cell towers.</p>  <p>Battery consumption is also a key factor. Video streaming can quickly drain mobile phone batteries.</p>  <p>The video profile, polling frequency, and encoding algorithms are often chosen to reduce battery consumption.</p>    <p>“Game day simulation”: something Jio did to simulate peak load conditions.</p>  <p>Involved in generating synthetic traffic and the teams needed to scale systems and follow operational protocols in response.</p>  <p>The teams did not have access to the traffic dashboard, so the traffic patterns were unknown to the teams.</p>     Advice for engineers to become better architects   <p>Understand this: anything that can fail, will fail. Overconfidence in systems can lead to problems! Most people underestimate or overlook the potential failure modes.</p>  <p>Look at every aspect of your system including configurations and code as even the smallest things can cause problems.</p>    <p>Detailed metrics and measurements are vital. Both to see potential problems and to be able to debug effectively.</p>  <p>Ensure you are measuring metrics correctly. For example, response time should be measured from when the request is queued, not when it enters the processing function.</p>    <p>Do not rely too heavily on APMs. It is better to understand the low-level details and measure and fine-tune every aspect of your code.</p>  <p>To learn more about video encoding: look up documentation on GitHub and online. Look for resources going into how image compression is done, and how images are turned into video.</p>  <p>Most of the learning happens on the job. There isn't a lot of public information about problems at this kind of scale!

 <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13a67322-b0fc-482d-aff0-740f283912fe_1792x1024.heic">          </a> <p>Access management is seen by many business leaders as primarily a means of protecting and securing computer systems. Important, but of secondary importance to the business. But as computer systems come to intermediate almost every interaction the business has with employees, contractors, partners, and customers, dynamic authorization should be seen as a strategic business enabler. Investing in a robust, flexible, and pervasive authorization infrastructure can drive revenue growth, operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation.</p> Reducing Operational Costs <p>Manually managing access using rigid, static authorization models like ACLs and groups is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Organizations that rely on static methods often have employees who are dedicated to managing permissions for employees and others. These employees also perform manual audits, track down problems, and manage groups. As the organization grows, these processes become more complex—scaling superlinearly due to interactions in the system.</p><p>Dynamic authorization automates many of these access control decisions, reducing the need for manual intervention. This has several benefits:</p>  <p>Lower administrative overhead—eliminating the need for manually managing permissions and groups reduces administrative costs.</p>  <p>Reduced risk of over-permissioning—accounts with permissions they no longer need are the source of many costly security breaches.</p>  <p>Reduced security insurance premiums—many organizations buy costly insurance for security breaches and ransomware. Better authorization practices and systems can reduce premiums.</p>  <p>Fewer support tickets for access problems—tickets that require IT to drop what they’re doing to sort out a permissioning problem take these critical employees away from work that advances the organization’s products and services.</p>  <p>Improved onboarding and offboarding efficiency—dynamic authorization can ensure new employees or contractors have all the access they need on day one and lose it as soon as they leave.</p>  <p>Improved operational efficiency gives the organization the freedom to explore and grow instead of constantly battling access management problems.</p> Enabling Business Agility and Innovation <p>As more and more business is conducted online, organizations are finding that it’s vital to quickly react to changing business needs. Whether an organization is launching a new product, expanding into new markets, reacting to new regulatory requirements, or enabling new partnerships, being able to flexibly adapt to emerging requirements and support innovation is table stakes for successful organizations.</p><p>As we’ve discussed, static authorization methods require manual changes to lists and groups to increase or decrease access to systems. For example, a financial services firm that is employing external auditors for compliance reviews must grant access for the duration of the engagement. A dynamic authorization system makes this as easy as a policy change. Even that might not be required if authorization policies have been written so as to anticipate this kind of need.</p><p>New products often require custom code to support authorization requirements for customers and administrators. A workforce management service provider launching a new employee onboarding product must ensure that customers can properly authorize varying access levels for their employees to administer and manage the service securely. A dynamic authorization system can be integrated with the new product, allowing developers to build in the right authorization controls without writing custom authorization code.</p> Improving Customer Experience <p>The compelling features of modern SaaS applications, marketplaces, and collaborative services depend on carefully controlling access. In these platforms, dynamic authorization isn’t just for security; it also enhances the user experience and provides enhanced revenue opportunities.</p><p>For example, platforms like Google Docs, Dropbox, and SmugMug all allow their customers to share content with specific people or groups. Dynamic authorization makes this functionality possible.</p><p>Or consider multi-tenant SaaS companies like Workday or Salesforce. Fine-grained authorization allows these companies to isolate customer data while simultaneously allowing granular access within each tenant that follows complex rules. These companies can’t build a single access management system because each tenant requires different access controls depending on their organization, regulatory environment, and internal access policies. Dynamic authorization lets them more easily meet customer needs.</p><p>Finally, many online businesses offer different features to different users depending on subscription levels. Dynamic authorization policies allow this to be done without custom code and give the business flexibility to add or modify subscription levels and features without changing the underlying code.</p> Strengthening Security and Compliance <p>Using dynamic authorization for improved security and regulatory compliance provides several business advantages. Industries like finance, healthcare, and government are heavily regulated. The regulations require organizations to enforce least privilege access, ensure auditability, and dynamically adjust access based on employee roles and changing risk conditions. Organizational benefits from using dynamic authorization include decreased compliance risk, better employee experience, fewer workarounds that introduce security problems, and reduced overall cost.</p> Competitive Differentiation <p>Using dynamic authorization inside products gives organizations a competitive edge by offering a more secure, flexible, and user-friendly product.</p><p>For example, a B2B SaaS company with a product built with fine-grained access control can better attract large enterprise customers who demand flexible, yet secure features. A financial services company that lets customers dynamically set transaction limits based on varying risk signals allows them to reduce fraud while maintaining a rich user experience. A collaboration tool that offers flexible, secure content sharing beats out competitors who use more rigid, static sharing models.</p><p>Organizations can more easily respond to competitor product changes when access management is as simple as a policy change. And dynamic authorization provides these benefits without developers having to write custom code.</p> A Business Necessity <p>The preceding sections offer multiple examples of how dynamic authorization goes well beyond enhanced IT security. Organizations that embrace dynamic authorization gain enhanced operational efficiency through automation, increased business agility to more easily pursue new opportunities, stronger security and compliance with less overhead, and better customer experiences that drive customer engagement and revenue.</p><p>In the era of multi-tenant, AI-enhanced, SaaS applications, dynamic authorization is essential for organizations to securely scale and effectively compete. Failing to adopt better access management technologies and mechanisms puts organizations at risk of losing their competitive advantage.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a>Octopus busy approving things</a> from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: Draw a picture of an octopus wearing an officials hat with each arm holding stamps that say either "allow" or "deny".

<p>Bitcoin failed.  J.P. Koning notes in <a href="https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2025/02/the-end-of-el-salvadors-bitcoin.html">The end of El Salvador’s bitcoin payments experiment</a>:</p>

  <code>But here was a government that was going to champion the stuff, nullifying all of the headwinds against bitcoin in one stroke! The government meddling hypothesis would be put to test.

The Salvadoran government used a combination of sticks and carrots to kick-start adoption. First, let's list the carrots. The capital gains tax on bitcoin was set to zero to remove the hassle of buying stuff with bitcoin. The government also built a bitcoin payments app, Chivo, for all El Salvadoreans to use. (Chivo also supports U.S. dollar payments.) Anyone who downloaded Chivo and transacted with bitcoin would receive a $30 bitcoin bonus—that's a lot of money in El Salvador. Gas stations offered $0.20 off of a gallon of gas for customers who paid with the app. People could also use Chivo to pay their taxes with bitcoin.

The biggest carrot was zero-transaction fees. Any payment conducted with Chivo was free, as was converting bitcoins held in the Chivo app into U.S. dollars and withdrawing cash at Chivo ATMs. These Chivo ATMs were rolled out across El Salvador and in the U.S., too, to encourage the nascent U.S.-to-El Salvador bitcoin remittance route. Bitcoin ATMs are usually incredibly pricey to use, but in El Salvador the government would eat all the transaction fees. What a fantastic deal.

As for the stick, Bukele introduced a forced-tender rule. Beginning in 2021, businesses were required to accept the orange coin or be punished. This was costly for them to comply with. They would have to update point of sale software, signage, train employees, and set up new processes for handling bitcoins post-sale.

By all rights, this combination of sticks and carrots should have led to a flourishing of bitcoin payments. But it didn't.
</code> 
 

<p>Koning concludes:</p>

  <code>The saddest thing about El Salvador's bitcoin experiment is that all sorts of time and resources have been wasted. El Salvador is not a rich country. The money spent on building and operating Chivo, compliance by businesses, bitcoin signage, and subsidies could have been better deployed on more important things like health and education.  One hopes that other countries learn from this experience and avoid going down the same route that El Salvador did.

<p>A few years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook were known as places where – inside certain organizations – some engineers could earn large sums of money for doing comparatively little work, and wile away the work week waiting for their large new joiner equity to vest over four years. This chill approach is what the “rest” in rest-and-vest refers to, which was a popular phrase at the time for it. These places also had many teams where work was laid back, and it was possible to “coast” and get by doing relatively little.</p><p>In 2017, Business Insider interviewed several such folks and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/rest-and-vest-millionaire-engineers-who-barely-work-silicon-valley-2017-7">wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Business Insider talked to about a half a dozen people with direct knowledge of the rest-and-vest culture. Some were "fat cats" themselves. Some were hiring managers who tried to lure these folks back to the world of productivity. Many acknowledged that resting and vesting was a common, hush-hush practice at their own companies. Internally, these people are often referred to as "coasters."</p><p>Their lives counter the other reality for many in the tech world: long work hours and pressure for workers to pledge unrelenting devotion to their companies and jobs above all else.”</p></blockquote><p>A culture of lenient performance management at the biggest tech businesses contributed to laidback work patterns; I talked with managers at the likes of Google and Microsoft at the time who were frustrated that the system made it hard to manage out folks who were visibly checked out, and were hard to motivate to do even the bare minimum work.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and there are signs that Big Tech employers are being tougher than ever in performance management, and any tolerance of “rest and vest” culture is history. This article covers:</p>  <p>Meta: first performance-based mass layoffs. Nearly 3,700 people have been dismissed as ‘low performers’; it’s the first time that another reason wasn’t given for layoffs by the social media giant.</p>  <p>Microsoft: performance-based firings are back. Employees terminated on the spot for performance reasons, without warning, and some don’t get severance.</p>  <p>Evolution of Microsoft’s performance management. The Windows maker has been brutal in performance management before: its old stack ranking system was unpopular for close to two decades.</p>  <p>Even without stack ranking, there’s still bucketing. Stack ranking fell out of favor years ago, but bucketing is still how performance reviews work.</p>  <p>Why now? The end of zero rates, a cooling job market, and more. Takeaways from recent mass layoffs.</p>  <p>Companies that always had high performance expectations. Some Big Tech businesses have always had strict performance standards. For example, within Amazon, Netflix, and NVIDIA, little will change.</p>  <p>Related to this article is our two-part deepdive into <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/performance-calibrations">How performance calibrations are done at tech companies</a>.</p> 1. Meta: first performance-based mass layoffs <p>Meta did no mass layoffs for its first 18 years of its existence, until November 2022 when it <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-32">let go 13% of staff</a>. Back then, there were business reasons. I <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-scoop-32">wrote at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Meta’s revenue is simply not growing fast enough. In Meta’s Historic Growth Challenge, I suggested that just by allowing attrition to slightly reduce headcount expenses, Meta could catch up with profitability. However, what I did not account for was how attrition was likely too slow to wait for, and not fully within the company’s control. Layoffs, however, are.</p><p>The stock price pressure likely became too much. Meta’s stock price dipped under $100 for the first time on Thursday, 27 October, a week before layoffs. The stock dropped by 26% that day, which was the biggest one-day fall, after the company forecast weaker-than-expected revenue growth for Q4 2022. (...)</p><p>Zuck has summarized these layoffs:</p><p>“We’ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We’re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won’t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I’ve also made the hard decision to let people go.”</p></blockquote><p>Six months later in early 2023, the company <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/108835985/meta-a-second-round-of-layoffs-and-restructuring-to-come">reduced headcount</a> by another 11%, letting go 10,000 people The reasoning was that it had overhired during the pandemic years of 2020-2021, and was too bloated. The layoffs flattened the organization and boosted efficiency.</p><p>That was two years ago, and since then Meta has become more efficient: it generates more revenue ($164B per year) and profit ($62B) than ever before, and its value is at an all-time high of $1.8 trillion dollars.</p><p>It’s in this context that Meta announces its first-ever performance-based mass layoffs. Five percent of staff are expected to be let go, starting this week with around 3,700 people. An internal email from Mark Zuckerberg explains why, as reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/14/meta-targeting-lowest-performing-employees-in-latest-round-of-layoffs.html">by CNBC</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025.</p><p>We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts.”</p></blockquote><p>This clarity that it’s “low performers” who are being laid off, is new. The large mass layoffs of 2022-23 were justified differently. Of course, low performers are at risk of being let go in most circumstances. However, in Meta’s previous layoffs, plenty of high-performers were also cut who worked in teams seen as bloated <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/profit-centers-cost-centers">cost centers</a>, or targeted for sharp headcount drops.</p><p>While these cuts are unfortunate, Meta at least is <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/meta-begins-performance-based-layoffs-143643090.html">offering</a> generous severance to those impacted: 16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for each year of service.</p> 2. Microsoft: performance-based firings are back <p>Meta isn’t the only tech giant terminating employees based on performance concerns; Microsoft is doing the same  — except on an individual basis. Also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-based-job-cuts-have-started-termination-letters-2025-1">from Business Insider</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Microsoft has started performance-based job cuts, according to termination letters viewed by Business Insider.<br><br>Microsoft is taking a stronger stance on performance management like its competitors, and managers at the company have spent the past few months evaluating employees all the way up to level 80, one of its highest levels.”</p></blockquote><p>One of several termination letters was reported by Business Insider. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>"The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include that your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position… You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft."</p></blockquote><p>Just to repeat, performance-related firing is commonplace, but what’s different here is how short and quick the process is. Previously, most of Big Tech followed a standard process for workers seen as in need of improvement:</p>  <p>Feedback from the manager, often at a biannual performance review</p>  <p>Performance improvement plan (PIP) which formalises why someone is not meeting performance expectations, and how to succeed with the plan</p>  <p>Dismissal upon failure to clear the PIP. Big Tech has been known for generous severance packages which exceed the legal minimum</p>  <p>But now, Microsoft seems to be skipping PIPs and also not offering severance in some cases. This is unusual, given how differently the tech giant had treated employees since Satya Nadella became CEO. It also feels unusually petty to cancel severance packages for those affected, especially as Microsoft is reporting record profits. Is it a message to low performers to expect nothing from the company?</p><p>Microsoft getting “cutthroat” in its performance-management is also out of character, as it was Nadella who introduced a more lenient performance management approach, back in 2014.</p> 3. Evolution of Microsoft’s performance management <p>Between the 1990s and 2013, Microsoft used a stack ranking system for performance management, which wasn’t advertised to employees until the mid-2000s – although many knew about Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve">“vitality curve”</a> for ranking engineers and managers. Under this, workers high on the curve got outsized bonuses and pay rises, and those low down the curve; well, they got managed out.</p><p>In 2004, Mini Microsoft (an anonymous employee at the company, blogging in the public) wrote a post <a href="https://minimsft.blogspot.com/2004/07/microsoft-stack-rank-as-popularity.html">explaining</a> how the then still-secretive stack ranking worked:</p><blockquote><p>“Then along came a new lead. Her feedback [to me was], "You've got to increase your team visibility so that you can do better in the stack rank meeting."</p><p>The what-rank? She said it slower as if it would help me to divine what the heck she was talking about. Then she got up and gave me the stack rank lesson and I got to learn about how the team is divided into columns of high, medium, and low folks and then each column has a person by person relative ranking, all those positions negotiated by the leads putting their people up on the whiteboard and then arguing the merits of which report belongs above which other reports.</p><p>She said they set the context of their decisions by asking a question like, "Okay, if the team were on a sinking boat and we had to decide who we would put on the life-boats, who would it be?" Up to that point, my ass was next in line for the boat but still going down with the ship.”</p></blockquote><p>From 2004 – mostly thanks to this blog post – stack ranking was no longer a secret, but it wasn’t until 2011 that then-CEO Stever Ballmer acknowledged its existence in an internal email, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoftpri0/2014835496_microsoft_employees_will_get_pay_raises.html">writing</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Each rating at each level will now have set compensation tied to the rating.</p><p>These ratings will be based on the results you accomplished during the review period (assessed against your commitments), how you accomplished them, and your proven capability. Ratings will be a simple 1-5 system with relative performance being assessed across common peer groups.”</p></blockquote><p>The buckets were pre-defined, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve">supposedly</a> as 20% (top performers), 20% (good performers), 40% (average), 13% (below average), and 7% (poor performers).</p><p>I worked at Microsoft starting in 2012, the year after the existence of the stack ranking system became public knowledge. Knowing the distribution made me hope for a grade of 1-2, which would have meant my manager saw me as the “top 40%” within the team. I ended up getting a “3” in 2013, which I was disappointed with, as I interpreted it as being in the bottom 20th to 60th percentile.</p><p>Later, I talked with a HR person, who told me that nobody at Microsoft was ever happy with their grades:</p>  <p>Those getting a “1” (the highest rating for the top 20%) think they deserve it. Many feel entitled to it, more than they’re happy to achieve it</p>  <p>Everyone on a 2 to a 5 is disappointed to different extents</p>  <p>Stever Ballmer’s departure spelt the end of the stack ranking system. Shortly after Ballmer announced his retirement in August 2013, the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303460004579193951987616572">announced</a> the system was also being retired, effective immediately in November 2013. There are a few possible reasons why Stack Ranking went extinct:</p><p>1. Office politics ruled Microsoft. From the mid-2000s, it was increasingly clear that internal politics was more important than building products customers loved.</p><p>Microsoft was blindsided by the 2007 launch of the iPhone, and the launch of Android the next year. It took three more years to finally launch a competitive device – the Windows Phone in 2011. By then, iPhone and Android had captured the bulk of the smartphone market.</p><p>In 2011, Google software engineer and cartoonist Manu Cornet drew <a href="https://goomics.net/62">a cartoon</a> about how he perceived Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Oracle. This was what how he represented the Xbox maker:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc216f8-4425-4f9f-9fea-af7b9c0b0be3_666x436.png">          </a>Source: <a href="https://goomics.net/62">Manu Cornet</a> <p>This image went viral, even though Manu never intended it as a big joke in his comic strip, as he explains in <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/manu">The Man Behind the Tech Comics</a>. The intended target of the joke was Oracle, but his image of Microsoft captured a widely perceived truth.</p><p>Back then, there was close to zero collaboration between divisions at Microsoft, which were thousands of employees in size; like Windows Office, Server, Xbox, and Skype. I experienced the lack of collaboration – to the point of hostility – first-hand. In late 2013, my team was building Skype for Web, which we positioned as a competitor to Google Hangouts. We had a problem, though: in order to start a video or voice call, users needed to download a plugin which contained the required video codecs. We noticed Google Hangouts did the same on Internet Explorer and Firefox, but not on Chrome because the plugin was bundled with the browser for a frictionless experience.</p><p>My team decided we had to offer the same frictionless experience on Microsoft’s latest browser, Edge, which was in development at the time. After weeks of back-and-forth, the team politely and firmly rejected bundling our plugin into the new Microsoft browser. The reason? Their KPI was to minimize the download size of the browser, and helping us would not help them reach that goal.</p><p>It was a maddening experience. Microsoft could not compete with the likes of Google due to internal dysfunction like this; with teams and individuals focused on their own targets at the expense of the greater good for the company and users.</p><p>2. Stack ranking pinpointed as the core of the problem. In 2012, Vanity Fair published <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer">Microsoft’s lost decade</a>, which said:</p><blockquote><p>“At the center of the cultural problems was a management system called “stack ranking.” Every current and former Microsoft employee I interviewed—every one—cited stack ranking as the most destructive process inside of Microsoft, something that drove out untold numbers of employees. (...)</p><p>The system—also referred to as “the performance model,” “the bell curve,” or just “the employee review”—has, with certain variations over the years, worked like this: every unit was forced to declare a certain percentage of employees as top performers, then good performers, then average, then below average, then poor.</p><p>In the end, the stack-ranking system crippled the ability to innovate at Microsoft, executives said. “I wanted to build a team of people who would work together and whose only focus would be on making great software,” said Bill Hill, the former manager. “But you can’t do that at Microsoft.”</p></blockquote><p>3. Investor and board pressure. By 2013, Microsoft’s stock had been flat for about 12 years. It was clear that cultural change was needed to turn business performance around, and removing the hated stack ranking system was one of the easiest ways for the leadership team to show that change was afoot.</p><p>4. Ballmer’s exit. Several leaders including Head of HR Lisa Brummel were never in favor of stack ranking, as Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-just-killed-its-controversial-stack-ranking-employee-review-system-2013-11?">reported</a> at the time. With Ballmer gone, executives could push decisions that would’ve previously been vetoed, before a new CEO took the helm.</p><p>Satya Nadella replaced stack ranking with a more collaborative performance review system. As CEO, he recognized the cultural problems Microsoft had. In his 2017 book, Hit Refresh, he recalled the pre-2014 times:</p><blockquote><p>"Innovation was being replaced by bureaucracy. Teamwork was being replaced by internal politics. We were falling behind."</p></blockquote><p>A new performance review system attempted to address the problems, rating employees in three areas:</p>  <p>Individual impact</p>  <p>Contributing to others’ success</p>  <p>Leveraging the work of others</p>  <p>Microsoft also got rid of its vitality curve (the stack ranking system), starting from 2014. The changes resulted in a different performance review process, where individual impact carried less weight. In 2022, Microsoft even <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-microsoft-measures-employee-thriving-not-engagement">started to measure</a> how many of its employees said they were “thriving”, which it defined as being “energized and empowered to do meaningful work.” Note that this was at the peak of the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market">hottest job market in tech</a>, when attrition spiked across the sector, and even Big Tech needed new ways to retain people.</p><p>Signs that performance management was changing again were visible in 2023, when last September, Microsoft <a href="https://www.hrkatha.com/global-hr-news/microsoft-introduces-secret-performance-rating-system-for-managers/">quietly introduced</a> a new field for managers called “impact designators.” They had to rate the impact of their reports and not disclose this to employees. The ratings determined bonuses and pay rises.</p><p>As a former engineering manager, what surprised me about this lowkey change was not that it happened, but rather that it raises the question of what Microsoft was doing before? “Impact designator” is another name for “multiplier”, used in most tech workplaces. Ahead of performance calibration meetings, managers often know this information and must fit the budget, or can sometimes exceed it. Multipliers are finalized in the calibration which helps for dividing bonus pots, equity refresh, and pay rise budgets.</p><p>So it was a surprise to learn Microsoft operated without managers setting or recommending multipliers for nine years, as part of the performance process.</p> 4. Even without stack ranking, there’s still bucketing <p>The demise of divisive stack ranking was cheered; but in reality, all larger companies still operate ranking frameworks today. At most mid-sized-and-above companies, performance review processes have the explicit goal to identify and reward top performers, and to find low performers and figure out what to do next. We cover the dynamics of the process in a two-part deepdive. <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/performance-calibrations">Performance calibrations at tech companies</a>, including:</p>

<p>This blog shows how to implement a delegated OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange RFC 8693 flow in ASP.NET Core, and has a focus on access token management. It looks at how the OAuth Token Exchange can be implemented and how an application can request delegated access tokens on behalf of a user and another application, providing a seamless and secure access to protected resources using a zero trust strategy.</p>

 ASP.NET Core delegated OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange access token management 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/03/25/asp-net-core-delegated-microsoft-obo-access-token-management-entra-only/">ASP.NET Core delegated Microsoft OBO access token management (Entra only)</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution implements an ASP.NET Core web application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra ID. The web application uses an API protected with a Microsoft Entra ID access token. This API uses another downstream API protected with Duende IdentityServer. The API exchanges the Microsoft Entra ID access token for a new Duende IdentityServer access token using the OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. Both APIs use a user delegated access token. The tokens are persisted on the trusted backend using the IDistributedCache implementation. This can be an in-memory cache or a persistent cache. When using this cache, it is important to automatically renew the access token, if it is missing or invalid.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for delegated downstream API user tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 



 The application must handle a user logout 
 



 Client Implementation (Entra ID API) 



<p>An OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange token request is sent to the Duende IdentityServer using the ApiTokenCacheClient. The service persists the token in a cache per user. The cache is implemented using the IDistributedCache interface.</p>

 Duende IdentityServer implementation 



<p>Duende IdentityServer provides an IExtensionGrantValidator interface to implement the identity server support for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange standard. This service must validate the access token and provide the data to issue a new Duende access token. Other validation checks are required like validating the sub claim which represents the user in the delegated access token. It is important to validate the access token fully. The new access tokens should only be issued for the same user. It is important to use a unique identifier from the access token to read data and issue new data for the user. An email is normally not a good solution for this as users can change their email in some IAM solutions.</p>

<p>I made a video today reflecting on how we manage (or don’t) our energy and how our engagement with digital information complicates our lives. I’m proposing that people consider dialing back their social media consumption to spend time reflecting on their thinking, what we have learned over the past five years, and how we can navigate future challenges with integrity and grace. In the space that is created I am hoping some people will experience ontopoetic synchronicities, conversations with the divine, as we become more intentional about how we direct our consciousness and bodies in this 3D world. I would love to hear back from anyone who gives this a try to see what your experience has been. Life is a stage and we are players. Consider this an unplugged improv opportunity where you get to riff with the quantum. </p>
<p>Words of the day: biosemiotics, memetics, reality tunnel, and metacognition. </p>

 The People of DRCongo Shed Light on the “Heart of Darkness” as Our Media Looks the Other Way 
<blockquote>
<p><a href="mailto:soljacksteve@gmail.com">Steve Soloman</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keeping up with world events, important as it is, can nonetheless be fraught. Any Canadian who wishes to stay informed has seen the coverage: autocratic governments flexing their muscles, personality cults rather than responsible governments and the rule of law being threatened even in well-established democracies. The internal rot of misguided populism and hyper partisanship, challenging as they are, are only the first steps along a very rocky road.</p>
<p>Despite what we see and hear, the news is not all bad. There is a place, little noticed and even less understood by most Canadians, where democracy is growing stronger despite a history of violence and exploitation.</p>
<p>When we think of Africa - if we think of it at all - we picture a continent struggling to overcome its colonial past. Tragically for the people who live there, this image is not entirely wrong; Africa has seen nine military coups since 2020. But like elsewhere youth in Africa are the continent’s hope, and Africa is a very young continent, with an average age in 2023 of just under nineteen. Education levels are rising though progress has been slow, due in part to a largely indifferent West. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), despite almost innumerable setbacks, positive strides are being made and there are valuable lessons to be learned if only we would take note. DRC and its people are working to overcome deplorable handicaps to create a government that is, to borrow a phrase, by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>When DRC does get mentioned, it’s because of either disease or warfare. This is largely due to the nature of the media beast; both what it is and what it isn’t. The media consists of profit-seeking businesses, and like any business it provides us with what it knows, or at least believes, we want. What it’s not is a pacifier ready to soothe our jangled nerves. Simply put, bad news sells. The news we get out of DRC is very much a case in point. There are positive developments, but we won’t read about this in mainstream media, not because of any sort of cover-up but rather out of rational business decisions. Thus democracy is evolving in the midst of a continent deserving of far more attention than it gets.</p>
<p>But before we can get to those positives we need to illustrate the circumstances out of which they have grown. This is really the only way we can appreciate what the people of DRC have suffered and continue to endure in their ongoing and heroic attempts to free themselves and achieve what so many of the rest of us take for granted.</p>
<p>DRC lies at the very centre of the African continent. With an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, it’s the second largest African nation after Algeria. It became a Belgian colony in 1908 but Europeans had ‘discovered’ the country well before that; in 1890 Joseph Conrad spent time there and later used it as the setting for Heart of Darkness. The book is a critique both of Belgian exploitation and an attitude toward Congo, and by extension all of Africa, that persists to this day.</p>
<p>Many of us continue to think of Africa as if it was one big country when in fact it contains fifty-four fully independent nations. Ethnically and culturally it’s at least as diverse as any other continent. In terms of its natural resources, DRC is amongst the wealthiest nations on Earth but its people are amongst the poorest. The Belgian colonizers exploited the country’s rubber reserves and more recently many nations, including Canada, have taken advantage of DRC’s vast quantities of copper, cobalt, zinc, silver, gold, bauxite, uranium and coltan. In all, minerals account for 90 per cent of DRC’s exports. To illustrate just one example, eighty per cent of the world’s supply of coltan comes from DRC and that mineral is in all the cell phones and laptops you and I use every day.</p>
<p>Much of the mining in DRC is referred-to as ‘artisanal’, a euphemism which when put into plain English, means men and children, typically boys, working as miners with no safety gear and little or no equipment of any kind beyond pickaxes. The coltan in our phones and computers has very likely come from one of these ‘artisanal’ mining operations. This is in no way meant to suggest we shouldn’t own these things, only that we should be aware; that we should be ready to take positive steps to give back in some way; to end the exploitation.</p>
<p>DRC officially gained its independence from Belgium on June 30th 1960. But the country was utterly unprepared to run its own affairs since the Belgians had taken no steps to prepare their former colonials for the challenges of self-rule. A republican government was established, with both a President and Prime Minister. Patrice Lumumba, a leader of the independence movement, and the country’s first Prime Minister, was both an African nationalist and a member of the pan-African movement. This meant he supported national self-determination and believed in strengthening bonds between all indigenous Africans and the global African diaspora. He played a major role in taking the nation from colony to independence. But his left-of-centre political views, in the midst of the Cold War, made him dangerous in the eyes of several western nations, particularly the United States.</p>
<p>The independence celebrations were short-lived; within a very few days the new nation was faced with what came to be known as the Congo Crisis. With Belgian support the provinces of Katanga and South Kasai seceded and there was also a revolt by members of the military as Black soldiers were no longer willing to accept orders from white officers. The United Nations was preparing to send troops to aid the government against the secessionists but the Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjold, made a last minute decision not to do so. In response, Lumumba called for assistance from the Soviet Union, which sent ‘military advisors’. The Soviet presence caused a split in the government between Lumumba and the President, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. It was at this point that Joseph-Désiré Mobutu Sese-Seko, a lieutenant-colonel and Lumumba’s chief military advisor, stepped in to break the deadlock by leading a coup-d’etat. Supported by both Belgium and the United States, he expelled the Soviets and established a government that supported his view of Lumumba as a danger to the country. He led a second coup in 1965 that made himself President. About 100,000 people died during this period of political conflict, including Lumumba, who was assassinated on January 17, 1961. Mobutu ruled from 1965 to 1997. In 1971 he changed the country’s name to Zaire. His thirty-year rule also saw European investors expelled and the nationalizing of their companies. He looted the nation’s treasury. In 1990 he agreed to end the ban he had imposed on a multi-party state and formed a transitional government while retaining considerable political power. In 1994 he agreed to the appointment of Kengo Wa Dondo, an advocate for free-market reforms, as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>That same year in neighbouring Rwanda, between April and July, armed groups consisting of Hutu fighters committed genocide against the Tutsi people. Over 800,000 victims, mostly Tutsis, were killed and the violence spread into DRC as small groups of Hutu extremists formed militia groups. Such militias continue to operate in DRC to this day, funded largely by the Rwandan government under the leadership of Paul Kagame. Kagame, who is Tutsi, was a commander of a militia that sought, successfully, to put an end to the genocide. However he later initiated two rebel wars in DRC, the First Congo War, from 1996 to 1997, immediately followed by the Second Congo War of 1998 to 2003. Among horrific atrocities committed was the serial rape and murder of Congolese women. Canada’s Trudeau government, usually so ready to condemn such acts, has remained entirely silent about the continuing actions of the militia groups in DRC. As recently as July 13th of 2024, seventy-two people were killed by armed militia in a village about one hundred kilometres east of the nation’s capital, Kinshasa.</p>
<p>While the equally horrific acts occurring in Ukraine are breathlessly reported within hours, this slaughter in DRC was reported in a Toronto newspaper four days after the event and was buried at the bottom of page five.</p>
<p>Mineral wealth provides the incentive for the ongoing violence. Recent reports indicate that Rwanda’s national army, somewhat ironically named the Rwandan Defence Force, has deployed as many as four thousand soldiers to DRC. Their mission appears to be aiding the militia groups and facilitating the smuggling of minerals into Rwanda. In late January of this year, Rwanda sent even more troops into DRC, in numbers that indicated full-out invasion. Along with a militia group called M23, they captured the capital of DRC’s eastern region, Goma.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s Rwandan-backed militias have taken control of coltan and other mineral-mining operations. The Congolese government estimates that it loses $1 billion (U.S.) each year because of these illegal activities. The Congolese army is fighting to halt these operations but finds itself facing an enemy that is very well armed with modern weapons such as so-called mortar drones. Desertion is also a significant factor, as the militia groups pay their soldiers better wages than DRC can pay. People continue to be forced to flee their homes, a harsh reality in eastern DRC for almost thirty years. This violence has also resulted in severe food shortages as farms are abandoned in areas controlled by militia groups. The only realistic way to put an end to all this would be to confront the Rwandan government directly, with military force if needed. Why this has gone on all this time with no response from the West is a matter for conjecture, though it’s by no means far-fetched to suggest having access to relatively cheap minerals plays a role. A case can also be made that Western governments feel no pressure to act because their citizens are uninformed by media.</p>
<p>DRC has also been plagued by outbreaks of disease. In 1976 the country made headlines due to the outbreak of Ebola, a disease named after a tributary of the Congo River. The Ebola virus was first detected in a village about 110 kilometres from the river but it was decided to name the disease Ebola in order to avoid having the village become forever known as the starting point of this often - though not always - fatal pathogen. There have been subsequent outbreaks that have killed thousands of people. Work to create vaccines began to make progress in 2014. The World Health Organization did much to speed the process and an effective vaccine began to be used in 2016. Recent outbreaks have been quickly brought under control.</p>
<p>There are organizations in the West who lay claim to knowledge of the situation in DRC. Freedom House, a Washington D.C.- based non-profit that assesses how democratic various nations are, continues to list DRC as “not free”. However, a review of current trends suggests that the Freedom House ranking should be reviewed.</p>
<p>In January 2019, when Felix Tshisekedi became President, it marked the first time since independence that the presidency was peacefully transferred from one political party to another. Tshisekedi freed seven hundred political prisoners jailed by his predecessor. Understanding that education is vital to building a free and democratic state, he also invested heavily in schools for DRC’s next generation.</p>
<p>In December 2023 he faced another election, as the country’s constitution requires. Western media tended to focus on claims of voting irregularities that originated mostly with defeated candidates. Voter turnout was 48.8 per cent despite three provinces being unable to safely participate due to ongoing militia violence. That figure marks a small but important increase from the prior election in 2018 when 45.5 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot (voter turnout in the Ontario election of 2022 was forty-three per cent). Tshisekedi was re-elected by a comfortable margin and reports from well-informed sources within DRC state that the majority of Congolais believe the election was run fairly, the results are credible and that the re-elected President had achieved some positive change that ordinary citizens could see for themselves. The really crucial point is this: if the majority of people in DRC see themselves as living in a democracy, how legitimate can it be for outsiders like Freedom House to claim otherwise?</p>
<p>DRC is just one of many countries that has had a long, hard struggle to achieve democracy, and the hard work of maintaining what has been won never stops. The people of that nation have overcome crushing obstacles, and the progress they’ve made continues to be under siege by those both in Africa and abroad who have very different interests.</p>
<p>Democracy doesn’t just happen by itself. It must be fought for and constantly supported by an informed and active electorate. The people of DRC have learned this vital lesson while too many of us in the West appear to have forgotten it.</p>

<p>Polen, das derzeit den Vorsitz im EU-Rat innehat, <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2025/01/2025-01-30-conseil-pl-compromis-reglement-csam.pdf">schlägt eine wichtige Änderung des viel kritisierten EU-Vorschlags zur Chatkontrolle vor</a>: Anstatt die generelle Durchsuchung privater Chats anzuordnen soll die Chatkontrolle wie bisher im Ermessen der Anbieter stehen. Vertreter der EU-Regierungen werden den Vorschlag in der EU-Arbeitsgruppe für Strafverfolgung <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/dokument/XXVIII/EU/9693/imfname_11447708.pdf">am Mittwoch beraten</a>.</p>



<p>“Der neue Vorschlag ist ein Durchbruch und im Kampf um unser digitales Briefgeheimnis ein großer Sprung nach vorn”, kommentiert Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei), ehemaliges Mitglied des Europäischen Parlaments und digitaler Freiheitskämpfer. “Der Vorschlag würde sichere Verschlüsselung schützen und damit die Sicherheit unserer Smartphones. Allerdings blieben drei grundlegende Probleme ungelöst:</p>



<p>1. Massenüberwachung: Selbst wenn Anbieter wie Meta, Microsoft oder Google die Chatkontrolle “freiwillig” praktizieren, ist sie immer noch eine völlig ungezielte und wahllose Massenüberwachung aller privaten Nachrichten über diese Dienste. Nach Angaben der EU-Kommission sind etwa 75 % der Millionen privater Chats, Fotos und Videos, die jedes Jahr von den unzuverlässigen Chatkontrollalgorithmen der Industrie geleakt werden, nicht strafrechtlich relevant und lassen unsere intime Kommunikation in die Hände Unbekannter gelangen, bei denen sie nicht sicher ist und bei denen sie nichts zu suchen hat. Eine ehemalige Richterin des Europäischen Gerichtshofs, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Legal-Opinion-Screening-for-child-pornography-2021-03-04.pdf">Ninon Colneric</a> (S. 34 f.), und der <a href="https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2024-02/24-01-24_opinion_sexuellen_missbrauchs_kindern_internet_de.pdf">Europäische Datenschutzbeauftragte</a> (Abs. 11) haben gewarnt, dass diese wahllose Überwachung gegen unsere Grundrechte verstößt, selbst wenn sie im Ermessen der Anbieter liegt. In Schleswig-Holstein und Bayern sind bereits zwei Klagen gegen diese Praxis anhängig. </p>



<p>Das Europäische Parlament <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/beitraege/chatkontrolle/#epmandat">schlägt einen anderen Ansatz vor</a>: Die Telekommunikationsüberwachung soll verpflichtend angeordnet werden können, aber auf Personen oder Gruppen beschränkt werden, die mit sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch in Verbindung stehen. Das Parlament schlägt außerdem vor, dass die Anbieter ihre Dienste durch eine Reihe von Voreinstellungen, Nachfragen und Warnungen sicherer für junge Menschen gestalten müssen.</p>



<p>2. Digitaler Hausarrest: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 6 könnten Nutzer unter 16 Jahren künftig zu ihrem eigenen Schutz vor sexueller Annäherung alltägliche Apps aus dem App-Store nicht mehr installieren. Dazu gehören Messenger-Apps wie Whatsapp, Snapchat, Telegram oder Twitter, Social-Media-Apps wie Instagram, TikTok oder Facebook, Spiele wie FIFA, Minecraft, GTA, Call of Duty, Roblox, Dating-Apps, Videokonferenz-Apps wie Zoom, Skype, Facetime. Ein solches Mindestalter wäre leicht zu umgehen und würde Jugendliche bevormunden und isolieren, anstatt sie zu stärken.</p>



<p>3. Verbot anonymer Kommunikation: Nach dem von Polen unverändert vorgeschlagenen Artikel 4 (3) wäre es Nutzern künftig nicht mehr möglich, anonyme E-Mail- oder Messenger-Konten einzurichten oder anonym zu chatten, ohne einen Ausweis oder ihr Gesicht vorzeigen zu müssen, wodurch sie identifizierbar würden und das Risiko von Datenlecks entstünde. Dies würde z. B. sensible Chats zum Thema Sexualität, anonyme Pressekommunikation mit Quellen (z. B. Whistleblowern) sowie politische Aktivitäten einschränken.</p>



<p>Alles in allem ist der polnische Vorschlag im Vergleich zu den bisherigen Texten ein großer Fortschritt in Bezug auf unsere Sicherheit im Internet, aber er erfordert noch gravierende Nachbesserungen. Gleichzeitig geht der Vorschlag wahrscheinlich schon zu weit für die Hardliner-Mehrheit der EU-Regierungen und die EU-Kommission, deren Überwachungshunger bisher stets so extrem war, dass sie die Opfer lieber ohne Einigung ganz im Stich lassen als eine verhältnismäßige, gerichtsfeste und politisch mehrheitsfähige Alternative zur Chatkontrolle zu akzeptieren.”</p>

 Elevator Pitch for Quantum Realism 
 
<p>Quantum Realism proposes that the physical universe is not fundamental but instead a virtual construct generated by a self-sustaining quantum network or primal consciousness. The physical phenomena we observe, including space, time, energy and matter, are outputs of this underlying quantum process, more like a computational system where the quantum field serves as the substrate for reality. Unlike classical realism, which treats matter as independent and static, Quantum Realism views the universe as a dynamic, evolving system, continuously shaped by observation and interaction.</p>
<p>This theory aligns with the strange findings of modern physics, such as quantum superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect. These phenomena indicate that reality behaves more like information being processed than a collection of static objects. By grounding itself in the principles of quantum mechanics and information theory, Quantum Realism provides a framework that explains physical laws but also integrates consciousness as an active participant in the unfolding of reality.&nbsp;</p>
 
  How Quantum Realism Differs from Other Theories 
 
<p>Quantum Realism stands apart by uniting consciousness and matter within a single quantum substrate. Classical physics focuses on deterministic interactions of matter, while dualism separates consciousness from the material. Quantum Realism suggests that matter emerges from the consciousness field, which acts as a self-generative, non-physical substrate. This explains phenomena like wave-particle duality and the observer effect, where the act of measurement collapses probabilities into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>In contrast to other simulation theories, which claim an external programmer, Quantum Realism describes a holographic reality that is self-generating, requiring no external creator. The consciousness quantum network acts as both the origin and sustainer of reality, dynamically evolving through recursive feedback loops. By embedding consciousness within this process, Quantum Realism resolves the paradox of how non-physical awareness can influence a seemingly physical world, offering a more integrated perspective than either dualism or materialism.</p>
 
  What Led You to This Investigation? 
 
<p>Stemming from my childhood curiosity of electricity and of light, I started learning the math that was required. It was the whole concept of imaginary numbers that got me questioning reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that light oscillates into a imaginary 4th dimension emerged from the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. I later discovered Imaginary numbers are fundamental to describing oscillatory behavior in wavefunctions, suggesting that light and other quantum phenomena extend beyond the three spatial dimensions we perceive. This mathematical insight led me to consider whether these higher-dimensional oscillations underpin the strange behaviors observed in quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement.</p>
<p>For me this opened a pathway to investigate how higher-dimensional processes might generate the physical universe as a lower-dimensional projection. By focusing on the recursive nature of these oscillations, I began exploring how reality could arise from iterative feedback within a quantum network. This exploration ties into Quantum Realism’s premise that space, time, and matter are emergent constructs, projected from the recursive operations of the quantum field.</p>
 
  The Circle of Values 
 
<p>Everything in the universe oscillates (light waves, matter waves, and even biological rhythms) indicating an underlying recursive principle. This principle, that I refer to as the “Circle of Values,” describes how primal consciousness perpetuates creation through cyclic processes. Each oscillation represents a feedback loop in which information from the quantum field interacts with localized nodes, generating structure and coherence across scales. These cycles are fractal-like, with self-similar patterns appearing at every level of reality, from quantum fluctuations to galactic rotations.</p>
<p>This recursive behavior mirrors the properties of fractal mathematics, where complexity arises from simple iterative rules. In Quantum Realism, the Circle of Values represents consciousness in action, continuously manifesting and sustaining the fabric of reality. By oscillating through states, this process generates not only physical structures but also the informational coherence necessary for life and awareness to emerge, illustrating the very deep interconnection between consciousness and the material world.</p>
 
  Holographic Reality vs. Simulations 
 
<p>A holographic reality differs fundamentally from a simulation in that it requires no external programmer or hardware. Instead, it emerges intrinsically from within the quantum field itself, with every fractal part containing information about the whole. This self-generative nature is supported by quantum entanglement, where particles separated by vast distances remain instantaneously correlated. Such behavior suggests that reality operates like a hologram, where local phenomena reflect an interconnected structure.</p>
<p>In contrast to simulations, which rely on predefined algorithms and external input, a holographic reality evolves dynamically through feedback between consciousness agents and the quantum network. This perspective resolves the apparent separation between observer and observed, as both are integrated within the same system. Quantum Realism states that the universe is not a static construct but a living, self-referential system that adapts and evolves as consciousness interacts with it.</p>
 
  Free Will: Participants or Puppets? 
 
<p>Quantum Realism portrays localized consciousness as an active participant in shaping reality. While physical parameters provide constraints (such as natural laws and probabilities) free will emerges as consciousness influences the collapse of quantum states. The observer effect demonstrates this participatory role, where the act of measurement determines which potential becomes reality. Thus, consciousness is not merely a bystander but an integral component of the quantum network.</p>
<p>This dynamic allows for meaningful choice within the parameters of the system. While deterministic factors like genetics and environment play a role, the ability of consciousness to interact with the quantum field introduces variability and agency. In this way, Quantum Realism reconciles the apparent tension between determinism and free will, framing individuals as co-creators within an evolving reality.</p>
 
  What Is Quantization? 
 
<p>Quantization is the process by which continuous possibilities are restricted to discrete units, such as energy levels in an atom. This principle is essential for the stability of physical systems, as it prevents infinite regress and ensures coherence. Without quantization, systems would lack the precision needed for consistent behavior, leading to paradoxes like infinite energy densities in classical physics.</p>
<p>In Quantum Realism, quantization also reflects the underlying processing structure of the quantum network. By discretizing energy, time, and space, the system ensures that interactions remain finite and manageable, enabling the emergence of stable structures like atoms and molecules. This discrete framework not only resolves the infinities problem but also provides a foundation for understanding how coherence and order arise in a fundamentally quantum reality.</p>
 
  Time, Causality, and Superposition 
 
<p>In Quantum Realism, time is not an absolute backdrop but an emergent property of processing cycles within the quantum field. Each cycle represents a discrete step in the evolution of reality, giving rise to the ordered flow of events we perceive as time. Superposition, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously, reflects the quantum field’s ability to hold and process many potentials before they are collapsed into specific outcomes.</p>
<p>Causality emerges from this collapse, as interactions within the quantum network resolve probabilities into ordered sequences. This dynamic interplay between potential and actualization creates the linear progression we experience, while superposition ensures that the system retains flexibility and adaptability. Together, these principles demonstrate how time, causality, and quantum phenomena are deeply interconnected within the framework of Quantum Realism.</p>
 
  The Role of Our 3D Bodies 
 
<p>Our 3D bodies serve as localized nodes within the quantum network, enabling consciousness to interact with the virtual constructs of space and time. By acting as receivers and processors of quantum information, these bodies provide the specificity and coherence needed for complex interactions, such as perception, learning, and decision-making. This localized embodiment allows consciousness to experience and express reality in a focused and constrained way, facilitating exploration and growth.</p>
<p>At the quantum level, our bodies are composed of informational systems governed by quantized interactions, such as atomic vibrations and molecular bonds. These interactions provide the stability necessary for biological processes, while also linking us to the larger quantum network. This dual role (as both physical entities and conduits for consciousness) illustrates the magnificent integration of body, mind, and the quantum substrate.</p>
 
  Reflections on Itzhak Bentov’s Premise 
 
<p>Though admittedly I don’t know much about Bentov, his idea that life represents organized information gifted back to the cosmos aligns with Quantum Realism’s view of consciousness as a dynamic contributor to the quantum field. Each life accumulates unique experiences, which are reintegrated into the system upon death, enriching its informational density and coherence. This cyclical process mirrors the conservation of energy and information observed in physical systems.</p>
<p>By framing life as an exchange of information between localized consciousness and the quantum network, Quantum Realism provides a holistic view of existence. Death is not an end but a transition, where individual contributions are folded back into the universal substrate, furthering the evolution of the system as a whole. This perspective offers both a scientific, existential and spiritual understanding of life’s purpose and continuity.</p>
 
  Hope in Navigating 3D Reality 
 
<p>Quantum Realism offers a hopeful perspective by framing life as an integral part of a coherent, meaningful process. By recognizing that consciousness actively shapes reality, individuals can embrace their role as co-creators within this evolving system. This participatory view inspires purpose and creativity, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and contribution.</p>
<p>The recursive and interconnected nature of the quantum network suggests that even small actions can have far-reaching effects. This reinforces the idea that every individual’s choices matter, contributing to the larger process of coherence and complexity. In this way, Quantum Realism not only explains the nature of reality but also provides a framework for navigating it with intention and hope.</p>

<p>In the wake of OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/openai-launches-operator-an-ai-agent-that-can-operate-your-computer/">releasing Operator</a>, a Computer-Using Agent (CUA), in research preview, I’ve read many breathless posts about the future of Web-based Agentic AI (as opposed to API-based Agentic AI), and how it makes every website “programmable”, even without APIs. If you have worked in software development, you can visualize the mechanics easily – it’s like giving a QA Automation tool like Selenium WebDriver a brain, so that instead of just automating web applications for rinse-and-repeat testing, it can actually read the data, make decisions, adjust course, and take action. That framing should also make it easy to immediately grok how this will break the identity and security infrastructure we currently have, or are putting in place. I mean, we have been dealing with these in our QA Automation projects forever. I thought I’d share the thoughts that immediately jumped to my mind, mostly because I need to not be the only one worrying about these (#MiseryLovesCompany).</p>



<p>1) Bypassing/Breaking/Compromising Authentication Mechanisms</p>



<p>Since CUAs rely on web-based browsing, they necessarily run into some of the same break points that QA automation runs into – like multi factor authentication, bot verification techniques, and more. Any CUA would currently have to give the user back control of the browser to take these actions before proceeding. This high friction point is going to run head first into consumer dissatisfaction and business mandates to “just make it work”, and all of us in identity can guess exactly what will follow:</p>



 
 Users will hand over passwords to their Agent service so it can log in as them, or grant them access to their password managers (probably as a feature getting built into first the browser password manager and then the generic password managers). 



 Users will turn off MFA to allow their agents to work. 



 Any guesses on what will happen to passkeys? If syncing of the private key was the worst that you thought could happen…. 



 There will people looking at how authorized session hijacking can become a feature to leverage, much like how Selenium allows direct manipulation of cookies and local storage, enabling agents to hoover up valid session tokens and bypass login screens. Case in point: <a href="https://github.com/JoshMayerr/passport-mcp">Build MCP servers for any website with automatic browser auth syncing</a> 



 Just like Selenium can sometimes bypass automation (bot) detection protections using headless browsing and user-agent spoofing, expect Agentic AI tools to develop capabilities to do the same. 
 



<p>2) Violating Authorization Boundaries (When They Exist)</p>



<p>QA Automation scripts often execute actions as a high-privilege test user (e.g., an admin account) to avoid breaking tests that are verifying functionality but not data or access restrictions. The rush to deploy Web-based Agentic AI tools will mean that like other tools of the past, it won’t be built with proper scope controls, thereby driving implementors to grant it excessive privileges. You can guess the rest.</p>



<p>As for consumer applications, those rarely have differentiated access control models built in for their users. That means a customer that wants to use a CUA, but limit what it can and cannot do will be out of luck. We saw this play out in the days of screenscraping-based personal finance applications, and how long it took for us to move everyone over to OAuth2 and FAPI as the better and more secure approach.</p>



<p>3) Weakening Security Controls</p>



<p>(aka “Is that a DDoS attack, or an army of Agents here to take advantage of the limited time deal we announced?”)</p>



<p>It won’t just be Authentication controls that are impacted. There are many security protections that will likely be obstacles in the path of Web-based Agentic AI. Would any of us be surprised to find out that IT teams were told to weaken or disable security mechanisms (e.g., Content Security Policy, SameSite cookies, Bot and DDoS detection) to facilitate automated agents, inadvertently creating vulnerabilities?</p>



<p>And these are just what immediately jumped to mind. I am sure there are many more that I’m not even thinking of.</p>



<p>Identity vendors and practitioners everywhere really need to shift into high gear to help organizations properly prepare for what’s headed their way. The demand to support Web-based Agentic AI will put a great deal of pressure on them to enable safe acceptance, and being the “Agent of No” (see what I did there) is not likely to go well. As for what can be done – more on that later.</p>

<p>This post looks at customizing the sign-in UI and the sign-in options in an ASP.NET Core application using Duende IdentityServer and ASP.NET Core Identity. There are multiple ways of changing the look and feel of the UI for different OpenID Connect clients or different client flows.</p>

 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2025/02/03/multiple-client-sign-in-customizations-using-duende-identity-provider/">Customizing a single client sign-in using parameters in Duende IdentityServer</a> 
 



 Setup 



<p>The solution is setup using three different ASP.NET Core applications. In the example code, the “Admin” application has different federation authentication options compared to the “Shop” client authentication sign-in experience. The client ID from the authentication context is used to customize the look and feel, i.e. the styles, the layout and the options of the client are used to define which federation and authentication options are possible.</p>







<p></p>



 Customization of the sign-in options 



<p>The EnableLocalLogin parameter and the IdentityProviderRestrictions parameter from Duende IdentityServer can be used to change the sign-in options for the end user of the applications. If the EnableLocalLogin  option is set to false, the define username, password login is disabled. The IdentityProviderRestrictions  setting can be used to define which federation options are allowed for the client sign-in.</p>


  new Client
{
    ClientId = "shop-client-ui",
    
	// more client options ... 

    // show/hide the local authentication screen
    EnableLocalLogin = false

    // federated authentication options to display
	// empty displays all
    IdentityProviderRestrictions = ["AdminEntraID"]
},
  


<p></p>



 Layout Customization for clients 



<p>Sometimes the identity provider application need to display a different look and feel for the different clients. To achieve this, a separate login screen is used and each login screen uses a different layout. The layout and the style are changed using the client ID from the authorization context. If the shop client is used, the user is redirect to a different Razor Page. The UseShopClientDisplay bool is used for this.</p>


  private async Task BuildModelAsync(string? returnUrl)
{
    Input = new InputModel
    {
        ReturnUrl = returnUrl
    };

    var context = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);
    if (context?.Client.ClientId == "shop-client-ui")
    {
        View = new ViewModel
        {
            UseShopClientDisplay = true
        };
        
        // Process in the shop client login
        return;
    }

    // standard code from duende template
}
  


<p></p>



<p>In the Login Razor Page on get method, the user is redirected to a different layout if the UseShopClientDisplay is true. The returnUrl is passed as a parameter.</p>


  public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGet(string? returnUrl)
{
    await BuildModelAsync(returnUrl);

    if (View.IsExternalLoginOnly)
    {
        // we only have one option for logging in and it's an external provider
        return RedirectToPage("/ExternalLogin/Challenge", 
				new { scheme = View.ExternalLoginScheme, returnUrl });
    }

    if (View.UseShopClientDisplay)
    {
        return RedirectToPage("ShopClient", new { returnUrl });
    }
       
    return Page();
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The HTML part of the Razor Page uses a different Layout and the Layout is set explicitly in the Razor Page. </p>


  @page
@model IdentityProvider.Pages.Login.ShopClient
@{
    Layout = "Shared/_LayoutShopClient";
}
&lt;div class="login-page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="lead"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Shop Client Login&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose how to login&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>Different, options, styles and layouts can be setup for any clients.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Or a different client display using the ClientID as the switch:</p>







<p></p>



<p>With this setup any CSS and any layout can be used for the different clients. This is one way of having a multi-tenant or multiple client setup. This setup uses a different Client ID to style and add or remove options.</p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well and does not require much effort. Sometimes customization is required within a single client. If you intend to use this in a multiple tenant solution, you should disable the default sign-in screen if building from the ASP.NET Core Identity templates. In a follow up post, I will look at further customization within a single client option.</p>

<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2218">Kim Cameron</a> first told me what Digital Identity is on February 1, 2005.  He said that the Internet was created without an identity layer. He encouraged me “You should come help build it with me.” I’ve been at it ever since!</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1367">What I wrote about digital identity a decade ago</a> remains as true today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
An interesting thing about digital identity is that, by definition, it’s not a problem that any one company can solve, no matter how great their technology is.  For digital identity to be “solved”, the solution has to be broadly adopted, or else people will continue having different experiences at different sites and applications.  Solving digital identity requires ubiquitously adopted identity standards.  Part of the fun and the challenge is making that happen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to even try to list all the meaningful identity and security initiatives that I’ve had the privilege to work on with many of you.  But I can’t resist saying that, in my view, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Token (JWT), and OAuth 2.0 are the ones that we knocked out of the park.  I tried to distill the lessons learned from many of the initiatives, both successes and failures, during my 2023 EIC keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  And there’s a fairly complete list of the consequential things I’ve gotten to work on in my <a href="https://self-issued.consulting/standards-cv">Standards CV</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll also call attention to 2025 marking twenty years of the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>.  I attended the first one, which was held in Berkeley, California in October 2005, and all but one since.  What a cast of characters I met there, many of whom I continue working with to this day!</p>
<p>As a personal testament to the value of IIW, it’s where many of the foundational decisions about what became JWS, JWE, JWK, JWT, and OpenID Connect were made.  Particularly, see <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=361">my post documenting decisions made at IIW about JWS</a>, including the <code>header.payload.signature</code> representation of the JWS Compact Serialization and the decision to secure the Header Parameters.  And see the posts following it on <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=378">JWE decisions</a>, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=386">naming decisions</a>, and <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=390">JWK decisions</a>.  IIW continues playing the role of enabling foundational discussions for emerging identity technologies today!</p>
<p>It’s been a privilege working with all of you for these two decades, and I love what we’ve accomplished together!  There’s plenty of consequential work under way and I’m really looking forward to what comes next.</p>

<p>My first attempt at building a decentralized app in this day and age will use Solid Pods and DIDs. The goal? A super simple “BooksWeLike” app—a place where I can review books and see what my friends are reading and enjoying.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes this app different is how it handles data. Unlike traditional apps where data lives in a centralized database, my app will let users store their own data in Solid Pods. Think of a Pod as your own personal data vault—you control who can access it and how it’s used. And instead of relying on centralized logins like Google or Facebook, I’ll use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which allow users to prove their identity on their own terms.</p><p><br></p><p>The plan for the app is straightforward:</p><p>	•	If you already have a DID or a Solid Pod, you can sign in using your existing accounts.</p><p>	•	If you don’t, the app will help you create them when you sign up.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, part of this journey is figuring out how practical and possible all of this really is. Beyond building the app, I’ll also evaluate the tools, SDKs, client libraries, and documentation available for Solid and DID developers. How well is the building community being enabled? I’ll compare my experience with other distributed ecosystems as I attempt to replicate this app in different environments in the future. Once the app exists across multiple ecosystems, I can explore broader topics like ecosystem interoperability and federation.</p><p><br></p><p>These technologies are still evolving, and I’m excited to explore what’s possible—and what needs improvement.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what about you? Have you already taken the plunge into the world of DIDs or Solid Pods? Or is this your first time hearing about them? Let’s find out together as I document this journey.</p><p><br></p><p>In my next post, I’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of authentication—getting users to log in with their DIDs and connecting them to their Pods. I suspect it’s trickier than it sounds, but that’s all part of the adventure.</p>

This is known as the principle of least privilege. The problem is that knowing this is a best practice and putting it into practice are two different things. Traditionally, organizations have used access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) based on groups to authorize activities. These methods are static, requiring that lists or groups be updated manually as people move between roles or leave employment. When this is extended to partners, suppliers, and other services, the problem is that much worse. And excess standing privileges are a real security risk.</p><p>Standing privileges are characterized by persistent access regardless of whether the person is using the resource or not, predefined scope where role is used to define broad access, and minimal oversight with little monitoring and accountability. Standing privileges increase the attack surface, letting attackers exploit broad permissions without further escalation. In addition, over time people accumulate permissions beyond what they need to perform their current job, a situation known as privilege creep.</p><p>In an ideal world, least privilege is like a shrink wrap, constantly adjusting the access perimeter as the needs of the employee change. Sometimes they expand and the shrink wrap expands to seamlessly grant any access to needed perform a job. Sometimes the needs shrink and the access perimeter of the employee contracts as well. By limiting access to just that necessary to perform tasks, least privilege ensures that the attack surface that an attacker can exploit is as small as possible.</p> Zero Trust <p>Sometimes it's easy to get least privilege and zero trust confused. Zero trust is an overall security framework that requires continuous trust verification. Zero trust is a strategic, overarching trust model for an entire organization. Least privilege, in contrast, is more tactical, determining who can access what and when they can do it.</p><p>To see how least privilege fits into a zero trust strategy, consider a database administrator (DBA). Least privilege might set access controls such that the DBA can manage databases, but cannot view customer data stored within them. If their credentials are compromised, the attacker cannot steal sensitive information because the DBA’s privileges are tightly scoped. Zero trust relies on the DBA's access being valid, but might also check for unusual activity such that if the DBA appears to be accessing the database from a new location or at an unusual time, access is curtailed until the DBA is re-authenticated.</p><p>As the example shows, least privilege is an important part of zero trust, but only part. Other tactics that play in a zero trust strategy include device management, multi-factor authentication, and segmenting applications and processes (i.e., microsegmentation) to make fine-grained access control possible. Still, least privilege is a core part of a zero trust strategy. And least privilege depends on eliminating standing privileges.</p> Eliminating Standing Privileges <p>Recent developments in dynamic authorization have made it easier than ever to eliminate standing privileges. Standing privileges are the result when automatically updating an employee's access in response to changing circumstances is difficult. Modern policy-based authorization systems like <a href="https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en">Cedar</a> allow organizations to control access though policies that state who can access what and under what conditions. These policies are managed like code, making them easier to manage. More importantly, they can automatically respond to changing circumstances.</p><p>For example, the first of the following two Cedar policies forbids anyone to access any resource that's considered "critical" unless they're on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. The second permits employees in the Finance group to access any finance application. These policies work together, so that if the finance application is also a critical resource, then finance employees would also have to be on a managed device with an acceptable security posture. As employees change roles that group is automatically updated from the HR system, growing or shrinking access as needed.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal,  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"CriticalResources"  
) unless {  
    context.device.security.risk == "Secure" &amp;&amp;  
    context.device.security.assessment.overall &gt;= 80  
};

permit(  
    principal in UserGroup::"Finance"  
    action,  
    resource in Category::"FinanceApplications"  
);  </code> <p>While policy-based access control (PBAC) can be used to mimic a role-based access control system, proper system segmentation (i.e. being able to identify finance applications) and device management allows finer-grained access control where employee's actions can be restricted to specific systems and only when their using a company-owned device that is properly secured. Access control can be limited to certain times or from specific locations. All of these reduce the surface area of an employee's access perimeter for better security.</p> Just-in-Time Access Control <p>We can shrink the access perimeter even further using just-in-time access control. Just-in-time (JIT) access control is a mechanism that grants users, applications, or processes access to resources only for a limited time and only when it is explicitly needed. This minimizes the risks associated with long-term or persistent access privileges. While the principle of least privilege focuses on ensuring users or systems have the minimum permissions required to perform their roles or tasks, JIT access control refines this further with several other important features:</p>  <p>Time-Bound Privileges:—JIT ensures permissions are time-limited, reducing the window of opportunity attackers have to exploit rarely-used accounts. For example, a developer needing access to a production server might receive elevated privileges only for a specific task and only for a set duration.</p>  <p>Dynamic Privilege Assignment:—Even when policies are evaluated for each access, the permissions they allow are available indefinitely. JIT adds another dimension to the dynamic nature of PBAC where privileges are granted on demand and revoked automatically when no longer needed.</p>  <p>Granular Control:—Dynamic privilege assignment complements PBAC by making access more granular—not just who can access what, but also when and for how long.</p>  <p>JIT access control might, for example, be used to limit access to payroll functions except during the window when payroll is being processed. Another example is in so-called "break-glass" situations where access is granted to production resources in an emergency or in the case of unexpected failure. Other examples use dynamic roles (e.g., on call) to grant access or require a third party (like a manager) to approve access.</p><p>These scenarios can fit within a policy-based authorization architecture using mechanisms such as dynamically altering roles or adding information to the authorization request context based on querying other systems or utilizing permission tokens that carry time-based permissions with them. For example, the following policy makes use of an assignment to process payroll in the oncall tracking system to ensure only people with an oncall assignment of "payroll" can process the payroll.</p> <code>forbid(  
    principal  
    action == "Payroll::Process",  
    resource  
) unless {  
    context.oncall.assignment == "payroll"  
} </code> <p>For this to work, the authorization agent that creates the request for the policy authorizer has to ensure that the context for the request includes the correct oncall assignment and oncall assignments need to be automated.</p> Putting it All Together <p>Zero trust, the principle of least privilege, and just-in-time access work together to create a comprehensive security framework.</p>  <p>Zero trust enables an overarching strategy that mandates systems, resources, and actions be designed such that it is possible to continuously verify every action.</p>  <p>Principle of Least Privilege forms the heart of the zero trust strategy, mandating authentication and authorization systems that can dynamically grant fine-grained access through policy.</p>  <p>Just-in-time authorization augments the authorization system so that permissions can be granted not just based on who and where, but also only when they are needed to perform critical actions.</p>  <p>The well known adage that you can't buy security, applies to zero trust and JIT. There are products and technologies that make just-in-time, dynamic fine-grained access control possible, but besides putting them in place, you must also integrate them, make any necessary changes to other systems, and implement governance, monitoring, and auditing to ensure they work. These are organizational changes that take time, money, and perseverance. Done right, the payoff is not just a reduced attack surface and better security, but more productive employees as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, but poorly implemented, piecemeal security measures put much of the burden for keeping systems safe on employees who deal with tactics like frequent, yet ineffective password changes or requesting, and then waiting for, permissions to do their job.</p><p>When dynamic access control with JIT access is thoughtfully implemented, you shift the burden of security from employees to systems that automate protection, making it proactive and intelligent. Reducing friction so that employees can do their job while also enhancing security requires balance and a holistic approach that aligns technology, process, and culture. This transformation requires real effort but offers substantial rewards: resilient, secure systems; empowered employees; and peace of mind.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Shrink Wrapped Computers from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: draw a wide format picture of several colorful, shrink wrapped computers and smartphones.</p>

<p>I took notes on Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz’s post-election discussion of their Fairshake pro-crypto Pac and the coming Trump presidency about two months ago, but set them aside and other topics took precedence. Given the rising craziness in the crypto space around the inauguration, I thought it was a good time to put them out for consideration. A quick glance at the finances of their pro-crypto / pro-blockchain Pac should be a wake up call to anyone doubting the rising tide of automated, smart contract law and global cyber governance. We need to wrap our heads around the fact that it’s less about money and power and more about information theory, token engineering, and the shift of social systems into a networked super intelligence operating under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for expanded “human potential.” It is a bipartisan effort. It is an international effort. It will be framed as a “populist uprising” to take back “the commons,” engineered of course by the world’s largest asset holders. In my opinion, meme-coins are biosemiotic aides facilitating emergent swarm intelligence. Tread carefully around those digital mind viruses folks. A lot of money, and tokens, are being thrown around trying to get their planned cyberphysical-sociotechnical future to stick.&nbsp;</p>

 Setup 



<p>The ASP.NET Core web application authenticates using OpenID Connect and OpenIddict as the secure token server. The application needs to use data from an app-to-app resource. An OAuth client credential flow is used to get an application access token to access the API. The OAuth client credentials flow can only be used when it can keep a secret. This token has nothing in common with the delegated access token from the user authentication. The application is persisted once for the application. An in-memory cache is used for this. The application sends the application access token as a bearer token to the API.</p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per application for application tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. The tokens must be persisted safely in multiple instance setups. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per application 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely (Safe and encrypted storage if not in-memory) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example  



<p>An ApplicationAccessTokenCache service is used to manage the access tokens for the application. The service is registered as a singleton and runs once for the whole application. Each request scope can use this. The application looks in the cache for a valid token and if no valid token is present, the service requests a new access token using the OAuth client credentials flow. The token is persisted to the cache using the client ID. This means only one token can exist per client definition.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The required services are added the the application in the program file. </p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;ApplicationAccessTokenCache&gt;();
builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;ApplicationUsersService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();
  


<p></p>



<p>The token cache works great when using in-memory cache. If using a persistent cache, care needs to be taken that the access tokens are persisted in a safe way. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSaMF7KbUME">this morning’s video</a> I somehow missed the fact that the inauguration coincides with MLK Day, which is an interesting sync with the “melanin as optical material” lens. I’m going to drop a few links to old blog posts that touch on the YMCA and “out of school time learning” as as well as my “Momo” read-aloud playlist. Maybe I should do a read aloud of Bentov’s “Stalking the Wild Pendulum,” too? I’m understanding it much better now. Look for a discussion of quantum realism with Joseph Gonzales in the coming week. I’ll just say it once again, I can’t believe I have to talk about any of this, but if you don’t take it too seriously, conjecturing can be rather fun.</p>

<p>In this video I draw connections between Gestalt theory and organizational development as applied to digital groupthink in the context of Christiana Figueres, a leader in the development of carbon trading, who trained at the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland. As a young woman, she attended Swarthmore College, a Quaker institution. The first wife of her father, three-time president of Costa Rica and MIT alumnus, had ties to Quaker expats (Henrietta Boggs’ uncle and aunt) who emigrated south from Alabama in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Kenneth Boulding, a Quaker economist who developed some of the first ideas around social impact investing, and his wife Elise, sociologist who built the field of peace studies, were affiliated with Swarthmore though Kenneth only did a year’s stint as a guest lecturer. </p>
<p>When our family toured the campus for a college visit, it was made clear that only the top-tier candidates would be accepted, because many slots were reserved for equity outreach. Interestingly a high percentage of students presenting that day asserted their intentions to become economists with aspirations of working at the World Bank and the IMF. That was an eye-opener for sure!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use the visual of the optical illusion of paired silhouettes with a vase in the center to describe how two narratives can be presented, but often only one is truly “seen.” This Gestalt concept is applied to parallel narratives – one presented in two recent stories on Unlimited Hangout that foreground militarism and data surveillance in AI healthcare and the story I keep attempting to tell about gamified managed community “wellness” protocols linked to social impact finance deals on blockchain that on another level will be leveraged to catalyze emergent behaviors and possibly advance bio-hybrid information processing.</p>
<p>I also describe a strange encounter in which Aetna health care intended to target low-income communities of color for VR guided meditation in a digital “jungle” setting. The second hour of the video is a repeat of two site visits Jason and made in Denver in 2022 to the then new Palantir headquarters and the state capitol.</p>

<p>The article looks at managing user delegated access tokens for a downstream API in an ASP.NET Core web application. There are many ways of implementing this, all with advantages and disadvantages. The tokens are requested from an OpenID Connect server using the recommended standards. In this blog, the UI access token from the application authentication is re-used for the downstream API.</p>

 Setup 



<p>The solution uses a secure downstream API and requires user delegated access tokens for access. The UI application is implemented using ASP.NET Core and razor pages. The UI application authenticates against an OpenID Connect server implemented using OpenIddict. The application client is implemented using an OpenID Connect confidential client and the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. This flow returns an access token which is used for the downstream API. </p>







<p></p>



 What must an application manage? 



<p>An access token management solution must ensure that tokens are securely stored per user session for user delegated tokens and updated after each UI authentication or refresh. The solution should be robust  to handle token expiration, function seamlessly after restarts, and support multi-instance deployments. Additionally, it must effectively manage scenarios involving invalid or missing access tokens.</p>



 Properties of token management in the solution setup: 



 
 The access token is persisted per user session 



 The token expires 



 The token needs to be persisted somewhere safely 



 The token must be replaced after each UI authentication (per user) 



 The solution must work after restarts 



 The solution must work for multiple instances when deployed to multi-instance deployments. 



 The solution must handle invalid access tokens or missing access tokens 
 



 Implementation example using Duende Token Management 



<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect">Duende Token Management OpenIdConnect</a> Nuget package can be used to implement these requirements for user delegated access tokens. This is not the only way to do this and can be implemented in numerous different ways. With this package, the AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement can be used to add the token management. </p>


  builder.Services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The different HTTP requests or the Razor pages can use the GetUserAccessTokenAsync method to get the access token for each user and session. The SaveTokens is set to true to persist the tokens in the session using a secure cookie per default. This is an option in the AddOpenIdConnect method. The defined scope is used to select the access token.</p>


   // token expires, token managment required
var accessToken = await HttpContext.GetUserAccessTokenAsync(
   new UserTokenRequestParameters
   {
      Scope = "myscope"
   });
  


<p></p>



<p>The AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient method can be used to add a named HttpClient client for the access token and the specific API.</p>


  builder.Services.AddUserAccessTokenHttpClient("profileClient",
    configureClient: client =&gt; 
    { 
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri(profileApiBaseUrl!); 
    });
  


<p></p>



<p>This client can then be used to access the API resource using the access token.</p>


  var client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("profileClient");

var response = await client.GetAsync("api/Profiles/photo");
if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
{
    var data = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    if (data != null)
        return data;

    return string.Empty;
}
  


<p>When the applications are started, the access token can be used to request data from the downstream API.</p>



 Notes 



<p>In follow up blogs, I will look at the different ways and the different types of strategies which are used to implement token management in ASP.NET Core web applications.</p>

<p>What will come of large language models when they mirror unsettled psyches defined by religious hero complexes into the cloud? We do ourselves and future generations a profound disservice when we choose not to make time to comprehend and interrogate how emerging technologies and narrative flows are being deployed to steer psychological states individually and as holon-based collectives through socio-technical, cyberphysical systems and the tokenized attention economy. </p>
<p>I recognize that rather than being a victim of Substack mania once again, I was merely a reflection of another’s discomfort in the world, an obstacle that gave someone a useful anchor point to exert his will and express his agency, however uninformed and misguided. It’s not a good feeling, but an informative lesson nonetheless. </p>
<p>It’s time to wrap our heads around tokenized spirituality and organized religion. My gut tells me Texas is ground zero for integration of the Drucker-Buford metaverse church model with digital community currencies tied to “moral” markets and social impact “charity” in ATT smart cities designed for community “wellness.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don’t think AI should be approached as a digital intercessor for “divine” moral guidance.” I view, web3 systems as linguistic scaffolds quietly mapping the terrain of our souls. Once harvested, our somatic pyschological GPS coordinates can be used ad infinitum to play us like instruments in the coming LARPy animist musical of blockchained cloud minds to solve gnarly problems that can only be untangled by a network of diverse, distributed intelligences – with digital wallets.</p>
<p>Follow your heart, think clearly, and ground yourself. It is easy to get swept away by the Sturm und Drang we generate around ourselves to make the hero roles we inhabit make sense. I’m not going to link to Andrew Corner’s Substack directly, but it’s not hard to find – I’m in the “energy” one. If you go there, fair warning, it’s a slog that’s equal parts disturbing and amusing. </p>
<p>What are we becoming folks? I don’t think the “hybrid” intelligence program is going to be a good look for many of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of the day this may very well have simply been another signals-intelligence operation. It doesn’t seem like anyone really pays attention to that Substack anyway. If so, I hope there are at least a few useful take aways regarding how we should engage with this systems.</p>

 Part 2: Issuing&nbsp;Badges <p>In <a href="https://blog.dcconsortium.org/explaining-verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-5bf2f482b383">part one</a> of this series, we discussed how the trust model of Open Badges 3.0 differs from earlier versions. Credentials issued as Open Badges 3.0 are based on the <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1b808YBAgwQgD8omWIWcyUb193SW2MvG3Fs5XCX7wHyE?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> data model which describes how claims made online can be&nbsp;proven.</p><p>To explore this trust model, let’s explore the story of Olivia who has been taking classes at a local community college. Olivia is told that with each course she will be awarded and issued a badge that she can use to apply for employment.</p><p>Let’s start with what “issuing a badge” means using the most common approaches:</p><p>For older Open Badges (versions 0.5 to 2.1): The issuer saves completed course data in the format of an Open Badge that includes Olivia’s email address. When the issuer saves the data, the badge is considered “issued”. This data will be used to populate a web page or a file on the web. This web page or file must be public for Olivia to share online and be considered verifiable. In order for Olivia to do this, she must have an account on the issuing platform associated with the same email&nbsp;address.</p><p>For Open Badges 3.0 &amp; W3C Verifiable Credentials: The issuer decides that Olivia should be awarded a badge and provides a secure link for Olivia to retrieve it. Olivia uses a digital wallet to click the secure link which makes a request to the issuing software to produce the badge. The issuing software retrieves and digitally signs the badge data; at this moment the badge has been by definition “issued.” (Prior to this digital signature, the badge itself did not exist.) It is sent to Olivia’s wallet where she claims and secures it, now able to share it privately at her discretion. It is important to note that this credential is hosted locally on Olivia’s device. There is no web page or URL for this credential until Olivia decides to create a public&nbsp;link.</p> Different Trust&nbsp;Models   Older Open Badges are hosted on the web. In this model, trust in the credential is based on the reputation of the badging platform hosting the credentials. Perceptions of trust of websites or platforms can be based on elements like issuer identity confirmation, availability of content, and security of the web site (<a href="https://www.digicert.com/how-tls-ssl-certificates-work">how websites are secured</a>).  Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials are digitally signed, portable files. In this model, trust is based on the cryptographic digital signature and privacy. The digital signature in the credential is readable to the verification software, which looks for information indicating which entity signed the credential and if the data has changed since it was signed. Confirmation of the issuing entity’s identity happens later using an issuer registry (to be explained in more detail in a future&nbsp;post).  <p>Olivia has unfettered access to the credential and can share it knowing that when she does, her actions aren’t being tracked or communicated to the issuer. When she shares her credential, it is signed by the digital identity associated with the credential issuer so that the verifier can trust that she has control of the digital identity and the credential.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Open Badges v3 and Verifiable Credential issuing platforms could still have public web pages for badges. Olivia may not want all of her badges digitally signed but with Open Badges 3.0 and Verifiable Credentials, she has that&nbsp;choice.</p><p>This blog post is Part 2 of a series of content explaining W3C Verifiable Credentials and Open Badges 3.0. Stay tuned for Part 3 — “What does it mean that a badge is digitally signed?”.</p><p>For more information on the DCC, including membership, projects, and events, visit our <a href="http://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">website</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/">wiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dccconsortium">Linkedin</a>.

<p>Is blogging still a thing?</p><p>If you’re reading this, please comment or like it so I know.</p><p><br></p><p>I am, at heart, still the XDI Guy. My passion for robust, secure, and scalable distributed data management hasn’t waned. Building one of the first XDI implementations (shout-out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821/">Markus Sabadello</a>, who might have built the only other one), I learned a lot about the challenges and opportunities of distributed data at scale. Over the years, I’ve reflected on qualities essential for data ecosystems, qualities that are often overshadowed by content-driven ecosystems. For example:</p><p>	•	Caching semantics: Apps need governance and management of caches to respect data ownership while maintaining local operational efficiency.</p><p>	•	Transactionality: Mature data protocols depend on it for consistency and reliability.</p><p>	•	Request batching: Optimizing network requests is vital for performance and scalability.</p><p><br></p><p>After years away, I’m ready to dive back in. There are a couple of apps I want to build, and I want to build them on a distributed data platform. My first idea is a fully distributed implementation of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-degraf-4521/">Brad deGraf</a>’s BooksWeLike concept—a way to share and discover books that resonate with you. (Brad, if you’re reading this and don’t like the idea, let me know!)</p><p><br></p><p>To make this happen, I’ve started scanning the distributed protocol space to see what’s out there. Here’s my initial list of protocols to evaluate:</p><p>	•	AT Protocol</p><p>	•	Nostr</p><p>	•	Solid</p><p>	•	ActivityPub</p><p>	•	Matrix</p><p>	•	IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</p><p>	•	SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)</p><p>	•	DID (Decentralized Identifiers)</p><p>	•	Libp2p</p><p>	•	Hypercore</p><p>	•	Waku</p><p>	•	Zero-Knowledge Identity Protocols (ZK Protocols)</p><p><br></p><p>What am I missing?</p><p>Are there protocols on this list that don’t belong? If so, why? Are there others I should consider? I haven’t started my evaluations yet, so I’m open to your insights. If you’ve built apps on these protocols or have opinions about them, I’d love to hear from you.</p><p><br></p><p>I’ll be capturing my journey of discovery here—sharing what I learn, where I stumble, and how I (hopefully) succeed. Let’s make distributed data a reality, by and for the people.</p>

These advantages make our scheme a promising candidate for privacy-preserving digital identity applications.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>当社のECDSAの証明書は60ミリ秒で生成できます。ISO MDOC標準のような完全に標準化されたアイデンティティプロトコルに組み込まれた場合、クレデンシャルのサイズにもよりますが、モバイルデバイス上でMDOCプレゼンテーションフロー用のゼロ知識証明書を1.2秒で生成できます。これらの利点により、当社の方式はプライバシー保護型デジタルアイデンティティアプリケーションの有望な候補となっています。</p></blockquote><p>mdocのプレゼンテーション時にゼロ知識証明を1.2秒で生成、このくらいなら実用性がありそうですね。</p><p>論文の本文もPDFで閲覧できるようになっているので、おいおい見ていこうと思います。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p>

<p>In this post, I cover using LlamaIndex LlamaParse in auto mode to parse a PDF page containing a table, using a Hugging Face local embedding model, and using local Llama 3.1 8b via Ollama to perform naive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). That’s a mouthful. I won’t go into how to setup Ollama and Llama 3.1 8b; this post assumes it is&nbsp;running.</p><p>First off, you can find the code for this in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test Github repo</a> under Test1/src folder. At the time of this writing there is a Test0 and a Test1. To see the post about Test0 code see <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/using-llamaindex-part-1-openai-e96b3efa699a">Using LlamaIndex — Part 1&nbsp;OpenAI</a>.</p><p>The code uses a&nbsp;.env and load_dotenv() to populate the needed LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY. I recommend that if you have an OPENAI_API_KEY entry in the&nbsp;.env that you comment it out for this experiment to prove to yourself that the embedding and LLM are local and not OpenAI. See the part 1 post for more details on the LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY.</p> #OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>The pip install dependencies I put as comments at the top of the python file. There is also a requirements.txt for the project as a whole that covers all the “Test” experiments package requirements.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface<br># pip install llama-index-llms-ollama<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file <p>The nice thing about LlamaIndex LlamaParse is that it provides an auto mode that will use premium mode when specified criteria are met. In this experiment, I have set auto mode on with triggers for mode change on in- page images or tables. Also, to save on parsing credit usage in LlamaParse and because, for this example, it is all that is needed, I have set the pages to be parsed to PDF page 9 only (note that PDF page 9 is target page 8 to LlamaParse because it uses a 0 based page index). Like the part 1 post, I am using an output of markdown because it provides greater context to the LLM; though, I did try it with result_type=text and received the proper query response despite the answer to the query being in a&nbsp;table.</p> # set LlamaParse for markdown output and auto_mode only parsing page 8<br>parser = LlamaParse(<br>    result_type="markdown", <br>    auto_mode=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page=True,<br>    auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page=True,<br>    target_pages="8",<br>    verbose=True<br>) <p>So that you don’t have to open the PDF document that gets parsed to understand the input below is a screenshot of the&nbsp;page.</p><p>As in part 1, I use LlamaParse.load_data to read the page and parse it. Since it has a table in-page and we are in auto mode it will automatically use Premium mode to potentially better handle the page and table. This will cause the page parse to cost 15 credits on LlamaIndex. Note that LlamaIndex will cache your parsed page for 48 hours unless you specify otherwise or change the parse parameters which allows you to run the code more than once and only get the credit cost once. I did try using the default “accurate” mode by removing the auto_mode parameters on the LlamaParse and it still parsed the table properly and returned the proper answer to the query — but this is a sample for showing the use of “auto mode” so just pretend that is not the&nbsp;case.</p><p>If you want to see the output of the parser, uncomment the print command after the documents variable is populated. I like to then paste it into a markdown viewer to see it as rendered markdown output.

Over a three-week period, hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card accounts from retail giant Target by exploiting the account of an HVAC contractor. The attack began with an email-based phishing scam that tricked an employee at the HVAC company into revealing their credentials. As a vendor to Target, the HVAC company had legitimate access to Target’s systems. Using the stolen credentials, the hackers infiltrated Target’s network and installed malware on the retailer’s point-of-sale systems, enabling them to collect customer data. The breach resulted in direct costs to Target of nearly $300 million, along with reputational damage that is difficult to quantify.1</p><p>The Target breach underscores the critical importance of not only knowing who is accessing your systems (authentication) but also controlling what they can access (authorization). The HVAC vendor had access to Target’s systems for electronic billing, contract submission, and project management. However, the hackers were able to extend this access beyond those legitimate uses to reach systems used to update point-of-sale devices. Target’s failure to properly restrict access to critical systems created a significant vulnerability that the hackers exploited.</p><p>But I don’t want you to get the idea that authorization is just about securing IT systems—it’s also fundamental to how modern cloud applications function, enabling features that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. For example, services like Google Docs and Dropbox rely on authorization to allow users to share documents with specific people while restricting access to others. Without this capability, these applications would not be possible.</p><p>Another example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), where authorization enables Amazon to securely provide hundreds of cloud services to millions of customers at scale in a cost-effective manner. As a global distributed system taking advantage of multi tenancy to service millions of customers, AWS uses a sophisticated policy-based authorization system to help customers control access to the services running inside their accounts.</p><p>Several trends make authorization a more important topic that it has been:</p>  <p>More and more software is being delivered as a service (so called Software as a Service, or SaaS). As we’ve discussed cloud-based services can’t provide the needed levels of functionality and security without strong authorization systems.</p>  <p>Perimeter-based security architectures like firewalls are giving way to zero-trust architectures. Rather than assuming everyone inside the perimeter is trusted, zero-trust systems assume breach and authorize every access. This isn’t possible without flexible authorization systems that can determine whether to grant access based on the context of the request.</p>  <p>Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected devices mean that more and more computer systems are talking to each other on their owner’s behalf. Restricting their access to the role they play protects them and prevents them from becoming a vector that hackers can exploit to break into other sensitive systems.</p>  <p>Regulatory compliance is yet another reason why authorization is increasingly important. Laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require that access to personal information be carefully controlled so that only the right people and systems can use it. Beyond controlling access, these laws also require that you be able to audit access to show compliance.</p>  <p>In addition to these, the rise of GenAI and particularly AI agents that can act on your behalf pour gasoline on the smoldering identity industry interest in authorization. Am I talking to a human? Does this agent have authority to make a doctor's appointment on the patient's behalf? These and other questions mean that making good authorization decisions, knowing what decisions were made, and easily incorporating authorization infrastructure into your apps and infrastructure is vital.</p>    Notes   <p>The story is interesting beyond the fact that it highlights the need to properly manage access. Target’s response, or rather lack of one, provides several important security lessons: <a href="https://coverlink.com/cyber-liability-insurance/target-data-breach/">Cyber Case Study: Target Data Breach</a> provides more details</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Hacker Stealing Credit Cards from DALL-E (public domain).

<p>Released yesterday: <a href="https://sqitch.org" title="Sqitch: Sensible database change management">Sqitch</a> v1.5.0. This version the MySQL driver
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql" title="DBD::mysql - MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::mysql</a> with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB" title="DBD::MariaDB - MariaDB and MySQL driver for the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI)">DBD::MariaDB</a>, both for its better backward compatibility
with MySQL as well as MariaDB driver libraries and for its improved Unicode
handling. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch">Docker image</a> likewise switched to the MariaDB <code>mysql</code>
client. I expect no compatibility issues, but you never know! Please file an
<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues" title="Sqitch Issues">issue</a> should you find any.</p>
<p>V1.5.0 also features a fixes for Yugabyte deployment, Oracle error handling,
existing Snowflake schemas, connecting to MySQL/MariaDB without a database
name, and omitting the <code>checkit</code> MySQL/MariaDB function when the Sqitch user
lacks sufficient permission to create it. Sqitch now will also complain when
deploying with <code>--log-only</code> and a deployment file is missing.</p>
<p>Find it in the usual places:</p>

 Using LlamaIndex Part 1 — OpenAI <p>I have started to experiment with <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> for use in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) document parsing and indexing. My results were mixed on the simple page provided. This is part 1, where I make a short post on LlamaIndex with OpenAI as the LLM component. I expect part 2 to be LlamaIndex with Ollama and Llama3–8b as the LLM components.</p><p>This is a very short chunk of code. I also used the LlamaIndex Parse browser-based tool to see if I received different outputs. As one would expect, I did not. You can access the browser-based tool by opening a LlamaIndex account and choosing the “Parse” tool in your dashboard. You’ll need an account if you plan to use the code I provide and you will also need to generate an API key from your LlamaIndex dashboard. One of the great things about LlamaIndex is that for a paid tool it is generous in its free usage; 1000 credits PER DAY. In “accurate” mode, it is 1 credit per page; in “premium” mode, it is 15 credits per page. For my simple one page example the output between the two did not&nbsp;differ.</p><p>First the small snippet of&nbsp;code.</p> # pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai llama-index-llms-openai<br># pip install llama-index-core llama-parse llama-index-readers-file<br><br>from llama_parse import LlamaParse<br>from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex<br>from dotenv import load_dotenv<br><br><br>load_dotenv()<br><br>parser = LlamaParse(result_type="markdown", verbose=True)<br><br>file_name = "ssi-page-5.pdf"<br>extra_info = {"file_name": file_name}<br><br>with open(f"../../sample_docs/{file_name}", "rb") as file_to_parse:<br>    # must provide extra_info with file_name key when passing file object<br>    documents = parser.load_data(file_to_parse, extra_info=extra_info)<br>    # to manually check the MD output uncomment the below<br>    # print(documents[0].text)<br><br># index the parsed documents<br>index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)<br><br># generate a query engine for the index<br>query_engine = index.as_query_engine()<br><br># provide the query and output the results<br>query = "what are the principles of SSI?"<br>response = query_engine.query(query)<br>print(response) <p>You can find this code and a few sample documents, including the document used in this code in my <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/LlamaIndex_Test">LlamaIndex_Test</a> Github repo with the code specifically under the Test0&nbsp;folder.</p><p>Note that I don’t set an LLM or an embedding model. LlamaIndex uses OpenAI as the default LLM and OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002. You will need an OpenAI API key to go along with the LlamaIndex key. My code loads them from the&nbsp;.env to environmental variables and if they are named appropriately those variables will be found by default. Below is a&nbsp;.env&nbsp;example.</p> OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY<br>LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY <p>In the code above I am using a single-page PDF, “ssi-page-5.pdf”. It is page 5 of the larger document, “Self-Sovereign Identity A Systematic Review Mapping and Taxonomy.pdf”. If you plan to send LlamaParse a larger document but use the API properties to tell it only to parse a subset of pages from the document keep in mind that LlamaParse starts at page 0. The first time I tried this I had an off-by-one issue because I assumed page 1 of the document was, you know, page 1. It was page 0. This is understandable from a programming standpoint but caught me off guard&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>In the example code, I opened a file directly but LlamaIndex provides a directory reader with filters, if you desire to use that instead. The results I got back on the LLM query were spot on as would be expected on a single page of context with a well-outlined section pertinent to my simple&nbsp;query.</p><p>You don’t really need the creation of the vector index, query engine and query/response to test out LlamaIndex parsing. Just uncomment line 23 in the above code (line 19 in the repo code) comment out everything below it and get the parsed&nbsp;output.</p> Premium Mode and Auto Mode and Less than Expected&nbsp;Outcomes <p>In the code, I didn’t try out premium mode or auto mode. I intend to make a separate post about auto mode. I did try them in the LlamaIndex Parse tool. In both, I expected the image at the top of the page to get output as an image in the “Images” tab of the Parse output tool, but it&nbsp;didn’t.</p><p>The image at the top of the page is below as a screen&nbsp;capture.</p><p>This was disappointing. I’m not sure why this did not provide the expected&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>There you have it. A simple bit of code to parse using LlamaIndex. What makes it different from other parsers I have tried (all open source) is that it spits out the results in markdown, if desired, which is better than the usual plain text I received in other tools. The markdown provides the LLM more context even if in my simple case it was not of value. The other is that in theory, it will better parse images, tables etc., but as I explained I did not get that result.&nbsp;:-( I’ll continue to experiment with it, especially on more complicated pages such as ones that contain a table and in auto mode via&nbsp;code.</p><p>You can find part 2 as “<a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/ai-rag-with-llamaindex-local-embedding-and-ollama-llama-3-1-8b-b0620116a715">AI RAG with LlamaIndex, Local Embedding, and Ollama Llama 3.1 8b</a>”. The example in part 2 uses LlamaParse auto&nbsp;mode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group</a> published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-jose-cose-20241219/">Snapshot Second Candidate Recommendation of the Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE specification</a> just before the holidays.  This was one of <a href="https://www.w3.org/news/2024/five-candidate-recommendation-snapshots-published-by-the-verifiable-credentials-working-group/">five Candidate Recommendation Snapshots</a> published by the working group at the same time, including for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/CR-vc-data-model-2.0-20241219/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0</a>, which I’m also an editor of.  A <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">W3C Candidate Recommendation Snapshot</a> is intended to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#RecsCR">W3C Candidate Recommendation</a> after required review and approval steps.</p>
<p><a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2525">As I wrote about the First Candidate Recommendation</a>, VC-JOSE-COSE secures VC Data Model payloads with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html">JOSE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, or <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9052.html">COSE</a> signatures.  And while I’m admittedly not a fan of JSON-LD, to the extent that Verifiable Credentials using the JSON-LD-based VC Data Model are in use, I’m committed to there being a solid VC-JOSE-COSE specification so there is a simple, secure, standards-based way to sign these credentials.</p>
<p>One significant change since the First Candidate Recommendation was splitting the Controller Document text out into its own specification called <a href="https://w3c.github.io/cid/">Controlled Identifier Document 1.0</a>.  Publishing a Candidate Recommendation Snapshot for it is planned for next week.  Part of why it became its own specification is so that it can be referenced by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/04/did-wg-charter.html">planned update to the W3C DID specification</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to my co-editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohengabe/">Gabe Cohen</a> and working group chair <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bzundel/">Brent Zundel</a> for the significant work they both put in to help us reach this point!</p>

  Should Sqitch and URI::mysql use DBD::MariaDB instead of DBD::mysql? If so,
what are the implications for Sqitch deployment and usage?

<p>I seek the wisdom of the Perl Monks:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Sqitch project got <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/issues/825" title="sqitchers/sqitch#825 Support DBD::MariaDB">a request</a> to switch from <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a>
to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::MariaDB">DBD::MariaDB</a>. DBD::mysql 5’s requirement to build from the MySQL 8
client library provides the impetus for the request, but in poking around, I
found a <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/grinnz/2023/12/migrating-from-dbdmysql-to-dbdmariadb.html">blogs.perl.org post</a> highlighting some Unicode fixes in
DBD::MariaDB, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Sqitch likely doesn’t have the Unicode issue (it always works with Perl
Unicode strings), but it depends on <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::db">URI::db</a> to provide the DBI connection
string. For MySQL URIs, the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/URI-db/source/lib/URI/mysql.pm#L6">URI::mysql dbi_driver</a> method returns <code>mysql</code>.</p>
<p>Should it be changed to return <code>MariaDB</code>, instead? Is there general
community consensus that DBD::MariaDB provides better compatibility with
both MySQL and MariaDB these days?</p>
<p>I’m also curious what the impact of this change would be for Sqitch.
Presumably, if DBD::MariaDB can build against either the MariaDB or MySQL
client library, it is the more flexible choice to continue supporting both
databases going forward.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! 🎉🥳🍾🥂</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">JSONPath RFC</a> includes a section on defining <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-normalized-paths" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Normalized Paths">normalized paths</a>,
which use a subset of JSONPath syntax to define paths to the location of a
node in a JSON value. I hadn’t thought much about it, but noticed that the
<a href="https://serdejsonpath.live">serde JSONPath Sandbox</a> provides a “Located” switch adds them to query
results. For the sake of complementarity, I added the same feature to the <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/">Go
JSONPath Playground</a>.</p>

</code>  <p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> of the <code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> Go package enables this feature
via its new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.SelectLocated"><code>SelectLocated</code></a> method, which returns a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a> that
shows off a few of the benfits of pairing JSONPath query results with paths
that uniquely identify their locations in a JSON value, including sorting and
deduplication. It also takes advantage of <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go v1.23 iterators</a>, providing
methods to range over all the results, just the node values, and just the
paths. As a result, v0.3.0 now requires Go 1.23.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_json_path">serde_json_path Rust crate</a> inspired the use of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#LocatedNodeList"><code>LocatedNodeList</code></a>
rather than a simple slice of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0/spec#LocatedNode"><code>LocatedNode</code></a> structs, but I truly embraced it
once I noticed the the focus on “nodelists” in the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-overview" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Overview">RFC’s overview</a>, which
provides this definition:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>A JSONPath expression is a string that, when applied to a JSON value (the
query argument), selects zero or more nodes of the argument and outputs
these nodes as a nodelist.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>It regularly refers to nodelists thereafter, and it seemed useful to have an
object to which more features can be added in the future.
<code>github.com/theory/jsonpath</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0">v0.3.0</a> thererfore also changes the result value
of <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#Path.Select"><code>Select</code></a> from <code>[]any</code> to the new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath@v0.3.0#NodeList"><code>NodeList</code></a> struct, an alias for
<code>[]any</code>. For now it adds a single method, <code>All</code>, which again relies on <a href="https://go.dev/blog/range-functions">Go
v1.23 iterators</a> to iterate over selected nodes.</p>
<p>While the data type has changed, usage otherwise has not. One can iterate
directly over values just as before:</p>
  <code>for _, val := range path.Select(jsonInput) {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>But <code>All</code> removes the need to alias-away the index value with <code>_</code>:</p>
  <code>for val := range path.Select(jsonInput).All() {
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", val)
}
</code>  <p>I don’t expect any further incompatible changes to the main <code>jsonpath</code> module,
but adding these return values now allows new features to be added to the
selected node lists in the future.</p>
<p>May you find it useful!</p>

<p>Based on the recently-released Go <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">JSONPath</a> and <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">JSONTree</a> playgrounds, I’ve
updated the design and of the <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">SQL/JSON Playground</a>. It now comes
populated with sample JSON borrowed from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535</a>, as well as a selection of
queries that randomly populate the query field on each reload. I believe this
makes the playground nicer to start using, not to mention more pleasing to the
eye.</p>
<p>The playground has also been updated to use the recently-released
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/sqljson@v0.2.1/path">sqljson/path v0.2 package</a>, which replicates a few changes included in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-17-released-2936/" title="PostgreSQL 17 Released!">PostgreSQL 17 release</a>. Notably, the <code>.string()</code> function no longer uses a
time zone or variable format to for dates and times.</p>
<p>Curious to see it in action? <a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/" title="Go SQL/JSON Playground">Check it out!</a></p>

   こんにちは、富士榮です。  ついにこの日が来ました。           去年の正月休みに某猫とのチキンレースが始まってしまったので収まりがつかなくなって惰性で描き続けていましたが気がついたら本当に1年経ってしまいました。  ↓某猫のポスト

 Wenn du gesetzlich krankenversichert bist, wird deine Krankenkasse bis 15. Januar 2025 eine elektronische Patientenakte für dich einrichten – es sei denn, du widersprichst. Das gilt auch für private Krankenversicherungen, die freiwillig eine elektronische Patientenakte anbieten. Durch einen Widerspruch dürfen dir keine Nachteile entstehen. Die Anschreiben der Krankenkassen informieren <a href="https://www.vzbv.de/pressemitteilungen/elektronische-patientenakte-krankenkassen-informieren-unzureichend">unzureichend</a>. Bedenke bei deiner Entscheidung: 



<p></p>



 
 
<p>1. Inhalt und Datensicherheit: Ohne deinen Widerspruch wird künftig jeder Arztbesuch, jede Therapie und jede Medikation in einer zentral abrufbaren elektronischen Patientenakte gespeichert, darunter Arztbriefe, Entlassungsberichte und Diagnosekennungen. Hierunter fallen unter anderem auch Informationen zu deinen Suchtkrankheiten, Psychotherapien und psychischen Erkrankungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen, Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen (z.B. Impotenz), die gespeichert und zusammengetragen werden.&nbsp;Durch die zentrale Speicherung aller Behandlungen in einer elektronischen Patientenakte erhältst du eine einheitliche Zugriffsmöglichkeit auf deine Patientendaten. Andererseits waren in der Vergangenheit bereits mehrere zentralisierte, europäischen Gesundheitssysteme von umfangreichen Datenpannen betroffen. Bei der elektronischen Patientenakte in Deutschland ist noch nichts passiert. Sicherheitsforscher <a href="https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2024/ende-der-epa-experimente">warnen</a> jedoch, Kriminelle könnten mit wenig Aufwand auf beliebige Patientenakten zugreifen. Falls es zu Hacking, Datendiebstahl oder Datenverlust kommen sollte, können viel mehr Informationen verloren gehen als ohne elektronische Patientenakte.</p>
 



 

			
		
 
 



<p>2. Direkter Zugriff: Mit der elektronischen Patientenakte können behandelnde Ärzte, deine Apotheker, deine Physiotherapeuten, dein Pflegeheim, usw., sowohl in Deutschland als auch künftig im EU-Ausland deine elektronische Patientenakte direkt einsehen. Sie können sie auch in ihrer eigenen Praxissoftware speichern. Die Vorteile: Der Datenzugriff kann deine Behandlungen und Medikation wesentlich beschleunigen und verbessern, z. B. auch fehlerhafte Medikamentationen vermeiden. Unterlagen müssen nicht erst angefordert werden und liegen auch im Notfall unmittelbar vor. Doppeluntersuchungen entfallen. Ein möglicher Nachteil könnte sich daraus ergeben, dass für&nbsp;andere medizinische Stellen nicht relevante Behandlungen, Medikamentationen, etc. abgerufen und somit eingesehen werden können (z.B. dein Zahnarzt oder Apotheker könnte von deiner Psychotherapie oder Geschlechtskrankheit erfahren).</p>



<p>Ohne elektronische Patientenakte wirst du, so wie du es bisher kennst und möglicherweise erlebt hast, auf einem Anamnesebogen nach Vorbehandlungen, Medikamentationen, Unverträglichkeiten, Allergien, usw. gefragt. Gegebenenfalls werden weitere Unterlagen angefordert wie z. B. MRT-Aufnahmen, usw. Es gibt auch einen papierbasierten, bundeseinheitlichen Medikationsplan, den du dir ausdrucken lassen kannst. Dieser ist aber auch in der elektronischen Patientenakte speicherbar.</p>



<p>Mit elektronischer Patientenakte kannst du mündlich, über eine App oder über deine Krankenkasse einzelne (ärztliche) Leistungserbringer komplett vom Zugriff auf deine elektronische Patientenakte ausschließen. Dies ist mit gewissen Herausforderungen verbunden. Du hast auch das Recht, gegenüber Leistungserbringern der Übertragung von einzelnen Informationen in die elektronische Patientenakte zu widersprechen. Du kannst einzelne Dokumente auch nachträglich wieder aus ihrer elektronischen Patientenakte löschen (lassen) – leider wieder recht kompliziert. Bedenke, dass Löschungen Nachteile für deine Behandlung nach sich ziehen können.</p>



<p>3. Weitergabe an Dritte: Deine elektronische Patientenakte kann für bestimmte Zwecke auch an Politik und Behörden, Forschende und Wirtschaftsunternehmen (z.B. Technologieunternehmen und Pharmaindustrie) weitergegeben werden. Die Chancen: Anonymisierte Gesundheitsdatenanalysen ermöglichen bedeutende Fortschritte in der Pandemie- und Endemieeindämmung, z. B. durch Früherkennung, sowie in der Forschung, z.B. bei der Entwicklung sicherer Medikamente. Die Risiken: Nur teilweise werden Daten vor der Weitergabe anonymisiert. In anderen Fällen werden dein Name und deine Versichertennummer zwar entfernt, aber über andere Kennzeichen bleibst du eindeutig identifizierbar (sog. Pseudonymisierung). So kann es Dritten gelingen, deine Krankheitsgeschichte wieder dir zuzuordnen.</p>



<p>Hinweis: Auch wenn du die elektronische Patientenakte nutzt, kannst du ihrer Weitergabe an Dritte frühestens ab dem 15.01.2025 separat widersprechen (über eine App deiner Krankenkasse oder durch <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruch-gegen-uebernahme-forschungsdaten/">Brief an ihre Ombudsstelle</a>).</p>



 Ergebnis: Es ist letztendlich deine Entscheidung, ob du&nbsp;eine elektronische Patientenakte haben möchtest oder nicht. 



<p></p>



<p>Wenn du eine elektronische Patientenakte geführt haben möchtest, brauchst du nichts zu tun – sie wird ab 15. Januar 2025 automatisch eingerichtet.</p>



<p>Wenn du dich gegen eine elektronische Patientenakte entscheidest, hilft dir der <a href="https://widerspruch-epa.de/widerspruchs-generator/">Widerspruchs-Generator</a> ein Widerspruchsschreiben zu erstellen. Du kannst auch per Krankenkassen-App oder – bei einigen Krankenkassen – auch <a href="https://www.heise.de/ratgeber/Widerspruch-bei-der-ePA-fuer-alle-Was-bisher-bekannt-ist-9710212.html">über deren Website widersprechen</a>.</p>



<p>Du kannst ab dem Moment widersprechen, in dem deine Krankenkasse dich über dein Widerspruchsrecht informiert hat. Ein Widerspruch ist auch nach Ablauf der in dem Schreiben genannten 6-Wochen-Frist jederzeit möglich; dann werden alle bereits gespeicherte Daten wieder aus der elektronischen Patientenakte gelöscht. Solltest du später einmal deine Entscheidung ändern, kannst du deinen Widerspruch jederzeit wieder zurücknehmen und für die Zukunft eine elektronische Patientenakte bekommen.</p>

Such deletion:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Must delete all mDL information, log information, and any metadata (e.g. settings) that could impart information about the deleted mDL or its use.&nbsp;  Must not require approval by the Issuing Authority.  Must be an option available to an mDL holder on the mDL device  Must be possible when the mDL device is offline.  Should be available to an mDL holder via a request to the Issuing Authority (see below).  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者のデバイスからmDL保持者のmDLを削除する機能を持たなければならない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  すべてのmDL情報、ログ情報、および削除されたmDLまたはその使用に関する情報を与える可能性のあるメタデータ（設定など）を削除すること  発行機関の承認を必要としないこと。  mDLデバイス上でmDL保持者が利用可能なオプションであること。  mDLデバイスがオフラインのときに可能であること。  発行機関（下記参照）へのリクエストにより、mDL保持者が利用可能であること。  <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;デバイスからmDL情報を削除する際の話です。基本的に利用者が自身で削除をすることができること（その際に発行者の承認や接続が不要であること）が求められています。難しいところですね。この章の中で発行したmDL関連情報が適切に扱われていること発行機関が責任をもって確認することが求められる一方で利用者の権利も守らないといけないわけです。まぁ、最低限ウォレット開発者が悪意を持って利用者のデータを扱えないように、というところまでは守りましょう、ってところですね。</p><blockquote><p>Should an mDL device (i.e. a device containing an mDL) be lost or get stolen, it could be beneficial for the mDL holder to have the mDL remotely deleted (or temporarily suspended) by the Issuing Authority. Besides the obvious advantage to the mDL holder, other considerations apply too:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The mDL holder’s request must be authenticated. It must not be possible for someone other than the mDL holder or the Issuing Authority to delete (or suspend) an mDL.  A “push” capability (from the Issuing Authority to the mDL device) is needed for immediate deletion (or suspension) (see section 6).  Successful deletion (or suspension) depends on network connectivity to the mDL device  The mDL will automatically become unusable (although potentially not inaccessible) when the MSO expires (see section 6).&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLデバイス（mDLを含むデバイス）が紛失または盗難に遭った場合、発行機関によってmDLがリモートで削除（または一時的に停止）されることは、mDL保有者にとって有益です。mDL保有者にとっての明らかな利点の他に、他の考慮事項も適用されます：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  mDL保有者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者の要求は認証されなければならない。mDL保持者または発行機関以外の者がmDLを削除（または一時停止）することはできない。  即時削除（または一時停止）には、（発行局からmDLデバイスへの）「プッシュ」機能が必要である（セクション6参照）  削除（または一時停止）の成功は、mDLデバイスへのネットワーク接続に依存します。  MSOの有効期限が切れると、mDLは自動的に使用できなくなる（アクセスできなくなる可能性はないが）（セクション6参照）。  <p></p></blockquote><p>やはりスマートフォンベースの話なので当然紛失や盗難に関する考慮は十分に必要です。</p><p>mDLを利用するときはちゃんと認証するのは当たり前として、発行者から発行済みのクレデンシャルをプッシュ等を使って削除できるようにする、また有効期限切れたらウォレット側で自動的に使えなくする、などもちゃんと気を使う必要があります。</p><blockquote><p>In addition, mDL deletion may be needed when an mDL holder wants to transfer an mDL to a new device, when a person moves to another jurisdiction, or when a person dies.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should weigh the benefits and challenges associated with a remote delete (or suspension) capability when considering its implementation (see Appendix A).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An mDL holder must have the capability to delete activity log information (as defined in section 4.4) the mDL holder may previously have elected to maintain. It is recommended that this capability allows selective deletion (i.e. specific log entries, rather than only an “all or nothing” option).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、mDLの削除は、mDL保持者が新しいデバイスにmDLを移したい場合、別の管轄区域に移動する場合、またはmDL保持者が死亡した場合に必要となる可能性がある。</p><p>発行局は、リモート削除（または一時停止）機能の導入を検討する際、その利点と課題を比較検討する必要がある（付録A参照）。</p><p>mDL保持者は、mDL保持者が以前に保持することを選択した活動ログ情報（第4.4項に定義）を削除する機能を持たなければならない。この機能により、選択的な削除（すなわち、「全削除」オプションのみではなく、特定のログエントリーの削除）を可能にすることが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>mDLを含めデジタルデータを持ち主だけが制御できるようにするのは大切な一方で死亡した場合などの考慮は非常に重要です。マイナンバーカードと保険証の統合をした結果、意識のない救急患者の保険者資格の確認ができない、なんて話も聞きますが、この辺りは例外処理も含めてちゃんとプロセス設計をしておくのが大切です。</p><p>また、ログの削除に関しても選択的に削除することができるようにすべきである、などかなり細かくガイドされている感じがあります。</p><p>4.6.&nbsp;NO TRACKING</p><blockquote><p>“Tracking” is the act of compiling information about an mDL holder and/or an mDL holder’s activity. Any stakeholder (including Issuing Authorities, technology providers, service providers and mDL verifiers) must not track mDL holders or the usage of any mDL except as required by law (e.g. when a drug store dispenses products containing ephedrine).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>「トラッキング」とは、mDL保持者および/またはmDL保持者の活動に関する情報を収集する行為を指します。いかなるステークホルダー（発行局、テクノロジープロバイダー、サービスプロバイダー、mDLベリファイアーを含む）も、法律で義務付けられている場合（ドラッグストアがエフェドリンを含む製品を調剤する場合など）を除き、mDL保持者やmDLの使用状況を追跡してはなりません。</p></blockquote><p>トラッキングの禁止に関する条項ですね。法的根拠なくトラッキングしてはならない、と。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Tracking by an mDL verifier can be performed as soon as two different mDL transactions can be linked to each other. This can be countered by designing the solution to maximize anonymity (“characteristic of information that does not permit a personally identifiable information principal to be identified directly or indirectly”, from ISO/IEC 29100) and to maximize unlinkability. Anonymity can be hampered by metadata that may be associated with multiple mDL transactions, e.g. hardware or network addresses, long-term public keys, or session tokens. Consequently, Issuing Authorities must minimize the sharing of static or long-lived metadata.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL検証者による追跡は、2つの異なるmDLトランザクションが互いにリンクされるとすぐに実行できる。これは、匿名性（「個人を特定できる情報主体が直接的または間接的に特定されない情報の特性」、ISO/IEC 29100より）を最大化し、リンク不能性を最大化するようにソリューションを設計することで対抗できる。匿名性は、複数のmDLトランザクションに関連するメタデータ（ハードウェアやネットワークアドレス、長期公開鍵、セッショントークンなど）によって妨げられる可能性がある。そのため、発行局は静的または長期的なメタデータの共有を最小限に抑える必要がある。</p></blockquote><p>これはSD-JWT-VCでも同じ議論がなされていますが、Verifierの結託によるリンク可能性の話ですね。mdocにおける選択的開示については基本的にSD-JWTと類似の考え方なので単体ではリンク可能性に対する対応はできなかったはずです。そのため匿名性を担保するソリューションを別途検討することが必要とされています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Although pre-matched transactions hold the promise of maximizing anonymity at a user data level, anonymity in post-matched transactions is limited since the portrait image is always shared. For these transactions it is recommended that Issuing Authorities pursue regulatory protection against tracking by mDL verifiers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>事前照合取引は、ユーザー・データ・レベルでの匿名性を最大化することが期待できるが、事 後照合取引では肖像画像が常に共有されるため、匿名性は制限される。このような取引の場合、発行機関はmDL検証者による追跡を防ぐため、規制による保護を追求することが推奨されます。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solutions using the server retrieval method also pose challenges in preventing tracking. As per design, the Issuing Authority is involved in real time each time an mDL is used by the mDL holder. The Issuing Authority would technically be able to keep track of when an mDL holder uses his/her mDL and keep track of what data is shared. Based on IP address analysis the Issuing Authority would also be able to track an mDL holder’s physical location to some extent. This can be mitigated by placing regulatory limitations on the Issuing Authority11, and will be of value to the extent an mDL holder trusts the Issuing Authority’s adherence to the regulatory limitations. Consequently, Issuing Authorities considering a server retrieval solution should carefully weigh the advantages of this approach against its privacy implications.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルを使用するソリューションは、追跡を防ぐという課題もある。設計の通り、発行局はmDL保有者がmDLを使用するたびにリアルタイムで関与します。発行局は技術的に、mDL保有者がいつmDLを使用し、どのようなデータが共有されたかを追跡することができます。IPアドレスの分析に基づき、発行局はmDL保持者の物理的な所在地をある程度追跡することもできます。この問題は、発行局に規制上の制限を設けることで緩和することができます11 。そのため、発行局はサーバー検索ソリューションを検討する際、このアプローチの利点とプライバシーへの影響を慎重に比較検討する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>サーバーリトリーバルは基本的に従来のフェデレーションモデルと同様に発行者への問い合わせが発生するため、トラッキング耐性は低いとされます。この辺りはエコシステムのサイズや参加しているエンティティの関係性などを踏まえて設計していかないといけないポイントですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Since the activity log (see section 4.4) contains a full record of when and potentially where an mDL was used, it is reiterated that access to the activity log must not be possible by anyone other than the mDL holder.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>アクティビティログ（4.4項参照）には、mDLがいつ、どこで使用されたかについての完全な記録が含まれるため、mDL保持者以外の者がアクティビティログにアクセスできないようにする必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>今日もこの辺りにしておきましょう。</p><p><br></p>

As standards in this respect are still under development, each Issuing Authority should take great care to ensure that the design of its solution supports this requirement. At minimum, Issuing Authorities must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、mDL保持者のデバイスに保存されたすべてのmDLデータが適切に保護されていることを確認する必要があります。この点に関する標準はまだ開発中であるため、各発行局はソリューションの設計がこの要件を確実にサポートするよう、細心の注意を払う必要があります。発行局は、最低限以下の事項を遵守しなければなりません：</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;原文でも太字で強調されているとおり、mDL App（ウォレット）に保持されているmDLデータが保護されていることを発行者が確認することが求められています。この責任分解の考え方は非常に重要ですね。欧州でもそうですが発行者となる国が認定したウォレットが必要になるのはこのような背景からきていると思います。しかしこうなるとApple WalletやGoogle Walletに格納されたクレデンシャルが適切に管理されていることをどこまで国は確認できるんだろうか、、、と気になってきますね。</p><p>具体的な要件が続きます。</p><blockquote><p></p>  mDL information must be stored in encrypted form  Private key material must be protected in a security module designed for the safekeeping of key material.  The mDL holder must be authenticated when any mDL data is accessed or released, at a point in time that is sufficiently close (as determined by the Issuing Authority) to the time of the access or release. Issuing Authorities that want to leverage device unlocking to protect mDL data must include measures to ensure that this feature has not been disabled by the mDL holder (also see section 7).  Example: If an app authenticates the mDL holder when the mDL app is accessed, an Issuing Authority should set a time limit after which authentication of the mDL holder is again required before the release of mDL data.&nbsp;  mDL data must be released to an mDL verifier only via the following:   an ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant interface.  an ISO/IEC 18013-7 compliant interface.  As an alternative to ISO/IEC 18013-7, an over-the-Internet interface as envisioned in Appendix C that:   Complies with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f, and&nbsp;  Has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee.    For sharing mDL data between apps on a phone via an interface other than those listed above, an interface compliant with Appendix C items 2.b and 2.f and that has been approved by the AAMVA Identity Management Committee&nbsp;  mDL情報は暗号化された形で保存されなければならない。  秘密鍵は、鍵の保管のために設計されたセキュリティ・モジュールで保護されなければならない。  mDL データがアクセスまたは公開される際には、アクセスまたは公開の時点に（発行局が決定する）十分 に近い時点で、mDL 所持者が認証されなければならない。デバイスのロック解除を活用してmDLデータを保護したい発行局は、この機能がmDL保持者によって無効化されていないことを保証する手段を含める必要があります（セクション7も参照）。  例 アプリがmDLアプリにアクセスしたときにmDLの所有者を認証する場合、発行局は、mDLデータの公開前にmDLの所有者の認証が再度必要となる制限時間を設定する必要があります。  mDLデータは、以下を経由してのみmDL検証者に公開されなければならない：   ISO/IEC 18013-5に準拠したインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7準拠のインターフェース。  ISO/IEC 18013-7 に代わるものとして、付録 C で想定されているインターネット上のインター フェース：   付録Cの項目2.bおよび2.fに準拠し、かつ  AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承認されている。    上記以外のインタフェースを介して携帯電話のアプリ間で mDL データを共有する場合は、付 録 C 項目 2.b および 2.f に準拠し、AAMVA アイデンティティ管理委員会によって承 認されたインタフェース。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p></blockquote><p>かなり細かく要件が決まってますね。EUでも鍵をどこに置くかは色々と議論がありましたが、AAMVAではセキュリティ・モジュールになってますね。クラウドベースのHSMとかは選択肢に入らないのかな？あと、Holderのプレゼンスや認証のタイミング、ウォレットのアンロックが無効化されていないことの確認など色々とガイドがありますがどうやって確認するんだ？？って気もしますが。こうなってきるとやはり専用ウォレットみたいな話になってきそうですねぇ。。</p><blockquote><p>Note 1: This requirement prohibits the sharing of mDL data using the mDL as a “flash pass” (i.e. by showing an image of a credential to a verifier); also see section 8.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>注 1：この要件は、mDL を「フラッシュ・パス」（すなわち、検証者にクレデンシャルの画像を見せること）として使用して mDLデータを共有することを禁止している。</p></blockquote><p>これも重要ですね。以前紹介したパートにも書いてありましたが基本的にmDLは目視で確認するためのものではない、ということですね。</p><p>4.4.&nbsp;ACTIVITY LOG</p><blockquote><p>The mDL app must be capable of maintaining an activity log. The mDL app must allow the mDL holder to decide if an activity log must be maintained or not. It is recommended that the mDL app requires the mDL holder to explicitly choose for or against keeping an activity log upon setup (i.e. no defaults, and in addition to being able to change this subsequently). The activity log and related settings must be accessible only to the mDL holder (also see section 4.6). The activity log must allow for the recording of all mDL transactions. In this context, an mDL transaction is the sharing of information by an mDL holder with an mDL verifier, as well as any provisioning, update, or communication action between the mDL and the Issuing Authority. At minimum, the following must be recordable for any transaction: Transaction timestamp; type of transaction (e.g. update or data sharing); in case of a data sharing transaction the data that was shared, and to the extent that it can be gathered, information about the identity of the mDL verifier. It is recommended that the mDL app provides the mDL holder the capability to select what types of activities are recorded in the activity log (i.e. rather than only an “all or nothing” option). It is also recommended that the mDL app includes functionality to help the mDL holder monitor and manage the size of the activity log within the capabilities of the mDL holder’s device. The mDL app must provide an option to the mDL holder to export the activity log.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを維持できなければならない。mDLアプリは、アクティビティログを保持するかどうかをmDL保持者が決定できなければならない。mDLアプリは、セットアップ時に、mDL保有者がアクティビティログの保持の可否を明示的に選択することを推奨します（すなわち、デフォルトではなく、さらにその後変更できるようにします）。アクティビティログおよび関連する設定は、mDL保持者のみがアクセス可能でなければなりません（4.6項も参照）。アクティビティログは、すべてのmDLトランザクションの記録を可能にしなければならない。ここでいう mDL トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者が mDL 検証者と情報を共有すること、および mDL と発行局との間でプロビジョニング、更新、または通信を行うことである。どのようなトランザクションでも、最低限、以下の情報は記録可能でなければならない： トランザクションのタイムスタンプ、トランザクションのタイプ（更新またはデータ共有など）、データ 共有トランザクションの場合は共有されたデータ、および収集可能な範囲で mDL 検証者の身元に関する情報。mDLアプリは、活動ログに記録される活動の種類を選択する機能をmDL保持者に提供することが推奨される（すなわち、「all or nothing」オプションのみではなく）。また、mDLアプリには、mDL保持者がmDL保持者のデバイスの能力の範囲内でアクティビティログのサイズを監視および管理するのに役立つ機能が含まれることが推奨されます。mDLアプリは、mDL保持者がアクティビティログをエクスポートできるオプションを提供する必要があります。</p></blockquote><p>次はログの話題です。アクティビティログはプライバシーの観点からも非常に重要なものですので、Holderが完全に制御できるものである必要があることが強調されています。この辺りもウォレットソフトウェアを開発する際は留意したいポイントですね。</p><blockquote><p>If an Issuing Authority allows an mDL holder to hold the same mDL on more than one device, the activity log settings on each device should be independent of each other. It is recommended that there be no synchronization of the activity log or activity log settings between the two devices. Any synchronization features that are provided must adhere to the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Synchronization must be an option that can be enabled or disabled by the mDL holder. The process to enable synchronization must require the mDL holder to prove access to both devices.&nbsp;  Synchronization must occur directly between the devices in question. A synchronization action must not give visibility of any of the following to anyone other than the mDL holder, or to anyone other than entities that already know that the mDL holder has an mDL on more than one device:  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>   Activity log information.  Activity log settings.  The fact that a synchronization action/selection took place  Any information that may convey that the mDL holder has an mDL on more than one device.&nbsp;   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局がmDL保持者に複数のデバイスで同じmDLを保持することを許可する場合、各デバイスのアクティビティログ設定は互いに独立しているべきである。2つのデバイス間でアクティビティログまたはアクティビティログ設定の同期は行わないことが推奨される。提供される同期機能は、以下に従わなければならない：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  同期は、mDL保持者が有効または無効にできるオプションでなければならない。同期を有効にするプロセスでは、mDL保持者が両方のデバイスへのアクセスを証明する必要があること。  同期化は、当該デバイス間で直接行われなければならない。同期化アクションは、mDL保持者以外、またはmDL保持者が複数のデバイスにmDLを持つことを既に知っているエンティティ以外の者に、以下のいずれかを可視化してはならない：  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>   アクティビティログ情報。  アクティビティログの設定。  同期アクション/選択が行われた事実。  mDL保持者が複数のデバイスでmDLを使用していることを伝える可能性のあるあらゆる情報。   <p></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;複数デバイスをHolderが使っている場合のログの同期の話です。これもせっかくコンテキストによってデバイスを分けているにも関わらずログが同期されてしまうとコンテキスト違反が起きてしまうことになるのでちゃんと分けましょう、という話ですね。</p><p><br></p><p>今日はこのあたりで。</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p>

 こんにちは、富士榮です。  <br>  引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi85q8IPb56W5CIBBhWuklhFDxdF3kKtk_aGN65-fLtdEYJ5aX1p9So9JtqZQEMRGO4EW6Abqt41KCuQRb77IZFHKhFk-jcVGGWV1ETizuK3OgxNNvxgphB0CMgGG4CJQM3ASdfhzVQobyNMzl_KAXkHKmAcfk7amN5a8iOw9tj0BF657SbWgr4x347eSQs"></a> <br><br>  ようやく4章の「PRIVACY AND SECURITY」に入ります。4章も結構長いんですよね。。。ただ、結構重要な章なので細かくみていきたいと思います。  <br>  4.1.&nbsp;INTRODUCTION <blockquote> The privacy of an mDL holder has been paramount in the mDL design process from the start. Care was and is being taken in all the work to ensure that methods and means are available to protect mDL holder privacy. The subsections that follow elaborate in more detail on different aspects of privacy protection and security. </blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLの設計プロセスでは、当初からmDL保持者のプライバシーが最優先されてきました。すべての作業において、mDL保持者のプライバシーを保護する方法と手段が利用できるよう、細心の注意が払われています。以下のサブセクションでは、プライバシー保護とセキュリティのさまざまな側面について詳しく説明します。</p></blockquote><p>4.2.&nbsp;DATA MINIMIZATION AND SELECTIVE DATA RELEASE</p><blockquote><p>A primary component of privacy involves the ability of an mDL holder to only share some information. This is achieved by two related but distinct measures:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Data minimization: A decision by an Issuing Authority to record fractional information about an attribute in an mDL, thus empowering an mDL holder to share less information than would otherwise have been the case. For example, an Issuing Authority can decide to include9 the optional age_birth_year field in an mDL in addition to the (mandatory) date of birth. This will allow the mDL holder to share only a birth year as opposed to a date of birth. Another example would be to include the resident city in addition to a full address.&nbsp;  Selective data release: Allowing an mDL holder to decide which of the data fields requested by an mDL verifier will be released to the Verifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As noted in section 2, it is important for Issuing Authorities to understand that ISO/IEC 18013-5 primarily specifies interfaces. The interfaces support both data minimization and selective data release. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities implement and provision as many of the optional minimized data elements, defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 and in this document, as possible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>プライバシーの主要な構成要素は、mDL保持者が一部の情報のみを共有する能力である。これは、2つの関連するが異なる手段によって達成される：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  データの最小化：データの最小化：発行局が、mDLに属性情報の一部を記録することを決定すること。例えば、発行局はmDLに、（必須である）生年月日に加え、オプションのage_birth_yearフィールドを含める9 ことができます。これにより、mDLの所持者は、生年月日ではなく、生年のみを共有することができます。他の例としては、完全な住所に加えて、居住地の市町村を含めることができる。  選択的データ公開：mDL保有者が、mDLベリファイアから要求されたデータフィールドのうち、どのフィールドをベリファイアに開示するかを決定できるようにすること。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>セクション2で述べたように、発行局はISO/IEC 18013-5が主にインタフェースを規定していることを理解することが重要である。インターフェースはデータの最小化と選択的なデータ公開の両方をサポートする。発行局は、ISO/IEC 18013-5 および本文書で定義されているオプションの最小化データエレメントを可能な限り実装し、提供することが推奨される。</p></blockquote><p>Privacy by designということです。ISO/IEC 18013-5ではデータの最小化と選択的情報開示の両方をサポートしているので、本書の原則を踏まえてちゃんと実装しなさいよ、と。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In addition, Issuing Authorities must ensure that mDL apps to which they provision data support at least the following:&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  In case the request was received electronically, the mDL app must clearly convey what data was requested, and whether the mDL verifier intends to retain the information. If the request is presented in summarized form in the user interface (e.g. “Identity and driving privilege data” as opposed to “First Name, Last Name, DOB, Driving privileges”), means must be available to give the mDL holder visibility of the details of such a summarized form, both before and during a transaction.  The mDL app must provide the mDL holder full control over which data elements to share with the mDL verifier.&nbsp;  ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait image to be shared if the portrait was requested and if any other data element is released (to enable the mDL verifier to tie the mDL information to the person presenting the information). The app must support a graceful and informed exit from the request if the holder opts not to share the portrait image when requested.  If blanket sharing options are used, measures must be implemented to ensure that the mDL holder remains aware of what is being released when such an option is in effect. An mDL holder must also be able to opt out of or cancel any blanket sharing function.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities (and their app providers) are encouraged to devise solutions that will minimize transaction friction without compromising the above requirements.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>さらに、発行局はデータを提供するmDLアプリが少なくとも以下をサポートしていることを確認する必要があります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  要求が電子的に受信された場合、mDLアプリは、どのようなデータが要求されたのか、またmDLベリファイアがその情報を保持する意図があるかどうかを明確に伝えなければならない。要求がユーザーインターフェースに要約された形で提示される場合（例えば、「姓名、DOB、運転権限」ではなく「身分証明書および運転権限データ」）、取引の前および取引中の両方において、mDL保有者がそのような要約された形の詳細を可視化できる手段を利用できなければなりません。  mDLアプリは、どのデータ要素をmDLベリファイアと共有するかについて、mDL保持者に完全なコントロールを提供しなければならない。  ISO/IEC 18013-5では、肖像画が要求された場合、およびその他のデータ要素が公開された場合、肖像画を共有することが要求されています（mDLベリファイアがmDL情報を提示者に紐付けることを可能にするため）。アプリは、所持者が要求されたときに肖像画を共有しないことを選択した場合、その要求から 潔く、かつ通知された形で抜けることをサポートしなければならない。  包括的共有オプションが使用される場合、そのようなオプションが有効であるとき に、mDL保有者が何が公表されるかを確実に認識し続けるための措置が講じられなけれ ばならない。また、mDLの保有者は、包括的共有機能をオプトアウトまたはキャンセルできなければならない。  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局（およびそのアプリプロバイダ）は、上記の要件を損なうことなく、取引の摩擦を最小化するソリューショ ンを考案することが推奨される。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>データを要求・共有する目的・意図を明確に伝える、そして提供しないことをユーザが選択できるようにする、オプトアウトできるようにもする、と。どれも基本的なことではありますが実装者にとってはどのようなUXを提供するかが腕の見せ所になると重要なポイントの一つでもあります。この辺りは日本でもウォレット開発をする方々も参考にすべき点だと思います。</p><p><br></p><p>細かくみていこうと思うので少し細切れにしていきます。</p><p>ということで今日はここまで。</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) typically seek accreditation to demonstrate their competence and adherence to specific procedures and standards. One prominent accreditation body is the International Accreditation Service (IAS), which provides accreditation based on criteria such as AC803¹². This accreditation involves an assessment of the SDO’s standardization process, procedures, and management system².</p>



<p>In the United States, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredits SDOs that follow a consensus-based process³. This ensures that the standards developed are the result of a transparent, balanced, and inclusive process.</p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続き<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">AAMVAのMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjheuE0pW_Gibv8p14gefJol34or8iPp4a4pWzoPAcrwPFSnEcPxU_72Sm-ExWFQ9t2RCpx7ejVdNdfYlx6MQU7rbTTogPcw_g4eVMbXISy_BXiGxaohW_fWS5bYPAjua61aWqWhPNzM0qgsHk8hW6Nte3ErLLd_z4ctKlIPicw5_BHk-4BqaKmrCO3fdBu"></a> <br>まだ３章が続きますが今回で３章は終わりです。<p></p><p><br></p><p>3.6.&nbsp;IACA ROOT CERTIFICATE</p><blockquote><p>In Table B.1 of ISO/IEC 18013-5, on the table row for the “ISSUER” certificate component, replace:</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>stateOrProvinceName is optional.

This enables readers to always know which version of the data structure is present on a credential since the full data string is always read. This is not true for an mDL. An mDL reader has to explicitly request individual data elements, and does not know in advance which data elements are present or what version of a data set is supported.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA カード設計仕様の 2D バーコードのデータ構造には、バージョン番号が含まれている。これにより、完全なデータ文字列が常に読み取られるため、読み手はデータ構造のどのバージョンがクレデンシャルに存在するかを常に知ることができる。これは mDL には当てはまらない。mDL リーダは個々のデータ要素を明示的に要求する必要があり、どのデータ要素が存在する か、またはデータ・セットのどのバージョンがサポートされているかを事前に知ることはできない。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One approach to address this is to add a “version” data element to the AAMVA namespace. To be useful an mDL reader would have to obtain this data element before making a subsequent request for additional data. Allowing the release of this data element without mDL holder approval is possible; requiring approval may confuse an mDL holder and increase transaction friction. Regardless, the 2-step process would add complexity (an mDL reader would still have to allow for not receiving a response to such a request) and add time to the transaction. Such an approach would also be unique to mDL in North America.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これに対処する1つの方法は、AAMVA名前空間に「バージョン」データ要素を追加することである。mDLの読者は、追加データを要求する前にこのデータ要素を取得しなければならない。mDL保持者の承認なしにこのデータ要素の公開を許可することは可能です。承認を必要とすると、mDL保持者を混乱させ、取引の摩擦を増大させる可能性があります。いずれにせよ、2段階のプロセスは複雑さを増し（mDLリーダーは、そのような要求に対する返答を受け取らないことを許容しなければならない）、取引に時間を要する。また、このようなアプローチは北米のmDLに特有のものである。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Instead, versioning of the AAMVA mDL data element set is achieved as follows:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  If needed, create a new identifier. This applies if there is a change to an existing data element, or if a completely new data element is added. Set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers must support the new identifier (Dayx in Figure 2). “Support” as used here means that an mDL app must allow an Issuing Authority to provision the identifier into the app, and that an mDL reader must be able to read the new identifier.&nbsp;  For the old identifier, set a date by which mDL apps and mDL readers do not need to support the old identifier anymore (Dayy in Figure 2). This is also the date by which Issuing Authorities must be provisioning the new identifier.  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>代わりに、AAMVA mDLデータ要素セットのバージョニングは、以下のように行われる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  必要に応じて、新しい識別子を作成する。これは、既存のデータ要素に変更がある場合、またはまったく新しいデータ要素が追加される場合に適用されます。mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが新しい識別子をサポートしなければならない期日を設定します（図2のDay x）。ここでいう「サポート」とは、mDLアプリが発行機関に識別子をアプリにプロビジョニングできるようにすること、およびmDLリーダーが新しい識別子を読み取れるようにすることを意味します。  旧識別子については、mDLアプリとmDLリーダーが旧識別子をサポートする必要がなくなる日付を設定します（図2のDay y）。これは、発行局が新しい識別子をプロビジョニングする期日でもあります。&nbsp;  <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Figure 2 also reflects other requirements on both the mDL reader and the mDL app. The main advantage of the approach illustrated in Figure 2 is that, in case of changing an existing identifier, the Issuing Authority will have the time between the two dates to provision the new identifier (and deprecate the old identifier) to all its mDLs with the knowledge that mDL readers should be able to accommodate either identifier (the highlighted option in Figure 2). In the case where a new identifier is added (i.e. when there is no change to an existing identifier), the two dates may be on the same day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>図2には、mDLリーダーとmDLアプリの両方に対するその他の要件も反映されています。図2に示されたアプローチの主な利点は、既存の識別子を変更する場合、発行局は2つの日付の間に、mDLリーダーがどちらの識別子にも対応できることを前提に、すべてのmDLに新しい識別子を提供する（古い識別子を廃止する）時間を持つことができることです（図2のハイライトされたオプション）。新しい識別子が追加される場合（既存の識別子に変更がない場合）、2つの日付は同じ日になる可能性があります。</p><p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ideally mDL readers would ask for the old identifier up to Dayy and for the new identifier thereafter. However, it is likely that readers would, at least around the change date, ask for both. It is also likely that an mDL would, especially around Dayy, include both identifiers. How the request is presented to the mDL holder, and how approval to share is administered, is left to implementers. Nevertheless, a simple approach could be for the mDL to present only one request, for the new identifier, to the mDL holder.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>理想的には、mDLの読者はDay yまでは旧識別子を、それ以降は新識別子を要求するだろう。しかし、少なくとも変更日前後には、読者は両方の識別子を要求すると思われる。また、mDLは、特にDayyの前後には、両方の識別子を含むと思われる。どのようにリクエストをmDL保持者に提示し、どのように共有の承認を行うかは、実装者に委ねられている。とはいえ、単純なアプローチとしては、mDLがmDL保持者に提示する要求は、新しい識別子のための1つのみである。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpKZpmtHdpxVCCwwAKMtV_dcR9dTJ0qNOyEf6IeiqWqdvkGzDtfypoVDg1yyriuQFZUYGmH_-6Gwpmnk89D1VB673A4oDmpeJn3Y70AXiEZgh03qvwkd9zgCGiu41f1-Cf-evePqOQvlMxJyfiAfp56dM-gQ34jp1dJYCl-mphywPE6HYyO0or_fUrmhT"></a> <br>バージョニングに関するコンセプトがちゃんとしていますね。リードタイムをうまく作ってスムーズに移行できる様にすることができる様にしています。<p></p><p><br></p>3.8.&nbsp;ISSUING AUTHORITY SPECIFIC DATA<blockquote> ISO/IEC 18013-5 allows for the creation of additional namespaces, in like manner as the AAMVA namespace defined in this document (see clause 7.2.8 in ISO/IEC 18013-5). Issuing Authorities can use this mechanism to add additional fields to an mDL. The Issuing Authority would be responsible for communicating such an additional namespace to mDL verifiers that need to be able to read the Issuing Authority-specific data.

The portrait image therefore needs to be of suitable quality for this purpose. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires the portrait to comply with Annex D of ISO/IEC 18013-2:2020, which in turn requires the portrait image to be at least 192 pixels wide and 240 pixels high. In addition, ISO/IEC 18013-2 requires portrait images intended for automated face recognition to comply with ISO/IEC 19794-5, which among other requirements requires 90 pixels between the centers of the eyes. However, it should be noted that these requirements were created in the context of storage on a physical card and in machine-readable formats with limited storage capacity compared to an mDL.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>肖像画像は、立会取引においてmDLを提示する人物とmDLを照合する主要な手段です。したがって、肖像画像はこの目的に適した品質である必要があります。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、肖像画がISO/IEC 18013-2:2020の附属書Dに準拠することを要求しており、この附属書Dは、肖像画が少なくとも幅192ピクセル、高さ240ピクセルであることを要求している。さらに、ISO/IEC 18013-2は、自動顔認識用の肖像画像について、ISO/IEC 19794-5に準拠することを要求しており、この要件では、特に目の中心間が90ピクセルであることが要求されています。ただし、これらの要件は、物理的なカードへの保存や、mDLに比べて保存容量が限られる機械読み取り可能なフォーマットでの保存を想定して作成されたものであることに留意する必要があります。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It would therefore be possible to include a portrait image of much higher resolution in an mDL. Arguments for going this route include higher accuracy when using the portrait image as a probe image in 1:n biometric searching, and making it easier for a human to compare the portrait image with the mDL holder. Arguments against going this route include the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>従って、mDLにはるかに高解像度の肖像画像を含めることが可能である。この経路をとることへの賛成意見には、1:nの生体認証検索でプローブ画像として肖像画を使用する際の精度が高くなること、人間が肖像画とmDLの所持者を比較しやすくなることなどがあります。このルートに反対する意見には、以下のようなものがあります：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. A larger portrait image can negatively affect mDL transaction times（より大きなポートレート画像は、mDLのトランザクション時間に悪影響を与える可能性があります）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2.&nbsp;A better-quality portrait image could arguably be less privacy preserving than a smaller portrait image.（より質の高いポートレート画像は、より小さなポートレート画像よりもプライバシーの保護に劣る可能性がある）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3.&nbsp;The primary purpose of the portrait image is a 1:1 match with the mDL holder. If this match is performed biometrically, the smaller portrait size should be sufficient.（肖像画像の主な目的は、mDLの所持者と1対1で照合することです。この照合が生体認証で行われる場合は、肖像画のサイズは小さくても十分です）</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Issuing Authorities should carefully consider all these points when deciding on a portrait image size. It is recommended that Issuing Authorities opt for a smaller rather than for a larger portrait image.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>発行局は、肖像画のサイズを決定する際、これらの点を慎重に考慮する必要があります。発行局は、大きな縦長画像よりも小さな縦長画像を選ぶことを推奨します。</p></blockquote><p>結構細かいレベルで顔写真の要件が決まっているんですね。</p><p><br></p><p>3.4.&nbsp;SIGNATURE IMAGE</p><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not prescribe anything other than that the image shall be in JPEG or JPEG2000 format. Building on the requirements for a signature image in ISO/IEC 18013-1 and in the AAMVA Card Design Standard, if present the signature image must be an accurate and recognizable representation of the original signature. Care should be given to image capture, processing, digitization, and compression.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、画像が JPEG または JPEG2000 フォーマットであること以外には何も規定していない。ISO/IEC 18013-1およびAAMVAカード設計基準における署名画像の要件に基づき、署名画像が存在す る場合は、元の署名を正確かつ認識可能な形で表現しなければならない。画像のキャプチャ、処理、デジタル化、および圧縮には注意を払う必要がある。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>3.5.&nbsp;MDL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS</p><blockquote><p>In line with recommendations from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, certain cryptographic constructs must not be supported for mDL solutions built in accordance with this document. At the same time, interoperability needs to be retained so mDL readers can successfully interact with an mDL originating from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>米国国立標準技術研究所（NIST）およびカナダ・サイバーセキュリティセンターの勧告に従い、この文書に従って構築されたmDLソリューションでは、特定の暗号構造をサポートしてはなりません。同時に、mDLリーダーが他の場所から発信されたmDLと正常にやり取りできるよう、相互運用性を維持する必要があります。</p>  To this end, the AAMVA mDL Implementation Guidelines require the following changes to be applied to ISO/IEC 18013-5:  </blockquote><blockquote><p>このため、AAMVA mDL実装ガイドラインでは、ISO/IEC 18013-5に以下の変更を適用することを要求している：</p></blockquote><p>ここも量が多いので割愛しますが、Cipher SuiteをNISTの要求に従って変更したりしていますので、他の国が単純にmdocだからISO/IEC 18013-5に従ってリーダーを実装してもAAMVAのmDLは読めないって言う状態になるんだろうなぁ。。。と思います。</p><p><br></p><p>ということでここまでです。３章がもう少しだけ続きます。</p>

<p>こんにちは、富士榮です。</p><p>引き続きAAMVAの<a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">Mobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4</a>を読んでいきます。</p><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBEDtZGMY8KAvIcWmF_nr7Yae50KCINUkNzovO1xmrtAspfVN2sSwB2GfcvrW57NmqFULeLGPxOnGCZ84E-CSILP6uuEaHW9Rne1Adv0oXwwa3qzw7MXsdEf6PbeBw_42rQJwErsEYbxCQUt3k_3iCGGqOu_76BLge31-ltvFySpfSQ19FBewhEgHSYLcA"></a> <br>今回は２章のmDL Solution Overviewを見ていきます。<p></p><blockquote><p>An mDL can be described as leveraging a mobile device to transfer (or cause to be transferred) driver’s license information to an mDL verifier, who cryptographically authenticates the information using the Issuing
Authority’s public key. A visual rendering of a DL on a mobile device’s display (and which can be misused as a
“flash pass”) therefore does not qualify as an mDL (also see section 8).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL は、発行局の公開鍵を使用して情報を暗号的に検証する mDL検証者に運転免許証情報を転送する （または転送させる）ために、モバイル機器を活用するものと説明できる。したがって、モバイル機器のディスプレイ上に DL を視覚的に表示するもの（「フラッシュパス」として悪用される可能性があるもの）は、mDL として認められない（セクション 8 も参照）。</p></blockquote><p>スクショやオレオレはダメってことですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>An mDL solution can be described in terms of the following three properties:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLソリューションは、以下の3つの性質で説明できる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Data retrieval method. The device retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the offline model) works without outside connectivity (for both the mDL holder’s device and the mDL reader) at the time the transaction takes place, thus requiring the mDL data to reside on the mDL holder’s device. Under the server retrieval method (sometimes referred to as the online model, and not to be confused with use of an mDL in an unattended transaction setting such as over the Internet) mDL data is retrieved in real time directly from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 requires an mDL to support device retrieval, and allows a device to additionally support server retrieval.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. データ検索方式。デバイス検索方式（オフラインモデルと呼ばれることもある）では、取引時に外部（mDL保持者のデバイスとmDLリーダーの両方）に接続することなく動作するため、mDLデータはmDL保持者のデバイスに存在する必要がある。サーバー検索方式（オンラインモデルと呼ばれることもあり、インターネット経由のような無人トランザクションでのmDLの使用と混同されないよう注意）では、mDLのデータは発行機関からリアルタイムで直接取得される。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、mDLがデバイスの検索をサポートすることを要求しており、さらにデバイスがサーバーの検索をサポートすることを認めている。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. Transaction type. An attended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are in close proximity to each other. The engagement mechanisms currently reflected in ISO/IEC 18013-5 (QR code, NFC) were selected to support such close proximity. An unattended transaction is one where the mDL holder and the mDL verifier are not in close proximity, e.g. when an mDL holder wants to provide identity or proof of age to an online retailer. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support unattended transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. トランザクションの種類。対面型トランザクションとは、mDL保有者とmDL検証者が近接しているトランザクションのことである。現在ISO/IEC 18013-5に反映されているエンゲージメントの仕組み（QRコード、NFC）は、このような近接をサポートするために選択された。無人トランザクションとは、mDL 保持者と mDL 検証者が近接していないトランザクショ ンのことであり、たとえば、mDL 保持者がオンライン小売業者に ID または年齢証明を提供する場合などである。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は現在、無人トランザクションをサポートしていない。ただし、ソリューションを標準化する作業が進行中である。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. Timing of (and responsibility for) matching. This property is about the responsibility for confirming, at transaction time, that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the mDL data. In a post-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL data is made after the mDL data is shared and is performed by the mDL verifier. This happens by comparing the portrait image in the mDL with the person presenting the mDL. ISO/IEC 18013-5 supports postmatched transactions. In a pre-matched transaction, the link between the mDL Presenter and the mDL is made right before the mDL data is shared. Although the Issuing Authority should not be involved in real time, the Issuing Authority does take responsibility for certifying the link. The mDL verifier receives only the confirmation that the person presenting the mDL data is the person described by the shared mDL data. ISO/IEC 18013-5 does not currently support pre-matched transactions. However, work is ongoing to standardize a solution (and notably one that does not involve the Issuing Authority at transaction time).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. 照合のタイミング（および責任）。このプロパティは、mDLデータの提示者がmDLデータに記述された本人であることをトランザクション時に確認する責任に関するものである。マッチング後のトランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLデータのリンクは、mDLデータが共有された後に行われ、mDL検証者によって実行される。これは、mDL内の肖像画像とmDL提示者を比較することで行われる。ISO/IEC 18013-5 はポストマッチトランザクションをサポートしている。事前照合トランザクションでは、mDL提示者とmDLのリンクは、mDLデータが共有される直前に行われる。発行局はリアルタイムで関与すべきではないが、発行局はリンクを認証する責任を負う。mDLの検証者は、mDLデータの提示者が共有されたmDLデータに記述された本人であることの確認のみを受ける。ISO/IEC 18013-5は現在、事前照合トランザクションをサポートしていない。しかし、（特にトランザクション時に発行局が関与しない）ソリューションを標準化するための作業が進行中である。</p></blockquote><p>デバイスリトリーバル、サーバーリトリーバルの２方式があること、対面、非対面のシナリオが定義されていること、そして検証者がHolderバインディングを行うことが求められている、ということです。本人確認書類として利用することを考えると当然ですね。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>With this as background, Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the mDL ecosystem described in ISO/IEC 18013-5.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>これを背景に、図1はISO/IEC 18013-5で説明されているmDLエコシステムのハイレベルな概要を示している。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjlRKfp1Zh0yZz5SYXLjnkGDTY3J4rdF0dFbsr3NDGiLK4sQllx_gBpLQHsCgRQRxq3QwFboS6_54Tsfqzw1afoJT3-iI95mHWXrXE1HDvhY2iQrpAAAGXYg3pJqyCIvz6fy5agtv-Rogt03J4w8gbf9HE00N3Rt1CVPCFDReQiQ4hrxKYZz-6_RBFRh_1U"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Three interactions are involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3つの相互作用が関係している：&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. Interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL. This interaction results in getting everything onto an mDL holder’s device that is needed to use the mDL. There is also subsequent interaction between the Issuing Authority and the mDL to keep the mDL information updated. Technical components of this interaction will be standardized in the ISO/IEC 23220 series.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>1. 発行局とmDLの間のインタラクション。このやりとりの結果、mDLを使用するために必要なすべての情報がmDLホルダーのデバイスに取り込まれます。また、発行局とmDLの間には、mDLの情報を更新するための相互作用があります。このインタラクションの技術的なコンポーネントは、ISO/IEC 23220シリーズで標準化される予定です。</p></blockquote><p>Issueの時の仕組みですね。OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuanceでもmdocを扱うことができますので、そちらを非対面のシナリオでは使うケースもありますが、ここではISO 23220が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2. Interaction between the mDL and the mDL reader infrastructure of the mDL verifier. This interaction comprises the transfer of technical information to set up a secure communication channel between the two parties, and the subsequent exchange of the driver’s license information (or of a point from where it can be retrieved) that the mDL holder agreed to share. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2. mDLとmDL検証装置のmDL読み取りインフラ間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、両者間の安全な通信チャネルを設定するための技術情報の転送と、それに続く mDL 保持者が共有に同意した運転免許証情報（またはそれを取得できるポイント）の交換で構成される。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化する。</p></blockquote><p>こちらはPresentationの話ですね。こちらもOpenID for Verifiable Presentationでも対応ができる範囲です。ここではISO 18013-5での対応が挙げられています。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3. Interaction between the mDL reader infrastructure and the Issuing Authority. This interaction can be used for different purposes, depending on the data retrieval method involved:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Device retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier to obtain the public keys needed to authenticate mDL information. Such interaction can also involve an intermediary entity that aggregates and disseminates certificates. (In North America, AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service performs this function – see section 5.) Regardless, the mDL verifier must trust that the certificate truly comes from a valid Issuing Authority. This interaction does not need to occur at the time of an mDL transaction. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes a method supporting this interaction.  Server retrieval method: The interaction is used by the mDL verifier for two purposes:   As in the case for the device retrieval method, to obtain the public key of the Issuing Authority  To pass to the Issuing Authority, in real time, a token that identifies the mDL holder and the mDL, and to receive the actual mDL information back from the Issuing Authority. ISO/IEC 18013-5 fully standardizes an interface describing this interaction   <p></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>3. mDLリーダーインフラと発行局との間のインタラクション。このインタラクションは、関係するデータ検索方法に応じて、異なる目的で使用することができる：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  デバイスの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL 検証者が mDL 情報の検証に必要な公開鍵を取得するために使用される。このようなインタラクションには、証明書を集約し普及させる仲介エンティティが関与することもできる。(北米では、AAMVA のデジタル・トラスト・サービスがこの機能を果たす。） いずれにせよ、mDLの検証者は、証明書が本当に有効な発行機関から発行されたものであることを信頼しなけれ ばならない。この相互作用は、mDLのトランザクション時に発生する必要はない。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、この相互作用をサポートする方法を完全に標準化している。  サーバーの検索方法： このインタラクションは、mDL検証者によって2つの目的で使用される：   デバイス検索方式と同様に、発行局の公開鍵を取得する。  mDLの所有者とmDLを識別するトークンをリアルタイムで発行局に渡し、実際のmDL情報を発行局から受け取ること。ISO/IEC 18013-5は、このインタラクションを記述するインタフェースを完全に標準化している。   <p></p></blockquote><p>ここはデバイスリトリーバルなのかサーバーリトリーバルなのかで異なりますが、mDLリーダーがIssuerへの問い合わせを行うケースについて記載されていますね。いわゆるDIDを使ったVCとの大きな違いはIssuing Authorityが完全に中央集権であることかと思います。（免許なので当然ですね）そのため、検証用の公開鍵を取得する場合は堂々とVerifierからIssuerへのインタラクションが発生しています。（ここは若干プライバシーとのトレードオフはありますが）&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Note that ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies system interfaces and a certificate exchange method, and on purpose does not address the user interface (e.g. the look, feel and functionality of an mDL app residing on an mDL holder’s device). It is left up to Issuing Authorities (and their implementers) to innovate in this area.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5は、システム・インターフェースと証明書交換方法を規定するものであり、ユーザ・イン ターフェース（例えば、mDL保有者のデバイスに常駐するmDLアプリのルック、フィール、機能性）については、 意図的に触れていないことに留意されたい。この分野での技術革新は、発行局（およびその実装者）に委ねられている。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>ということで、本日はここまで。</p><p><br></p>

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先日、<a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/12/blog-post.html">用語を見た</a>ついでにAAMVAが出しているMobile Drivers License Implementation Guidelines 1.4を読んでいこうと思います。  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjSCs0hVWK7schMxMWxX_jNjarDUUlvDhZPWDkVuJSY_CSHh2gdAgW92RcC-0unJodQBwWYdiJj7Inhz0_So2plM4W9fRQ0xb8dQGFtcXoezjCup5Wn5ll9BxKRxVBW0D-UzCxiuZkmyzJFZXWQb-F6IyfGlYGctpLzkUPnQdVb0mzDjvVKfT_wMRMtF1H"></a> <br>  <a href="https://www.aamva.org/getmedia/8d8fbb1f-1ec0-4b25-89a1-b90c36163edb/mdl-implementation-guidelines-v1-4.pdf">こちら</a>が原文です。  <br>  まずはIntroductionから。 <blockquote> The AAMVA Joint Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) Working Group (WG) has been active around mobile identification since 2012. As the mDL evolves, the mDL WG continues to identify and address topics on which guidance to Issuing Authorities can be helpful. This document represents the bulk of the current guidance, and points to additional resources as needed. </blockquote><blockquote><p>AAMVA 合同モバイル運転免許証（mDL）ワーキンググループ（WG）は、2012 年以来、モバイル ID を中心に活動してきました。mDL の進化に伴い、mDL WG は、発行機関へのガイダンスが役立つトピックを特定し、対処し続けています。この文書は、現在のガイダンスの大部分を示し、必要に応じて追加のリソースを示します。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The goal of this document is to inform and equip Issuing Authorities, and to some extent mDL verifiers, to achieve the following:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この文書の目的は、発行局、そしてある程度mDLの検証者に対し、以下のことを達成するための情報を提供し、装備させることです：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  Technical interoperability between different Issuing Authorities’ mDL programs, i.e., an Issuing Authority being able to read an mDL issued by any other Issuing Authority.  Trust in different Issuing Authorities’ mDLs.  Privacy preserving implementations.&nbsp;  異なる発行局のmDLプログラム間の技術的な相互運用性。つまり、発行局は他の発行局が発行したmDLを読むことができる。  異なる発行局のmDLに対する信頼性  プライバシーの保護  <p></p></blockquote><p>まずは目的からですが、アメリカでは州ごとに免許証を発行しているため、相互運用性は非常に重要になってくる、というところだと思います。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It is up to Issuing Authorities to determine the extent to which the guidance in this document is followed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the minimum measures deemed necessary to achieve the above are labeled as mandatory requirements in this document (i.e. “shall” or “must”). A summary of minimum measures can be found in Appendix B.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書のガイダンスにどの程度従うかは、発行当局の判断に委ねられます。とはいえ、上記を達成するために必要とみなされる最低限の対策は、本文書では必須要件（すなわち「しなければならない」または「しなければならない」）と表示されています。最小限の措置の要約は付録Bに記載されています。</p></blockquote><p>先にも書いた通り、州ごとに発行しているのでこのガイドラインの強制力も一定程度にとどまる感じなんですね。確かに後半に出てくるリテンション期間の話や複数枚数の発行の可否などはかなり現場に判断を委ねているところもあります。このあたりは念頭に読み進める必要がありそうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The following topics are outside the scope of this document:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下のトピックは本文書の範囲外です：</p></blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  The identity establishment, management and recordkeeping that precedes the creation of an identity credential.  Responsibilities of mDL verifiers.&nbsp;  </blockquote><blockquote><p></p>  ID クレデンシャルの作成に先立つ、ID の確立、管理、および記録管理。  mDL 検証者の責任。  </blockquote><p>あくまでmDLの発行と管理に関するところがスコープっぽいですね。</p><blockquote><p>This document leverages and expands on ISO/IEC 18013-51 (also available as INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5), an international mDL standard. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5 specifies an mDL solution, it was intentionally designed to support any type of mobile identity credential. ISO/IEC 18013-5, as qualified in this document, will therefore enable Issuing Authorities to issue both mobile driver’s licenses and mobile identification cards.</p><p>The term “mDL” as used in this document covers both credential types. Qualifications made in this document also allow for identifying an mDL as being REAL ID compliant or not, and/or as a credential issued under the Enhanced Driver’s License program (“EDL”; see the AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>本文書は、国際 mDL 標準である ISO/IEC 18013-5（INCITS/ISO/IEC 18013-5 としても利用可能）を活用し拡張したものです。ISO/IEC 18013-5 は mDL ソリューションを規定していますが、意図的にあらゆるタイプのモバイル ID クレデンシャルをサポートするように設計されています。このため、本文書で規定する ISO/IEC 18013-5 により、発行機関はモバイル運転免許証とモバイル ID カードの両方を発行できるようになります。</p><p>本文書で使用する「mDL」という用語は、両方のクレデンシャル・タイプをカバーします。この文書で行われる認定は、mDL を REAL ID 準拠かどうか、および／または拡張運転免許証プログラム（「EDL」；AAMVA DL/ID カード設計基準参照）の下で発行されたクレデンシャルとし て識別することも可能にします。</p></blockquote><p>本書はISO/IEC 18013-5がベースであり、モバイル運転免許証とモバイルIDカードの両方を対象に書かれている、というところが肝ですね。そしてやはりリアルID法に関しても視野に入っています。</p><blockquote><p>Additional guidance on mDL administration in the areas of legislation and procurement can be found in two other documents produced by the mDL Working Group. Those are the mDL Model Legislation, and the mDL Procurement Guidance (see the jurisdictional member area on the AAMVA website). AAMVA also conducts regular outreach to stakeholders on the topic of mDL, including town hall meetings, podcasts, and training.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLに関する法律や調達に関するガイダンスは、mDLワーキンググループが作成した2つの文書に記載されています。これらは、「mDLモデル法案」と「mDL調達ガイダンス」です（AAMVAウェブサイトの管轄メンバーエリアを参照）。AAMVAはまた、タウンホールミーティング、ポッドキャスト、トレーニングなど、mDLに関するステークホルダーへの定期的な働きかけも行っています。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It should be noted that mDL and related technologies are ever evolving. As a result, this document will continue to be updated to synchronize its content with the latest standards and practices. For this reason, readers of this document are encouraged to periodically check the AAMVA website for new versions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLと関連技術は常に進化しています。そのため、本書は最新の基準や慣行と内容を同期させるために更新され続けます。このため、本書の読者は、定期的にAAMVAのウェブサイトで新バージョンを確認することが推奨されます。</p><p></p></blockquote><p>AAMVAのウェブサイトを見ると色々な情報が掲載されていますので、このガイドライン以外にも参照すべき情報は多そうです。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>As a follow-up to the JSONPath module and playground I released <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/11/go-jsonpath-playground/" title="Introducing RFC 9535 Go JSONPath and Playground">last month</a>,
I’m happy to announce the follow-up project, called JSONTree. I’ve implemented
it in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package, and built a <a href="https://webassembly.org" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a>-powered
browser <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsontree/" title="Go JSONTree Playground">playground</a> for it.</p>
 JSONTree? 
<p>While a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> query selects and returns an array of values from
the end of a path expression, a JSONTree compiles multiple JSONPath queries
into a single query that selects values from multiple path expressions. It
returns results not as an array, but as a subset of the query input,
preserving the paths for each selected value.</p>
<p>In other words, it compiles multiple paths into a single tree of selection
paths, and preserves the tree structure of the input. Hence JSONTree.</p>
 Example 
<p>Consider this JSON:</p>

</code>  <p>Note that the original data structure remains, but only for the subset of the
structure selected by the JSONPath queries.</p>
 Use Cases 
<p>A couple of use cases drove the conception and design of JSONPath.</p>
 Permissions 
<p>Consider an application in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list" title="Wikipedia: Access-control list">ACL</a>s define permissions for groups of users
to access specific branches or fields of JSON documents. When delivering a
document, the app would:</p>
 
 Fetch the groups the user belongs to 
 Convert the permissions from each into JSONPath queries 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into an JSONTree query 
 Select and return the permitted subset of the document to the user 
 
 Selective Indexing 
<p>Consider a searchable document storage system. For large or complex documents,
it may be infeasible or unnecessary to index the entire document for full-text
search. To index a subset of the fields or branches, one would:</p>
 
 Define JSONPaths the fields or branches to index 
 Compile the JSONPath queries into a JSONTree query 
 Select and submit only the specified subset of each document to the
indexing system 
 
 Go Example 
<p>Use the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree">github.com/theory/jsontree</a> Go package together with
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a> to compile and execute JSONTree queries:</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
	"github.com/theory/jsontree"
)

func main() {
	// JSON as unmarshaled by encoding/json.
	value := map[string]any{
		"name":  "Barrack Obama",
		"years": "2009-2017",
		"emails": []any{
			"potus@example.com",
			"barrack@example.net",
		},
	}

	// Compile multiple JSONPaths into a JSONTree.
	tree := jsontree.New(
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.name"),
		jsonpath.MustParse("$.emails[1]"),
	)

	// Select from the input value.
	js, err := json.Marshal(tree.Select(value))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>{"emails":["barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>  <p>Note that the index position of the selected email was not preserved. Replace
<code>New</code> with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsontree#NewFixedModeTree" title="github.com/theory/jsontree: NewFixedModeTree"><code>NewFixedModeTree</code></a> to create a “fixed mode” JSONTree that
preserves index positions by filling gaps with <code>null</code>s. Its output of the
above example would be:</p>
  <code>{"emails":[null,"barrack@example.net"],"name":"Barrack Obama"}
</code>   Status 
<p>The public interface of the <code>jsontree</code> module is quite minimal and stable. But
I suspect there may remain some flaws in the merging of JSONPath selectors.
Please report bugs via <a href="https://github.com/theory/jsontree/issues/" title="theory/jsontree: Issues">GitHub issues</a> and I’ll get them fixed up ASAP.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please share and enjoy!</p>

Web security, symbolized<p>Monty Pythons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnciwwsvNcc">parrot sketch</a> is an all time classic because it plays on a very human experience of being defenseless when someone is just blatantly refusing to acknowledge the obvious. Shared reality is a matter of perception, not objective observation. Supported also by various mental biases, including the sunk cost fallacy, and the desire to agree with people we perceive as sympathetic or competent, virtually all humans can fall into this trap. Technical experts on Self Sovereign Identity included.</p><p>Instead of recognizing that the parrot of Web security is deceased, has gone to meet its maker, is pushing up the daisies, some people keep insisting that it is merely napping, and use trinkets and all kinds of strings and wires to hold it&nbsp;up.</p><p>The result is did:tdw, recently rebranded to did:webvh.</p> Web based DID methods belong to the family of federated identity methods, not Self Sovereign Identity <p>Using the web for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) violates some of the basic principles of Self Sovereign Identity, and effectively restricts the possible properties of the system to that of a classic federated identity protocol, such as&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>Federated identity systems have their uses, and are often “good enough” for usage by large corporations and governments. But they also enable and encourage platform strategies, which has dramatic implications for personal usage, as well as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The result has been the Surveillance Industry, and a dependency of 95% of our economy on a few, large platform companies.</p><blockquote>Self Sovereign Identity has been developed as a concept to break that dependency, and give people control over their own privacy, security and data. Instead, thanks to did:web and its descendants, it increasingly looks like an exercise of putting SSI lipstick on the pig of the federated Web.</blockquote><p>You may think this is just hyperbole. So let’s go back to the beginning.</p> About the principles of&nbsp;SSI <p>The design goals of Decentralized Identifiers are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#design-goals">Section 1.2 of the W3C DID specificaton</a>:</p>W3C DID: Design goals for Decentralized Identifiers (DID)<p>So how well do Web based DID methods meet these&nbsp;goals?</p><p>All web based methods, including did:web, did:tdw, did:webvh, and any other web based method anyone might ever come up with depend on a domain name pointing to a web server. The method specific identifier is always being transformed into a HTTPS request. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/next/#the-did-to-https-transformation">DID to HTTPS Transformation</a> is the same for did:webvh as it is for&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#method-specific-identifier">did:web</a>.</p><p>Reaching the correct web server is therefore contingent on access control by the administrator of the web server, the security of the web server, the longevity of the organization operating the web server, the Certificate Authority issuing the certificates identifying the web server, the configuration of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) parameters, and the Domain Name System to identify which web server to&nbsp;contact.</p><p>Users have two&nbsp;choices:</p>  Operate their own web server,&nbsp;or  Use the web server of some organization that provides them their “decentralized” identifier.  <p>The former is the “let them eat cake” of modern technologies.</p><p>Despite many people working for decades to make self-hosting easier and more attractive, self-hosting has been declining. But even if we reverted that trend and enabled and motivated people to self-host with some amazing self-hosting offers: How hard would it be to correlate did:tdw:QmfGEUAcMpzo25kF2Rhn8L5FAXysfGnkzjwdKoNPi615XQ:petermueller.ch to did:tdw:QmdfTbBqBPQ7VNxZEYEj14VmRuZBkqFbiwReogJgS1zR1n:petermueller.ch&nbsp;?</p><p>How difficult would it be to figure out these might both belong to the same person, whose name might be Peter Müller? Especially considering that the web server at petermueller.ch presents a certificate that lists the owner of the certificate to be a “Peter Müller”, and the whois record for the domain lists his full name, address and phone&nbsp;number?</p><p>Which brings us to the second choice, above, which is today’s reality for most people in a federated identity world: Trust the platform intermediary.</p><p>How much decentralization is there in Apple Mail? How decentralized are today’s Certificate Authorities? How much privacy and control do users of Gmail have? How secure are today’s web services? How well does today’s world fare in terms of data protection from compromise and loss? How good is today’s Web security?</p><blockquote>In reality, Web based DID methods give up on Decentralization, Control, Privacy and Security to the same level that today’s federated identity solutions have given up on&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>They use protocols like OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VC &amp; OIDC4VP) because they ARE OpenID methods. Which is why if use cases building on top of Web based DIDs were using truth in labelling, they would inform their users about being based on&nbsp;OpenID.</p><p>But much of the technology world thrives on buzzwords and hypes, and too often, the technical reality is obfuscated by layers of technical complexity and marketing. So the market rarely penalises false advertising.</p>did:web(vh), EV&nbsp;edition<p>Using the Web for “Decentralized” Identifiers and advertising it as revolutionary SSI technology is a bit like selling an “Electric Vehicle” that avoids all the complexities of battery development by using a diesel generator on a towed trailer to power the car. Yes, the propulsion is now electric.</p><p>But is the end result fundamentally better than a diesel&nbsp;car?</p> But what about the added security? <p>When reading about did:webvh, one could get the impression a lot of security is being added. In reality, it's mostly added complexity because everything goes over a single channel, the same one that is being used by did:web, as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>It adds security in the same way that web sites get more secure if you ask users to enter not a single password, but three passwords, subsequently, in the correct&nbsp;order.</blockquote><p>There is a reason no-one does that. Three passwords are not fundamentally more secure, because there is no additional channel. Add a real second factor, and security actually goes up. Which is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</a> has been invented.</p><p>Most likely the Web based DID methods can be developed to the point they will provide actual MFA security at a similar level to today’s federated identity protocols. Maybe did:webvh is even close to that&nbsp;point.</p><blockquote>But that only makes it just as secure as “Login with Google”, today. And it does nothing to make it meet the SSI criteria of Decentralization, Control and&nbsp;Privacy.</blockquote><p>Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this parrot is not just a heavy&nbsp;sleeper.</p> Embrace, Extend, Extinguish <p>So what’s the problem if some people like did:web and its relatives? As long as we are aware of the limitations, and never use it for systems that are supposed to be used in production by end users or SMEs, there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;did:web.</p><p>As I’ve written in a <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/coming-full-circle-how-self-sovereign-identity-could-lose-its-way-069b480c4399">previous article,</a> it’s really useful for rapid prototyping, and can be used as a placeholder during experimentation before switching to a real Decentralized Identifier. We’ve done so ourselves when <a href="https://vereign.com">Vereign</a> has been working on Proof of Concept for the Swiss health sector in 2023. But once we started working on the production system in 2024, we switched to an Autonomous Identifier (AID) that meets the definition of Self Sovereign Identity.</p><p>The problem starts when people put Web based identifiers into production.</p><p>Not only is it an issue of misleading users with false promises of decentralization, control, privacy and security. It runs much deeper than that. Increasing adoption of Web based identifiers under the moniker of Self Sovereign Identity makes it impossible for actual Self Sovereign Identity to differentiate itself from federated identity protocols. It sucks the air out of the room for actual&nbsp;SSI.</p><blockquote>At a technology strategy level, adoption of Web based identifiers makes SSI susceptible to something it was originally designed to prevent: Platform&nbsp;capture.</blockquote>Depiction of did:web(vh) being welcomed by Self Sovereign Identity community<p>Whether accidentally or by design, the movement for Web based identifiers perfectly executes a strategy coined by Microsoft in the 90s, labelled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>. I’ve gotten to study that particular script extensively when coordinating the technical and communication activities of the <a href="https://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> around the EU Microsoft <a href="https://fsfe.org/activities/ms-vs-eu/ms-vs-eu.en.html">antitrust case</a> in order to obtain much needed interoperability information for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.</p><p>The script is not super complicated. First, become a champion of Self Sovereign Identity, embrace it visibly, participate in the conferences, champion it at the political level. Then come up with ideas to extend it, for instance by proposing to speed up adoption by falling back on “proven”” technologies from the Web. Provided enough Kool-Aid, nobody might notice that it violates the principles of SSI and you’ll find many willing participants.</p><p>And lastly, once it has become the dominant flavour to however misleadingly claim the label Self Sovereign Identity, extinguish what is left in terms of actual SSI by aggressively using your economic and political might to push a platform play to suck the air out of the market. While Sovrin had its issues, including political, it undoubtedly lived up to all the SSI principles. Recently, the Sovrin Foundation announced that it was <a href="https://idtechwire.com/the-community-moved-on-sovrin-announces-mainnets-likely-shutdown/">shutting down in March 2025</a> due to its community moving to the&nbsp;Web.</p> So, what’s&nbsp;left? <p>Microsoft had originally championed did:ion, a fully Self Sovereign Identifier based on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> specification. But as of 2023, it unsurprisingly also <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/verified-id/verifiable-credentials-faq#does-microsoft-entra-verified-id-support-ion-as-its-did-method">switched to did:web</a>. Old habits die hard. Other large tech platforms are also pushing in the same direction, as are several of the former governmental monopolists with strong political ties, such as T-Systems.</p><p>The most promising design for a decentralized identifier is the <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, and at conceptual level it solves some very hard problems that no other method even attempts to address. The problem is how long it has been the promising next thing, without achieving sufficient adoption, and without finding its way into the regulatory documents in the European Union <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS (for “electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services”)</a> working group, which is strongly pushing in the direction of Web based identifiers.</p><blockquote>Unsurprisingly, technical experts have raised <a href="https://www.cryptomathic.com/blog/key-vulnerabilities-of-eudi-arf">security</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/200">privacy</a> concerns. In fact, it seems the current draft of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/Technical+Specifications">EU Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF)</a> may be in violation of the EU privacy provisions it is supposed to&nbsp;provide.</blockquote><p>Also, and it’s already been a topic in the <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/dice-2024-retrospective-b20372f13a65">DICE2024 retrospective</a>, KERI is currently available in Python only. Which leaves adoption hamstrung. Not everyone in the KERI community agrees with that, but I’m aware of a number of people and initiatives who would love to adopt KERI, but not in Python. And its completeness as a concept puts the effort required for implementation in another language outside what is feasible for any of these parties individually.</p><p>So, when looking at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/#comparison-of-did-methods">W3C DID Traits</a> draft, the table looks pretty bleak, with two actual SSI methods left on it: did:key and did:peer. Both limited in relation to quite a few use&nbsp;cases.</p> What we ended up&nbsp;doing… <p>We anticipated this picture when designing our use case and solution for the Swiss health sector back in January 2024. The Web identifiers were obvious non-starters, as were did:key and did:peer, due to them being overly limited for our&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We also did not like the idea of putting Python into a mission critical production application for large number of users. Especially since we did not want to put Python on the phone, and also did not want remote wallets that do not actually live on the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>So we did what XKCD told us <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">not to do</a>. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>EDIT ON 3. March 2025: The follow-up is finally available at <a href="https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f">https://ggreve.medium.com/a-future-for-self-sovereign-identity-c237caa5e46f</a></p>

 “Extermination &amp; Acts of Genocide”: Human Rights Watch on Israel Deliberately Depriving Gaza of Water 

 AMY GOODMAN: So, can I ask you, Bill Van Esveld, is this the first time that Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza? 

 BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have no

<p>BILL VAN ESVELD: This is the first time that we’ve made a finding of genocidal acts in Gaza. It is not an accusation that we level lightly. We have not done this very often in our history. We accused the Myanmar military of genocidal acts against the Rohingya in 2017, and we found full-blown genocide against the Kurds in Saddam Hussein’s Anfal campaign in Iraq in the ’80s — sorry, in the ’90s, and we found genocide against — also in Rwanda in the ’80s. It is, you know, an extremely difficult crime to prove. It is, you know, mass killing deliberately to destroy people because they’re part of the group, not something we level lightly, but, yes, we found it here.</p>

They are issued in a secure process, and include technology that makes travel easier. EDLs are a low-cost, convenient option for entering the United States from Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, in addition to serving as a permit to drive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>強化運転免許証（EDLs）は、自動車で米国国境を越える際に身分証明と米国市民権を証明する州発行の強化運転免許証である。EDLは安全なプロセスで発行され、渡航を容易にする技術も含まれている。EDLは、カナダ、メキシコ、カリブ海諸国から陸路または海路で米国に入国する際に、低コストで便利なオプションであり、運転許可証としての役割も果たす。</p></blockquote><p>使い道としては2025年から施行されるReal ID法（州が発行する運転免許証や身分証明書に対して最低限のセキュリティ基準を定めるもの）に対応したものっぽいです。米国国内で飛行機に乗るときにReal ID法に準拠した身分証明書の提示が必要になる、って話です。（日本人は外国政府発行のパスポートを使うことになると思います）</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>mDL。いわゆるMobile Driver's License、モバイル運転免許証ですね。</p><p>こんな解説が書いてあります。</p><blockquote><p>driver’s license or identification card that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the related information</p><p>Note to entry: Adapted from ISO/IEC 18013-5</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>運転免許証または身分証明書であって、モバイル・デバイス上に存在するもの、または入国時に 関連情報にアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とするもの： ISO/IEC 18013-5 からの引用。</p></blockquote><p>まだ18013-7:2024と18013-5:2021の差分をとれていませんが、AAMVAとしては18013-5ベースです。</p><p><br></p><p>mDL app。いわゆるWalletに当たるものですね。</p><blockquote><p>software running on an mDL holder’s device; within the context of this document this includes a standalone app as well as a wallet type app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDL保持者のデバイス上で動作するソフトウェア。本書の文脈では、スタンドアロン型アプリおよびウォレット型アプリを含む。</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mdoc。クレデンシャルフォーマットがmdoc、運転免許証として使えばmDLっていう整理でいいのかと思います。</p><blockquote><p>document or application that resides on a mobile device or requires a mobile device as part of the process to gain access to the document or application</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>モバイル・デバイス上に存在する、または文書やアプリケーションにアクセスするためのプロセスの一部としてモバイル・デバイスを必要とする文書またはアプリケーション</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>mobile security object。MSOなんて言われたりします。mdocの構造化されたデータセットの話です。中にはデバイスアテステーションなども含まれるのでHolderバインディングの保証をすることが目的とされます。</p><blockquote><p>structured data set that enables an mDL verifier to authenticate (for both accuracy and origin) other mDL data elements received during an mDL transaction</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLベリファイアが、mDLトランザクション中に受信した他のmDLデータエレメントを（正確さと出所の両方について）認証できるようにする構造化データセット</p></blockquote><p><br></p><p>provisioning。これは特殊用語lじゃないのかな？と思うのはIdentity界隈の人だからなのかもしれません。</p><blockquote><p>initial loading of mDL information into an mDL app</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>mDLアプリへのmDL情報の初期読み込み</p></blockquote><p>要するにウォレットへのモバイル運転免許証をインストールすることですね。</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>ということで、まずは用語解説からでした。</p><p>概念を理解するためにもこのあたりはちゃんと押さえておきましょう。&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

  パプアニューギニア   オーストラリアに続いて「特定のソーシャルメディア・プラットフォーム」の年齢保証を法制化する計画を発表した  政府のデジタルトランスフォーメーション・リーダーであるスティーブン・マタイナホ氏は、「詐欺、違法な商品の流通、人身売買、偽情報、サイバーハラスメントの増加が懸念されている」ため、「有害なコンテンツから子どもを守る」ためだと主張している  大人も「年齢制限のあるコンテンツ」にアクセスする際には、強制的なデジタルID（SevisPassとして知られる）を使用する必要がある  <a

  フランス   大手携帯電話会社4社（ブイグ・テレコム、フリー、オレンジ、SFR）は、オンラインビジネスのためのデジタルID認証を改善するために手を組んだ。  ここでは相互運用性が重要であり、事業者はモバイルネットワーク間の仕様を統一するために2つの新しいAPIを導入している。これらは、Linux Foundationによって開発されたオープンソースプロジェクトであるCAMARA標準に基づいている  <a

  英国   英国内務省は、英国への入国を申請する外国人を対象に、スマートフォンを使った遠隔および対面での生体指紋採取の試験実施を計画している  しかし、パスポートの生体指紋データは現在、拡張アクセス制御（EAC）によって保護されており、EU加盟国の当局しか読み取ることができないことを考えると、この計画の実現性には懸念がある  一方、遠隔地からの指紋採取は、AIを利用した詐欺の影響を受けやすいというセキュリティ上の懸念もある  <a

  ケンブリッジ・オルタナティブ・ファイナンス・センター（CCAF）   新しい調査によると、60の国・地域がオープン・バンキングに関連する法律や規制を導入している。  このうち44の法域では、金融サービス業界内の競争が導入の主な要因となっている  また、オープン・バンキングのアプローチには地域差があり、欧州、中央アジア、中東、北アフリカでは規制主導のアプローチが主流である一方、サハラ以南のアフリカやアジア太平洋地域では市場主導のアプローチが一般的である  <a

こんにちは、富士榮です。 <br>  先週はTaiwan Digital Identity Wallet International Forumで登壇してきましたので、キーノートとしてお話した内容をメモしておきたいと思います。  イベントについてはこちら  <a href="https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html">https://idmlab.eidentity.jp/2024/11/taiwan-digital-wallet-international.html</a>  <br>  <br>   <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgLdUITMo8-0WkN9eDPJPAeSBVYxbJlZtXx7dCVQPLVArTRWr9jbnobZOXl7rVLRBMZkDRDsWJTzXG41M3cu1akZPLKjFhulfjbL3A8QA4ANSNLOPMoyKLb5JHQYoGySeLTNKL0Fi2yS4-4oe5AUIdiDo1cMSDlgvbsWpaGQi1WJdwJULHo-uwAbptt6OO7"></a> 自己紹介は置いておいて、テーマは相互運用性でした。 <blockquote>  As you know, the Digital Identity Wallet has recently become an emerging topic in the digital identity space. For example, the European Committee has started implementing the European Digital Identity Wallet, which allows citizens to bring their own digital identity documents, such as national ID cards or mobile driver's licenses. At the same time, interoperability is essential for adopting these wallets in the real world because we have an existing ecosystem without the digital identity wallet today.  So, today’s my talk is about interoperability between current identity ecosystems and a Digital Identity Wallet.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>ご存知のように、デジタルIDウォレットは最近、デジタルID分野で新たなトピックとなっています。例えば、欧州委員会は欧州デジタルIDウォレットの導入を開始しました。これにより、国民は国民IDカードや携帯電話運転免許証などのデジタルID文書を携帯できるようになります。同時に、現実世界でこれらのウォレットを採用するには相互運用性が不可欠です。なぜなら、今日、デジタルIDウォレットのない既存のエコシステムが存在しているからです。</p><p>そこで、本日の私の講演では、現在のアイデンティティ・エコシステムとデジタル・アイデンティティ・ウォレット間の相互運用性についてお話します。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiA3n4-wCR4DNYo_k3sK3z-I4R5-SaDuVUF8Zslk_xqZDA6GQUZ3Dt2O5q3vc3zXbzT0s-gbMATmbaPywiwnZv57PiofbMYQJU16YjB5906Jmu5j0ehK6xfYS2tUUinvbtqsfrZmYKWpy6s85tSjhZcXSkn_32zVAM0sB0sETtHGtIwRt_IFOPGTSK3_xZb"></a> <br> <blockquote>  First, let’s think about our current situation when considering the term “interoperability.”  Since the fall of the Tower of Babel, we have been living in a world divided by different languages, different tribes, different cultures, and different social systems.  In other words, we have been living in a world where we have not been able to communicate well for a long time. This continued until the Age of Exploration, when trade between countries worldwide became more active.  For people like me who have lived in Asia, we have lived in a world that is very different from Western languages and cultures, and we are still living behind language barriers.  However, since the spread of the Internet began in the 1990s, the breakdown of regional divisions, including countries, has started. We have finally been freed from the constraints of physical location, and the need to communicate globally has arisen.  So, did a technology break down these barriers to allow us to communicate and trade freely globally?  </blockquote><blockquote><p>まず、「相互運用性」という言葉について考える前に、現在の状況について考えてみましょう。</p><p>バベルの塔が崩壊して以来、私たちは異なる言語、異なる部族、異なる文化、異なる社会制度によって分断された世界に生きてきました。</p><p>つまり、私たちは長い間、うまくコミュニケーションを取ることができない世界に生きてきたのです。この状況は、大航海時代を迎え、世界各国間の貿易が活発になるまで続きました。</p><p>私のようにアジアで生活してきた人間にとっては、西洋の言語や文化とはまったく異なる世界で生きてきましたし、今でも言葉の壁に阻まれて生活しています。</p><p>しかし、1990年代からインターネットが普及し始め、国を含めた地域的な区分が崩れ始めました。私たちはようやく物理的な場所の制約から解放され、グローバルにコミュニケーションを取る必要性が生じてきたのです。</p><p>では、こうした障壁を打破し、世界中で自由にコミュニケーションや取引ができるようになった技術は登場したのでしょうか？</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi5y9anTn_NhSR-d4KY5iBnhoJg5ukODYAT_19gYSWnWqoC3GO47P0ybB5WPxL3k3umxO0z8joXuwN0R-OKCXXpfGUk3qUe5P0tEW1JYG2SfB009l6ztXWS8C2Da0P_wZAs7LzTEPlW-7Yy5PPgVfQa7wNNWrAYdS6gJ4HE_S9K7L_LVudbB6qGz3T2KND5"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  At the moment, the answer is no.  We are currently living in a world divided by silos created by technology.  Even now, to transfer data freely across systems, we have to design and implement interfaces between systems each time, and even when it comes to identity, which is the theme of today's talk, it is still managed on a system-by-system basis. We often have to manage multiple accounts for each systems.  </blockquote><blockquote><p>現時点では、答えはノーです。</p><p>私たちは現在、テクノロジーによって作られたサイロによって分断された世界に生きています。</p><p>今でも、システム間でデータを自由にやりとりするためには、その都度、システム間のインターフェースを設計し実装しなければなりませんし、本日のテーマであるアイデンティティにしても、システムごとに管理されています。 システムごとに複数のアカウントを管理しなければならないこともよくあります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote>  <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjc3RHuXPN49Srpkp-ay7jH8qc8-AcVI5zU8YgT-PhPezrvj357_jwm2aj43ei3VTGSKcaxzBEnyZZOe8aL6pWCuYZAbeyMPWoeDoEJIIm8L-ooSZGMOIqh69lVyCfb7M2Dx9RK5wBQwzpRh6BU8Q75DQXhwYUroOMt921Nenn6_UdEjbgwJLLTn52Zarct"></a> <br><br> <blockquote>  We need a way to communicate across countries, jurisdictions, and systems.  And we already know of some examples that have been developed to some extent.  Email can be delivered anywhere in the world without a centralized system, and the telephone system allows us to make calls to people worldwide. In these systems, we can communicate without depending on the email user agent or telephone type.  Also, in the real world, we use passport to identify people on traveling to other countries.  Those of us involved in digital identity need to follow the example of these previous cases and work to create a world where interoperability is guaranteed.    国や管轄区域、システムを越えてコミュニケーションを行う方法が必要です。  そして、ある程度まで開発された例がすでにいくつか存在しています。  電子メールは中央集権的なシステムなしで世界中のどこへでも配信できますし、電話システムは世界中の人々との通話を可能にしています。これらのシステムでは、電子メールユーザーエージェントや電話の種類に依存することなくコミュニケーションを行うことができます。  また現実の世界では、パスポートを使って他国への渡航者の身元確認を行っています。  デジタルアイデンティティに関わる私たちは、これらの過去の事例を手本とし、相互運用性が保証された世界を実現するために取り組む必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhslNQ8t7ykKyYZ4KsncE8XYjiqmEZrVn2iEer_BlhMTAjRVDzlVNpybLpv2xlxLlmOx-OvShv6X7a_BC8Vg62RvBnNDAKTYtaGD0Jo4QoJod9GEqlzkPbq3AeKWYqis0TTPbrLnZOOvp3yeWDbXgS4PqaCAcIP1d8rr7Vkge8x19y4qQ1Mfh1rhnIO-W-K"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>And digital identities are not just for natural persons. There are various things in the real world, such as IoT devices and legal entities, are connected to the internet, and daily business transactions are carried out. Now is the time to design and implement a system so that all digital identities can be mutually operated with minimal friction.</p> また、デジタルアイデンティティは自然人だけのものではありません。現実世界には、IoTデバイスや法人など、さまざまなものがインターネットに接続され、日常的な商取引が行われています。今こそ、すべてのデジタルアイデンティティが相互に最小限の摩擦で運用できるようなシステムの設計と実装を行うべき時なのです。 </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqKIO8M86eL17l9NBAcUA36CHs6y2pOvo5uw0MnzSg1uwZMtKZcZ18JgGGkt4h1SkX0m4FvDqlNUxIAArC8lT0PHIoKjrQ8JMljwhDR89WXx44XfmhcnzPFvX-MHPFf9Mamjuwasmn4T6Ka2rdUP_7G7HznrDEg5jv0ga1xtQtqD-gIXJgWkmXjdyK5hss"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Let's now take a closer look at interoperability. Even though we use the word 'interoperability,' it can be roughly divided into technical and non-technical aspects. When many engineers talk about interoperability, they often only focus on the technical side, but it is also essential to consider the non-technical side.</p><p>First, let's look at the technical aspects. We must consider the identifier format, transfer protocol, and data model, including the schema and signature algorithm.</p><p>In addition, on the non-technical side, we need to agree on the semantics that expresses what meaning the exchanged data has, the rules and framework within which the data is generated, and the trust framework that ensures the reliability of the entity state, etc.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at each of these elements from the next slide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>それでは、相互運用性について詳しく見ていきましょう。相互運用性という言葉を使っていますが、大まかに技術的な側面と技術的ではない側面に分けることができます。多くの技術者が相互運用性について語る場合、技術的な側面のみに焦点を当てがちですが、技術的ではない側面も考慮することが不可欠です。</p><p>まず、技術的な側面について見ていきましょう。識別子のフォーマット、転送プロトコル、データモデル（スキーマや署名アルゴリズムを含む）を考慮する必要があります。</p><p>さらに、技術面以外の側面では、交換されたデータがどのような意味を持つのか、データが生成されるルールや枠組み、エンティティの状態の信頼性を確保する信頼フレームワークなどを表現するセマンティクスについて合意する必要があります。</p><p>それでは、これらの要素について、次のスライドから詳しく見ていきましょう。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhvFDgGZXLcax7V5-cA-q2Q2oXP0vSu_GzbeW3UwM9ZuBw8PXahIh7W7PWksvkZ-tQ8OolqYXGSbHEBSdBIJGZSOVsBpJcH093UlZohL6M7aZW7WUbz8Tm47xtppP-41MPpW8S4saIXVRKfykMWdfrE6qK5uUyXFzfGr_34uvJbuB4wwuDa8on4uckjbwj7"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>First of all, let's talk about identifiers. An identifier is an attribute identifying a particular entity within a specific set. This attribute can be a single attribute or multiple attributes.</p><p>The design of the identifier depends on the size of the set that contains the target entity. For example, designing an identifier within a local set differs significantly from creating one within an international or global set. For example, my family name is Fujie, but there may be no one else in this room with the same family name. In this situation, my family name could function as an identifier. However, when I go home to Japan, my family name does not function as an identifier because, as you know, all of my family members have the family name Fujie.</p><p>Finally, it is essential to consider privacy and persistence when considering identifiers. For example, suppose control of an identifier is taken away from you. In that case, there is a possibility that control over the identity information linked to that identifier will also be taken away from you. Also, suppose you are logged in to multiple services using the same identifier. In that case, there is a possibility that the services will collide with each other and merge your attribute information in an unintended way. To deal with such cases, it may be necessary to devise ways to ensure that users use different identifiers.</p><p>On the other hand, if users are not allowed to use the same identifier for an extended period, they may not be able to use the service continuously or may not be able to access past data.</p><p>From the perspective of interoperability, it is necessary to design systems that can correctly identify entities while considering privacy and persistence, not only in the current but also in a broader set in the future.</p><p>Identifiers may seem simple, but they must be designed very carefully.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;まず、識別子についてお話しましょう。識別子とは、特定の集合内の特定のエンティティを識別する属性です。この属性は単一の属性であることも、複数の属性であることもあります。</p><p>識別子の設計は、対象のエンティティを含む集合の規模によって異なります。例えば、ローカルな集合内で識別子を設計することは、国際的またはグローバルな集合内で設計することとは大きく異なります。例えば、私の姓は富士榮ですが、この部屋には同じ姓の人は誰もいないかもしれません。このような状況では、私の姓は識別子として機能するでしょう。しかし、私が日本に帰国した場合、ご存知のように私の家族全員が富士榮という姓なので、私の姓は識別子として機能しません。</p><p>最後に、識別子を考える際には、プライバシーと永続性について考慮することが不可欠です。例えば、ある識別子の管理が自分から奪われたとします。その場合、その識別子と紐づけられたID情報についても管理が奪われる可能性があります。また、同じ識別子を使って複数のサービスにログインしているとします。その場合、サービス同士が衝突し、意図しない形で属性情報がマージされてしまう可能性がある。このようなケースに対応するためには、ユーザーに異なる識別子を利用させる工夫が必要となる可能性があります。</p><p>一方で、長期間にわたって同一の識別子を利用できないと、サービスを継続的に利用できなくなったり、過去のデータにアクセスできなくなったりする可能性があります。</p><p>相互運用性の観点では、プライバシーや永続性を考慮しつつ、現在だけでなく将来にわたって、エンティティを正しく識別できる仕組みを設計する必要があります。</p><p>識別子は一見単純に見えるが、非常に慎重に設計しなければいけません。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiKAB88-R_zRe_U7x8Bg9R4RIL98VLqqc-BLoHNVl0MNXyFjhF1cCDK02M9KyJRJ0-RYlrHLDylKmnUDAr84p6R5VS_xyn4o4jSORmYaf2BwduEgtainFdpQoF-23OBAj-GottskC-jd0r8qEsZTO0IuLgRjrdsyBGzBenVQKD-3rH1i495lXHsh6P4JvE_"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote>  Next, we will consider transport protocols. Transport protocols define the methods by which entities communicate with each other. In the context of digital credentials, transport protocols include issuing credentials to wallets, presenting credentials to verifiers, and revoking issued credentials by issuers.  To ensure interoperability, the multiple issuer, wallet, and verifier components must communicate using a method that has been agreed upon in advance.  次に、トランスポートプロトコルについて検討します。トランスポートプロトコルは、エンティティが相互に通信する方法を定義します。デジタルクレデンシャルの文脈では、トランスポートプロトコルには、クレデンシャルをウォレットに発行すること、クレデンシャルをベリファイアに提示すること、発行者によって発行されたクレデンシャルを取り消すことが含まれます。  相互運用性を確保するには、複数の発行者、ウォレット、ベリファイアのコンポーネントが、事前に合意された方法で通信する必要があります。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjurXoMAA89tiSW9Esp45fMx0C7A7DsZ71iIG-vx3-lbEZ4i8saprScEXHgtmUszZ6vjEFDPLIk_Ma1l07_gpImkTclXvPCq7z6vul9AzK07R5p7HFwu3OCNyWRt6XUnjHpQEPAZ99Bnv1HwIWHxtgC2hVypArM6Y7hg8thjOLDTrp_f-ZNCesuXx3TPtaJ"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Let's also consider data models. Schemas need to take into account the types and namespaces of attributes. Generally, gender is expressed using letters such as M and F, but in some cases, it is expressed using numbers such as 0 and 1. In addition, the attribute name family_name is sometimes used to express the family name, and the attribute name surname is sometimes used. In any case, related entities must agree on the names and types of attributes to achieve interoperability.</p><p>The algorithm used for digital signatures is also a very important factor. In general, it is necessary to verify digital signatures to verify the authenticity of digital credentials. Still, verification will not be possible if the issuer uses a signature algorithm that differs from what the verifier expects. Agreement on the signature algorithm is significant to avoid this.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>データモデルについても検討してみましょう。スキーマでは、属性のタイプと名前空間を考慮する必要があります。一般的に、性別はMやFなどの文字で表現されますが、場合によっては0や1などの数字で表現されることもあります。また、姓を表現する際に、属性名family_nameが使用されることもあれば、surnameという属性名が使用されることもあります。いずれにしても、相互運用性を実現するには、関連するエンティティが属性の名称とタイプについて合意する必要があります。</p><p>電子署名に使用されるアルゴリズムも非常に重要な要素です。一般的に、電子証明書の真正性を検証するには、電子署名を検証する必要があります。しかし、発行者が検証者が期待するものと異なる署名アルゴリズムを使用している場合、検証は不可能です。これを回避するには、署名アルゴリズムについて合意することが重要です。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiqXwHjBUQPgKQva9Rl3AtSHknkrvp1Zw1fICZSRflbltVKS-iUNopss3fhEE0pAzlG1vllNohrkqVY9EGH3eZN8YRhLcH022GVPTa4tqcpFfOQik6eVKo_RDx9HZS9-Q5WLl_0Biso3ngi6Aeo5DJkVtKS_v6d722m96se-n61u0E3B-TcvWKZxFJPRUAQ"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>As we have seen, reaching an agreement on identifiers, transport protocols, and data models is essential to achieve interoperability.</p><p>Many standardization organizations are working to develop standard specifications to facilitate this agreement. For example, the W3C has developed a specification called Decentralized Identifiers for identifiers, and the OpenID Foundation has developed a protocol for exchanging credentials called the OpenID for Verifiable Credenitals Issuance and the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations. The W3C and IETF have also formed working groups to create data models.</p><p>However, as you can see from this table, the current situation is that multiple standardization bodies are trying to develop their standard specifications. In this situation, no matter how much implementers adopt a standard, achieving interoperability with entities that use a different standard will not be possible.</p>  これまで見てきたように、識別子、通信プロトコル、データモデルについて合意に達することは、相互運用性を実現するために不可欠です。  多くの標準化団体が、この合意を促進するための標準仕様策定に取り組んでいます。例えば、W3Cは識別子としてDecentralized Identifiersと呼ばれる仕様を策定しており、OpenID FoundationはOpenID for Verifiable Credenitals IssuanceおよびOpenID for Verifiable Presentationsと呼ばれる認証情報の交換プロトコルを策定しています。また、W3CやIETFでもデータモデルのワーキンググループが結成されています。  しかし、この表から分かるように、現状では複数の標準化団体が標準仕様を策定しようとしている状況です。このような状況では、実装者がどれだけ標準を採用しても、異なる標準を採用する主体との相互運用性を実現することはできません。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEilbEkeJdb2kcQZfcv10z18NLDNv1Pl4RX7B10rMRAX9od9ao7ryXE9HoVYoP-hiUjKegB6fKg6h30XvcSd-zCBvlKPOXEo9wwXIdx--LT-GPbQEDHW3dcTCCSYEVGOLIdYMg4Qe4YWWqiu0s21x9n9Zz-BYSBAFK8Ka8Q74uLH5QVyayvTx0JK2e1YDaAd"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>Due to the situation explained in the previous slide, some people are defining and using profiles that combine multiple standards.</p><p>It is not realistic to reach agreement on the identifiers, transfer protocols, and data models for each entity. Therefore, we develop profiles that combine specifications for specific identifiers, specific transfer protocols, and specific data models, and the relevant entities agree to use these profiles.</p><p>This allows us to reduce the need for individual coordination between entities.</p><p>This approach is also used in the European Union, and the OpenID Foundation provides a profile called the High Assurance Interoperability Profile, or HAIP.</p><p>前スライドで説明した状況により、複数の標準を組み合わせたプロファイルを定義し使用する人もいます。</p><p>各エンティティの識別子、転送プロトコル、データモデルについて合意に達することは現実的ではありません。そのため、特定の識別子、特定の転送プロトコル、特定のデータモデルの仕様を組み合わせたプロファイルを開発し、関連するエンティティがこれらのプロファイルの使用に同意します。</p><p>これにより、エンティティ間の個別の調整の必要性を減らすことができます。</p><p>このアプローチは欧州連合でも採用されており、OpenIDファウンデーションは、高信頼相互運用性プロファイル（HAIP）と呼ばれるプロファイルを提供しています。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgSGvzsoHhoidu-I3gEgFtwFJm5ygL22FWryBvgtnoDade5QnwMaicJlQcoYM0vrbHseMYY-XBJHL-I29lIofEZIwHjcrYWR-GpDnNJJh5aYfmYTOT6-cPd8unACf2NsLW4OZXAch41JsYk4AMQ8iPwGvx4xyppQvDXhQ0W0es2A_ZZCdtbQJlYPqaWE1P9"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>From this slide, I would like to consider the non-technology elements.</p><p>First of all, there is semantics. Suppose you receive a digitally signed credential. If you can only verify the signature, can you trust the information contained in the credential? I think it is difficult.</p><p>In other words, a digital signature only proves that the data has not been tampered with by a third party, and does not prove the reliability of the data itself or the reliability of the entity that sent it.</p><p>This is where a quality assurance framework is needed. For example, UNESCO has published a quality assurance framework that is intended for global use. This framework defines the levels of degrees at universities, etc., and by having educational institutions in each country issue degrees in accordance with this framework, the recipients of the credentials will be able to understand the meaning of the credentials.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>このスライドから、技術以外の要素について考えてみたいと思います。</p><p>まず、意味論があります。 デジタル署名された資格証明書を受け取ったとします。 署名の検証しかできない場合、その資格証明書に記載されている情報を信頼できるでしょうか？ 難しいと思います。</p><p>つまり、デジタル署名は、第三者がデータを改ざんしていないことを証明するだけであり、データ自体の信頼性や、送信元の信頼性を証明するものではありません。</p><p>そこで必要になるのが、品質保証の枠組みです。例えば、ユネスコは世界的に利用できる品質保証の枠組みを公表しています。この枠組みは、大学などの学位のレベルを定義するもので、各国の教育機関がこの枠組みに沿って学位を発行することで、資格取得者はその資格の意味を理解できるようになります。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEic6AEnaP80TGCIdeYM4WNJndK1qfqtSVuB5FuyiyKDxJAHiul9yPox7s5wNyY9XSv_LaR-9n_dqegg1JO43wzCzr3zw1XDB4Qz9vPcU74qtBmVpA1-0doIJ36NY2xWZfkfk-VWdgYvHX4wcCwq38IRtB3WORJDEaR_28s-RvJx0NNBHvaM6Ghk69hrcgu5"></a> <br>&nbsp;<p></p><blockquote><p>Next, let's consider the trust framework. Let's ask the same question as on the previous page. Just because you have verified the digital signature on the credential you have received, does that mean you can trust the issuer of that credential? For example, if you have obtained the digital data of a graduation certificate with a digital signature, how can you confirm that the university that issued the certificate exists?</p><p>This is where a system called a trust framework comes into play. There are various types of trust frameworks, but general laws and regulations are also a type of trust framework. For example, the recipient of a certificate of qualification may believe that the issuer is operating under the country's laws and regulations that control the bank and that the government regularly audits the bank. In this case, the verifier believes in the laws and regulations of the country, so there is no need to visit the bank to confirm that the individual issuer is an actual bank. In this way, it is possible to reduce the cost of individual verification by designing and operating a system that includes certification and auditing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>次に、トラストフレームワークについて考えてみましょう。前ページと同じ質問をしてみましょう。受け取ったクレデンシャルに付与された電子署名を検証したからといって、そのクレデンシャルの発行者を信頼できるのでしょうか？例えば、電子署名の付与された卒業証明書の電子データを受け取った場合、その証明書を発行した大学が実在していることをどのように確認できるのでしょうか？</p><p>そこで登場するのが「トラストフレームワーク」と呼ばれる仕組みです。トラストフレームワークにはさまざまな種類がありますが、一般的な法律や規則もトラストフレームワークの一種です。例えば、資格証明書の受領者は、発行者が銀行を管理する国の法律や規則に従って運営されており、政府が定期的に銀行を監査していると考えるかもしれません。この場合、検証者はその国の法律や規制を信頼しているため、個々の発行者が実際に銀行であることを確認するために銀行を訪問する必要はありません。このように、認証と監査を含むシステムを設計・運用することで、個々の検証にかかるコストを削減することが可能となります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiGzca6bl5wy7EJ9-gOhZxgZIokb7OcltZlEWAllIDnpylfBVdge4miWc5s1EjC-vpf3VGKC1-yKDIIgx4PPAXUkWMo_rsLoSSsaFazlwZcrvLazs8gKRC5Oj5uFiYbx8ema85rABr84EtFe91jaIlPKeUL7EvEc7yc_Qf9I8N9eIGnr2tzTI1v-efXGmk9"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>In a few previous pages, we discussed the need for profiles.

In the real world, we must consider interoperability between these systems.</p><p>In this slide, I want to explain the recent paradigm shift in digital identity systems.</p><p>This diagram shows how the identity paradigm has changed from a centralized world to a decentralized one.</p><p>In the centralized identity system, as I mentioned earlier, it is crucial to manage identity information in the centralized database. However, there are various side effects, such as the need to keep a non-active user account in the database, making license costs expensive. It may cause identity theft attack because nonactive user cannot be aware their identities were stolen since they are not using their accounts.</p><p>Also, a centralized authentication system is quite helpful in gathering sign-in logs. Still, the system's availability is quite crucial because if the system fails, all users cannot log in to all applications.</p><p>On the other hand, in the decentralized identity world, users' identity data is stored in the user's wallet, which is typically installed on smartphones. So, users can bring their identity and authenticate it through their purse, and there is no effect on other users if the user’s wallet is offline.</p><p>In addition, users can aggregate attributes from multiple data sources in a single wallet, aggregate them, and present them to the application. The application can get various attributes from the user’s wallet and determine access permission.</p>  システムアーキテクチャは日々変化しており、複数のアプローチに基づくシステムが共存することは明らかです。現実の世界では、これらのシステム間の相互運用性を考慮する必要があります。  このスライドでは、デジタルIDシステムにおける最近のパラダイムシフトについて説明したいと思います。  この図は、IDのパラダイムが中央集権型から分散型へとどのように変化したかを示しています。  集中型のIDシステムでは、先ほど申し上げたように、ID情報を集中データベースで管理することが重要です。しかし、さまざまな副作用があります。例えば、データベースに非アクティブなユーザーアカウントを維持する必要があるため、ライセンスコストが高額になることがあります。また、非アクティブなユーザーはアカウントを使用していないため、自分のIDが盗まれたことに気づくことができません。そのため、ID盗難の被害に遭う可能性があります。  また、中央集権型の認証システムはサインインログの収集に非常に役立ちます。しかし、システムが故障した場合、すべてのユーザーがすべてのアプリケーションにログインできなくなるため、システムの可用性は非常に重要です。  一方、分散型のアイデンティティの世界では、ユーザーのアイデンティティデータは、通常スマートフォンにインストールされているユーザーの財布に保存されます。そのため、ユーザーは自分のアイデンティティを持ち歩き、財布を通して認証することができます。また、ユーザーの財布がオフラインの状態でも、他のユーザーには影響がありません。  さらに、ユーザーは複数のデータソースから属性を収集し、それを集約してアプリケーションに提示することができます。アプリケーションはユーザーの財布からさまざまな属性を取得し、アクセス許可を決定することができます。  </blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjjpt2WhbfdLj_-EyePeQi4OFyTwJXxatukt_LD73dpvW8mu9xe8pkI1h_gl0Ug0HFFZPVXJXLkzrZmhRYYRQNnyYM1O4YlE0YxIAg1VQP4Hex10JBiXbjpFX3KsYIGJoKQmDMFMlOVL5w0e3KfSRUgI-1EKK_g61uwBfLdsNrxR9s1l5RgILayabDRn6tT"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>We at the OpenID Foundation support the SIDI Hub, a community established to ensure interoperability in global digital identity.

We placed a gateway service between Moodle and the wallet and constructed it as an issuer that issues verifiable credentials based on the OpenBadge issued by Moodle. In other words, from the wallet's point of view, the gateway service appears as an Issuer.</p><p>Secondly, the Verifiable Credential presented by the wallet was embedded inside the SAML assertion. Since the existing Relying Party supports the SAML protocol, it was impossible to show the Verifiable Credential directly. Therefore, the OpenBadge extracted from the Verifiable Credential was embedded as one of the attributes inside the SAML assertion, and the credential was presented to the Relying Party. To achieve this, we developed a Wallet to SP Connector component. We configured it to appear as a Verifier to the Wallet and an Identity Provider to the Relying Party.</p><p>Of course, the Relying Party still needs to implement the appropriate logic to extract the OpenBadge from the SAML assertion, verify it, and use it. Still, there was no need to modify to support new protocols such as OpenID for Verifiable Presentation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>この統合環境にウォレットベースのシステムを導入することを決定しました。</p><p>そのため、相互運用性の課題に対して、以下のアプローチをとりました。</p><p>まず、LMSが独自のAPIを利用して発行するOpenBadgeクレデンシャルを、検証可能なクレデンシャルに埋め込みました。Moodleとウォレットの間にゲートウェイサービスを配置し、Moodleが発行するOpenBadgeに基づいて検証可能なクレデンシャルを発行する発行者として構築しました。つまり、ウォレットから見ると、ゲートウェイサービスは発行者として表示されます。</p><p>次に、ウォレットが提示した検証可能なクレデンシャルはSAMLアサーション内に埋め込まれました。既存のリライングパーティはSAMLプロトコルをサポートしているため、検証可能なクレデンシャルを直接提示することはできません。そのため、検証可能なクレデンシャルから抽出したOpenBadgeをSAMLアサーション内の属性の1つとして埋め込み、リライングパーティにクレデンシャルを提示しました。これを実現するために、私たちは Wallet to SP Connector コンポーネントを開発しました。 Wallet に対してはベリファイアとして、また、リライングパーティに対してはアイデンティティプロバイダーとして表示されるように構成しました。</p><p>もちろん、リライングパーティは、SAML アサーションから OpenBadge を抽出し、それを検証し、使用するための適切なロジックを実装する必要があります。それでも、OpenID for Verifiable Presentation などの新しいプロトコルをサポートするために修正する必要はありませんでした。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhhiK-H70IUy-2lphu2saFh89mZq0zRuJouHar_JAvWxtRrpMN4tM7s32bN7_pj22MoO70uUNrNYtNJ5rhLgEBNb_rLnhAV_j0lEwdgCKYEAM6JnkC-QD7923lmJUhGw5rtJkC7qb9TxAynfG_QLiPBN4d0p67CubAzZz8JAoh_Hzbc1d5VyGhV1Xz2faxS"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>This is an overview of the system.</p><p>First, the user issues a badge using the Learning Management System. At this point, the user is authenticated using the existing Identity Provider.</p><p>Next, the badge is issued to the user's wallet. When the user accesses the gateway, the gateway is also federated with the same Identity Provider as the Learning Management System, and the user is prompted for authentication. This way, the user is granted the appropriate permissions to execute the Moodle API. The gateway service then performs the Moodle API to obtain the issued badge and generate a verifiable credential. The gateway then issues the verifiable credential to the user's wallet as the issuer.</p><p>The issuance is now complete.</p><p>Finally, let's look at the presentation. In this case, we want to present the credential to the Gakunin RDM research database, but Gakunin RDM only supports the SAML protocol so we will use the Wallet to SP Connector. When the user accesses a specific page on Gakunin RDM, Gakunin RDM uses the SAML protocol to start the Wallet to SP Connector. This is the same operation as a standard SAML-based federation, so it is very easy to implement. When the Wallet to SP Connector is started, it requests the user's wallet to present a verifiable credential per the OpenID for Verifiable Presentation protocol. When the user presents the credential in their purse, the Wallet to SP Connector verifies the signature of the credential, extracts the embedded badge information from the credential, and configures it as a SAML assertion, then sends it to Gakunin RDM using the SAML protocol.</p><p>This allows Gakunin RDM to obtain the desired learning credential information, which can then be used to perform access control and other processing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>以下にシステムの概要を示します。</p><p>まず、ユーザーは学習管理システムを使用してバッジを発行します。この時点で、ユーザーは既存のアイデンティティプロバイダを使用して認証されます。</p><p>次に、バッジがユーザーのウォレットに発行されます。ユーザーがゲートウェイにアクセスすると、ゲートウェイも学習管理システムと同じアイデンティティプロバイダとフェデレーションされており、ユーザーに認証が求められます。これにより、ユーザーにはMoodle APIを実行する適切な権限が付与されます。次に、ゲートウェイサービスがMoodle APIを実行して発行済みのバッジを取得し、検証可能な資格情報を生成します。次に、ゲートウェイが発行者として、検証可能な資格情報をユーザーのウォレットに発行します。</p><p>これで発行は完了です。</p><p>最後に、プレゼンテーションについて見てみましょう。このケースでは、学認RDM研究用データベースにクレデンシャルを提示したいのですが、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルしかサポートしていないので、Wallet to SP Connectorを使用します。ユーザーが学認RDM上の特定のページにアクセスすると、学認RDMはSAMLプロトコルを使用してWallet to SP Connectorを開始します。これは標準的なSAMLベースのフェデレーションと同じ操作なので、実装は非常に簡単です。Wallet to SP Connectorが起動すると、OpenID for Verifiable Presentationプロトコルに従って、ユーザーのウォレットに検証可能なクレデンシャルの提示を要求します。ユーザーが財布内のクレデンシャルを提示すると、Wallet to SP Connectorはクレデンシャルの署名を検証し、クレデンシャルから埋め込みのバッジ情報を抽出し、それをSAMLアサーションとして構成し、SAMLプロトコルを使用して学認RDMに送信します。</p><p>これにより、学認RDMは必要な学習クレデンシャル情報を取得でき、アクセス制御やその他の処理に使用できるようになります。&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgau6fIEPYKGurnBK6dhvh04y9UPBo-xmcnP6X004UVGvSmWIxQ88HUGurZNWicYm1nT34kxNtfvd-XciYT6pgQg4UceunyKCXp8zoc_TaxZlA2VeEjkc8rfNpwtA_2TcstBvS40KumqVvOe3Chuj4UooA7Igdtlh6k3D7sbAEicyfSgYonpWhXSNYYT1lk"></a> <br><p></p><p><br></p><blockquote><p>We will also introduce activities that address other non-technical considerations.</p><p>Open Identity Exchange is working to map the trust frameworks of each country and identify differences.</p><p>For example, this will enable the EU to understand what rules were used to issue the credentials issued by Japan and to determine whether additional measures are necessary.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>また、技術以外の考慮事項に対処する活動についても紹介します。</p><p>Open Identity Exchangeは、各国の信頼フレームワークをマッピングし、相違点を特定する作業を行っています。</p><p>例えば、これによりEUは、日本が発行したクレデンシャルを発行する際にどのような規則が用いられたかを理解し、追加の措置が必要かどうかを判断することができます。</p></blockquote><p></p> <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhDFjscYoiOWigxm93OXMFSWREtQZTLepeNIH8el6Z9jnUykMh8LncWZCuiN0OPLfIMgxQTaplNvL-av8lycqfrlsuLbDNIwldX5sbe-Y4zNctT7gwrdOYcrTRwCqL5siP5yIiYtwZCfXsCm8OODNoIvyHYhiZRyD202nbffUGDTr0vzflTctniFppbVL4G"></a> <br><br><p></p><blockquote><p>There are also activities in the academic world to map frameworks related to qualification levels.</p><p>In the academic world, there are two main types of credentials: micro-credentials, mainly learning records, and macro-credentials, which are qualifications such as degrees and credits.</p><p>While micro-credentials are becoming increasingly digitized, as in the case of the NII example mentioned earlier, OpenBadge, it is tough to standardize the difficulty of skills.

<p>When I first heard the quote “We shape our tools then our tools shape us” from Orie Steele (A quick web search attributes it originally to John Culkin) I didn’t quite understand the profound wisdom in the statement. It’s one of those clickbait sounding quotes that sticks with you for a bit and has to ruminate for longer like it’s an idea slow cooking in a crockpot on thanksgiving dinner. But the wisdom in it rings true as I see it playing out repetitively within the technology space and I’m sure it makes a difference in many other aspects of our life.</p>

<p>When we build a technology, tool, web app, or even language we first build the tool to solve a problem. Over time though, new problems arise and they inevitably change based on the tools we choose to use to solve them. For example, language in its most primitive form was likely just a means to express emotions such as danger. Eventually it evolved and specialized so much that we can hear the sounds, piece together their grammatical structure, but only if we’re listening are we able to unpack the meaning. Whether that’s because the language being spoken is foreign (in which case we might not even understand the grammatical structure) or because we’re speaking with such abstract jargon the impact of the language as a tool remains the same. We cannot convey our intentions well enough such that our audience understands why we chose to make a noise in the first place. So we end up stuck in this sempiternal cycle of solving problems only for new ones to arise and the evidence we leave is in the iterative design of our tools. Or in the case of language in the semantic drift of words and change of mediums over time.</p>

<p>This has had me wondering lately, how do our newest tools on the Web used for communication shape our conversations? Looking back on the various forms of communication we’ve had throughout history might shed some light on this, but I’m not exactly sure so bear with me as I explore this idea further and hopefully my wandering thought leads to a moment of reflection for you the reader rather than loss of attention already.</p>

<p>Starting with speaking, since that seems to be the most primitive form of communication, when we speak with people we use tone, pauses, and word choice as our primary tools to convey different meanings. This form of communication hasn’t failed us yet so it’s still just as ever present now as it was at the beginning of humanity. But that’s just within the noises we make - when speaking we also express ourselves through our body language both as a speaker and as an audience. The speaker can convey a point with conviction through standing taller, speaking louder, and pausing longer. At the same time, without saying a word an audience can convey a lack of interest without even saying a word such as by yawning or diverting their attention elsewhere. So how does this appear in other forms of communication?</p>

<p>In written form, we lose the ability to convey emphasis through our body language so we had to modify our language to express it. Things like exclamation points, question marks, and even a parenthetical are evidence of that. But we also gained something rather noteworthy as well. With writing, because we have time to pause and reflect on our thoughts, edit them, and think through them we are able to build better structure into our writing to role play as both the author and the audience to make sure our intent isn’t lost. Additionally, because we’re not as restricted by the same social considerations we can write in both a more expansive or condensed form to convey our intent and reflect on our impact.</p>

<p>What becomes interesting though about both forms of communication is that we can both add and lose properties just by changing the medium that we use as well. For example, when speaking we can do this face to face with an individual, behind a podium to a variable sized audience, or even recorded as a video with or without editing. In writing, we can write books, essays, emails, messages, or social media posts. Each comes with their own nuances and social contracts in how we communicate within the medium chosen. And this is how we now shape our tools and then our tools shape us. We create new mediums of communication, and the new mediums form new rituals and social contracts in “acceptable” forms of communication via those mediums. So why does that matter?</p>

<p>It’s important because this informs us about how the methods we choose to communicate with  affects not only the cohesiveness of the community, but also the norms and the values reflected. Thereby changing the values we expect from one another. As an example, many collectives have adopted social media as a common form of communication. With that though, particularly with Twitter, comes the limited forms of editing, condensed writing that skips the rationale, and an algorithm that chooses to reinforce rhetoric through amplifying ideas with more likes and speakers with more followers/subscribers/friends.</p>

<p>Social media then instills values such as lack of reflection in our communication, attention grabbing ideas, and a bit of group think. With each new medium comes a different collection of properties that encourages emergent behavioral changes in us that show up in our collective shared values. So the final question I want to leave the reader with to reflect upon… Are the values you want within your communities being encouraged by the tools you use or is there a different tool that is needed to better reflect how you want to communicate with others?</p>

<p>This post looks at implementing an Open ID Connect identity provider in Microsoft Entra External ID. Auth0 is used as the identity provider and an ASP.NET Core application is used to test the authentication. Microsoft Entra External ID federates to Auth0. </p>



<p>Client code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID supports federation using OpenID Connect and was used to create the Auth0 OpenID Connect client. The settings configured in the portal must align with those in the Auth0 identity provider. The Entra External ID OIDC client would work with most IDPs, since standard OpenID Connect is used.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The corresponding client configuration was created in Auth0:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Auth0 client in this setup returns the email in the name claim. This must match in the claim mapping in Entra External ID. The email claim is switched to use the name claim. Depending on the mappings, different claim mappings are required. The values are read from the id_token.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The correct callback URLs MUST be set on the Auth0 client configuration. Entra External ID requires the following redirectly URLs:</p>


  https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-ID&gt;/federation/oauth2

https://&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.ciamlogin.com/&lt;tenant-subdomain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com/federation/oauth2
  


<p></p>



<p>The values are added to the Auth0 client. See the Entra External ID <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-custom-oidc-federation-customers#set-up-your-openid-connect-identity-provider">docs</a>.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Once the OpenID Connect client is setup, the identity provider can used in the Entra External ID user flow. Select the required user flow:</p>







<p></p>



<p>And select the Identity Providers and add the OpenID connect IdP.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To test, an <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">ASP.NET Core application</a> using Microsoft.Identity.Web was implemented to authenticate against Entra External ID. When the user is redirected the authenticate, the sign-in with Auth0 option is displayed.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well, but setting up the mappings can be difficult if you don’t know the mapping. With this it is possible now to use identities from almost any identity provider. </p>

<p>I’m writing to highly recommend the article “<a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">How to link an application protocol to an OpenID Federation 1.0 trust layer</a>” by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirdzhuvinov/">Vladimir Dzhuvinov</a>.  In it, he defines two kinds of integrity for Federations, and describes how to achieve them:</p>
 
 Federation Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
This ensures mutual trust between two entities is established always from a common trust anchor. Any resolved metadata and policies that govern the client application and the OpenID provider in a transaction will then fall under the rules of the same federation and thus will be aligned and consistent with one another.
</p></blockquote>
 Metadata Integrity, which is defined as: 
<blockquote><p>
It ensures the trust chains for an entity to a given trust anchor will invariably result in consistent metadata and policies. The natural way to achieve this is for the federation topology under a trust anchor to form a tree. Topologies that lead to multiple paths from a leaf entity to a trust anchor are to be avoided.
</p></blockquote>
 
<p>The article also explores how application protocols, such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> or digital <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">wallet protocols</a>, can achieve those properties in practice (and when they do and don’t need to).</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll note that, as a result of Vladimir’s and others’ thinking about the topic, we just added a section on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-41.html#name-federation-topologies">Federation Topologies</a> to the OpenID Federation specification, which provides concrete guidance on how to achieve Metadata Integrity.</p>
<p>I’ll stop here so as not to repeat all the useful content in Vladimir’s article.  By all means, <a href="https://connect2id.com/blog/how-to-link-an-app-protocol-to-an-openid-federation-trust-layer">give it read</a>!</p>

<p>Many digital identity proponents love the meme “the internet was built without an identity layer” and claim this as a bug to defend the need for a universal digital identity system. They’ve got it wrong though. This is a feature of the Web that has allowed the Web to flourish not a bug that must be fixed. The reason we should be preserving it extends beyond privacy and is more than ever relevant to the impact the Web has on our society.</p>

<p>Instead, we have to look beyond about the purpose the Web serves in our greater lives. Today, many of us use the Web as a means to learn, challenge our beliefs, and ultimately shape who we are by being exposed to new and challenging ideas. However, without pseudonyms it’s hard for us to refine and grow ideas. This is because pseudonyms are a hallmark to challenging the Overton’s window.</p>

<p>What is an Overton window though and why does it matter? The idea of an Overton window is that there’s a limited number of acceptable policy or discussion points that are acceptable to a mainstream populous. For example, if we were to debate the concept of inequality and someone were to propose the idea of getting rid of money in today’s time it would not be a widely accepted solution in a discussion or debate. The reason for this is that it’s impractical relative to our cultural and social norms and therefore sits outside the Overton window of today.</p>

<p>Similarly, slavery is a well understood concept that is no longer acceptable in today’s society. We understand it no longer aligns with our values as humans and therefore sits outside the Overton window as well as a regressive policy that was once acceptable, but is definitely not now. So, in any good faith discussion or debate there’s a range of believes that are acceptable as a path forward for the majority of people and that’s what makes an Overton window interesting in the broader perspective of the Web. It serves as a tool for us to consider and evolve our beliefs in society today. This range of acceptable beliefs changes though, but how?</p>

<p>Essentially, in any discussion people stake their credibility to put forth ideas that they believe have merits to the stakeholders of a problem and one that aims to solve such problem. The issue is though that some ideas exist too far outside the range of acceptable policies such that the idea of even proposing them would instantly affect the credibility of the author of the idea. Therefore, in order to reduce the risk while still moving the discussion forward we need the ability to submit and refine ideas that exist outside the Overton window until they’re good enough to shift the window. So why is pseudonymity important to guiding this?</p>

<p>Pseudonymity serves as a way to reduce the risk while still contributing to the overall broader conversation without running the risk of hurting our credibility within the broader context. Often times, the people with the most interesting ideas are those who are most involved within the topic, but may not be willing to contribute under their true moniker. Benjamin Franklin is one such example of a person who famously used pseudonyms in this way. Silence Dogood was a pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin developed at the age of 16 in order to test his political ideas and refine his writing style. It’s likely the case that this ability to submit publications under this pseudonym and listen to the feedback of readers anonymously contributed to his ability to shape the founding of the United States beneficially. So should we remove or reduce that ability from the Web which is now the primary place for us to engage in political discussions? Furthermore, how is that happening?</p>

<p>With the advent of digital credentials coming to your phone soon we’re about to make it very easy for any social media platform, forum, or site to link our online identities to our real life identities. In fact, in some places like Australia they’ve recently passed a bill to require the collection of this information for the purposes of protecting children. Since these digital credentials of our true monikers will be easily accessible, as they become collected within places on the Web where political discussions occur we will see a reduction in the use of pseudonyms on the Web. Instead, people will either be forced to remain silent or they will be forced to overcome a greater barrier of entry in order to shift the Overton window under true monikers. Is that beneficial for society as a whole?</p>

<p>I’d argue not - clearly it’s been beneficial both for the purposes of the progress of a nation and for the progress of us as people to have pseudonymity to in political discussions previously. Therefore, it seems risky to accept the path of reducing the pseudonymity on the Web and ultimately reducing the shifting of the Overton window by chilling political speech on the Web  via the allowance of digital credentials. Instead, we should be limiting digital credentials usage as much as possible in order to continue making progress in our political discussions and ultimately progressing our shared values together.</p>

<p>This article looks at setting up an ASP.NET Core application to use Azure Key Vault. When deployed to Azure, it works like in the Azure documentation but when working on development PCs, some changes are required for a smooth developer experience. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment">https://github.com/damienbod/UsingAzureKeyVaultInDevelopment</a></p>



<p>I develop using Visual Studio and manage multiple accounts and test environments. However, I frequently encounter access errors when using DefaultAzureCredentials. These errors typically occur because the account and tenant do not match the filter set in Visual Studio, or the user lacks access to the tenant. This issue arises often:</p>







<p></p>



<p>The problem can be resolved by using an application client secret to access the Azure Key Vault, implemented with the ChainedTokenCredential. The access client can be specified in the project’s user secrets, allowing it to function independently of the user account and the last filter used in Visual Studio. To set this up, a new Azure App registration was created, and a client secret was added. This client secret is then included in the dotnet user secrets for the project.</p>







<p></p>



<p>A Role assignment was added to the Azure Key Vault for the application service principal, and the necessary access role was configured. With the correct configuration in the user secrets on the development PC, the application can access the Azure Key Vault. This setup eliminates the need for Azure RBAC changes for each developer.</p>







<p></p>



 Setup local development credentials 



<p>The following Nuget packages can be used to integrate a Key Vault client in an ASP.NET Core application. Depending on how the client is setup, or what data is used from the Key Vault, different packages can be used.</p>



 
 Azure.Extensions.AspNetCore.Configuration.Secrets 



 Azure.Identity 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Certificates 



 Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets 
 



<p></p>



<p>A ChainedTokenCredential is used to access the Key Vault, preventing the access issues associated with DefaultAzureCredential. In local development, a client credential is used via a secret, which can be stored in the dotnet user secrets. When a new developer joins the team, these user secrets can be shared, eliminating the need to modify Azure Key Vault RBAC settings for each new developer. This setup is ideal for development, as it avoids problems caused by incorrect tenants or user accounts in Visual Studio. For production or other deployments, a system-assigned managed identity is used.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DevelopmentAspNetCoreKeyVault;

public static class AppAccessCredentials
{
    public static ChainedTokenCredential GetChainedTokenCredentials(IConfiguration configuration, bool isDevelopment)
    {
        if (!isDevelopment)
        {
            // Use a system assigned managed identity on production deployments
            return new ChainedTokenCredential(new ManagedIdentityCredential());
        }
        else // dev env
        {
            var tenantId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:TenantId", string.Empty);
            var clientId = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientId", string.Empty);
            var clientSecret = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("EntraId:ClientSecret", string.Empty);

            var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
            {
                AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
            };

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(tenantId)) // DevOps
            {
                // Use DefaultAzureCredential if AzureCliCredential is not used in your DevOps
                return new ChainedTokenCredential(new AzureCliCredential());
            }

            // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
            var devClientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
                tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

            var chainedTokenCredential = new ChainedTokenCredential(devClientSecretCredential);

            return chainedTokenCredential;
        }
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The user secrets would have something like this:</p>


  {
  "EntraId": {
    // aspnetcore-keyvault-development-access
    "TenantId": "--tenant_id--",
    "ClientId": "--client_id--",
    "ClientSecret": "--secret--"
  }
}
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault directly in the application 



<p>The secret from the Azure Key Vault can be used directly in the code by using the SecretClient class from Azure.Identity. The AppAccessCredentials is used to return the chained credentials and the application is authenticated if the service principal from the App registration has the correct RBAC.</p>


  // Azure SDK direct
var client = new SecretClient(new Uri(_configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]!),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(_configuration,
        _hostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()));

var secret = await client.GetSecretAsync("demosecret");
DemoSecret = secret!.Value.Value;
  


<p></p>



 Using Key Vault as a configuration 



<p>The AddAzureKeyVault method can be used to use the Azure Key as a further configuration option. I like this as all configuration is abstracted with the IConfiguration interface in the application. The AddAzureKeyVault takes the chained credential as a param.</p>


  var keyVault = builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"];
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(keyVault))
{
    builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["AzureKeyVaultEndpoint"]}"),
    AppAccessCredentials.GetChainedTokenCredentials(builder.Configuration,
        builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()));
}
  


<p>The secret can be read anywhere in the code using the IConfiguration interface. This can be used in different ways and provides type safe ways of using the properties.</p>


  // ASP.NET Core configuration
// From from key vault using ASP.NET Core configuration integration
// Or from user secrets if offline, or fast startup is required
DemoSecretConfig = _configuration["demosecret"];
  


<p></p>



 Using user secrets for local development 



<p>Sometimes, you need to work offline or frequently restart the application. Constantly connecting to Azure Key Vault can slow down development. In such cases, it’s often more efficient to use dotnet user secrets instead of Azure Key Vault.</p>



 Note 



<p>This is a good and simple approach for developing applications which use Azure Key Vault. You can use a local key management system or whatever local developers use. The client secret should not be used in production deployments as the secret expires and there are better ways to secure the access for the application to Key Vault. System assigned managed identity is the best way to implement application access in Azure in production environments.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect working group</a> recently adopted three new specifications that build upon and provide new capabilities to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>.  But I’m not only happy about these because of the engineering benefits they bring.</p>
<p>I’m particularly happy because they bring new active contributors to the work, specifically <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-f-1495aa133/">Michael Fraser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-jaromin-54355647/">Łukasz Jaromin</a>, as well as continuing the strong work by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuseppe-de-marco-bb054245/">Giuseppe De Marco</a>, who’s become a leader in the space.  They’re also supported by a few veterans: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandhedberg/">Roland Hedberg</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ve7jtb/">John Bradley</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selfissued/">yours truly</a>, plus now the full OpenID Connect working group.</p>
<p>Here’s the three new specifications, along with an abstract for each of them:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-extended-listing-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Extended Subordinate Listing</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification acts as an extension to OpenID Federation 1.0. It outlines methods to interact with a given Federation with a potentially large number of registered Entities, as well as mechanisms to retrieve multiple entity statements along with associated details in a single request.
</p></blockquote>
<p>2.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html">OpenID Federation Wallet Architectures</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
As digital wallets become increasingly deployed for managing identity credentials, establishing an architecture for trusted communication is required to allow each participant in the ecosystem to evaluate other participants’ compliance with mutual trust frameworks and accomplish secure and trusted transactions.</p>
<p>This specification defines how to use OpenID Federation 1.0 to enhance the security and interoperability of wallet ecosystems, facilitating trust establishment among the parties and enabling secure metadata exchange and policy application across large scale deployments. It outlines the general architecture of a federated trust infrastructure for wallet ecosystems, identifying participant roles and describing the use of those roles.
</p></blockquote>
<p>3.  <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rp-metadata-choices-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Relying Party Metadata Choices</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification extends the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 specification to enable RPs to express a set of supported values for some RP metadata parameters, rather than just single values. This functionality is particularly useful when Automatic Registration, as defined in OpenID Federation 1.0, is used, since there is no registration response from the OP to tell the RP what choices were made by the OP. This gives the OP the information that it needs to make choices about how to interact with the RP in ways that work for both parties.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the members of the OpenID Connect working group who helped refine them before adoption, and are now working on progressing them in the working group.</p>

<p>One of the wonderful, yet also daunting, aspects of being in the Identity industry is realizing just how far-reaching and all-encompassing its scope and boundaries are. It’s why we need more than just technologists and standards wonks engaged in driving the future of this industry. I’ve been on stage at Identiverse and other conferences for many years challenging the Identirati to bring in people from other fields like User Experience Research, Law, Privacy, and more.</p>



<p>This is the challenge that the <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a> has taken on. You can check out how they are doing this on their website, via the Kim Cameron Award and the Vittorio Bertocci Award. Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arynn-crow-821761103/">Arynn Crow</a>, I had the chance to spend some time chatting with the 2024 Kim Cameron award winner, legal scholar <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-klutke-3ba8a1228/">Grace Klutke</a>, at Authenticate 2024. We talked (in my usual rambling sort of way) about ethics in Identity, and the broader impact on human rights, inclusion, and access (in the human and not the technical Authorization sense). You can read her reflection on her experience at the conference <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/news/2024-kim-cameron-awardee-reflections-grace-klutke/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Oh, and <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/donate/">support DIAF</a> if you can. They’re doing good, and necessary, work!  If DIAF continues to bring smart, talented, and motivated individuals like her from other fields into our industry, then we’ll be doing it right.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I started <a href="https://postgr.es/m/2CAD6FA7-DC25-48FC-80F2-8F203DECAE6A%40justatheory.com">a pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing a new
extension file organization and a search path <a href="https://pgpedia.info/g/guc.html" title="GUC - Grand Unified Configuration">GUC</a> for finding extensions.
The <a href="https://postgr.es/m/E7C7BFFB-8857-48D4-A71F-88B359FADCFD@justatheory.com">discussion</a> of <a href="https://www.df7cb.de">Christoph Berg</a>’s <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/"><code>extension_destdir</code> patch</a>
inspired this proposal. These threads cover quite a lot of territory, so I
want to pull together a more unified, public proposal.</p>
<p>Here goes.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>A number of challenges face extension users, thanks to extension file
organization in the Postgres core. The common thread among them is the need to
add extensions without changing the contents of the Postgres installation
itself.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>On Debian systems, the user account that creates extension packages lacks
permission to add files to Postgres install. But testing extensions requires
installing the extension where Postgres can find it. Moreover, extensions
ideally build against a clean Postgres install; adding an extension in order
to run <code>make installcheck</code> would pollute it.</p>
<p><a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/50/4913/">Christoph’s patch</a> solves these problems by adding a second lookup
path for extensions and dynamic modules, so that Postgres can load them
directly from the package build directory.</p>
<p>Alas, the patch isn’t ideal, because it simply specifies a prefix and appends
the full <code>pg_config</code> directory paths to it. For example, if <code>--sharedir</code>
outputs <code>/opt/share</code> and <code>extension_destdir</code> GUC is set to <code>/tmp/build/myext</code>,
the patch will search in <code>/tmp/build/myext/opt/share</code>. This approach works for
the packaging use case, which explicitly uses full paths with a prefix, but
would be weird for other use cases.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut proposed an <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">alternate patch</a> with a new <code>GUC</code>,
<code>extension_control_path</code>, that provides a more typical search path pattern to
find extension control files, but doesn’t account for shared modules that ship
with an extension, requiring that they still live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Installing into custom directories requires the
undocumented <code>datadir</code> and <code>pkglibdir</code> variables:</p>
  <code>make install datadir=/else/where/share pkglibdir=/else/where/lib
</code>  <p>This pattern can probably be simplified.</p>
 OCI Immutability 
<p><a href="https://opencontainers.org" title="Open Container Initiative">OCI</a> (née Docker) images are immutable, while a container image runs on a
writeable but non-persistent file system. To install persistent extensions in
a container, one must create a persistent volume, map it to
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code>, and copy over all the extensions it needs (or muck with
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ongres/postgres-extensions-in-kubernetes?slide=14" title="Postgres Extensions in Kubernetes: StackGres">symlink magic</a>). Then do it again for shared object libraries (<code>PKGLIBDIR</code>),
and perhaps also for other <code>pg_config</code> directories, like <code>--bindir</code>. Once it’s
all set up, one can install a new extension and its files will be distributed
to the relevant persistent volumes.</p>
<p>This pattern makes upgrades tricky, because the core extensions are mixed in
with third-party extensions. Worse, the number of directories that must be
mounted into volumes depends on the features of an extension, increasing
deployment configuration complexity. It would be preferable to have all the
files for an extension in one place, rather than scattered across multiple
persistent volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">Peter Eisentraut’s patch</a> addresses much of this issue by adding a
search path for extension control files and related data/share files
(generally SQL files). One can create a single volume with a <code>lib</code> directory
for shared modules and <code>share/extension</code> directory for control and data/share
files.</p>
 OCI Extension Images 
<p>However, an additional wrinkle is the ambition from the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CloudNativePg</a>
(<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a>) community to eliminate the need for a persistent volume, and rely
instead on mounting images that each contain all the files for a single
extension as their own volumes, perhaps using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume
feature</a>, (currently in alpha).</p>
<p>This feature requires all the file in an extension to live in a single
directory, a volume mounted to an extension image contains all the files
required to use the extension. The search path patches proposed so far do not
enable this behavior.</p>
 Postgres.app Immutability 
<p>The macOS <a href="https://postgresapp.com" title="Postgres.app: The easiest way to get started with PostgreSQL on the Mac">Postgres.app</a> supports extensions. But installing one into
<code>SHAREDIR/extensions</code> changes the contents of the Postgres.app bundle,
breaking Apple-required signature validation. The OS will no longer be able to
validate that the app is legit and refuse to start it.</p>
<p>Peter Eisentraut’s <a href="https://postgr.es/m/0d384836-7e6e-4932-af3b-8dad1f6fee43@eisentraut.org">new patch</a> addresses this issue as well, with
all the same caveats as for the <a>packager testing</a>
challenges.</p>
 Solution 
<p>To further address these issues, this RFC proposes to change file organization
and lookup patterns for PostgreSQL extensions.</p>
 Extension Directories 
<p>First, when an extension is installed, by default all of its files will live
in a single directory named for the extension. The contents include:</p>
 
 The Control file that describes extension 
 Subdirectories for SQL, shared modules, docs, binaries, etc. 
 
<p>Subdirectories roughly correspond to the <code>pg_config --*dir</code> options:</p>
 
 <code>bin</code>: Executables 
 <code>doc</code>: Documentation files 
 <code>html</code>: HTML documentation files 
 <code>lib</code>: Dynamically loadable modules 
 <code>locale</code>: Locale support files 
 <code>man</code>: Manual pages 
 <code>share</code>: SQL and other architecture-independent support files 
 
<p>This layout reduces the cognitive overhead for understanding what files belong
to what extension. Want to know what’s included in the <code>widget</code> extension?
Everything is in the <code>widget</code> directory. It also simplifies installation of an
extension: one need add only a directory named for and containing the files
required by the extension.</p>
 Configuration Parameter 
<p>Add a new <code>pg_config</code> value that returns the directory into which extensions
will by default be installed:</p>
 <code> --extdir   show location of extensions
</code> <p>Its default value would be <code>$(pg_config --sharedir)/extension</code>, but could be
set at compile time like other configuration parameters. Its contents consist
of subdirectories that each contain an extension, as described in <a>Extension
Directories</a>. With a few extensions installed, it
would look something like:</p>
  <code>❯ ls -1 "$(pg_config --extdir)"
auto_explain
bloom
isn
pair
plperl
plpgsql
plv8
xml2
semver
vector
</code>   Extension Path 
<p>Add an extension lookup path GUC akin to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>, called
<code>extension_path</code>. It lists all the directories that Postgres will search for
extensions and their files. The default value for this GUC will be:</p>
  <code>extension_path = '$extdir'
</code>  <p>The special string <code>$extdir</code> corresponds to the <code>pg_config</code> option of the same
name, and function exactly as <code>$libdir</code> does for the <code>dynamic_library_path</code>
GUC, substituting the appropriate value.</p>
 Lookup Execution 
<p>Update PostgreSQL’s <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> command to search the directories in
<code>extension_path</code> for an extension. For each directory in the list, it will
look for the extension control file in a directory named for the extension:</p>
  <code>$dir/$extension/$extension.control
</code>  <p>The first match will be considered the canonical location for the extension.
For example, if Postgres finds the control file for the <code>pair</code> at
<code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/pair.control</code>, it will load files only from the
appropriate subdirectories, e.g.:</p>
 
 SQL files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/share</code> 
 Shared module files from <code>/opt/pg17/ext/pair/lib</code> 
 
 PGXS 
<p>Update the extension installation behavior of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> to install extension
files into the new layout. A new variable, <code>$EXTDIR</code>, will define the
directory into which to install extension directories, and default to
<code>$(pg_config --extdir)</code>. It can be set to any literal path, which must exist
and be accessible by the PostgreSQL service.</p>
<p>The <code>$EXTENSION</code> variable will be changed to allow only one extension name. If
it’s set, the installation behavior will be changed for the following
variables:</p>
 
 <code>EXTENSION</code>: Creates <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION</code>, installs
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/$EXTENSION.control</code> 
 <code>MODULES</code> and <code>MODULE_big</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code> 
 <code>MODULEDIR</code>: Removed 
 <code>DATA</code> and <code>DATA_built</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share</code> 
 <code>DATA_TSEARCH</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/share/tsearch_data</code> 
 <code>DOCS</code>: Installed into <code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/doc</code> 
 <code>PROGRAM</code>, <code>SCRIPTS</code> and <code>SCRIPTS_built</code>: Installed into
<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/bin</code> 
 
<p>Each of these locations can still be overridden by setting one of the
(currently undocumented) <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/Makefile.global.in#L82-L90">installation location options</a> (e.g., <code>datadir</code>,
<code>pkglibdir</code>, etc.).</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note</p>
      <p>External projects that install extensions without using PGXS, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>,
must also be updated to either follow the same pattern or to delegate
installation to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
 Control File 
<p>The <code>directory</code> control file parameter will be deprecated and ignored.</p>
<p>The <code>module_pathname</code> parameter should only name a shared module in the <code>lib</code>
subdirectory of an extension directory. Any existing use of a <code>$libdir</code> prefix
will be stripped out and ignored before replacing the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string
in SQL files. The implication for loading extension dynamic modules<a>1</a>
differs from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-DYNLOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Dynamic Loading">existing behavior</a> as follows:</p>
 
 If the name is an absolute path, the given file is loaded. 
 If the name does not contain a directory part, the file is searched for in
the in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory
(<code>$EXTDIR/$EXTENSION/lib</code>). 
 Otherwise (the file was not found in the path, or it contains a
non-absolute directory part), the dynamic loader will try to take the name
as given, which will most likely fail. (It is unreliable to depend on the
current working directory.) 
 
 Use Cases 
<p>Here’s how the proposed file layout and <code>extension_path</code> GUC addresses the
<a>use cases</a> that inspired this RFC.</p>
 Packager Testing 
<p>A packager who wants to run tests without modifying a PostgreSQL install would
follow these steps:</p>
 
 Prepend a directory under the packaging install to the <code>extension_path</code>
GUC. The resulting value would be something like
<code>$RPM_BUILD_ROOT/$(pg_config --extdir):$extdir</code>. 
 Install the extension into that directory:
<code>make install EXTDIR=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT</code> 
 Make sure the PostgreSQL server can access the directory, then run
<code>make installcheck</code> 
 
<p>This will allow PostgreSQL to find and load the extension during the tests.
The Postgres installation will not have been modified; only the
<code>extension_path</code> will have changed.</p>
 OCI/Kubernetes 
<p>To allow extensions to be added to a OCI container and to persist beyond its
lifetime, one or more <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/" title="Docker Docs: Volumes">volumes</a> could be used. Some examples:</p>
 
 Mount a persistent volume for extensions and prepend the path to that
directory to the <code>extension_path</code> GUC. Then Postgres can find any
extensions installed there, and they will persist. Files for all
extensions will live on a single volume. 
 Or, to meet a desire to keep some extensions separate (e.g., open-source
vs company-internal extensions), two or more persistent volumes could be
mounted, as long as they’re all included in <code>extension_path</code>, are
accessible by PostgreSQL, and users take care to install extensions in the
proper locations. 
 
 CNPG Extension Images 
<p>To meet the <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io" title="CloudNativePG — PostgreSQL Operator for Kubernetes">CNPG</a> ambition to “install” an extension by mounting a single
directory for each, create separate images for each extension, then use the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/image-volumes/" title="Kubernetes Docs: Use an Image Volume With a Pod">Kubernetes image volume feature</a> (currently in alpha) to mount each as a
read-only volume in the appropriate subdirectory of a directory included in
<code>extension_path</code>. Thereafter, any new containers would simply have to mount
all the same extension image volumes to provide the same extensions to all
containers.</p>
 Postgres.app 
<p>To allow extension installation without invalidating the Postgres.app bundle
signature, the default configuration could prepend a well-known directory
outside the app bundle, such as <code>/Library/Application Support/Postgres</code>, to
<code>extension_path</code>. Users wishing to install new extensions would then need to
point the <code>EXTDIR</code> parameter to that location, e.g.,</p>
  <code>$ make install EXTDIR="/Library/Application Support/Postgres"`
</code>  <p>Or the app could get trickier, setting the <code>--extdir</code> value to that location
so that users don’t need to use <code>EXTDIR</code>. As long as <code>extension_path</code> includes
both the bundle’s own extension directory and this external directory,
Postgres will be able to find and load all extensions.</p>
 Extension Directory Examples 
<p>A core extension like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/citext.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: citext — a case-insensitive character string type">citext</a> would have a structure similar to:</p>
 <code>citext
├── citext.control
├── lib
│   ├── citext.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── citext
│       │   └── citext.bc
│       └── citext.index.bc
└── share
    ├── citext--1.0--1.1.sql
    ├── citext--1.1--1.2.sql
    ├── citext--1.2--1.3.sql
    ├── citext--1.3--1.4.sql
    ├── citext--1.4--1.5.sql
    ├── citext--1.4.sql
    └── citext--1.5--1.6.sql
</code> <p>The subdirectory for a pure SQL extension named “pair” in a directory named
“pair” that looks something like this:</p>
 <code>pair
├── LICENSE.md
├── README.md
├── pair.control
├── doc
│   ├── html
│   │   └── pair.html
│   └── pair.md
└── share
    ├── pair--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── pair--1.1.sql
</code> <p>A binary application like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_top/" title="PGXN: pg_top">pg_top</a> would live in the <code>pg_top</code> directory,
structured something like:</p>
 <code>pg_top
├── HISTORY.rst
├── INSTALL.rst
├── LICENSE
├── README.rst
├── bin
│   └── pg_top
└── doc
    └── man
        └── man3
            └── pg_top.3
</code> <p>And a C extension like <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver/" title="PGXN: semver">semver</a> would live in the semver directory and be
structured something like:</p>
 <code>semver
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── semver.control
├── doc
│   └── semver.md
├── lib
│   ├── semver.dylib
│   └── bitcode
│       ├── semver
│       │   └── semver.bc
│       └── semver.index.bc
└── share
    ├── semver--1.0--1.1.sql
    └── semver--1.1.sql
</code>  Phase Two: Preloading 
<p>The above-proposed <a>solution</a> does not allow shared modules
distributed with extensions to compatibly be loaded via <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library
preloading</a>, because extension modules wil no longer live in the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DYNAMIC-LIBRARY-PATH"><code>dynamic_library_path</code></a>. Users can specify full paths, however. For example,
instead of:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>One could use the path to the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the extension’s directory:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '/opt/postgres/extensions/pg_partman_bgw/lib/pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But users will likely find this pattern cumbersome, especially for extensions
with multiple shared modules. Perhaps some special syntax could be added to
specify a single extension module, such as:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_libraries = '$extension_path::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>But this overloads the semantics of <code>shared_preload_libraries</code> and the code
that processes it rather heavily, not to mention the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> command.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a follow up to the <a>solution</a> proposed above, this
RFC proposes additional changes to PostgreSQL.</p>
 Extension Preloading 
<p>Add new GUCs that complement <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-CLIENT-PRELOAD" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Shared Library Preloading">shared library preloading</a>, but for extension
module preloading:</p>
 
 <code>shared_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>session_preload_extensions</code> 
 <code>local_preload_extensions</code> 
 
<p>Each takes a list of extensions for which to preload shared modules. In
addition, another new GUC, <code>local_extensions</code>, will contain a list of
administrator-approved extensions users are allowed to include in
<code>local_preload_extensions</code>. This GUC complements <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCAL-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: local_preload_libraries"><code>local_preload_libraries</code></a>’s
use of a <code>plugins</code> directory.</p>
<p>Then modify the preloading code to also preload these files. For each
extension in a list, it would:</p>
 
 Search each path in <code>extension_path</code> for the extension. 
 When found, load all the shared libraries from <code>$extension/lib</code>. 
 
<p>For example, to load all shared modules in the <code>pg_partman</code> extension, set:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman'
</code>  <p>To load a single shared module from an extension, give its name after the
extension name and two colons. This example will load only the
<code>pg_partman_bgw</code> shared module from the <code>pg_partman</code> extension:</p>
  <code>shared_preload_extensions = 'pg_partman::pg_partman_bgw'
</code>  <p>This change requires a one-time change to existing preload configurations on
upgrade.</p>
 Future: Deprecate LOAD 
<p>For a future change, consider modifying <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> to support shared
module-only extensions. This would allow extensions with no SQL component,
such as <code>auto_explain</code>, to be handled like any other extension; it would live
under one of the directories in <code>extension_path</code> with a structure like this:</p>
 <code>auto_explain
├── auto_explain.control
└── lib
   ├── auto_explain.dylib
   └── bitcode
       ├── auto_explain
       │   └── auto_explain.bc
       └── auto_explain.index.bc
</code> <p>Note the <code>auto_explain.control</code> file. It would need a new parameter to
indicate that the extension includes no SQL files, so <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and
related commands wouldn’t try to find them.</p>
<p>With these changes, extensions could become the primary, recommended interface
for extending PostgreSQL. Perhaps the <code>LOAD</code> command could be deprecated, and
the <code>*_preload_libraries</code> GUCs along with it.</p>
 Compatibility Issues 
 
 The <code>module_pathname</code> control file variable would prefer the name of a
shared module. The code that replaces the <code>MODULE_PATHNAME</code> string in SQL
files would to strip out the <code>$libdir/</code> prefix, if present. 
 The behavior of loading dynamic modules that ship with extensions (i.e.,
the value of the <code>AS</code> part of <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>) would change to look for
a library name (with no directory part) in the <code>lib</code> subdirectory of the
extension directory. 
 The <code>directory</code> control file parameter and the <code>MODULEDIR</code> PGXS variable
would be deprecated and ignored. 
 <code>*_preload_libraries</code> would no longer be used to find extension modules
without full paths. Administrators would have to remove module names from
these GUCs and add the relevant extension names to the new
<code>*_preload_extensions</code> variables. To ease upgrades, we might consider
adding a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink shared modules into
<code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 <code>LOAD</code> would no longer be able to find shared modules included with
extensions, unless we add a PGXS variable that, when true, would symlink
shared modules into <code>--pkglibdr</code>. 
 The <code>EXTENSION</code> PGXS variable will no longer support multiple extension
names. 
 The change in extension installation locations must also be adopted by
projects that don’t use PGXS for installation, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>. Or perhaps
they could be modified to also use PGXS. Long term it might be useful to
replace the <code>Makefile</code>-based PGXS with another installation system,
perhaps a CLI. 
 
 Out of Scope 
<p>This RFC does not include or attempt to address the following issue:</p>
 
 How to manage third-party shared libraries. Making system dependencies
consistent in a OCI/Kubernetes environment or for non-system binary
packaging patterns presents its own challenges, though they’re not
specific to PostgreSQL or the patterns described here. Research is ongoing
into potential solutions, and will be addressed elsewhere.

<p>The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family’s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter. It was a remarkable documentary effort that solidified our memories of that year. But dad was aware of the tradeoff. A favorite joke became: “Q: How was your trip?” “A: I won’t know until the film is developed!” He realized that interposing a camera between himself and the people he encountered had altered the direct experience he and they would otherwise have had.</p>
<p>This weekend I heard <a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/392-technology-culture">Christine Rosen’s</a> modern version of that critique in a discussion of her new book <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1454717522">The extinction of experience: Being human in a disembodied world</a>. I listened to the podcast on a hike, my noise-canceling Airpods insulating me from the sounds of the creek trail and from the people walking along it.</p>
<p>It’s complicated. When hiking alone I greatly value the ability to listen to interesting people and ideas while exercising, breathing fresh air, and moving through the natural world. The experience is embodied in one sense, disembodied in another. Reading the same material while lying on the couch would be a different, and arguably more extreme, form of disembodiment. But when I passed a family of four, all walking along looking at their phones, that felt wrong. When people are together they should actually be together, right? You’ve doubtless felt the same when seeing people in this together-but-not-together state.</p>
<p>Lately Pete Buttigieg has been urging us to spend less time online, more time IRL having face-to-face conversations. I think that’s right. There’s no doubt that the decline of social capital described in Robert Putnam’s <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">Bowling Alone</a> has accelerated in the 30 years since he wrote that book. America’s tragic polarization is a predictable outcome. Without the institutions and cultural traditions that once brought us together, face-to-face, in non-political ways, we’re all too vulnerable to being herded into competing online echo chambers that magnify our differences and erase our common humanity. </p>
<p>I won’t be abandoning my mediated and disembodied life online, but I do need to participate in it less and more critically, and prioritize my unmediated and embodied life IRL. The pendulum has swung too far away from the direct experience of shared reality, and that hasn’t been good for me nor for my country, </p>

  I finally deleted all my Twitter accounts, notably @theory. If you see that

<p>I quit Twitter in November 2022, when it became clear that Phony Stark would
take control of the company. No regrets; I’ve been active <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> since
then, via <a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/">Ivory</a>, where I’ve enjoyed the Twitter ca. 2010 vibe.</p>
<p>But I hadn’t deleted my Tweets or my accounts until this week. The change was
finally triggered by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/x-sees-largest-user-exodus-musk-takeover-rcna179793" title="X sees largest user exodus since Musk takeover">latest announcement</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first
time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train
artificial intelligence, like the company’s generative AI service, Grok.
Currently, X users can go to the site’s settings and opt out.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I have no interest in feeding Grok or any other large language model. So this
week I deleted all my tweets and then my accounts. I tried to transfer my
personal username to a new, empty account, but in the second between changing
it and switching to another tab to take it, it was somehow acquired by an
account created in 2011 with no posts. Not sure how that worked. Pretty scummy.</p>
<p>So, just to be clear, anyone using these usernames on Twitter are not me
anymore:</p>
 
 @theory 
 @lunar_theory 
 @DesignScene 
 @pgxn 
 
<p>See you <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> — or perhaps <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theory.fyi" title="theory.fyi">Bluesky</a>.</p>

<p>Heute vor einem Jahr <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/durchbruch-im-europaeischen-parlament-piraten-feiern-klare-absage-an-chatkontrolle-und-garantie-sicherer-verschluesselung/">haben wir im Ausschuss für bürgerliche Freiheiten, Justiz und Inneres (LIBE) des EU-Parlaments eine fraktionsübergreifende Position gegen anlasslose Chatkontrolle beschlossen</a>. Damit haben wir den wahnwitzigen Überwachungsplänen eine Absage erteilt, welche die von der Leyen-EU-Kommission vorgelegt hat.</p>



<p>Neben dem Europäischen Parlament müssen die EU-Regierungen im Rat eine Position zu dem Gesetzentwurf beschließen. Schon drei Mal wurde die notwendige Mehrheit dort verfehlt. Sowohl die spanische Ratspräsidentschaft im Oktober 2023 als auch der belgische Vorsitz im Juni 2024 haben die Abstimmung über die Chatkontrolle kurzfristig von der Tagesordnung des Rats der EU genommen, als sich ein Scheitern bei der Abstimmung abgezeichnet hat – ein Riesenerfolg der Zivilgesellschaft.</p>



<p>Die Europäische Kommission wird gerade neu gebildet. Bisher tat EU-Innenkommissarin Ylva Johansson (S&amp;D, Schweden) als Mutter der Chatkontrolle alles, um ihr Vorhaben durchzuprügeln. Nun soll Magnus Brunner (EVP, Österreich) auf sie im Amt folgen und das Projekt weiterführen. Er hat in seinem Anhörungsverfahren gegenüber dem Europäischen Parlament auf die Frage der Piratin <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/197549/MARKETA_GREGOROVA/home">Markéta Gregorová</a> schon signalisiert, <a href="https://hearings.elections.europa.eu/documents/brunner/brunner_writtenquestionsandanswers_en.pdf">dass er die Verhandlungen zur Chatkontrolle zum Abschluss bringen will</a>. Ein Bekenntnis zum Schutz vor flächendeckender Chatkontrolle oder Schutz sicherer Verschlüsselung kam ihm nicht über die Lippen. Das ist ein Fehler: die EU-Kommission muss sich endgültig von Massenüberwachung verabschieden. Die anlasslose Chatkontrolle muss vom Tisch!</p>



<p>Im Europaparlament habe ich mich als euer Abgeordneter der Piratenpartei Deutschland federführend in den Verhandlungen eingesetzt, um die Chatkontrolle zu verhindern und auch die Abgeordneten der anderen Fraktionen in unzähligen Beratungen davon überzeugt. Heute trägt Markéta Gregorová für die europäischen Piraten die Fackel der Digitalen Freiheitskämpfer*innen im Europäischen Parlament weiter und setzt sich dort gegen die Chatkontrolle ein.</p>



<p>Im Rat der EU konnten wir bisher nur dank des unermüdlichen Engagements und des lautstarken Protests der Zivilgesellschaft totalitäre flächendeckende Chatkontrollen verhindern. Möglich war das dank jeder Aktivistin und jedem Einzelnen, die sich telefonisch, per E-Mail oder per Brief immer wieder an Politik und Regierung gewendet haben. Danke für euren Einsatz! Wir müssen stark bleiben und auch bei jedem weiteren Anlauf gegen die extreme und weltweit einzigartige Bedrohung des digitalen Briefgeheimnisses und sicherer Verschlüsselung durch die Chatkontrolle kämpfen!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.</p>

  <p>Today, a post in my feed included a mention and its webfinger verification threw a WebFinger::BadRequest exception:</p>

  <code>Nov 08 09:18:49 AM  WebFinger::BadRequest (Bad Request):

<p>The activitypub actor document resided on mastodon.well.com but when a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/reports/socialcg/CG-FINAL-apwf-20240608/#reverse-discovery">reverse discovery</a> was performed, the hostname of the subject in the webfinger response was well.com instead of mastodon.well.com.  Making a webfinger request to well.com for the mentioned user returned a 500 Internal Server Error so a WebFinger::BadRequest exception was thrown.  What was going on?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-webfinger/issues/28">an issue in the activitypub-webfinger</a> had the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Looks like some are using this host-meta redirect to use a custom domain for actors which is different to the actual domain of the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is what was happening:</p>

  <code>curl https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/host-meta
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0"&gt;
  &lt;Link rel="lrdd" template="https://mastodon.well.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}"/&gt;
&lt;/XRD&gt;
</code> 
 

<p>A response in the issue notes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of host-meta as a “second layer of indirection” is something that mostly a holdover from the OStatus days, IIRC. Most projects that aren’t Mastodon or Pleroma will not check host-meta at all, and will instead always skip straight to the /.well-known/webfinger endpoint. I don’t think it makes sense to unnecessarily pressure everyone into adopting host-meta or supporting variable LRDD endpoints</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t argue with that so I just <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/10a8d622e022bc48521afd11e63fb3962fce71f4">handled the exception without setting the custom domain</a>.</p>

We have 364 attendees from around the world who called 178 sessions. I can't begin to describe the energy of the identity community when they all get together to discuss their favorite topics. If you like identity, or simply want to be part of an enthusiastic technical community, you should come to IIW.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F058990e6-03e6-4368-b36b-cce209a3bbc7_4025x1827.heic">          </a> <p>As you can see by the pins in the map at the top of this post, there were attendees from all over the world. Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (251), followed by Canada (18) and France (14). Germany, Japan, and Australia rounded out the top six with 12, 9, and 7 attendees respectively. Attendees from India (5), Columbia (3), and Chile (2) show IIW's geographic diversity. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa again. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you'd like to come to IIW40, please let us know.

<p>I’ve written and release a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC 9535 JSONPath</a> JSONPath Go package,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/theory/jsonpath">github.com/theory/jsonpath</a>. Why? For a personal project, I needed a simpler
JSONPath engine to complement to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/07/go-sqljson-path/" title="Introducing Go SQL/JSON Path and Playground">Go SQL/JSON Path</a> package, and quickly
found myself implementing most of the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC</a>. So I decided do the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yes, yet another JSONPath package in Go. I really appreciate the idea of a

reference to the RFC on pkg.go.dev. Today <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/search?q=RFC+9535" title="pkg.go.dev search: RFC 9535">the search</a> shows one!</p>
 Example 
<p>Usage is straightforward; here’s a quick example (<a href="https://go.dev/play/p/wmJvZdOl28D">Go playground</a>):</p>
  <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/theory/jsonpath"
)

func main() {
	// Parse a jsonpath query.
	p, err := jsonpath.Parse(`$["name", "slogan"]`)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Select values from unmarshaled JSON input.
	json := map[string]any{
		"name":   "Kamala Harris",
		"title":  "Vice President of the United States",
		"home":   "California",
		"slogan": "We are not going back!",
	}
	items := p.Select(json)

	// Show the result.
	fmt.Printf("%#v\n", items)
}
</code>  <p>And the output:</p>
  <code>[]interface {}{"Kamala Harris", "We are not going back!"}
</code>   🛝 Playground 
<p>No need to write code to try it out, though. I’ve also written a <a href="https://theory.github.io/jsonpath/" title="Go JSONPath Playground">playground
webapp</a> to encourage experimentation and exploration of the syntax and
behavior of the package. The implementation follows the precedents set by the
<a href="https://theory.github.io/sqljson/">Go SQL/JSON Playground</a> and design of the <a href="https://serdejsonpath.lives">Rust JSONPath Playground</a>.
Moreover, thanks to <a href="https://tinygo.org/" title="TinyGo - A Go Compiler For Small Places">TinyGo</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/" title="WebAssembly">Wasm</a> file comes in at a mere 254K!</p>
<p>The webapp loads sample JSON from the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535.html" title="RFC 9535 JSONPath: Query Expressions for JSON">RFC</a>, and randomly rotates through a
few example JSONPath queries. Fill in your own and tap the “Permalink” button

 Status 
<p>The root <code>jsonpath</code> package is stable and ready for use. Other packages remain
in flux, as I refactor and rejigger things in the coming weeks as part of the
aforementioned personal project. But for actual JSONPath execution and
querying, it should continue to work as-is for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>This is a big deal. My <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/12/times-up/" title="Times Up">former colleagues</a> in the <a href="https://nytimesguild.org">New York Times Tech Guild</a>
have declared a strike today in response to a number of unfair labor practice
violations and management’s inability to bargain in good faith. From the
<a href="https://wapo.st/3UBVSbs" title="New York Times Tech Guild goes on strike">Washington Post</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>Represented by the NewsGuild of New York, the Tech Guild has been
negotiating its first contract with the company since 2022. Both sides have
accused the other side of bogging down contract talks, which have recently
focused on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/23/new-york-times-tech-guild-strike/" title="What happens if the NYT’s tech staff strikes on election night?">three key issues</a>: “just cause” job protections (which ensure
employees can’t be fired without reason and due process), remote work and
pay equity. Unit members voted overwhelmingly in September to authorize the
strike, saying the timing of the authorization — in the run-up to the
high-profile election period — was “no accident.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I urge you to join me in supporting the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nyt-tech-strike-fund" title="gofundme: Support NYT Tech workers!">strike fund</a>, which will help more
vulnerable members to weather the strike.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Guild asks supporters to refrain from interacting with
Cooking and Games, and to break your streaks. Times reporters Maggie Astor has
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">the details</a>:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>As of this morning, the New York Times Tech Guild, which represents NYT tech
workers, is on strike.</p>
<p>Unless it’s resolved while today’s Wordle is still live, this streak is
gone.</p>
<p>NYT Games and Cooking are BEHIND THE PICKET LINE. Please don’t play or
engage with Games or Cooking content while the strike lasts!</p>
<p>News coverage is NOT behind the picket line. It’s okay to read and share
that, though the site and app may have problems.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@astor.maggie/post/DB81_ppxGPP">whole thread</a> for more information, which, as she says, “the
rules may not be what you think!”</p>

 When you want to do a hackathon but am missing the perfect&nbsp;idea. Compliments of Flux.1&nbsp;Schnell<p>You likely know the saying, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good/done.” Sometimes, I have a hard time living that, and an existing effort is one example. I have registered for an AI agent hackathon, <a href="https://www.tensorops.ai/aiagentsonlinehackathon">Agents Craft Hackathon</a>. I don’t plan to be competitive but I doubt that is the goal of most participants. I do want a good idea that makes a great example and is a pseudo-novel idea that implements an agent usage not in the <a href="https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents">GenAI_Agents Github repo</a>. Therein lies my problem; a unique and interesting use case and example. I’m inspiration-blocked. I know that I am letting the perfect be the enemy of the good or even of the enemy of the fun because there is a Discord channel with participant-created ideas for teams to work on. I want it simple yet inspired. I’m not inspired by any of the existing team projects; nothing against the projects as this is a me problem. I have a few more days to think about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Maybe you should join the hackathon. Your idea might be inspiring.</p>

<p>Last week I MCed the first Extension Ecosystem Summit EU and attended my first
at PGConf EU in Athens, Greece. Despite my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2007/03/five-things/#2-i-used-to-be-an-archaeologist" title="Five Things You Don't Know About Me">former career as an archaeologist</a>
— with a focus on Mediterranean cultures, no less! — this was my first
visit to Greece. My favorite moment was the evening after the Summit, when I
cut out of a networking shindig to walk to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaka" title="Wikipedia: Plaka">Pláka</a> and then circumnavigate the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens" title="Wikipedia: Acropolis of Athens">Acropolis</a>. I mean just look at this place!</p>

<p>Highlight of the trip for sure. But the Summit and conference were terrific,
as well.</p>
 Extension Ecosystem Summit 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> kindly organized The Extension Ecosystem Summit EU, the
follow-up to the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">PGConf.dev original</a>. While the Vancouver Summit focused on
developers, we tailored this iteration to users. I started the gathering with
a condensed version of my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/posette/#i-also-spoke" title="POSETTE 2024">POSETTE talk</a>, “State of the Postgres Extension
Ecosystem”, but updated with a <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/trunk-oci-poc/#demo" title="POC: Distributing Trunk Binaries via OCI — Demo">Trunk OCI Distribution</a> demo. Links:</p>

 <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/10/pgconf-extension-summit-eu/state-of-the-ecosystem-eu-notes.pdf">PDF with Notes</a> 
 <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/10/pgconf-extension-summit-eu/state-of-the-ecosystem-eu.key">Keynote</a> 
 
<p>We then moved into a lightning round of 10 minute introductions to a variety
of extensions:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyruss/">Jimmy Angelakos</a> showed off <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_statviz/" title="PGXN: pg_statviz">pg_statviz</a>, a “minimalist extension and
utility pair for time series analysis and visualization of PostgreSQL
internal statistics”. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hendel/">Adam Hendel</a> gave a brief history of <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pgmq/" title="PGXN: pgmq">pgmq</a>, is a “lightweight message
queue like AWS SQS and RSMQ, but on Postgres.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gulcinyildirim/">Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek</a> introduced <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx" title="GitHub: xataio/pgzx">pgzx</a>, “a library for developing
PostgreSQL extensions written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" title="Zig Programming Language">Zig</a>.” 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-blackwood-sewell/">James Sewell</a> talked about <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgvectorscale" title="GitHub: timescale/pgvectorscale">pgvectorscale</a> and <a href="https://github.com/timescale/pgai" title="GitHub: timescale/pgai">pgai</a> for managing
machine training workloads on Postgres. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/decodableminion/">Alastair Turner</a> described <a href="https://github.com/percona/pg_tde" title="GitHub: percona/pg_tde">pg_tde</a>, an extension that provides
transparent data encryption for Postgres. 
 
<p>Quite the whirlwind! There followed open discussion, in which each maintainer
went to a corner to talk to attendees about contributing to their extensions.
Details to come in a more thorough writeup on the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/" title="Tembo’s Blog">Tembo blog</a>, but I personally
enjoyed some fascinating discussions about extension distribution challenges.</p>
 PGConf.eu 
<p>Following the Summit, I attended several thought-provoking and provocative
presentations at <a href="https://2024.pgconf.eu" title="PostgreSQL Conference Europe 2024">PGConf.eu</a>, which took place at the same hotel, conveniently
enough.</p>

 In the conference keynote, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-haysler-ssh/">Stacey Haysler</a> explained the <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5869/">The PostgreSQL
License Fee</a>. I’m pleased to say that my employer “pays” license fee! 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-freund/">Andres Freund</a> (yes, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1244174104" title="NPR: One engineer may have saved the world from a massive cyber attack">that one</a>) summarized <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5839/">NUMA vs PostgreSQL</a>,
covering some of the issues and opportunities for optimization of
PostgreSQL on servers using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access" title="Wikipedia: Non-uniform memory access">NUMA</a> multi-processor memory
architecture. 
 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heikki-linnakangas-6b58bb203/">Heikki Linnakangas</a> offered an overview of <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5897/">The Wire Protocol</a>, that bit
of PostgreSQL technology that lets clients talk to PostgreSQL. 
 <a href="https://ophir.dev">Ophir Lojkine</a> and Thomas Guillemard <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5707/" title="Unearthing the Past with PostgreSQL: How Open Source is Revolutionizing Digital Archaeology">showed</a> how a pretty sweet
framework, <a href="https://sql.datapage.app/">SQLPage</a>, lets archaeologists like Thomas write complete web
applications in pure SQL, enabling rapid data entry while in the field. 
 <a href="https://github.com/tvondra">Tomas Vondra</a>’s <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5585/">Performance Archaeology</a> dug into the history of
PostgreSQL improvements, mapping their compounding returns over time. 
 <a href="https://dev.to/@floord">Floor Drees</a> (photo above) talked about <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2024/schedule/session/5946/">Supporting extensions, but
really now</a>, making a strong case for the need to organize infrastructure
to support the broader extension ecosystem. 
 
<p>There were many more talks, but clearly I tend to be drawn to the most
technical, core-oriented topics. And also archaeology.</p>
 Museums 
<p>Speaking of which, I made time to visit two museums while in Athens. First up
was the <a href="https://www.namuseum.gr/en/">National Archaeological Museum of Athens</a>, where I was delighted to
explore the biggest collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece" title="Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean Greece">Mycenaean</a> artifacts I’ve ever seen,
including massive collections from the excavations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann" title="Wikipedia: Heinrich Schliemann">Heinrich Schliemann</a>.
So much great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" title="Wikipedia: Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> stuff here. I mean, just look at this absolute unit:</p>


	
			
		
			<p>From the museum description: “Fragment of a krater depicting a chariot with
two occupants. A male figure holding a staff walks in front of the chariot.
Much of the Mycenaean Pictorial Style pottery (14th-12th centuries BC) with
representations of humans, chariots, horses and bulls on large kraters, was
produced at Berbati in the Argolid and exported to Cyprus, where it was widely
imitated. Birds, fish, wild goats or imaginary creatures (i.e. sphinxes) occur
on other types of vessels, such as jugs and stirrup jars. Usually only
fragments of these vases survive in mainland Greece from settlement contexts.
In Cyprus, however, complete vases are preserved, placed as grave gifts in
tombs.”

<p>The animal decorations on Mycenaean and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)" title="Wikipedia: Akrotiri (prehistoric city)">Akrotiri</a> pottery is simply
delightful. I also enjoyed the Hellenistic stuff, and seeing the famed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" title="Wikipedia: Antikythera mechanism">Antikythera Mechanism</a> filled my nerd heart with joy. A good 3 hours poking
around; I’ll have to go back and spend a few days there sometime. Thanks to my
pal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-hunter-stanton/">Evan Stanton</a> for gamely wandering around this fantastic museum with me.</p>
<p>Immediately after the PGConf.eu closing session, I dashed off to the
<a href="https://theacropolismuseum.gr/en/">Acropolis Museum</a>, which stays open till 10 on Fridays. Built in 2009, this
modern concrete-and-glass building exhibits several millennia of artifacts and
sculpture exclusively excavated from the Acropolis or preserved from its
building façades. No photography allowed, alas, but I snapped this photo
looking out on the Acropolis from the top floor.</p>

from the Parthenon inside the museum reflect in the glass, as does, yes, your
humble photographer.

<p>I was struck by the beauty and effectiveness of the displays. It easily puts
the lie to the assertion that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Marbles" title="Wikipedia: Elgin Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a> must remain in the British
Museum to protect them. I saw quite a few references to the stolen sculptures,
particularly empty spots and artfully sloppy casts from the originals, but the
building itself makes the strongest case that the marbles should be returned.</p>
<p>But even without them there remains a ton of beautiful sculpture to see.
Highly recommended!</p>
 Back to Work 
<p>Now that my sojourn in Athens has ended, I’m afraid I must return to work. I
mean, the event was work, too; I talked to a slew of people about a number of
projects in flight. More on those soon.</p>

  I'm fairly certain that what I write here won't change the minds that need changing. But I feel like I need to make a statement anyway: your vote is secure.

I've wanted to discuss this for a while. I have several things in my background that have given me insight into how elections work. I was the CIO for the State of Utah. I was a member of the Lt Governor of Utah's voting equipment selection committee. And I've been involved in identity and security for several decades.</p><p>Let me give you the headline up front: committing election fraud in a way that changes the result is difficult, nearly impossible. Let's examine how elections are run and how fraud could happen to see why.</p><p>First a caveat: there is no single way that US elections are run. Elections in the US are quite decentralized. Each state has different election laws and in most cases the mechanics of running an election are given over to county clerks who must follow state law, but also have freedom to create their own workflows and processes within that law. The analysis that follows is generalized and likely more true of Utah, which I'm very familiar with, than other places. Still, I think the big ideas are largely the same everywhere.</p><p>The process of voting is divided into two parts: (1) voter registration and (2) voting. This is important because most people who make up scenarios to convince you that voting is insecure usually ignore voter registration. Registration requires that you provide an address. This is an important piece of information because if you're voting by mail, it's where the ballot will be mailed. If you're voting in person, you need to vote at a specific polling place depending on your address.</p><p>When you vote, you either mail back the ballot that was mailed to you at the address you provided or you go to your polling place and fill out a ballot (usually via a voting machine). In either case, the ballot presented to you depends on your address since the candidates listed on your ballot depend on your voting precinct. Also, as of 2024, <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Voter_identification_laws_by_state">35 states require voters to present identification</a> at the polling place in order to vote. Of those that don't, many require it for voters who are voting for the first time after their registration.</p><p>Now, let's examine voting fraud and how it might work. One important factor is scale. You need to commit fraud at a scale necessary to impact the outcome. For small elections (say a single state legislative race or a small school board election) you don't need to change a lot of votes to change the outcome in a tight race—hundreds of votes might do it. For larger elections, like the presidential election, scale is a significant issue. I'm going to focus on presidential elections since they are the most consequential. Less consequential elections are not likely to attract the kind of money and talent necessary to commit election fraud.</p><p>A second factor is stealth. You have to keep the fraud from being discovered so that it's not reversed. Proving consequential fraud would likely result in the election being challenged and rerun. You don't have to identify who did it, just prove that it was done. So election fraud is much more dependent on not being discovered than commercial transaction fraud where the loss is likely to only be recovered if the identity of the perpetrator is known.</p><p>The nature of presidential elections is greatly influenced by the electoral college system. You need to influence the votes in enough states to swing that state's electoral votes to the candidate you favor. You don't want to commit fraud where it's not needed because you'll waste money while increasing your chances of discovery. So, selecting the states where you want to commit fraud is critical. Each of those states will have different requirements, so you'll have to tailor your attack to each of them. Furthermore, you'll have to tailor your attack to each legislative precinct within the counties you determine are the most likely to impact the election.</p><p>There are a few ways to attack an election:</p>  <p>Sending your people to vote—for this to work, your fake voters have to have been registered and, in most cases, provide some form of ID. To register, they need a plausible address. The election office might not notice if one or two extra people with different last names are registered at a specific address, but they might if this is systematic or if an unreasonable number of people register at the same address. Remember that elections are run at the county level, so you have to assume that the election workers have a good understanding of the local environment. These fake voters now have to go to many different polling locations and cast a vote. They can't easily cast multiple ballots at the same polling location since the poll workers might remember them. So, you need lots of people going to lots of different polling locations.</p>  <p>Intercepting mail-in ballots—for this to work, you have to register at someone else's home address and then get to the mail before they do or steal their ballots after they've filled them in and change the vote. This requires lots of people. You can't do this remotely. It requires "boots on the ground" as the saying goes. Furthermore, those people are exposed since they're looking in mailboxes in neighborhoods where they don't live. Doable, but not very stealthy.</p>  <p>Paying people to vote—for this to work, you have to contact a lot of people, convince them to commit fraud, and then be satisfied with the fact that you'll never know if they voted for your candidate or not because ballots are secret. They could take your money and vote for whoever they want. Or just not vote at all unless you're supervising them, an activity that will call attention to you and your agents.</p>  <p>Replacing real ballots with fake ones—for this to work, you have to get your hands on real ballots for many different polling places (remember they're different because of overlapping jurisdictions), intercept the ballots somewhere in transit or on delivery, and replace the real ballots with ones that you've filled out for your candidate. This likely involves subverting county election workers. Not just one, but many. Again, the risk of discovery goes up with each contact.</p>  <p>Destroying ballots—for this to work, you need to destroy ballots that are for the candidate you don't want to win. You could simple destroy ballots without regard to how they're filled, but this won't assure you'll meet your goal. To be effective, you have to just destroy the ones for the other candidate and leave the ones for your candidate. Again, you will have to subvert election workers to get your hands on the ballots and determine who the ballot is for.</p>  <p>Changing the results after the ballots are counted—for this to work, you have to either hack the machines that record the vote or hack the machines that are tabulating the vote. Hacking the machines won't work if the machines keep a paper audit trail and it's used to audit results. Hacking the tabulators means getting access to those machines. Recall those are kept at the county level, so you have to hack many in different locations unless a single county can swing the election your way.</p>  <p>I hope all of this has at least given you a feel for the scale and scope of the problem. Pulling it off successfully without anyone knowing it happened is a difficult problem. Each method involves many people being let in on the secret—in some cases a lot of people. This isn't an operation that a small group of hackers can reliably pull off. Having lots of people involved increases the chances that you'll be discovered. The decentralized and distributed nature of how elections are run is a feature, and makes elections more secure and trustworthy.</p><p>On top of all this, election officials aren't stupid, lazy, or inept. Sure, you're going to find a few who are. But as a rule the elections officials I've interacted with at the state and county level are professionals who are attuned to these dangers and take active steps to protect against them. They are, as a rule, happy to talk about how they operate and will respond to polite requests for information about how they audit systems and the processes they have in place to protect the vote.</p><p>As an aside, do you know what's easier than committing election fraud? Using social media to convince people that election fraud is happening to reduce confidence in the election and sow discontent. Then you can use that discontent to challenge a legitimate election and maybe change the outcome if you don't like it. Ask yourself which is more likely.</p><p>Successfully changing the results of a presidential election isn't impossible. But the odds of doing so and not leaving any evidence—the perfect crime—are vanishingly small. I have confidence in the security of the US election system.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: Voting from DALL-E (public domain) Prompt: Draw a horizontal picture of a woman casting a ballot with a ballot box</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/is-voting-secure?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share">Share</a></p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/subscribe?">Subscribe now</a></p><p></p>

AI generated crew image. Note that some folks are backwards.&nbsp;:-)<p>I continued my experimentation with CrewAI this weekend. To see the code, take a look at the following repo and path: <a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/crewai_playground/tree/main/crewai_series">Starter CrewAI Series</a> and the day_04 folder specifically. In the day_04 package, I created a simple custom tool, one that uses <a href="https://tavily.com/">Tavily</a>. The two agent, two task package queries for news information on CrewAI and then processes that info to create a report (markdown) on the latest news about CrewAI. I learned a few things outside that CrewAI just raised $18 million&nbsp;(US).</p> How it&nbsp;Works <p>It uses decorators on the classes and functions. I love decorators. I always have. I filed a <a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0204340.html">patent</a> once that used decorators in C# as a part of a solution for business rule traceability. But back to CrewAI. You’ll see code snippets&nbsp;like:</p> @CrewBase<br>class Day04Crew():<br><br>@agent<br> def researcher(self) -&gt; Agent:<br><br>@task<br> def research_task(self) -&gt; Task: <p>While to define the agent behavior, you use some YAML like the&nbsp;below:</p> researcher:<br>  role: &gt;<br>    Senior Data Researcher on {topic}<br>  goal: &gt;<br>    Find recent most relevant news on {topic} and limit your response to {limit} results<br>  backstory: &gt;<br>    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest<br>    developments on {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant<br>    information and present it in a clear and concise manner. <p>To define the task you use YAML like the&nbsp;below:</p> research_task:<br>  description: &gt;<br>    Search news about {topic}<br>  expected_output: &gt;<br>    A list of news articles about {topic} with the title, url, and content<br>  agent: researcher <p>If I were to experiment deeper I’d try the research task description to be a more sophisticated prompt but this one returned decent&nbsp;results.</p><p>And that is largely it for a simple enough example. I was off to the races with the exception of some calls to actually run the&nbsp;agents.</p> What I&nbsp;Found <p>First off. I found that I need to do some discovery of the CrewAI capabilities for some increased logging or traceability. Even with agent verbosity turned on, it was too much of a black box for me. Maybe I didn’t look closely enough at the verbose output but it seemed a bit too superficial. I want to know what exactly was passed to the LLM, a timestamp, its response and that timestamp, which endpoints on the LLM, etc. I think some of that can be found using <a href="https://www.langtrace.ai/">LangTrace</a> or <a href="https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/agentops-observability">CrewAI AgentOps</a>. I’ll almost certainly try that&nbsp;soon.</p><p>I also found that one time it got stuck in what I assume was some sort of loop. I can’t be certain exactly where, as I didn’t have any real logging or traceability (black box). But it was running far too long on just the first agent and task. I had to cancel out and when I did and looked at my usage of Tavily it had bumped up 100 API calls for that run versus the expected of only 1. That was very disconcerting. All other runs with the unmodified code performed only the expected 1 API call to&nbsp;Tavily.</p><p>The<a href="https://github.com/manicprogrammer/crewai_playground/blob/main/crewai_series/day_04/src/report.md"> report output</a> was what I was hoping for, but that has more to do with the LLM and Tavily results than with&nbsp;CrewAI.</p><p>I did notice that each task can have only one agent. That makes sense, I think. I would like to try where an agent has multiple tasks and has to choose the appropriate task for its job and also a scenario where an agent might call a task multiple times with slightly different input to get a more nuanced or expanded context for its actions. I don’t currently have an example use case for the latter. Give me some time or recommend one below. In these scenarios, traceability becomes even more important, and limits on task calling or tool usage are probably&nbsp;needed.</p> Final Thoughts <p>CrewAI covered the simple use case I wanted to try though it left me desiring more visibility into what it was doing. The implementation in my limited use case was easy. It was slow, but I don’t know where it was slow, because I didn’t have any instrumentation to see where it was spending its time. It might have been in the LLM and/or Tavily. All in all, I plan to experiment more with a hierarchical structure and with some attempts into observability and traceability. I wish I could say more and provide greater depth than what you can probably easily and quickly discern from the documentation but for now this is what I have. The next question is will I try the same in L<a href="https://www.langchain.com/">angChain</a> to compare or will I dig deeper into CrewAI&nbsp;first.</p>

<p>It’s nice if you can share your screen with someone who has walked that path before you, but that’s often impossible or infeasible. LLMs synthesize what others have learned walking the path.

<p>I was recently experimenting with <a href="https://www.crewai.com/">CrewAI</a>, but in one experiment I wanted to use a local LLM hosted by <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/">LM Studio</a>. Why LMStudio? Well… because that was the experiment. I wanted to see how I’d use LMStudio to host my model versus Ollama and then use it from CrewAI. Below is a very simple setup for doing&nbsp;this.</p><p>It’s good to point out that CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood as a sort of proxy. This provides CrewAI with the ability to talk to a range of LLMs without needing to really do much in terms of handling&nbsp;it.</p> What Doesn’t Work and&nbsp;Why <p>The first thing I found is what doesn’t work. The LLM class in CrewAI allows for the instantiation of an LLM that can then be used by agents. Spinning up an LLM instance on a local Ollama hosted model can look like&nbsp;below.</p>  ollama_31_8b = LLM(<br>     model="ollama/llama3.1",<br>     base_url="http://localhost:11434"<br>    ) <p>This works just fine if hosting the LLM inside Ollama, but you get response exceptions if, instead, you try to host inside LMStudio at the same server&nbsp;port.</p> ERROR: LiteLLM call failed: litellm.APIConnectionError: 'response' <p>First, you notice that the base_url doesn’t have a “/v1” at the end which LMStudio uses in their server setup. If you fix that, thinking it might work, you’ll find that you likely get the same&nbsp;error.</p><p>Secondly, you may realize that the model property in your LLM instantiation uses a [PROVIDER]/[MODEL] format. I tried removing the provider portion to see what would happen. The results&nbsp;were:</p> llm.py-llm:161 - ERROR: LiteLLM call failed: litellm.BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT provided. <p>That’s a reasonable outcome.</p> What Does&nbsp;Work <p>Lastly, I remembered that LM Studio is using OpenAI endpoints.</p><p>A quick look at the <a href="https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/openai_compatible">LiteLLM docs</a> provided the answer I needed; set the provider as “openai”. This results in a final outcome&nbsp;of:</p> ollama_31_8b = LLM(model="openai/llama3.1", base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1") <p>Now, if you try running it with the agent using the LLM instantiated it will work. Below is example code of the LLM and agent creation where I had Llama 3.1:8b model hosted in LM Studio on port&nbsp;11434.</p> @CrewBase<br>class MyCrew():<br><br> llama_31_8b = LLM(<br>   model="openai/llama3.1",<br>   base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1"<br>  )<br> <br> @agent<br> def joke_generator(self) -&gt; Agent:<br>  return Agent(<br>   config=self.agents_config['joke_generator'],<br>   verbose=True,<br>   llm=self.llama_31_8b<br>  )  Note <p>Note that on LMStudio I had my server port set to 11434 versus the default of 1234. It made it easier as I switched back and forth between Ollama and LM Studio; I didn’t need to modify the port. 11434 is the default Ollama&nbsp;port.</p> When Might I Use&nbsp;This <p>When might I use this? If I am programming, probably rarely. I could instead host the model in Ollama. I’d use LM Studio if I want to host a model and chat with it. In that scenario, I’d probably be more likely to use Ollama with <a href="https://anythingllm.com/">AnythingLLM</a> which would also provide me with some Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. Nonetheless, it was an experiment and I proved, for myself, it could easily be&nbsp;done.</p>

<p></p>  💡  This is written in response to a post titled "<a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/why-verifiable-credentials-arent-widely-adopted-why-trinsic-pivoted-aee946379e3b?ref=decentralgabe.xyz">Why Verifiable Credentials Aren't Widely Adopted &amp; Why Trinsic Pivoted</a>"  <p>A forewarning—there will be no tears here and, please, no hugging.</p>credit, XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/?ref=decentralgabe.xyz">https://xkcd.com/386/</a><p>The post I'm responding to makes a point about people resisting its conclusions because their livelihoods depend on it. But let’s be real—Trinsic depends on this too, just as much as mine does. We’re both here, with skin in the game, and that's a good thing. I continue to work on figuring out how to make self-sovereign identity work at scale because I believe it's worth it. If I was not convinced of its value, I wouldn't be here debating it; I'd have moved on to easier, more profitable paths. That’s the commitment this industry requires—guts, patience, and a long-term perspective.</p><p>So let's set the stage clearly. This isn't just about egos or jobs; it's about a vision for the future of digital identity. And while you’ve pivoted, it's worth looking at the broader picture and challenging the notion that SSI is somehow "dead" just because it's hard. We’re not the first to face a daunting path—nor will we be the last.</p> The Market Isn't the Oracle You Think It Is <p>Your unwavering faith in the market's infallibility is touching. You proclaim, "The market is the objective reality," as if channeling the spirit of a laissez-faire economist at a startup retreat. But let's examine recent history.</p><p>Betamax was superior to VHS, but marketing muscle won the day. The QWERTY keyboard isn't ergonomic, yet it's entrenched due to historical happenstance. The invisible hand often leads us down paths of inefficiency and fragmentation, leaving a trail of superior but abandoned technologies in its wake.</p><p>Fragmentation and incompatible standards aren't signs of the market "choosing" the best option; they're about who can shout "MINE!" the loudest while elbowing competitors off the playground. Sometimes, it takes a guiding hand—a nudge from governments or standard bodies—to steer the market toward what's efficient and beneficial for all.</p> Pivoting Isn't Prophecy you can do better, hon<p>The leap from "We couldn't make it work" to "It can't work" is a logical chasm too wide to cross. Your pivot from SSI evangelist to skeptic, while understandable, isn't a revelation of universal truth.</p><p>This is akin to Friendster declaring social media a dead end, or Blockbuster declaring video streaming a passing fad. The inability to monetize a nascent technology doesn't negate its potential; it merely highlights the gap between visionary ideals and the brutal realities of running a startup. For example, certain decentralized identity projects have successfully implemented verifiable credentials in applications like educational certificates, employment verification, and gaining access to the financial system, demonstrating real-world utility and growing momentum. These efforts show that verifiable credentials are gaining traction in specific, focused use cases.</p><p>Let me be unequivocal: I commend you for having the guts to start a company, work hard for years, and continue to try to make it viable. That is nothing short of admirable. Your pivot might make sense for Trinsic, but it's hardly the canary in the coal mine for SSI.</p><p>SSI, like many transformative technologies before it, may simply be awaiting its "streaming moment" — that convergence of technological readiness, market understanding, and user demand that catapults it from interesting concept to indispensable tool.</p> The Power of Collective Standards <p>Dismissing government involvement as a mere "silver lining" is like calling the sun a "helpful light bulb." Let's not overlook crucial historical precedents.</p><p>The internet (ARPANET), GPS, and even time zone standardization were government initiatives. The metric system, USB, and Wi-Fi all benefited from coordinated efforts beyond market forces. These standards didn't become universal because the market willed them so, but because of coordination to prevent fragmentation.</p><p>It is important not to ignore this. Preventing the chaos of incompatible systems often requires patience and collaboration—yes, even more patience than the industry has shown to this point.</p> Scattered Seeds Grow Diverse Forests <p>Your lament that SSI's "heat map is too scattered" misses the point. This diversity isn't a bug—it's a feature. The applications sprouting in education, finance, healthcare, and agriculture worldwide are the seeds of a diverse forest, not a failed monoculture.</p><p>Yes, SSI's initial user experience may be challenging, but that's par for the course with transformative technologies. Remember when 2G networks made downloading a single image feel interminable? Or when dial-up internet's screeching was our daily soundtrack?</p><p>Every groundbreaking technology endures growing pains. Users adapt, technologists adapt, and the market adapts with them—especially when the endgame offers control, privacy, and empowerment.</p> Business Goals Aren't Universal Truths <p>There's a profound difference between "We couldn't make it work for our business" and "The technology is inherently flawed."</p><p>Your focus on immediate market adoption overlooks the long-term value of doing the right thing—the hard thing—the thing that maybe, honestly, is not suited for startups that need to show growth and profit now. Perhaps a successful SSI startup is better suited as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_Corporation_(certification)?ref=decentralgabe.xyz">B-Corp</a>. </p><p>While market challenges are real, the problems that led us to SSI have only grown more severe. Data breaches are no longer news; they're an expectation. Surveillance Capitalism has entrenched itself deeper into the fabric of our digital lives, commodifying our every interaction. Government-issued digital identities, on the hardware of monopolistic tech giants, laced with privacy-eroding mandates, threatening to erode what little privacy we have left.</p><p>SSI isn't just a novel technology; it is our defense against these escalating digital threats.</p> Focused Implementation <p>While the post laments the scattered nature of SSI adoption, I see this differently. There is a clear answer to the diversity challenge: focus on specific, high-impact use cases. Our net is intentionally not cast wide.</p><p>We don't require credentials to be used across different domains from which they were issued. That's a potential bonus, not a requirement. It does not undermine the original goal of the technology; optionality is a strength. It leaves the door open for future cross-domain adoption without dependence on it for current success.</p><p>This focused strategy allows us to deliver value in targeted areas while building the infrastructure for broader adoption. It’s a pragmatic approach that addresses immediate needs while paving the way for SSI’s long-term vision. An iterative approach helps build confidence in the SSI ecosystem, one application at a time.</p><p>The success of SSI won't come from boiling the ocean. We’re laying the groundwork for future interoperability while delivering value today.</p> A Vision Beyond The Fiscal Calendar <p>While some may chase immediate market opportunities, many of us remain committed to SSI's promise. Transformational change isn't measured in fiscal quarters but in steady progress over years, many years. It demands fortitude, collaboration, and a willingness to look beyond short-term gains.</p><p>To the SSI community: Let this be our rallying cry. We're not just building a product; we're creating the foundation for human-centric digital identity. Let's continue to collaborate on improving user experience, pushing interoperability, and engaging governments and standards organizations. Every effort, no matter how small, contributes to a future where secure, privacy-respecting, self-sovereign digital identity is the norm.</p><p>The most compelling technological advances come from those who persevere when the path gets steep. The future of digital identity—one that isn't controlled solely by governments or tech monopolies—is counting on us.</p>credit: Dune<p>Should you find yourself at the next IIW, or the one after that, perhaps hosting a session titled "I Was Wrong About Being Wrong About SSI," feel free to invite us—we'll be there. We won't cry, clap, or hug you. We'll simply nod, in recognition that the most profound insights often come from pushing through challenges, not pivoting away from them.</p>

A presentation I gave at IIW38, in April&nbsp;2024.<p>At the Internet Identity Workshop 38, I announced my talk with a description something like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>Five years ago at this conference, Trinsic’s first product (our self-sovereign identity wallet app) was launched. Today, I’m hosting a session called “SSI didn’t work. Trinsic is pivoting.”</blockquote><p>I knew it was a provocative title — and I fully considered that apostatizing this publicly could result in a mob of opposition. But I was not prepared for what actually happened.</p>  Right after my announcement (and brief, surprised gasp from the crowd of ~350 people) one IIW veteran popped off his chair and clapped his way across the room to embrace&nbsp;me.  Right before my session, the CEOs of two separate identity companies asked to broadcast the talk online (one via livestream, another via live&nbsp;Tweet).  Right after my session during the closing circle (where the original crowd of ~350 reconvened), the cofounder of the conference wept as she thanked me. Another longtime identity veteran stood immediately after and claimed it was the most important session held at the event in the last 5&nbsp;years.  The next morning, a startup CEO called for memorializing a “Riley Session” as a new staple of the conference twice each year. More than a dozen people asked me to reprise my&nbsp;session.  <p>I say this all descriptively, not boastfully. Far from feeling proud, I actually felt humbled to have had the opportunity to contribute something evidently valuable to a community which has given me so much. (It was at an IIW in 2018 that I realized I wanted to build a career in this industry.) That is the context for this post — to share apparently-useful insights that hopefully will result in getting the world closer to using better digital ID technologies.</p><p>The spoiler for this article: I’m no longer betting on verifiable credentials taking off. I mean this literally — 99% of my net worth is <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a> stock, so the strategy I bet my company on is an objective revelation of my strongest convictions. While once central to Trinsic’s existence, our latest pivot demonstrates that I believe interoperable digital credentials won’t succeed in market anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Specifically, my prognostication is that digital identities will continue to be deployed and adopted, but that fragmentation, incompatibility, and bespoke implementations will continue to dominate the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now, I’ve been working on this problem for 7 years. Explaining how I landed on this conclusion requires expounding on years of the business equivalent of trench warfare. This post is a deep dive, not a summary. If you want a summary, I suggest dropping this post into your LLM of choice (I won’t be offended). I’ll do my best to be concise, but I also intend on being thorough. The structure of this post is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Assumptions</p><p>Brief History</p><p>Impossible Problems</p><p>Bull Case</p><p>End</p> Assumptions <p>Assumption #0: I’ve drunk the&nbsp;Kool-aid</p><p>As you read this post, your walls might go up. Especially if your salary depends on me being wrong. Just be aware of your biases and know that I am still Kool-aid drunk on the philosophy of self-sovereign identity. I want that future as much as anybody. But in my sincere pursuit to discover reality, I’ve learned some things that I hope others can benefit&nbsp;from.</p><p>Assumption #1: Terminology</p><p>I will use “verifiable credential” or “VC” in this post quite a bit. I’ll also use “self-sovereign identity” or “SSI” or “IDtech”. “Decentralized identity” or “DI” could be subbed in too for all I care. Fundamentally, I’m trying to communicate: A standard way to exchange trustworthy data in a user-centric/user-controlled way. But I’m intentionally avoiding being too pedantic, so don’t get overly caught up in semantics.</p><p>Assumption #2: The world is&nbsp;huge</p><p>The world is inconceivably big.</p><p>Consulting in SSI is a good way to make a living. But hand-to-hand combat is insufficient to get VCs adopted. The only way to scale something on the magnitude needed for SSI to work is a product with product/market fit. That, or regulatory obligation.</p><p>Imagine if companies needed Accenture to adopt artificial intelligence. Now consider how that differs from a world where any developer can pick up an API key from OpenAI and implement GPT4 in an afternoon. LLMs have product/market fit, SSI does&nbsp;not.</p><p>Assumption #3: The market is&nbsp;reality</p><p>Here’s how I think about startups &amp; new product development. The market is unknowable in its entirety. If it was known how to build a successful product (in our case, a widely-adopted SSI wallet or an adoptable VC format), it would have been done by now. To make progress at the cutting edge, you must do something desirable and different. Andy Radcliff calls this being “<a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/blog/venture-capital-economics/">non-consensus and&nbsp;right</a>”.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamath_Palihapitiya">Chamath</a> describes a startup as an exercise in mentally modeling the “market” and building a product to fit that model. If your product is rejected, your model of the world is wrong and you need to iterate its form. If your product is adopted, your model of the world is&nbsp;right.</p><p>All this is to say, the market is the objective reality. It decides winners and losers. As I’ve sought to get product/market fit in this space, I seek to discover reality as impartially as I can. When I see evidence of something working, I pay attention; when I see evidence that something isn’t working, I try to absorb those data points&nbsp;too.</p><p>Assumption #4: The best technology gets&nbsp;adopted</p><p>The worth of software is its impact on humans. The most elegant, idealistic, best software is therefore worthless unless it’s adopted. Actually, if it’s not adopted, it’s not elegant, idealistic, or best — no consolation prizes. The market is the judge and if your product isn’t making an impact on people’s lives, it’s no better than a refrigerator on the&nbsp;moon.</p><p>Adoption isn’t just the most important thing, it’s the only thing. Thus, this is actually a tautology: by definition, what gets adopted is&nbsp;best.</p><p>Assumption #5: Don’t waste your&nbsp;time</p><p>I’ve thought a lot about the optimal point between discouraging and cautioning. Yes, I’ve tried a lot of things but it’s important to state that markets change. Maybe something is different now than when I tried it. I surely can’t turn over every stone. Running new or differentiated experiments in this market is probably fruitful–I don’t want to discourage innovation. But I do want it to shine a light on the graveyard that exists in this space and hopefully prevent people from doing things that are doomed to&nbsp;fail.</p> Brief history <p>I started my journey in identity in 2017 when I interviewed for a job at Sovrin Foundation. I started Trinsic with two cofounders in 2019 because of the relatively low adoption of Sovrin’s network. I thought if we made the technology dramatically easier to use, more companies would adopt&nbsp;SSI.</p>Me plus Tomislav &amp; Michael, my cofounders, launching our product at IIW in&nbsp;2019.<p>We built something good. Hundreds of developers were signing up every month and issuing verifiable credentials. One of those developers was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/waynebuilds/">Wayne Chang</a> who, before cofounding Spruce, gave me the feedback that Trinsic was the best execution of any SSI product in the market. He asked something like:</p><blockquote>“With a product like this (where a developer can get value for free) you are probably either using this as lead gen for $250k consulting deals, or you’re just really betting on verifiable credentials blowing&nbsp;up.”</blockquote><p>I told him we were betting on VCs blowing&nbsp;up.</p><p>Our aim was to build a product that would accelerate VC adoption. In our view, if a customer needed consulting to succeed, it was a signal the product wasn’t good enough. (We did consult customers on how to succeed — but we treated this time as product discovery time, and incorporated the results immediately into the product roadmap.)</p><p>What happened is we acquired dozens of paying customers, but not enough were successful enough. We had roughly 1 breakaway <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-customer-stories/">customer story</a> per 500 companies that signed up. The rest were either startups that failed to get traction or large enterprise R&amp;D departments that never went to production.</p><p>In the meantime, the market shaped out in an undeniable way. Dozens of companies obtained product/market fit in the reusable identity space, none of which use the VC standard. Either none of the successful companies chose to use VCs, or none of companies that chose VCs succeeded (two statements of identical outcome but different presumed causation).</p>A slide I made in 5 mins immediately before my IIW38 presentation to make this&nbsp;point!<p>In fact one such company, which raised over $75m from top-tier venture capitalists to fuel its meteoric growth, said to me (paraphrasing):</p><blockquote>“The SSI people had a good idea. So we’re applying that idea to get customers while they’re wasting their time in working groups. You can think of us as proprietary SSI.”</blockquote><p>It’s been a few years since I was told that. I recently checked back in on them. They’re used by tens of millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Another reusable ID company used by several million end-users, which has raised 10s of millions, told me (paraphrasing):</p><blockquote>“We are building a monopoly. Our goal is to own the identity layer of the internet. It might not work, but if it does, we’re going to make a lot of&nbsp;money.”</blockquote><p>Both companies were started after 2019 (the year the VC data model became a W3C recommendation) and chose not to use standards.</p><p>This dynamic vexed me for months. Why was the market rewarding companies with inferior identity solutions?</p><p>It took me too long to conclude that SSI is the inferior identity solution. The market determines winners and losers, better and worse — and there are important reasons the market is rejecting verifiable credentials in favor of proprietary solutions.</p><p>After 4+ years of hypothesizing, experimenting, evaluating, and iterating, I found what I consider to be intractable problems that block adoption of verifiable credentials. I do not know the answers to these problems. If you’re building in the IDtech space, you should take these problems seriously because, in my view, these are the billion-dollar questions you’ll need to crack to have any meaningful success.</p> Impossible problems <p>Impossible problem #1: Interoperability is the premise, but doesn’t&nbsp;exist</p><p>Standards exist to enable compatibility. If interoperability isn’t important, simple alternatives to verifiable credentials exist (such as signing — or not signing — JSON). The ability to share data with an arbitrary 3rd-party in a standardized way (without bespoke integration or direct connection to issuing source) is the core purpose of VCs. But that doesn’t actually exist right&nbsp;now.</p><p>In other words, the reason for the existence of VCs is not&nbsp;present.</p><p>This is because interoperability at the application level requires technical interoperability of keys/signatures, public key resolution, exchange protocols, request/response formats, data models, semantics, and a host of underlying elements. (Not to mention nontechnical interoperability elements, like business models and trust frameworks.) Because a myriad of VC variants, exchange protocols, signature suites, etc. have emerged over the years, which must all line up to effectively interoperate, the only practical way to achieve interoperability with others is to use the same software.</p><p>Theoretically, if everyone in the industry agreed upon a single standard to use, interoperability would be present, and there would begin to be value to adopting VCs today — but there’s a problem: which standard should be adopted? and what if it’s the wrong&nbsp;one?</p><p>Prematurely standardizing is a risky endeavor. But in order to find out what kind of digital credential will have real product/market fit — and thus be adopted — the world needs to experiment, iterate, innovate, over trade-offs to discover what the market will&nbsp;adopt.</p><p>Do you see the problem? VCs need innovation, iteration, and experimentation to succeed. But they also need standardization, agreement, buy-in, and stagnation to have value. These two forces are directly opposed. I wrote about this dynamic more in a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">post</a> several years&nbsp;ago.</p>An image I made in 2022 for a post I wrote about the tension between interop &amp; innovation.<p>Standardization is essential for adoption. But adoption is essential for knowing what to standardize (there’s nothing worse than standardizing the wrong thing)! Prematurely standardizing before adoption is a classic “cart before the horse” scenario.</p><p>To be clear, none of this means that there is no reason to adopt VCs now — it means every reason to adopt VCs today is in anticipation of future value. Because today, verifiable credentials offer zero marginal value relative to simpler alternatives. To rationally adopt VCs, one must make a bet on the future. Some bold companies will be willing to take that very costly journey (like we did), but most will&nbsp;not.</p><p>Impossible problem #2: Initial UX is worse than&nbsp;baseline</p><p>Verifiable credentials are always a better UX than existing identity solutions at scale, but always a worse experience initially.</p><p>I had a mask-laden conversation with the late Vittorio Bertocci at the Internet Identity Workshop in 2021 where I was working to convince him of the merits of VCs as he advocated for federated approaches.</p><p>His point: VCs aren’t necessary to share data outside its original domain. Take, for example, Airbnb wanting to verify a digital driver’s license. Instead of using a VC, DMVs could become an IdP, and Airbnb could add a “verify with X driver’s license button” into their app. The tech exists&nbsp;today.</p><p>My point: Yes, but nobody does that today because it doesn’t work in person, doesn’t work offline, doesn’t work when presenting multiple credentials, doesn’t work when privacy needs to be preserved, etc. But most importantly, in this example Airbnb would need to add a “verify with X” button for all 50 states, which is a very bad UX — VCs would enable one universal verification button!</p><p>I’ve thought a lot about this interaction. While I like to think I helped nudge Vittorio a bit on the value VCs could provide, you’ll notice my points are basically only relevant at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>For a concrete example, take AI agents who need identity wallet capabilities. We ran a whole campaign about this at Trinsic and spoke to dozens of AI agent developers (see this <a href="https://trinsic.id/ai-agents/">landing page</a>, watch the demo video!). It’s obvious the problem exists in the long-term. As a user, it’s a pain to provision an agent access to all my accounts, info, etc. needed for it to accomplish real tasks for me. But in the near-term, 100% of the AI developers we talked to just chose to use OAuth to connect to sources where users’ data exists already (e.g.&nbsp;Google).</p><p>If a user already has a wallet with a bunch of useful credentials in it, obviously sharing those is a better UX than redoing the onboarding process that was required to obtain those credentials. But acquiring the wallet with credentials in the first place will always cause extra friction upfront, which businesses and users are very reluctant toward.</p><p>This problem is compounded because businesses don’t just adopt things that are a little bit better than alternatives. In order to switch behaviors or risk their careers on unproven technologies, new solutions need to be better enough to justify that extra investment. And unfortunately for VCs, for every initial use case I’m aware of, the experience is objectively worse.</p><p>I shared more insights from Vittorio&nbsp;<a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/how-vittorio-shaped-my-perspective-on-ssi-and-how-he-can-shape-yours-a51f62d173f2">here</a>.</p><p>Impossible problem #3: Heat map is too scattered</p><p>When I was raising money for Trinsic as a general-purpose verifiable credential platform, investors would often ask what the most prominent use case for verifiable credentials was — and more specifically, what the most common use case for Trinsic’s customers was. My answer&nbsp;sucked:</p><p>Our customers are building use cases in education, employment, financial services, healthcare, insurance, industrials, government, and agriculture. And&nbsp;more!</p><p>Once, in pursuit of a better answer to this question, we plotted the industries, geographies, and use cases of 100+ paying customers. The scatter plot was all over the place. Nothing stuck out prominently. It didn’t make sense to double down on a specific industry or use case because none dominated our demand. We didn’t even have geographic consistency — adoption existed from Myanmar to Peru to USA to&nbsp;Romania.</p><p>My cofounder Michael continuously sounded the alarm in my ear: in order for VCs to take off, a network effect needs to take hold. No network effect will exist if all adoption is completely scattered.</p><p>This problem doesn’t just affect Trinsic, it affects the entire VC space. Until pockets of adoption breed more adoption in a virtuous cycle, the rate of adoption will be capped to a linear value — and adoption to 1+ billion people requires exponential rates.</p><p>To drive this point home, I’ll cite an example from a packed room at a previous Internet Identity Workshop, circa 2020. In a room full of decentralized ID vendors, I asked for a raise of hands: “Who has ever heard of a verifiable credential being used for a purpose other than that for which it was issued?” (In other words, who has ever heard of a verifiable credential being used for the reason the VC standard was created.)</p><p>No hand went&nbsp;up.</p><p>I asked again in 2024. Still crickets.</p><p>Verifiable credentials won’t take off until this sort of thing is commonplace. This cross-context data sharing simply won’t happen until both sides of the exchange are interested in similar credentials, or are from a similar industry or geography. In other words, this won’t happen until the heat map of potential use cases lights up in a particular spot. But the current nature of the market is very scattered.</p> Bull case <p>This post outlines why I’m not betting on verifiable credentials taking off anytime soon. But if I had to articulate the bull case, there are two arguments here: government mandates and timing/direction of causality.</p><p>Governments</p><p>Governments represent the silver lining for verifiable credentials. While, in my view, the private sector lacks a viable adoption path for the reasons outlined above, governments have different incentives. Governments build utilities, and there is a good argument that interoperable digital ID is a government utility. Many governments in the West are investing in VCs, most notably eIDAS 2.0. Although even that is far from&nbsp;settled.</p><p>Government involvement is not limited to government-issued credentials. Virtually every private sector company in the verifiable credential world (except Trinsic, for what it’s worth) has been subsidized by governments funding their preferred VC standards (DHS funding different standards than the EU, for example). Various technologies through the years have succeeded due to government mandates or subsidies–nothing wrong with it inherently–but it is a telling&nbsp;aspect.</p><p>Governments compelling use of interoperable digital credentials represents the most likely success case for VCs I can think of. But that scenario exists in the medium-term, not the short-term.</p><p>Timing</p><p>The other argument says that verifiable credentials are simply too early. Many of the leading reusable ID ecosystems like IDme, Yoti, CLEAR, etc. were started and initially grew before the VC standard was finalized/stabilized. So one could argue these companies, if started today, could have had the same or greater success using verifiable credentials rather than a proprietary solution.</p><p>Unfortunately, recently companies like Incode, Footprint, Plaid, and many others launched “reusable ID” products and chose not to use VCs after extensive research. And have succeeded far beyond most SSI products. Which presents a difficult rebuttal to this argument.</p><p>One cannot rule out the possibility that companies can succeed betting on the VC standard. But it’s difficult to point to examples of VCs helping a business solve problems for customers (and thus make money) — and it’s trivial to point to dozens of examples of companies sinking millions of dollars into verifiable credential infrastructure (money which could have been spent acquiring customers). One hypothesis is that tinkerers are attracted to VCs while aggressive operators are less likely to experiment on new technologies or make speculative bets on the&nbsp;future.</p> End <p>I referenced Vittorio earlier, and I’ll cite him one last time here. In a blog post about his involvement in the CardSpace project at Microsoft, which is a spiritual ancestor of modern SSI, he&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven&nbsp;stance.”</blockquote><p>I’ve not changed my convictions on the future I want to live in. Nor has my resolve wavered in my desire to build that future. But the market has spoken. Prematurely standardizing a pre-product/market fit technology won’t work — no matter how badly zealous advocates of SSI want it to. That is why Trinsic is no longer a general-purpose verifiable credential infrastructure company.</p><p>While I don’t expect a universal standard for digital IDs will happen anytime soon, new digital IDs continue to roll out every day. These digital IDs are sometimes built with VCs, other times with mDLs, but usually in proprietary ways. Some are bound with biometrics, others with passkeys. Some are focused on solving a problem in a specific industry, others in a specific geography.</p><p>Today, the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198674795444490241/">Trinsic Identity Acceptance Network</a> represents the future of Trinsic. Instead of helping companies create digital IDs (issue verifiable credentials or create wallets for users), we help businesses accept existing digital IDs. Our strategy is a bet on continued fragmentation of the ID landscape — a bet on no single standard winning&nbsp;out.</p><p>In fact, I’ve become convinced that Trinsic’s current strategy to help businesses accept digital credentials is actually a necessary stepping stone to a future world powered by interoperable digital credentials. We’re still ushering the world in that direction, just from a different angle.</p><p>Of course, I could be wrong, and I hope I am. My ears and eyes are wide open for new information. My only objective is to see reality as clearly as I can. If you have information you believe I’m missing, I’d love to hear from you and have a conversation. Sincerely! You can DM me on LinkedIn or Twitter, or shoot me an email riley@trinsic.id.</p><p>Thanks to Kim Hamilton Duffy, Gerald Glickman, Timothy Ruff, Eve Maler, James Monaghan, Dave Grantham, and Zachary Jones for giving feedback on a draft of this&nbsp;post.</p>

Compliments of FLUX&nbsp;schnell<p>This last week I spoke with two folks on AI intersection within their work and how their work intersects with one another. One was a CPO for a startup that is bringing AI into their life sciences products in a forefront way. The other was a compliance manager for a pharma company. The second happens to be my wife. For me, their work intersects. They both certainly got me thinking harder about AI agents. The first of the two was breaking down knowledge silos in organizations and I definitely saw a play for AI agents and the use of tools by those agents in their approach. The second needed some exuberant discussion on the potential of how AI can contribute to their organizational goals and needs; and without mansplaining, I was glad to help.&nbsp;:-) The conversations only reinforced in me where we are headed in AI adoption.</p><p>There were discussions on trend analysis, small language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and how AI agents and tools work to bring different knowledge repositories into a single interface with human consumable outputs, just to name a few topics. Surprisingly or not, a lot of these topics were not with the CPO but with the wife; putting the theory into practical examples. It was motivational to&nbsp;me.</p><p>I have been looking for good, practical, and real-world examples of AI agenic tools to work on as knowledge-expanding exercises; whether they work or, in the end, surface the immaturity of the technology. I don’t get especially motivated by the common and tired examples of financial analysis, LinkedIn scraping for recruiting, or travel booking scenarios that every agent example seems to rely on. These discussions were a step&nbsp;forward.</p><p>These topics reinforced with me that for AI and its agents — “its got&nbsp;legs”.</p>

<p>After five years of standardization work, GNAP is now officially <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9635.html">RFC9635</a>! This long and intense process actually started a few years prior to that, when I was talking with a lot of folks in the security industry about some of the <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/moving-on-from-oauth-2-629a00133ade">shortcomings of OAuth 2.0</a>, and what we could do about them as an industry. These conversations led to the <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/xyz-why-b855970fdd89">XYZ proposal</a> (and implementations) which eventually led to the formation of the GNAP working group along with a bunch of others. In particular, the work that Fabien Imbault, Yaron Sheffer, Leif Johannsen, and Aaron Parecki put into the documents and conversations in the working group over these&nbsp;years.</p><p>I’m really proud of what we’ve built in GNAP. One of the core tenets of GNAP was to look at the world of OAuth and surrounding technologies and figure out how we could do a lot of that better. It’s been great to see GNAP getting applied in a bunch of places over the web, from payments to key management, and especially in places where OAuth doesn’t reach as well. While OAuth remains deeply entrenched over the world, and likely will be for some time, the community has learned many things from GNAP. Alot of things that started in GNAP have been making their way back to the OAuth ecosystem in some&nbsp;form.</p><p>The most obvious of this is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">RFC9396: OAuth Rich Authorization Requests</a>. This replacement of OAuth’s scope parameter was a direct and intentional backport of what became GNAP’s resource access rights, which also acronyms to RAR. In the OAuth world, we don’t get some of the clean features of GNAP, like being able to substitute strings for objects as a shorthand, but a lot of the core enhancements are&nbsp;there.</p><p>We’re also seeing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-first-party-apps/">yet another intent registration addition to OAuth 2</a> (on top of the pushed authorization request, device grant type, and CIBA extensions), and this one mimics a lot of the flexibility of GNAP’s interaction system. It’s a more narrow use case in the OAuth specification, but it’s clear that the pattern that GNAP was built on is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html">RFC9421: HTTP Message Signatures</a>. This is work that started independently from GNAP but grew up around the same time, and GNAP utilizes HTTP Message Signatures as a core security function. I don’t think we’d have gotten the signing spec to be as robust as it is without some of the GNAP key proofing use cases driving the discussion.</p><p>And finally, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-resource-servers">GNAP Resource Servers document</a> has just passed IESG review and is on its own way to becoming an RFC as well. This document represents key abstractions in how and RS and AS relate to each other, and I hope we can continue to build this out and pull the best ideas out into the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The GNAP working group is shutting down now that its core work is done, but GNAP is far from over. I look forward to seeing it grow into its spaces, and serve as a beacon of how a delegation protocol can be engineered and&nbsp;built.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I drafted <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/5" title="pgxn/rfcs#5 Add RFC for JWS-signing PGXN releases">PGXN RFC–5 — Release Certification</a>, which
proposes to replace the simple inclusion of a SHA-1 hash digests in PGXN
release <code>META.json</code> files with a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html" title="JSON Web Signature (JWS)">JWS</a>-signed release payload. From the
introduction:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>This RFC therefore proposes to extend <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/rfcs/pull/3" title="pgxn/rfcs#3 PGXN Meta Spec v2">v2</a> distribution metadata with a
single additional property, <code>certs</code>, that contains one or more
certifications that attest to the authenticity or other characteristics of
a release on PGXN.</p>
<p>The <code>certs</code> value is an object that contains at least one property, <code>pgxn</code>,
which itself contains a PGXN-generated <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html" title="JSON Web Signature (JWS)">RFC 7515</a> JSON Web Signature in
the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-7.2" title="RFC 7515: JWS JSON Serialization">JWS JSON Serialization</a> format. The <code>pgxn</code> property will allow clients
not only to assemble the release URL and verify the downloaded file against
checksums, but also validate it against a public key provided by PGXN.</p>
<p>The design allows multiple signatures, certifications, or other
attestations, which in the future MAY allow authors or other entities to
sign releases with their own keys. The new format appends a structure such
as this to the distribution <code>META.json</code> file:</p>
  <code>{
  "certs": {
    "pgxn": {
      "payload": "eyJ1c2VyIjoidGhlb3J5IiwiZGF0ZSI6IjIwMjQtMDktMTNUMTc6MzI6NTVaIiwidXJpIjoiZGlzdC9wYWlyLzAuMS43L3BhaXItMC4xLjcuemlwIiwiZGlnZXN0cyI6eyJzaGE1MTIiOiJiMzUzYjVhODJiM2I1NGU5NWY0YTI4NTllN2EyYmQwNjQ4YWJjYjM1YTdjMzYxMmIxMjZjMmM3NTQzOGZjMmY4ZThlZTFmMTllNjFmMzBmYTU0ZDdiYjY0YmNmMjE3ZWQxMjY0NzIyYjQ5N2JjYjYxM2Y4MmQ3ODc1MTUxNWI2NyJ9fQ",
      "signature": "cC4hiUPoj9Eetdgtv3hF80EGrhuB__dzERat0XF9g2VtQgr9PJbu3XOiZj5RZmh7AAuHIm4Bh-rLIARNPvkSjtQBMHlb1L07Qe7K0GarZRmB_eSN9383LcOLn6_dO--xi12jzDwusC-eOkHWEsqtFZESc6BfI7noOPqvhJ1phCnvWh6IeYI2w9QOYEUipUTI8np6LbgGY9Fs98rqVt5AXLIhWkWywlVmtVrBp0igcN_IoypGlUPQGe77Rw"
    }
  }
}
</code>

<p>Review and feedback would be very much appreciated, especially on the list of
unresolved questions toward the end.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/author/david-christensen">David Christensen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sjmiller609" title="GitHub: Steven Miller">Steven Miller</a> for the early reviews!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve released <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pgxn_meta/0.4.0" title="crates.io: pgxn_meta crate">pgxn_meta v0.4.0</a>, which adds support for this
format, as well as code to rewrite PGXN v1 release fields to the new format.
It doesn’t actually do signature verification, yet, as the server back end
hasn’t been updated with the pattern and PKI. But I expect to modify it in
response to feedback and get it implemented in early 2025.</p>

<p>As I continue my study and experimentation with coding up AI solutions, and especially, at the moment, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), I decided to work with a post from the <a href="https://www.metadocs.co/">Metadocs blog</a> titled “<a href="https://www.metadocs.co/2024/08/20/simple-agentic-rag-for-multi-vector-stores-with-langchain-and-langgraph/">Simple Agentic RAG for Multi Vector stores with LangChain and LangGraph</a>”. It seemed it would cover two areas of interest, agentic operations and RAG. Little did I expect to learn a valuable lesson in chunking. In this post I’ll pass along the obvious but well demonstrated lesson I gathered in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>It started with the prior mentioned post that referred to a prior post that it built upon. Following a link to that pre-requisite post, “<a href="https://www.metadocs.co/2024/04/05/create-a-langchain-app-with-multiple-vector-store-the-easy-way/">Create a Langchain app with multiple vector store the easy way</a>”, it in turn referenced an even earlier post as a pre-requisite. So down that rabbit hole I went. The earlier post was “<a href="https://www.metadocs.co/2024/03/26/deploy-a-rag-application-with-langchain-streamlit-and-openai-in-10-min/">Deploy a RAG app with Langchain in minutes</a>”. I read the earliest of the three posts and it was a very simple RAG application. I coded it up ensuring I understood each line along the way. Most notable was that it was splitting the text into chunks on “\n\n”. I hadn’t looked at the source document they were providing as a sample. It turns out it was a text file of a US State of the Union address with a twist. Each sentence was followed by “\n\n” (two line feed carriage returns); an interesting if unrealistic formatting. I have my own example PDF that I have been using for testing out various RAG implementations and how it handles a specific prompt, so I copied two paragraphs from the document that contains the context I was after and formatted it with a “\n\n” after each sentence. Normally, I have been extracting the text from the PDF as part of the code and then chunking usually with recursive character text splitting, but I didn’t want to change this program since I was going to build on it. When done the results actually returned what I was after, a list of the 10 principles of&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>For no apparent reason, I decided to edit the text file and format with a single “\n” after each paragraph. This should return the same results if I edited the text split to represent this. It didn’t. I was, and still am, perplexed by this. It makes no sense that a double line feed split should return any different results than a single line feed results under the circumstances. I plan to revisit this as I believe I must be wrong despite trying multiple times. What was most important in the process was that with the right chunking, as simple as it was, I got the desired results when prompted whereas in all my past experiences it had failed. There was a difference in that I was reading a text file versus using a PDF text extractor and that I was using only two paragraphs focused on the context I wanted versus 70 pages of an academic paper that is probably very hard to extract even if the proper area of context was two clean paragraphs of text within that PDF. The real lesson for me is showing how chunking is so important. I suspect the major differential in the success was in the chunk divisions. I won’t rule out the simpler PDF as a contributor.</p><p>Next, I plan to try a few things in this naive RAG implementation before I move on to the multi-vector store — a PDF creation of just the two paragraphs that contain the needed context and split on paragraphs (\n) to see how that comes out. I’ll try the two paragraphs in a PDF with text extracted and chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and separators=[“\n\n”, “\n”, “. “, “ “, “”] and a chunk size of 1000 and two different settings for overlap (0, and 200) as well as with SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction and then the default OpenAi embedding function. Let’s see how all those combinations work.</p><p>To recap, though I can’t explain why I got wildly different results depending on the parsing character used with the tex file format changed, I can suspect the simple chunking by sentence made a lot of difference. The other likely impacting result was clean simple text versus PDF-extracted text. I plan to experiment more and will report back the results. A take away for me, even if it was not entirely or even primarily the impactful element, was how important the chunking is for good&nbsp;results.</p>

This blog post shares some insights into how we built (and keep evolving) a secure, scalable, and reliable identity platform at DevRev. The decisions we made and the lessons we learned throughout this journey, we believe, would be equally applicable to most SaaS companies. I would like to acknowledge and thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akankshadeswal/">Akanksha Deswal</a>, and the DevRev identity team, who were part of this journey, and instrumental in figuring out what works best for&nbsp;us.</p><p>An identity platform serves as a secure bridge between users and the services they access — whether apps, APIs, or microservices — delivering a seamless and trustworthy way to manage, verify, and protect user identities in increasingly interconnected environments. While the expectations for an identity platform can vary depending on specific use cases, at DevRev, we primarily focused on the following core&nbsp;areas.</p>The expectations for an identity platform can vary depending on specific use cases; and at DevRev, we primarily focused on the above core&nbsp;areas.<p>The decision to buy or build components of an identity platform depends on several factors, such as business requirements (both functional and non-functional), cost at scale, available resources, in-house expertise, and more. We wanted to maintain complete control over our object model (organizations, users, groups, etc.) while delegating more generic identity capabilities to an external identity service (identity provider). Having control over the foundational object model is essential for innovation, and allowing a third party to dictate its structure or limitations can stifle growth and introduce significant risks.</p><p>A few years ago, I enjoyed reading Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century by Jeff Lawson. In the book, Jeff reframes the classic ‘build vs. buy’ debate into a more urgent choice: ‘build vs. die.’ As every company evolves into a software company, the true competitive advantage lies in the software they build. When software becomes the critical interface between our services and our customers, not building it to meet the exact needs means risking irrelevance — or worse,&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Building doesn’t always mean starting from scratch. We shouldn’t reinvent the wheel if existing solutions meet our needs. Instead, focus on developing what’s core to our business — the components that give us a competitive edge. Everything else, the foundational components that enable us to build our vision, can be sourced from the digital supply chain. I touched on this concept in the blog post, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>.</p><p>We had no interest in building identity federation standards like OpenID Connect or SAML, nor did we want to develop authentication protocols in-house. These are commodity features supported by almost all identity providers. However, we wanted to ensure the external identity service handling federation and authentication remained a ‘thin’ layer, separate from our business logic. This approach minimizes vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Vendor lock-in isn’t just about making it easy to switch providers — though that’s certainly part of it. More importantly, it’s about retaining the freedom to innovate independently, which was our primary focus. Within the DevRev platform, Janus serves as the identity service, managing the identity object model and interacting with the external identity provider during organization and user onboarding flows. For the rest of the DevRev platform components, the external identity provider remains a black box, only interacting with&nbsp;Janus.</p><p>Choosing the right identity provider requires a thorough and thoughtful evaluation. Our objective wasn’t to find an identity provider that perfectly matched the DevRev object model but rather to focus on its core constructs, their relationships, and the integration effort with the DevRev platform.</p><p>In the DevRev platform, each organization can choose its preferred authentication method. For example, one organization might opt for Google login, while another may use their identity provider via SAML. The external identity provider’s object model must support this flexible relationship between organizations and their connections. For instance, the connection to Google (social) is made using OpenID Connect, and ideally, we should be able to reuse that Google connection (or any other social connection) across multiple organizations.</p><p>This means the identity provider’s object model should allow connections to be defined independently of a specific organization and provide the ability to associate them with any org. During our evaluation, we encountered one identity provider that could only define a connection within the scope of an individual organization (or tenant), which led us to reject&nbsp;it.</p><p>Apart from key functional requirements for authentication and identity federation, we also worried about the scalability, availability, reliability, testability, compliance, and interoperability of the identity provider, and of course the cost at scale. We picked Auth0, mostly because of the lightweight organization model it had and it could meet our requirement to scale the number of organizations to 1 million. Most of the prominent identity providers do support almost all the key identity federation and authentication needs. Only in non-functional requirements and object relationships, you would find the differentiators.</p><p>In our hunt for an external identity provider, we mostly looked for a SaaS product. Going for a SaaS product gave us the freedom to focus on our core business problem, and delegate anything related to the external identity provider to the SaaS vendor. A key reason one would pick an on-prem product over a SaaS product is the freedom to do heavy customizations. Building heavy customization in the identity provider is something we wanted to avoid from day&nbsp;1.</p><p>Then again, I am not completely ruling out identity provider on-prem deployments. It would depend on the industry you are in and your business-specific needs. For example, highly regulated industries would pick an on-prem identity provider to keep all their customer data within their boundaries. I led the development of the open-source WSO2 Identity Server for almost 14 years, before joining DevRev, and saw many large-scale successful on-prem deployments.</p><p>When picking a SaaS identity provider, non-functional requirements play a key role. We have little control over the non-functional requirements, and even from the SaaS vendor’s point of view, they will find it hard to accommodate change requests related to non-functional requirements; as it could require core changes in their product. For example, Auth0 offers an availability of four 9’s. When you create a tenant in Auth0, it’s bound to one region, and internally they create a replica of that tenant in another availability zone. However, when the primary Auth0 region is down, we do not have the control to switch to the corresponding availability zone. It’s the Auth0 team that decides when to switch based on the severity of the incident. Auth0 also offers a private cloud deployment, but, its a costly&nbsp;option.</p><p>Another limitation we found in Auth0 (and of course in most of the other prominent SaaS identity providers as well) replication of data between regions. For example, when you pin your tenant to the Auth0 US-1 region, all the API calls from any region globally must be routed to the US-1 region. Due to this limitation, we’ve witnessed increased latency levels in login API calls (OpenID Connect) for the users connecting from Asia. This hurts the app load time and at the moment we are in the process of building a solution in-house to minimize the&nbsp;impact.</p><p>The DevRev platform is built with 250+ microservices running on Kubernetes. Janus is one of them. Each service has its CI/CD pipeline, which deploys each commit to main, to Prod after running end-to-end tests in Dev and QA. We’ve integrated Auth0 into the Janus integration tests. We have a dedicated Auth0 tenant for that, and in the CI/CD pipeline, we connect to Auth0 via the API to create organizations and users; and then associate users with organizations. Once the tests are complete, we run a clean-up task to remove the resources created in Auth0, as it has certain resource restrictions.</p><p>There was a time when the clean-up task failed to run and unfortunately went unnoticed. This filled up Auth0 resources and soon reached its limits. Auth0 has a limit on the size of the app metadata that can be associated with a user. We used the app metadata to associate the DevRev-generated organization identifier with an Auth0 user. Once we hit the limit, the Auth0 system became unstable, and none of the data in the test tenant could be accessed either via the UI or the API. This became a blocker for the prod promotion of the Janus service and all other services that relied on Janus for testing. As a quick workaround (while the Auth0 team was working on recovering the tenant), we had to spin up a new Auth0 tenant and use that in our tests. Usually, these limits enforced by Auth0 are way beyond our production needs, and we encountered this issue due to the failed clean-up task from our&nbsp;end.</p><p>Auth0 has a rate limit on its management API. During our tests, we used this management API to create organizations and users. Due to the nature of the tests, we started to hit the rate limits (even with proper retries) which resulted in some flaky tests. As a solution, to this and the resource limit issue we discussed before, we ended up mocking Auth0 in our integration tests, rather than directly hitting the Auth0 test&nbsp;tenant.</p><p>We follow GitOps at DevRev to automate and manage infrastructure and application deployments. Git is the single source of truth. This helps us to take any change via a review process and audit all changes. We followed the same model with Auth0, where appropriate. For example, we use Auth0 actions to inject the DevRev-generated org/user identifiers into the tokens it produces. The actions are Javascript code and we keep it in a Git repo and deploy to the Auth0 Prod tenant via Dev and QA. This helped us avoid any manual edits from the Auth0 management console, and keep all three environments consistent.</p><p>Currently, not all operations on Auth0 are fully managed through GitOps. For example, we still update certain settings, such as token lifetimes for applications, directly through the Auth0 management console. Although these are infrequent tasks, it’s essential to have a complete audit trail in production for every operation and change made. While Auth0 provides logs, they are only retained for a month. To ensure long-term visibility, we push Auth0 logs to Datadog and set up Slack alerts for specific cases. Additionally, we’re exploring the use of the Auth0 Terraform provider to automate and manage all Auth0 operations via&nbsp;GitOps.</p><p>Passwords are painful, not just from the user’s point of view but also from the product side. If an app has to support password-based login, it must also build the supporting infrastructure to recover passwords, rotate them periodically, implement strong second-factor authentication, and so on. From day one, we made a design decision to avoid passwords.</p><p>We use Auth0 as an identity bridge. The contract between the DevRev app and Auth0 is defined by OpenID Connect. Auth0 helps us connect multiple other identity providers via SAML and OpenID Connect to authenticate users. These identity providers are either the social identity providers or the enterprise identity providers owned by DevRev customers. Following the identity bridge pattern helped avoid storing user passwords, and also introducing a new identity provider or an authentication method requires no changes to the DevRev app. It can be done transparently.</p>This graph shows the growth of unique monthly active Dev users by connection type over the last 12 months. The growth in active users is healthy, with enterprise connections starting to dominate.<p>The identity bridge pattern effectively addresses the common challenges posed by the spaghetti-identity and identity-silos antipatterns. Spaghetti identity occurs when a SaaS application tries to establish direct, point-to-point integrations with multiple identity providers, leading to complex, tangled connections. On the other hand, identity silos arise when an application is limited to a single federation or authentication protocol, making it difficult and costly to introduce new protocols in the future. By adopting the identity bridge pattern, organizations can simplify integration and enable flexibility in supporting multiple protocols without the downsides of these antipatterns.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning how we leveraged the identity bridge pattern to overcome a limitation in Auth0. Auth0 supports passwordless authentication with email OTP; however, it cannot be used on its own with Auth0 organizations — only as a second factor. This limitation likely arises from Auth0’s architecture, as the organization model was introduced later. To overcome this and use email OTP as a passwordless method, we spun up another Auth0 instance without organizations and then federated to it from the primary Auth0 tenant (which has organizations enabled). While this approach works, it is far from ideal. We anticipate switching to native passwordless email OTP within our primary Auth0 tenant as soon as that feature becomes available.</p><p>Auth0 provides the latency numbers it introduces during the login operations; however, that does not reflect the latency the users experience at the edge. To address this concern, and also to have better visibility into the OpenID Connect login flow, we started routing all login calls to Auth0 via our CDN provider, which is Fastly. On the Fastly Compute@Edge platform, we run an edge gateway, which pushes all the API stats to Google BigQuery for further analysis. There we would know the latency at the edge corresponding to all the login operations. These latency numbers are very much closer to what the users experience. The following graph shows the p90 latency numbers in milliseconds for the last 31 days against a set of selected regions, for the Auth0 token endpoint.</p>p90 latency numbers in milliseconds for the last 31 days against a set of selected regions, for the Auth0 token&nbsp;endpoint<p>All DevRev applications utilize the OpenID Connect authorization code flow. The token endpoint, highlighted in the graph above, is called once during the initial app load and periodically thereafter for token refreshes. While the periodic refreshes happen asynchronously and do not affect the user experience, the latency of the initial token request during page load is more critical.</p><p>Two main factors contribute to this initial&nbsp;latency:</p>  Geographic latency — All users, regardless of location, connect to a centralized Auth0 instance in the US-East&nbsp;region.  Web-worker-based login flow — The DevRev web app, a single-page application (SPA), leverages this flow, which adds complexity and impacts performance during authentication.  <p>We opted for the web-worker-based login flow to enhance security by storing user tokens in browser memory more securely. However, web worker memory is scoped to a single browser tab, which means that even if a user has an active Auth0 session, opening a new tab requires calling both the authorize and token endpoints during the initial page load. Upon analyzing the stats, we found that 91.1% of the calls to the Auth0 authorize endpoint were from users who were already authenticated. To address this, we developed an edge-based solution targeting these 91.1% of users, aiming to reduce the latency at the edge to almost zero. As of this writing, this solution is being tested in our development and QA environments and will soon be available in production.</p>91.1% of the calls to the Auth0 authorize endpoint were from users who were already authenticated (page reloads). The users once logged in to the app, keep the login session. This graph shows the average number of active vs silent logins by weekday for the last 90 days. The edge-based solution we are working on will reduce the latency at the edge for the login calls for already authenticated users by almost&nbsp;100%.<p>In addition to publishing stats related to Auth0 API performance from the edge to Google BigQuery, we also send logs to Datadog. This allows us to trigger alerts in case of Auth0 failures and detect downtimes early. Moreover, this helps us identify which users and organizations are impacted during Auth0 outages — events that have occurred a few times in the past couple of&nbsp;years.</p><p>The contract between all the DevRev apps and the identity provider is based on OpenID Connect. However, we didn’t find the ID token to be particularly useful in the case of an SPA. An SPA is simply a “dumb” app or a public client, which means it cannot make any trustworthy decisions on its own. The access token is the key! (If you’re interested in learning more about the difference between the ID token and the access token, please check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sICt5aS7wzk">this</a>&nbsp;video.)</p><p>We use self-contained access tokens (JWTs), which include the user context with every request. These tokens have been widely adopted in the industry and were formalized as an IETF standard in 2021 (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068">RFC 9068</a>). While Auth0 has yet to support RFC 9068, this has had no impact on our use cases. In fact, for an SPA, using reference tokens (the other alternative to self-contained access tokens — also known as opaque access tokens) is not a viable option. Only the issuer of an opaque token can validate it, and it’s impractical for the gateway intercepting API requests to communicate with the issuer for token validation, for each&nbsp;request.</p><p>When using self-contained tokens, we also need to implement support for revocation. Unlike self-contained tokens, when a reference token is revoked, that request goes to the token issuer. The consumer of the token (such as a gateway) would be aware of the revocation because it communicates with the token issuer each time it validates a token. However, there’s no point in communicating with the issuer to revoke a self-contained token unless there’s a reliable way to propagate the revocation decision to all dependent systems. To address this, we introduced the auth-tokens.delete endpoint, allowing us to revoke access tokens upon user logout. We also maintain a cache of the revoked token IDs, with a TTL based on the token’s expiration.</p><p>Returning to the topic of the ID token, the DevRev app relies on the dev-users.self API to identify the user. Additionally, another reason we can't rely on the ID token for user identification is that Auth0 cannot embed the necessary user information into the ID token, as we store only a minimal set of user data in&nbsp;Auth0.</p><p>Most of the support queries we receive from our customers related to login are due to some kind of an issue with the OTP delivery. Even though the number of such queries is quite low (compared to the success cases), when it happens, it’s painful to the users and hurts the business. Most of the DevRev customers at the stage of evaluation use email OTP-based login and then later switch to login with their identity provider, with SAML or OpenID Connect. Apart from our direct customers, we also offer a support portal for our customers’ customers (who we call Rev users), which also offers login with email&nbsp;OTP.</p><p>Most email OTP-related issues arise from one of the following causes:</p>  The user’s email is added to the email provider’s global suppression list.  The OTP email is marked as&nbsp;spam.  The OTP email is rejected by the user’s mailbox due to internal domain restrictions, or other similar&nbsp;factors.  <p>Email service providers (ESPs) maintain global suppression lists to prevent sending emails to addresses that have previously bounced (due to invalid addresses) or opted out of receiving emails from certain senders. If a user’s email address is on such a list, the OTP email won’t be delivered. This can happen if the user’s email previously encountered delivery issues, such as soft or hard&nbsp;bounces.</p><p>Initially, we used SendGrid as our ESP for sending OTP emails as well as marketing emails. Although we used two separate SendGrid accounts for these purposes, SendGrid maintains a global suppression list shared across accounts when emails originate from the same domain — devrev.ai in our case. This meant that if a user unsubscribed from marketing emails, they were automatically added to the global suppression list, preventing them from receiving OTPs. In some cases, users didn’t even unsubscribe themselves; certain plugins handled it automatically.</p><p>This behavior was undesirable, as it significantly impacted OTP delivery. To address the issue, we switched to AWS SES for sending OTP emails, which reduced global suppression list-related problems by nearly&nbsp;90%.</p><p>We once encountered a particularly interesting issue related to email OTPs, and while it wasn’t a delivery problem, it’s worth mentioning. The user received the OTP email, but every time they tried entering the OTP, it failed. What made this case even more intriguing was that we discovered the OTP had already been attempted from a different IP address just before the user tried it. This explained why the OTP kept failing — the user was attempting to use an OTP that had already been&nbsp;used.</p><p>After further troubleshooting, we discovered the root cause. Along with the OTP in the email, we had also embedded an OTP link that allowed users to log in directly by clicking it. Although this link was commented out in the HTML template and not visible to the user, the organization this user belonged to had strict security protocols that automatically scanned and clicked on links embedded in incoming emails. This security bot didn’t distinguish between commented-out links and visible ones, so it clicked the hidden link, sending a request to the Auth0 server and invalidating the OTP before the user could use it. The issue was resolved by completely removing the commented-out OTP link from the email template.</p><p>Many email providers have spam filters that automatically classify certain emails as spam based on various criteria, such as the content of the email, sending frequency, or the sender’s reputation. If the OTP email is flagged as spam, it ends up in the user’s spam or junk folder, leading to the user not receiving it in their primary inbox. This could occur if the email provider deems the sender domain as suspicious or if the email contains certain keywords that trigger spam filters. After moving from SendGrid to AWS SES and then carefully designing the email template, we could get the number of spam emails almost down to&nbsp;0.</p><p>Every organization and user in the DevRev platform is assigned a unique, immutable, and persistent pseudonym known as a DON (DevRev Object Name). Every resource in the platform has its own DON. The format of a DON is: don:&lt;service&gt;:&lt;partition&gt;:(&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;)+, inspired by Amazon Resource Names&nbsp;(ARN).</p><p>For example, don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz is the DON of an organization. Here, identity refers to the service name, and dvrv-us-1 is the partition identifier, which indicates the organization’s location. For example, an organization in the us-east-1 region has dvrv-us-1 as its partition ID, while one in ap-south-1 has dvrv-in-1.</p><p>The type field of the DON defines the type of the object it is attached to. Every key entity within the DevRev platform is associated with an object, and all objects share a common ancestor known as the Atom object. For example, a devo object type represents a Dev organization, while devu represents a Dev user. A Dev organization is a company or team that uses the DevRev platform, and its members are referred to as Dev users. Customers of a Dev organization are called Rev users, who belong to Rev organizations (also known as workspaces). Both Rev organizations and Rev users operate within the scope of a Dev organization. For instance, the DON of a Rev organization would be: don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz:revo/pqr.</p><p>All identity objects in the DevRev platform follow a predefined schema, ensuring consistency and standardization across all organizations. This common schema facilitates smooth integration and uniformity across the platform. However, recognizing that different organizations may have unique requirements, we also provide the flexibility to extend the Dev user and Rev user objects with custom fields specific to a given Dev organization.</p><p>Customizability is essential for organizations that need to tailor their identity models to accommodate unique workflows, industry requirements, or specific customer data needs. For instance, a Dev organization might need to capture additional fields such as department codes, job roles, or region-specific preferences that go beyond the standard schema. Moreover, when importing Rev user objects from external systems like Salesforce or Zendesk, these objects may come with their own set of attributes. The ability to extend and adapt the schema allows organizations to seamlessly integrate and migrate from these external systems to the DevRev platform.</p><p>All personally identifiable information (PII) of DevRev users is stored exclusively in Janus, making it the single source of truth for PII. Other services in the platform reference users through their DONs. For example, when a client calls the works.get API to retrieve a work item, the request goes through the DevRev gateway, which makes a gRPC call to the corresponding service. The service returns the work item data, including the DONs of the users who created and are assigned to the&nbsp;item.</p>The DevRev platform is built with 250+ microservices running on Kubernetes. Fastly Compute@Edge serves as the entry point at the edge for all DevRev services. At the origin, the DevRev API gateway intercepts all incoming traffic. Once the gateway verifies the JWT accompanying an API request, it dispatches the request to the appropriate service.<p>Since raw user DONs are not user-friendly, the gateway resolves them into user details, such as display name, email, and full name, by querying Janus (<a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html">the API composition pattern</a>). These user summaries are cached in Redis to avoid repetitive calls to Janus (from the gateway), ensuring faster response times for future requests.</p><p>A DON attached to a user or an organization is an immutable identifier. It’s not just immutable, but also resolvable by its own — or embeds information in it. For example, we use the partition ID embedded into the organization DON to route requests to the corresponding region of the organization, in our <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/how-we-built-multi-regional-routing-at-the-edge-devrev-42059ddb9225">multi-regional routing implementation </a>built at the edge. Designing a system based on immutable identifiers needs to be done with care because the cost of a bad design decision is high. For example, we embed the Dev organization ID into the user DON, which means we cannot move this user to another Dev organization or a user cannot be part of multiple Dev organizations. This is a conscious decision we made to scope all the resources in the DevRev platform under a Dev organization.</p><p>However, we made a mistake in our Rev user implementation. The Rev user DON embeds both the Dev organization ID and the corresponding Rev organization ID. This means, a Rev user cannot switch Rev organizations, or cannot be part of multiple Rev organizations. This was not a requirement initially, but as we kept learning from our customers, we figured that it was a too restrictive constraint to limit a Rev user to one Rev organization. We made the Rev user scoped at the Dev organization level and removed the Rev organization ID from the DON. This was a painful&nbsp;change.</p><p>The Dev organization ID (don:identity:dvrv-us-1:devo/xyz), which is embedded into a DON is not incremental. An incremental ID can expose sensitive information, such as the total number of organizations created over time. Malicious actors could exploit this to infer patterns about system growth or attempt ID enumeration attacks to access or manipulate unauthorized resources. Non-incremental IDs make it harder to guess or predict other organization IDs, improving security and reducing the risk of ID enumeration.</p><p>The randomly generated IDs provide global uniqueness, meaning IDs can be safely generated across distributed systems without the risk of collision. This allows for a more flexible, decentralized architecture where different systems or regions can generate IDs without coordinating with a central&nbsp;system.</p><p>We initially used a 48-bit random value as the Dev organization ID. Once base62 encoded, it becomes a string with either 8 or 9 characters. When we moved to the multi-regional deployment, we wanted to ensure the Dev organization ID is unique across all regions by adding a regional prefix, for example, “1” for us-east1. However, since the previously generated Dev organization IDs were already 8 or 9 characters long, this introduced a challenge. A new region could potentially generate an ID with the prefix that results in 9 characters, which could match an already generated ID from a different region, before the introduction of the regional prefix. To address this, we first ensured the base62-encoded 48-bit value was always 9 characters by adding padding, and then introduced a regional prefix on top of that, effectively making the Dev organization ID a fixed-length random string of 10 characters.</p><p>What does deleting a Dev organization mean? A Dev organization has many other resources linked to it within and outside the identity space (or Janus). Dev users, Rev users, workspaces, accounts, service accounts, system users, and preferences are all identity-related objects, while conversations, articles, tickets, and issues, for example, are objects outside the identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>This is a common problem in a distributed system. What we need is a cascade delete. Implementing a cascade delete in a distributed system requires careful consideration of consistency, availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Unlike a traditional monolithic system, where database constraints and relationships can directly enforce cascade deletes, distributed systems involve multiple services, databases, and possibly different regions, making the process more&nbsp;complex.</p><p>When a Dev organization is deleted, we mark it as soft-deleted. A soft delete marks a Dev organization as deleted without actually removing it from the database. This is, in general, useful to avoid cascading failures in case other services depend on the deleted entity. When a Dev organization is marked as deleted, it triggers a CDC (change data capture) event, and we have a dedicated service (garbage collection service), listening to these events and taking actions based on the type of the object being deleted and the dependent object&nbsp;types.</p><p>Once the garbage collection service picks the event to soft delete an organization, it spins up a temporal workflow, which will trigger the cascade delete of the dependent objects after a retention period. As you have figured out already this is a recursive process, and we only need to specify the first level of dependencies.</p><p>In general, there are two common saga patterns for cascade delete implementation, orchestration-based saga and choreography-based saga. In the orchestration-based saga pattern, a central coordinator service orchestrates the cascade delete by calling each service that manages dependent objects in a defined sequence. It ensures the cascade completes across all services or triggers compensating actions (e.g., undo the deletion) if a step fails. In the choreography-based saga pattern, each service listens for events and performs its part of the cascade delete, triggering further events to continue the process. We picked the orchestration-based saga pattern over the choreography-based saga.</p><p>At DevRev, we leverage a range of databases — including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and DynamoDB — each selected to address specific use cases. For all identity-related data managed by Janus and the STS (which we’ll discuss later in this blog), we rely on MongoDB. MongoDB is ideal for transactional (OLTP) workloads, excelling in scenarios that demand high write throughput and the ability to manage large volumes of concurrent transactions. Its built-in replication via replica sets provides automatic failover and data redundancy across multiple nodes, enhancing both reliability and fault tolerance. To ensure data consistency, we utilize the majority write concern and read from the primary node. Currently, we are focusing on improving read and write performance in this&nbsp;setup.</p><p>MongoDB also offers horizontal scaling through sharding, where each shard operates as a replica set. Data is distributed across shards using a shard key, which is a field (or combination of fields) that determines how MongoDB partitions and routes data. Although we currently operate with a replica set without sharding, we’ve designed each collection in the identity database with a Dev organization ID field that can serve as the shard key, allowing us to seamlessly enable sharding when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Unlike traditional relational databases, which require predefined schema structures, MongoDB’s document-oriented nature supports schema-less design. This flexibility has allowed us to rapidly develop and iterate on identity objects without the need to define a schema or handle migrations upfront.</p><p>Along with MongoDB we also use Google BigQuery, which is a fully managed, serverless, and highly scalable data warehouse designed for fast SQL-based queries and real-time analytics on large datasets. We are using the MongoDB Kafka connector to capture change data capture (CDC) events from MongoDB and push them to BigQuery. This also acts as an audit for all changes at the data&nbsp;level.</p><p>SCIM support had always been planned but was deprioritized due to other tasks. We’re excited that it is now an integral part of the DevRev identity platform. SCIM offers a standardized protocol that streamlines the exchange of identity information between identity providers and external applications, significantly reducing manual processes and minimizing errors. It ensures that user data is synchronized and consistent across all systems. Furthermore, SCIM enhances security by automating the revocation of user access when employees leave or change roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring proper access management.</p><p>DevRev provides a SCIM endpoint for provisioning users and groups from an organization’s identity provider. Initial testing was done using Okta as the identity provider, and the DevRev SCIM integration will soon be available on the Okta Integration Network. Following that, we plan to expand availability to Azure and Google platforms. As a DevRev platform customer, the DevRev organization has already implemented SCIM for integration with Okta, streamlining identity management within the organization.</p><p>The identity bridge pattern (which we discussed before) facilitates trust mediation between the identity provider trusted by the DevRev platform (Auth0) and external identity providers that authenticate users from DevRev organizations. This pattern is primarily focused on human identities. To bridge the human identity into the services, we’ve introduced a security token service (STS). The STS implementation is inspired by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">RFC 8693</a>. This adds another level of indirection in trust, and all DevRev services only need to trust the STS. You can read more about STS from this blog: <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/securing-north-south-and-east-west-traffic-devrev-2004b4397950">Securing north/south and east/west traffic @&nbsp;DevRev</a>.</p><p>STS is a key part of the DevRev identity architecture, which helps to make the identity provider a thin layer, which we discussed earlier in this blog. An Auth0 token tells us who the user is and does not embed any PII data other than the email address. However, when exchanging an Auth0 token for an STS-issued token, we have the flexibility to enrich the token with the data available in the DevRev platform.</p>The STS is capable of issuing tokens of different types. This graph shows the number of tokens issued by the STS for the last 30&nbsp;days.<p>The STS is capable of issuing tokens of different types. For example Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for Dev users, Application Access Tokens (AAT) for service accounts, Rev session tokens for Rev users, and so on. Each of these token types is bound to a set of processing rules. For example, while issuing a Rev session token, the STS talks to Janus, and just-in-time provisions the Rev user, if they do not exist in the system. Another example would be how we handle delegation workflows. When a snap-in wants to act on behalf of a Rev user, it authenticates with its AAT (which represents the snap-in service account) and requests a Rev session token. Also, the STS-issued tokens are used in the multi-regional setup to facilitate certain region-to-region interactions.</p><p>In this blog post, we highlighted key aspects of the DevRev identity platform and the lessons we’ve learned throughout its development. This is an ongoing effort, and as we continue to gain insights from our customers, we constantly discover new ways to enhance the platform and tackle exciting challenges in the identity and security landscape.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-lessons-learned-in-building-a-secure-scalable-and-reliable-identity-platform-devrev-df62e52e89ad">The lessons learned in building a secure, scalable, and reliable identity platform @ DevRev</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/06/pgconf-future-ecosystem/" title="PGConf.dev 2024">PGConf.dev report</a> a couple days ago, I mentioned that a few actionable
items came out of the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGConf.dev_2024_Developer_Unconference#Improving_extensions_in_core">Improving extensions in core</a> unconference session. One
was the need to document the heretofore unofficial policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Wikipedia: API">API</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" title="Wikipedia: Application binary interface">ABI</a>
stability between major and, especially, minor versions of Postgres.</p>
<p>A frequent topic at the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/extension-ecosystem-summit/" title="Extension Ecosystem Summit 2024">Extension Summit and Mini-Summits</a> and a number of
PCConf sessions has been concern regarding compatibility changes between minor
releases of Postgres. At <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/05/mini-summit-five/">Mini Summit Five</a>, for example, Yurii Rashkovskii
presented a few examples of such changes, leading him to conclude, along with
several others in the community, that C API-using extensions can only be used
when built against the minor release with which they’re used.</p>
<p>In the Unconference session, core committers reported that such changes are
carefully made, and rarely, if ever, affect extensions compiled for different
minor releases of the same major version. Furthermore, they carefully make
such changes to avoid compatibility issues. In <a href="https://x.com/petervgeoghegan/status/1785720228237717627" title="Peter Geoghegan on Twitter: You must be referring to my commit 714780dc…">the case Yurii
found</a>, for example, a field was added to a struct’s padding,
without affecting the ordering of other fields, thus minimizing the risk of
runtime failures.</p>
<p>It became clear that, although the committers follow a policy — and read new
committers into it via patch review — it’s not documented anywhere. The
result has been a bunch of sturm und drang amongst extension developer unsure
what level of compatibility to depend on and what changes to expect.</p>
<p>The week after the conference, I started a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> proposing to
document the committer policy. Following some discussion and review of
potential ABI breaks in minor releases, the consensus seemed to be that the
committers strive to avoid such breaks, that they’re quite uncommon in minor
releases, and that most of the reported issues were due to using more obscure
APIs.</p>
<p>As a result, we started drafting a policy, and after a few iterations, <a href="https://peter.eisentraut.org">Peter
Eisentraut</a> pulled things together from the perspective of a core team member,
reframed as “Server API and ABI Guidance”. I converted it into a <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/48/5080/" title="Commitfest — Docs: API &amp; ABI Guidance">patch</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/postgres/pull/6" title="theory/postgres: Add API an ABI guidance to the C language docs">pull request</a>) to add it to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc-c.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: C-Language Functions">C Language docs</a>. A key statement on minor
releases:</p>
  
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general, extension code that compiles and works with a minor release
should also compile and work with any other minor release of the same major
version, past or future.</p>
    </blockquote>
  
<p>I hope this document clarifies things. Even if it’s not as strict as some
might hope, it at least documents the project approach to compatibility, so we
have a better idea what to expect when using the C APIs. If you see gaps, or
you have additional questions, please respond to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/5DA9F9D2-B8B2-43DE-BD4D-53A4160F6E8D@justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers: Proposal: Document ABI Compatibility">pgsql-hackers thread</a> — or
