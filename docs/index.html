   Scaling Datastores at Slack with Vitess 
 Slack spent three years migrating 99% of their MySQL query load to run against Vitess, the open source MySQL sharding system originally built by YouTube. "Today, we serve 2.3 million QPS at peak. 2M of those queries are reads and 300K are writes. Our median query latency is 2 ms, and our p99 query latency is 11 ms."

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity offers much more than just better ways to log in. The identity metasystem is really a sophisticated messaging system that is trustworthy, secure, and extensible. While decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials have much to offer the Internet of Things (IoT), the secure messaging subsystem promises an IoT that goes well beyond those initial scenarios. This post gives and introduction to SSI and IoT. The follow-on post goes deeper into what a true Internet of Things founded on SSI can provide.</p>




<p>
    I've been contemplating a self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT) for over a decade. An SSIoT is the only architecture which frees us from what I've called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>. Unlike the CompuServe of Things, the SSIoT1 supports rich, peer-to-peer relationships between people, things, and their manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
    In the CompuServe of Things, Alice's relationships with her things are intermediated by the company she bought them from as shown in Figure 1. Suppose, for example, she has a connected coffee grinder from Baratza. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative relationships in today's CompuServe of Things (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, Alice uses Brataza's app on her mobile device to connect with Baratza's IoT cloud. She registers her coffee grinder, which only knows how to talk to Baratza's proprietary service API. Baratza intermediates all of Alice's interactions with her coffee grinder. If Baratza is offline, decides to stop supporting her grinder, goes out of business, or otherwise shuts down the service, Alice's coffee grinder becomes less useful and maybe stops working all together. 
</p>

<p>
    In an SSIoT, on the other hand, Alice has direct relationships with her things. In  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a>, I showed a diagram where Alice has relationships with people and organizations. But I left out things because I hadn't yet provided a foundational discussion of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm-enabled digital relationships</a> that's necessary to really understand how SSI can transform IoT. Figure 2 is largely the same as the diagram in the post on operationalizing digital relationships with just a few changes: I've removed the ledger and key event logs to keep it from being too cluttered and I've added a thing: a Baratza coffee grinder2.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Alice has a relationship with her coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, the coffee grinder is a fully capable participant in Alice's relationship network. Alice has a DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. She also has a relationship with the company who makes it, Baratza, as does the coffee grinder. Those last two are optional, but useful—and, importantly, fully under Alice's control. 
</p>


<a></a>
 DID Relationships for IoT 

<p>
    Let's focus on Alice, her coffee grinder, and Baratza to better understand the contrast between the CompuServe of Things and an SSIoT.  
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Alice's relationships with her coffee grinder and it's manufacturer (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In Figure 3, rather than being intermediated by the coffee grinder's manufacturer, Alice has a direct, DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. Both Alice and the coffee grinder have agents and wallets. Alice also has a DID-based relationship with Baratza which runs an enterprise agent. Alice is now the intermediary, interacting with her coffee grinder and Baratza as she see's fit. 
</p>

<p>
    Figure 3 also shows a DID-based relationship between the coffee grinder and Baratza. In an administrative CompuServe of Things, we might be concerned with the privacy of Alice's data. But in a Self-Sovereign Internet of Things, Alice controls the policies on that relationship and thus what is shared. She might, for example, authorize the coffee grinder to share diagnostic information when she needs service. She could also issue a credential to Baratza to allow them to service the grinder remotely, then revoke it when they're done. 
</p>

<p>
    The following sections describe three of many possible use cases for the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Updating Firmware 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.embedded-computing.com/articles/firmware-security-for-iot-devices">problems with the CompuServe of Things</a> is securely updating device firmware. There are many different ways to approach secure firmware updates in the CompuServe of things—each manufacturer does it slightly differently. The SSIoT provides a standard way to know the firmware update is from the manufacturer and not a hacker.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 4: Updating the firmware in Alice's coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    As shown in Figure 4, Baratza has written a public DID to the ledger. They can use that public DID to sign firmware updates. Baratza embedded their public DID in the coffee grinder when it was manufactured. The coffee grinder can resolve the DID to look up Baratza's current public key on the ledger and validate the signature. This ensures that the firmware package is from Baratza. And DIDs allow Baratza to rotate their keys as needed without invalidating the DIDs stored in the devices.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, we could also solve this problem with digital certificates. So, this is really just table stakes. The advantage of using SSIoT for secure firmware updates instead of digital certificates is that if Baratza is using it for other things (see below), they get this for free without also having to support the certificate code in their products or pay for certificates.
</p>

<a></a>
 Proving Ownership 

<p>
    Alice can prove she owns a particular model of coffee grinder using a verifiable credential.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 5: Alice uses a credential to prove she owns the coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 5 shows how this could work. The coffee grinder's agent is running the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">Introduction</a> protocol and has introduced Alice to Baratza. This allows her to form a relationship with Baratza that is more trustworthy because it came on an introduction from something she trusts.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, Alice has received a credential from her coffee grinder stating that she is the owner. This is kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)">imprinting</a>. While it may not be secure enough for some use cases, for things like a coffee grinder, it's probably secure enough. Once Alice has this credential, she can use it to prove she's the owner. The most obvious place would be at Baratza itself to receive support, rewards, or other benefits. But other places might be interested in seeing it as well: "Prove you own a Baratza coffee grinder and get $1 off your bag of beans."
</p>

<p>
    


<a></a>
</p> Real Customer Service 

<p>
    We've all been in customer hell where we call a company, get put on hold, get ask a bunch of questions to validate who we are, have to recite serial numbers or model numbers to one agent, then another, and then lose the call and have to start all over again. Or been trapped in a seemingly endless IVR phone loop trying to even get to a human. 
</p>

<p>
    The DID-based relationship Alice has created with Baratza does away with that because DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication, reducing effort and increasing security. As a result, Alice has a trustworthy communication channel with Baratza that both parties can use to authenticate the other.  Furthermore, as we saw in <a>the last section</a>, Alice can prove she's a bona fide customer.
</p>

<p>
    But the ability of DIDComm messaging to support higher-level application protocols means that the experience can be much richer. Here's s simple example. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 6: Alice uses a specialized wallet to manage the vendors of things she owns (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In Figure 6, Alice has two coffee grinders. Let's further assume that Alice has a specialized wallet to interact with her things. <a href="https://searls.com">Doc Searls</a> has suggested we call it a "briefer" because it's more capable than a wallet. Alice's briefer does all the things her credential wallet can do, but also has a user interface for managing all the things she owns and the relationships she has with them3. Students in <a href="https://picolabs.io">my lab at BYU</a> have been working on a prototype of such an interface we call <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io">Manifold</a> using agent-enabled digital twins called "<a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?homepageId=1189866">picos</a>".
</p>

<p>
    Having two things manufactured by Baratza presents a problem when Alice wants to contact them because now she is the intermediary between the thing and its vendor. But if we flip that and let the thing be the intermediary, the problem is easily resolved. Now when Alice wants to contact Baratza, she clicks one button in her briefer and lets her coffee grinder intermediate the transaction. The grinder can interject relevant information into the conversation so Alice doesn't have to. Doc does a great job of describing why the "thing as conduit" model is so powerful in <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You'll recall from <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, that behind every wallet is one or more agents. Alice's briefer has an agent. And it has relationships with each of her things. Each of those has one or more agents. These agents are running an application protocol for vendor message routing. The protocol is using sub protocols that allow the grinder to act on Alice's behalf in customer support scenarios. You can imagine that CRM tools would be fitted out to understand these protocols as well. 
</p>

<p>
    There's at least one company working on this idea right now, <a href="https://www.hearro.com/">HearRo</a>. Vic Cooper, the CEO of HearRo recently told me:
</p>
<blockquote>Most communications happen in the context of a process. [Customers] have a vector that involves changing some state from A to B. "My thing is broken and I need it fixed." "I lost my thing and need to replace it." "I want a new thing and would like to pay for it but my card was declined." This is the story of the customer service call.  To deliver the lowest effort interaction, we need to know this story. We need to know why they are calling. To add the story to our context we need to do two things: capture the intent and manage the state over time. SSI has one more super power that we can take advantage of to handle the why part of our interaction. We can use SSI to operationalize the relationships.
</blockquote>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalized  relationships</a> provide persistence and context. When we include the product itself in the conversation, we can build customer service applications that are low effort because the trustworthy connection can include not only the who, but also the what to provide a more complete story. We saw this in the example with two coffee grinders. Knowing automatically which grinder Alice needs service for is a simple bit of context, but one that reduces effort nonetheless. 
</p>

<p>
    Going further, the interaction itself can be a <a href="http://picolabs.io/">persistent object</a> with it's own identity, and DID-based connections to the participants4. Now the customer and the company can bring tools to bear on the interaction. Others could be invited to join the interaction as necessary and the interaction itself now becomes a persistent nexus that evolves as the conversation does. I recently had a month long customer service interaction involving a few dozen calls with Schwab (don't ask). Most of the effort for me and them was reestablishing context over and over again. No CRM tool can provide that because it's entirely one-sided. Giving customers tools to operationalize customer relationships solves this problem. 
</p>

<a></a>
 A Self-Sovereign Internet of Things 

<p>
    The Sovrin Foundation has an IoT working group that recently released a <a href="https://sovrin.org/library-iot/">whitepaper on Self-Sovereign Identity and IoT</a>. In it you'll find a discussion of some problems with IoT and where SSI can help. The paper also has a section on the business value of SSI in IoT. The paper is primarily focused on how decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials can support IoT. The last use case I offer above goes beyond those, primarily identity-centric, use cases by employing DIDComm messaging to ease the burden of getting support for a product.
</p>

<p>
    In my next blog post, I'll extend that idea to discuss how SSI agents that understand DIDComm messages can provide advanced interactions not easily supported in the CompuServe of Things as well as play a bigger role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">vendor relationship management</a>. These and other scenarios can rescue us from an administrative, bureaucratic CompuServe of Things and create a generative IoT ecosystem that is truly internet-like. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Some argue that since things can't be sovereign (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.mq7pzglc1j96">Appendix B of the Sovrin Glossary for a taxonomy of entities</a>), they shouldn't be part of SSI. I take the selfish view that as a sovereign actor in the identity metasystem, I want my things to be part of that same ecosystem. Saying things are covered under the SSI umbrella doesn't imply they're sovereign, but merely says they are subject to the same overarching governance framework and use the same underlying protocols. In the next post on this subject, I'll make the case that even if things aren't sovereign, they should have an independent existence and identity from their owners and manufacturers.
     
     The choice of a coffee grinder is based simply on the fact that it was the example <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> gave when we were having a discussion about this topic recently.
     
     This idea has been on my mind for a while. This post from 2013, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/06/facebook_for_my_stuff.shtml">Facebook for My Stuff</a> discusses it in the "social" venacular of the day. 
         The idea that a customer service interaction might itself be a participant in the SSIoT may cause some to shake their heads. But once we create a true internet of things, it's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">not just material, connected things that will be on it</a>. The interaction object could have its own digital wallet, store credentials, and allow all participants to continue to interact with it over time, maintaining context, providing workflow, and serving as a record that everyone involved can access.

<p>I remember the day I realized who I wanted to be very clearly. I was sat in the Matter San Francisco garage, watching a panel of entrepreneurs from previous cohorts give advice to the current set of six startups who were about to graduate from the program. As I listened to the advice from the sidelines, as a member of the Matter team rather than a founder, an overwhelming sadness began to take hold.</p><p>It shouldn't have: Matter was a dream job that allowed me to support a particular kind of mission-driven startup founder. I loved every minute of it. But at my core, there was a part of me that missed building. Through supporting these 75 companies, I understood the mistakes I'd made more deeply, and knew I could do better next time.</p><p>I also knew myself better than I had the two times I'd been a co-founder. The truth is, I have a problem with authority: I hate being told what to do, and I'm not interested in perpetuating existing hierarchies. Starting my own businesses has been a way to create a working environment that's mine and mine alone, in a way that being an employee or a contractor never could be. I get to set the culture; I get to set the mission. It's a very individualist way of looking at work, but I'm not sure I can be different. Establishing a protective bubble that allows me to think in the way I need to has been important. It's a double-edged sword: external accountability also turns out to be important, and is harder to come by when you work for yourself.</p><p>I didn't go out and become a founder again. Instead, I've found a way to give myself creative space by working on side projects, which are never businesses and sometimes have nothing to do with technology at all. That doesn't mean I won't eventually start something new, but it takes the emotional pressure off a little. I get to work on something that's entirely mine, on my own time, with nobody telling me I should do it a different way, and without the pressure of it having to raise money or be self-sustaining. I've found it to be a very good balance, and it often helps my day job work.</p><p>Ultimately, the reasons I felt misgivings during the Matter panel were tied up in my identity. I am a founder: I make things using effort and creativity. That's not a million miles away from being an artist. But it's very different to being someone who has spent a long time going deep on a single career path serving other peoples' businesses. That might be where I am, but it's not how I see myself, and it doesn't cut to the core of the work I do. I've learned I'd rather earn half as much money to have twice as much freedom.</p><p>I've found it useful to bring that attitude to work. I'm in service of a mission that I've bought into, but take a critical eye to the vision and strategy. Is it the right thing for the people I want to help? Is it meaningful to work on? Is it intellectually honest? Going in and treating the company as if it was my startup to shape by definition means I'm unlikely to go with the flow, for better or worse.</p><p>I suspect most founders are the same.</p>

<p>On Monday, November 23rd the Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* held its 17th event, the focus of this event was on Guardianship and SSI.  Our presenter was Philippe Page of The Human Colossus Foundation and is a current member of the Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group.   </p><p>Guardianship is a legal status where one individual is under the legal care of another.  A natural guardian relationship is between parent and child, legal guardians are persons who are recognized by the courts as having the legal authority and duty of care for another.  </p><p>While there are long standing legal precedents and processes around the assignment, management and revocation of guardianships, these requirements were not met by existing digital identity management solutions. With SSI, this mechanism now exists.  SSI can work in conjunction with traditional identity and credential management systems while being able to integrate into existing legal processes and provides a robust mechanism for revocation.</p><p>Guardianship is a complex topic, with many subtleties and layers.  In the humanitarian sector the it is a reality of daily life when supporting and assisting migrants, refugees and displaced persons.  It is a topic we all are faced with in our lifetimes; whether as a child (being cared for) or as an adult (caring for or being cared for).  In this first event on this topic, Philippe has provided an overview of how SSI and Guardianship fit together and how SSI meets the lifecycle stages (Inception, Creation, Usage and Termination) of guardianship.  </p><p>An objective of these events is to educate the community on how high assurance digital identities unlock new possibilities across all entities and industry sectors.   Using the tripartite relationship in clinical drug trials of patient, doctor and pharma company, Philippe covered how guardianship can also be used to manage consent to derive a business value unlocked with high assurance digital identity.  </p><p>Guardianship is an important legal concept, and will be a topic we will return to in 2021.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/482803989">https://vimeo.com/482803989</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:03:55 - Philippe Page - Introduction</p>  <p>0:08:03 - Overview</p>  <p>0:08:41 -  Guardianship background</p>  <p>0:20:15 - Core Components</p>  <p>0:33:51 - Scaling and Standardization</p>  <p>0:39:04 - Bridging Economic Actors &amp; Human Centricity</p>  <p>0:45:45 - Applications</p>  <p>1:02:08 - Questions</p>  <p>For more information on:</p><p>	- Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group :&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">https://sovrin.org/guardianship/</a></p><p>	- The Human Colossus Foundation : <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">https://humancolossus.foundation/</a></p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

The author recognizes that there may be errors and biases, and welcomes constructive feedback to correct or ameliorate.</p><p>We all like secrets. When we possess a secret, it gives us a heightened sense of individuality — that we know some that nobody else knows — giving us a special perspective or an option for the future that only we can exercise — in other words,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/power">power</a>.</p><p>It turns out, imaginary or not, secrets are fundamental to the power that we have as individuals and institutions in the digital realm. Passwords, codes — those things that grant us or enable us to grant special access to those things that valuable, like bank accounts, emails, or the drafts and finals of our deliberations, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>It turns out, that up until, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-day-cryptography-changed-forever-1b6aefe8bda7">August 1, 1977</a>, secrets had a fundamental fault — we had to share them to use them. That meant you had to trust someone else, and that could eventually lead to the betrayal of your secret, and by extension, you.</p><p>In 1977, the public introduction of asymmetric cryptography heralded a new generation of secret capabilities. The first major capability was the establishment of shared secrets across insecure channels enabling encryption between two parties without the requirement of a secret backchannel. The second was enabling commitments using secrets that are not shared, more commonly known as digital signatures.</p><p>What had been discovered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (and also Jame Ellis), is changing the world as we know it. It’s been only 43 years. Yes, that seems like an ice-age ago, but in the grand scheme of history, it is only a&nbsp;wink.</p><p>My concluding remark in this brief post is that<a href="https://youtu.be/4cia_v4vxfE"> you ain’t seen nothing yet</a> (with apologies to BTO). I have been learning about many related schemes, based on that 1977 publicly-announced breakthrough: elliptic curves, homomorphic commitment schemes, proof-of-work, etc.</p><p>It’s one thing to understand these as mathematical, but it is another thing to understand what these things might be leveraged as institutional capabilities, either built by an institution itself or leveraged from an ecosystem that lets you keep your own&nbsp;secrets.</p><p>That’s the key — keeping your own secrets — keeping those things that give you the&nbsp;power.</p>

  <p>This week I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep">datasette-ripgrep</a> - a web application  for running regular expression searches against source code, built on top of the amazing <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> command-line tool.</p>
 datasette-ripgrep demo 
<p>I've deployed a demo version of the application here:</p>
<p><a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=pytest">ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=pytest</a></p>
<p>The demo runs searches against the source code of every one of my GitHub repositories that start with <code>datasette</code> - <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/repos?name__startswith=datasette&amp;owner__exact=9599">61 repos</a> right now - so it should include all of my Datasette plugins plus the core Datasette repository itself.</p>
<p>Since it's running on top of <code>ripgrep</code>, it supports regular expressions. This is absurdly useful. Some examples:</p>
 
 Every usage of the <code>.plugin_config(</code> method: <a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=%5C.plugin_config%5C%28">plugin_config\(</a>
 
 Everywhere I use <code>async with httpx.AsyncClient</code> (usually in tests): <a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=async+with.*AsyncClient">async with.*AsyncClient</a>
 
 All places where I use a Jinja <code>|</code> filter inside a variable: <a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=%5C%7B%5C%7B.*%5C%7C.*%5C%7D%5C%7D">\{\{.*\|.*\}\}</a>
 
 
<p>I usually run ripgrep as <code>rg</code> on the command-line, or use it within Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1331381448171929600">fun fact</a>: the reason VS Code's "Find in Files" is so good is it's running ripgrep under the hood).</p>
<p>So why have it as a web application? Because this means I can link to it, bookmark it and use it on my phone.</p>
<p></p>
 Why build this? 
<p>There are plenty of great existing code search tools out there already: I've heard great things about <a href="https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep">livegrep</a>, and a quick Google search shows a bunch of other options.</p>
<p>Aside from being a fun project, <code>datasette-ripgrep</code> has one key advantage: it gets to benefit from Datasette's publishing mechanism, which means it's really easy to deploy.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/">ripgrep.datasette.io</a> demo is deployed by checking out the source code to be searched into a <code>all</code> directory and then using the following command:</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun \
    --metadata metadata.json \
    --static all:all \
    --install=datasette-ripgrep \
    --service datasette-ripgrep \
    --apt-get-install ripgrep
</code> 
<p><code>all</code> is a folder containing the source code to be searched. <code>metadata.json</code> contains this:</p>
  {
    "plugins": {
        "datasette-ripgrep": {
            "path": "/app/all",
            "time_limit": 3.0
        }
    }
}  
<p>That's all there is to it! The result is a deployed code search engine, running on Google Cloud Run.</p>
<p>(If you want to try this yourself you'll need to be using the just-released Datasette 0.52.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_demo.yml">GitHub Action workflow</a> that deploys the demo also uses my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> tool to fetch my repos and then shallow-clones the ones that begin with <code>datasette</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#publishing-to-google-cloud-run">your own Google Cloud Run credentials</a>, you can run your own copy of that workflow against your own repositories.</p>
 A different kind of Datasette plugin 
<p>Datasette is a tool for publishing SQLite databases, so most Datasette plugins integrate with SQLite in some way.</p>
<p><code>datasette-ripgrep</code> is different: it makes no use of SQLite at all, but instead takes advantage of Datasette's URL routing, <code>datasette publish</code> deployments and permissions system.</p>
<p>The plugin implementation is currently <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep/blob/07b9ced2935b0b6080c1c42fcaf6ab9e8003d186/datasette_ripgrep/__init__.py">134 lines of code</a>, excluding tests and templates.</p>
<p>While the plugin doesn't use SQLite, it does share a common philosophy with Datasette: the plugin bundles the source code that it is going to search as part of the deployed application, in a similar way to how Datasette usually bundles one or more SQLite database files.</p>
<p>As such, it's extremely inexpensive to run and can be deployed to serverless hosting. If you need to scale it, you can run more copies.</p>
<p>This does mean that the application needs to be re-deployed to pick up changes to the searchable code. I'll probably set my demo to do this on a daily basis.</p>
 Controlling processes from asyncio 
<p>The trickiest part of the implementation was figuring out how to use Python's <code>asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()</code> method to safely run the <code>rg</code> process in response to incoming requests.</p>
<p>I don't want expensive searches to tie up the server, so I implemented two limits here. The first is a time limit: by default, searches have a second to run after which the <code>rg</code> process will be terminated and only results recieved so far will be returned. This is achieved using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.wait_for">asyncio.wait_for()</a> function.</p>
<p>I also implemented a limit on the number of matching lines that can be returned, defaulting to 2,000. Any more than that and the process is terminated early.</p>
<p>Both of these limits can be customized using plugin settings (documented in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep/blob/main/README.md">the README</a>). You can see how they are implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep/blob/0.2/datasette_ripgrep/__init__.py#L9-L55">async def run_ripgrep(pattern, path, time_limit=1.0, max_lines=2000)</a> function.</p>
 Highlighted linkable line numbers 
<p>The other fun implementation detail is the way the source code listings are displayed. I'm using CSS to display the line numbers in a way that makes them visible without them breaking copy-and-paste (inspired by <a href="https://www.sylvaindurand.org/using-css-to-add-line-numbering/">this article by Sylvain Durand</a>).</p>
  code:before {
    content: attr(data-line);
    display: inline-block;
    width: 3.5ch;
    -webkit-user-select: none;
    color: #666;
}  
<p>The HTML looks like this:</p>
  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code id="L1" data-line="1"&gt;from setuptools import setup&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code id="L2" data-line="2"&gt;import os&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code id="L3" data-line="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code id="L4" data-line="4"&gt;VERSION = &amp;#34;0.1&amp;#34;&lt;/code&gt;
...  
<p>I wanted to imitate GitHub's handling of line links, where adding <code>#L23</code> to the URL both jumps to that line and causes the line to be highlighted. Here's <a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep/view/datasette-allow-permissions-debug/setup.py#L23">a demo of that</a> - I use the following JavaScript to update the contents of a <code>&lt;style id="highlightStyle"&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element in the document head any time the URL fragment changes:</p>
  &lt;script&gt;
var highlightStyle = document.getElementById('highlightStyle');
function highlightLineFromFragment() {
    if (/^#L\d+$/.exec(location.hash)) {
        highlightStyle.innerText = `${location.hash} { background-color: yellow; }`;
    }
}
highlightLineFromFragment();
window.addEventListener("hashchange", highlightLineFromFragment);
&lt;/script&gt;  
<p>It's the simplest way I could think of to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>Update 28th November 2020: Louis Lévêque on Twitter suggested using the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target">:target selector</a> instead, which is indeed MUCH simpler - I deleted the above JavaScript and replaced it with this CSS:</p>
  :target {
    background-color: #FFFF99;
}  
 Next steps for this project 
<p>I'm pleased to have got <a>datasette-ripgrep</a> to a workable state, and I'm looking forward to using it to answer questions about the growing Datasette ecosystem. I don't know how much more time I'll invest in this - if it proves useful then I may well expand it.</p>
<p>I do think there's something really interesting about being able to spin up this kind of code search engine on demand using <code>datasette publish</code>. It feels like a very useful trick to have access to.</p>
 Better URLs for my TILs 
<p>My other project this week was an upgrade to <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">til.simonwillison.net</a>: I finally spent the time to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/issues/34">design nicer URLs</a> for the site.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><code>til.simonwillison.net/til/til/javascript_manipulating-query-params.md</code></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><code>til.simonwillison.net/javascript/manipulating-query-params</code></p>
<p>The implementation for this takes advantage of a feature I sneaked into Datasette 0.49: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49#path-parameters-custom-page-templates">Path parameters for custom page templates</a>. I can create a template file called <code>pages/{topic}/{slug}.html</code> and Datasette use that template to handle 404 errors that match that pattern.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/til/blob/main/templates/pages/%7Btopic%7D/%7Bslug%7D.html">the new pages/{topic}/{slug}.html</a> template for my TIL site. It uses the <code>sql()</code> template function from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> plugin to retrieve and render the matching TIL, or raises a 4040 if no TIL can be found.</p>
<p>I also needed to setup redirects from the old pages to the new ones. I wrote a <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/datasette_redirects-for-datasette.md">TIL on edirects for Datasette</a> explaining how I did that.</p>

    So the technical term for that delay or lag from then you finish speaking to you hearing when the next person speaks is wrapped up in an idea of “Latency”. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(audio)">Latency </a>is measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond">milliseconds (ms), which is thousandths of seconds</a>. Latency for a face to face conversation is like zero. For say a landline call, it is defined by an ITU standard and is judged by the ability to offer a quality of service.&nbsp; Ideally, about 10ms will achieve the highest level of quality and feels familiar.&nbsp; A latency of 20 ms is tremendous and is typical for a VoIP call as it is perfectly acceptable.&nbsp; A latency of even 150 ms is, whilst noticeable, permitted, however, any higher delay or lag times and the quality diminishes very fast. At 300 ms or higher, latency becomes utterly unacceptable as a conversation becomes laboured, driven by interruptions and lack flow.&nbsp; <p>We all know the phrases of “no-one left behind” or “you are only as strong as your weakest team member.” Well, the same applies for latency, one person in a remote place, low broadband speed, on a (shared) WIFI extension, with poor buffering on a cheap router;&nbsp; we are now all down to the slowest person in the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Analogy to get to the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jet lag”, also called “jet lag disorder,” is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock (circadian rhythms) that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep. Jet lag occurs because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've travelled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag. Jet lag can cause fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems. Jet lag is temporary, but it can significantly reduce your vacation or business travel comfort. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help prevent or minimise jet lag.</p><br><p>Stay with me. We are bringing JetLag and voice/ video lag (Latency) together.&nbsp; We know the effects of JetLag - fatigue, unwell feeling, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and is temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The question is, can VoiceLag create the same. Anecdotally I believe Yes based on 8 months of video calls.&nbsp; At the end of a day of video, Teams, Hangout or Zoom calls, we know we have fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and it is temporary. A good night of sleep, we can do it all again. &nbsp; I know that now making a day of mobile or landline calls I don’t suffer the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, is this voice lag or voice latency or video time or a little part of each? We definitely know that video calls are exhausting, but the assumption for this feeling was the new structure, a new approach, differences and styles, watch yourself continually, only seeing one person, having to be present 100% of the time.&nbsp; This is all true, but we also lack flow on video call due the latency and lag.&nbsp; Lacking flow means conversation is paused, interrupted and slow. This delay takes a lot of energy.&nbsp; We cannot get into flow to sharing our creative thinking, we have to hold ideas and opinions back, we have to wait for signals to speak - it is all exhausting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We need to focus on the remove of lag to create flow. We need to stop moving at the rate of the slowest person, let’s get everyone up to flow speed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

The editors met yesterday to discuss the issues that were pulled out of the previous draft text and document a process for how to resolve these and future issues. We would like to explain how we plan on using labels on GitHub issues to keep track of discussions and keep things moving. <br> <br>When there are substantive issues or pull requests, the editors will avoid merging or closing those outright, and instead mark them as "pending", so that these can be brought to the attention of the larger group. If no additional discussion happens on these, the merge or close action will be taken in 7 days. Note for this first round we are setting the deadline for the issues below as Dec 11th due to the US holiday and the fact that this is the first time using this process. <br> <br>"Pending Merge" <br>When specific text is proposed in a PR (by anyone, not limited to the editors), and the editors believe this text reflects the consensus of the working group, this marks that the PR will be merged in 7 days unless there is a clear alternative proposal accepted by the working group. <br> <br>"Pending Close" <br>When the editors believe an issue no longer needs discussion, we'll mark it "Pending Close". The issue will be closed in 7 days unless someone brings new information to the discussion. This tag is not applied to issues that will be closed by a specific pull request. <br> <br>There are two additional labels we will use to flag issues to the group. <br> <br>"Needs Text" <br>The editors suggest this issue needs additional text in the spec to clarify why this section is needed and under what circumstances. Without a concrete proposal of text to be included in the spec, this section will be removed in a future update. <br> <br>"Postponed" <br>This issue can be reconsidered in the future with a more concrete discussion but is not targeted for immediate concrete changes to the spec text. When used on its own, this label does not indicate that an issue is targeted to be closed. An issue may also be marked "Pending Close", and this is used so that we can distinguish closed issues between discussions that have concluded or things that we may want to revisit in the future. Remember that closed issues are not deleted and their contents are still findable and readable, and that new issues can reference closed issues. <br> <br>With these labels in mind, here are the list of issues and their statuses we were able to discuss on our last editor's call. The action on these pending issues will be taken on Dec 11th to give the group enough time to review this list. For this first round, many of the issues are marked "Pending Close" as we're looking for low hanging fruit to prune the list of issues down. In the future, you can expect to see more "Pending Merge" issues as we're bringing proposed text to review by the WG. <br> <br>Postponed: <br> <br>• Generic claim extension mechanism <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131</a> <br> <br>Pending Merge: <br> <br>• Make access token mandatory for continuation API calls <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129</a> <br> <br>Postponed and Pending Close: <br> <br>• Fetchable Keys <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47</a> <br>• Including OpenID Connect Claims <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64</a> <br>• Application communication with back-end <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82</a> <br>• Additional post-interaction protocols <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83</a> <br> <br>Pending Close: <br>     <br>• HTTP PUT vs POST for rotating access tokens <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100</a> <br>• Use of hash with unique callback URL <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84</a> <br>• Interaction considerations <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81</a> <br>• Expanding dynamic reference handles <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76</a> <br>• Post interaction callback nonce <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73</a> <br>• Unique callback URIs  <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55</a> <br>• Instance identifier <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46</a> <br>• Requesting resources by reference <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36</a> <br>• Mapping resource references <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35</a>

<p>Some on the next 10-ish years in identity management.</p><p>[This was originally written in December 2019: pre-pandemic, pre-US presidential election, pre-George Floyd. Truly, it was written in the “Before Times.” I thought about updating this before posting but that felt wrong – somehow dishonest. So here is the lightly touched up text of my talk which was given first in Tokyo at the OpenID Foundation Summit and then again as part of the all-virtual Identiverse. If you want to skip the text and <a href="https://players.brightcove.net/6154186074001/V3qAkKf6t_default/index.html?videoId=6184188772001">go straight to the video, you can</a>!&nbsp;</p><p>My deepest thanks go to Naohiro Fujie and Nat Sakimura for prompting me to write this, Andi Hindle for his feedback. – IG 11/24/2020]</p><p>It is my honor to present to you today. Today, it is my privilege to talk to you about my vision of the future of digital identity. When Naohiro-san asked me to speak on this topic, I was both honored and panicked. In my daily role, I focus on a 12 to 18 month time frame. My primary task is to help my stakeholders and, yes I have a multi-year vision, but I primarily focus on how my team can execute in the next few months to help those stakeholders. I don’t, as a matter of my daily routine, think about the future.</p><p>So I was a little panicked. I am not a futurist. I am no longer an industry analyst. I am just a practitioner trying to help where I can. How then should I talk about the next ten years of our industry?</p><p>I can name 4 ways to think about the future and with your permission I will briefly try all 4.</p> Looking at the Past to See the Future <p>One way to talk about the future is to look back at past predictions and see how they fared. I’ll choose 3 predictions:</p>  The Need for Password Vaulting  SAML is Dead  The Year of PKI (Again…Still)   The Need for Password Vaulting <p>In 2014, I said that <a href="https://youtu.be/_TsYqOq9iDk?t=449">by 2017 the need for password vaulting would be gone</a>. Well, it’s 2020 and there are systems that simply refuse to participate in single sign-on schemes. My guess is that in the next 5 years the need for enterprise password vaulting (not including privileged account management) will be gone.</p><p>In non-enterprise settings, password managers are more prevalent than ever, at least browser-based ones. My guess is that WebAuthn will drive passwordless use cases and when combined with OS-based software tokens the need for passwords and password vaulting in our daily lives will dramatically decrease in the next 5 to 10 years. But more on that later.</p> SAML is Dead <p>Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/n40173">Craig Burton famously stated that SAML was dead</a>. It’s 2020 and SAML remains dead. It is so dead that my company is involved with at least 70,000 different SAML federations. (May all of our endeavors be so successful upon their demise.)</p> The Year of PKI <p>Since 1977 it has been the year of PKI. It is now the year of PKI. It will continue to be the year of PKI until it becomes impossible to safely distribute keys. (But I’ll get to that in a bit.)</p><p>While looking at past predictions is one way to talk about the future it is not completely sufficient.&nbsp;</p> Continuous Future <p>Another way to think about the future is to imagine a continuous one… one in which today’s technologies and techniques progress in a linear fashion towards the future. Promising things that are growing today continue to grow into the future. There are four items I’d like to discuss briefly:</p>  OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal  SAML Will Still Be Dead  Passwords Will Also Be Dead  WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On   OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal <p>The next decade of IAM, especially workforce-centric IAM, will be based on OpenID Connect and SCIM. This implies that OAuth and JOSE will continue in their role as critical supporting standards. This is not to say that other protocols, such as SAML or Kerberos, will not be important, but OIDC and SCIM will be the assumed pieces of our infrastructures.</p> SAML Will Still Be Dead <p>The reason why SAML is “dead” is because it works and it is a legacy technology. It is mature. It is popular. And that will not change in the next&nbsp;5 years. Now, I do not expect a resurgence of SAML federations but I also do not expect rapid migration from SAML to OIDC (unless prompted by a shift in platform or provider.) Consider that it took years to stamp out WS-Federation; SAML will take a similar path. In 10 year’s time, the SAML zombie herd will be quite thin but still shuffling onwards and very much considered a legacy protocol.</p> Passwords Will Also Be Dead <p>Good news! The password is dead! And I mean this in both senses: passwords work and passwords are legacy. In the next 5 years, consistent best practices will roll through our enterprises: long passwords, infrequent changes, and strengthening with a second factor.</p><p>At the same time, we can see how the use of passwords will decline significantly over the next 10 years. Enterprise is already showing this to be the case: federation as the primary means of resource access. We are not far off from having 1 password per enterprise user. What about in the consumer space?</p> WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On <p>As a consumer, how do I get the best experience getting into sites and apps? One approach is to use a password manager. But in 2016 only 3% of internet users use a password manager app and only 2% use a browser-based one <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/01/26/2-password-management-and-mobile-security/">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. While those numbers have undoubtably grown, I cannot imagine they have cracked double digits.</p><p>Another approach is to use social sign-on to get into sites and apps. I believe people use social sign-on to avoid the twin hassles of creating an account and managing a password.</p><p>But I believe by 2030, there will be parity between WebAuthn and social sign-on. This is predicated on active clients ruling our mobile worlds and the use of desktops continuing to decline. Concerns over personal privacy combined with the ease of use in which the mobile OS is the dominant active client that “magically” signs one in, will bring a meaningful alternative to social sign-on.</p><p>WebAuthn is the standard that makes this happen at the wire-level. Ubiquitous browser support is a key enabling step which is well underway. Connecting OS-level biometric recognition to services via enabled-browsers is the obvious next step. Those two things will deliver a “magical” mobile sign-in experience in which I just look at my phone and I am in the app. we should expect to see play out over the next 3 to 5 years and mainstream adoption in 5 to 10.</p><p>These items will help us, in different ways, to improve the state of account management. But we cannot only think about digital identity by itself; we have to think about the technological landscape that surrounds our industry.</p> The Adjacent World <p>If we are going to talk about the future of identity we cannot do so without looking at adjacent technology and trends:</p>  Active Clients Will be Mainstream  Quantum Computing and PKI  Balkanization of the Internet   Active Clients Will be Mainstream <p>The next 10 years will be dominated by digital things acting on our behalf: active clients. Our password managers, personal digital assistants, and digital wallets will take a far greater role in finding, delivering, and interacting with online services.</p><p>In the next 5 years, the mobile OS and its features will be the primary active client for the vast majority of the online world. Using alternatives to mobile OS provided wallets, password managers, strong authentication clients, will be possible but will struggle to gain widespread adoption. That might change in 10 years with regulatory action or significant market externalities, but it is unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, when it comes to digital assistants, as my colleague Peter Schwartz, futurist, said to me, “If you aren’t Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant you have no chance. Everything will be brokered through one of those three.” Your digital assistant service will be brokered through one of those 3 or possibly a mega-platform such as WeChat.</p><p>All of this has implications in the death of passwords. If the mobile OS vendor doesn’t want to support WebAuthn, DID Auth, or the next great thing we can dream up, it is going to be extremely difficult to gain meaningful adoption by people and thus service providers will be unlikely to adopt as well.</p> Quantum Computing and PKI <p>In the next ten years, we will see quantum computing effect cryptography. For the most part, our hashing algorithms will be okay in a post-quantum world. But it is our key exchange algorithms that might fall. As my colleague Taher Elgamal, noted mathematician and father of SSL, told me, “We need to get moving.” We have 5 years to adopt new key exchange mechanisms assuming we get a new method by 2025… which we may not. A failure to act will undermine cryptographic trust. And that has profound implication for not just our industry but all industries.</p> Balkanization of the Internet <p>In the next 10 years we will see the internet split into at least 2 separate internets. There will be an internet for China (and possibly a separate one for Russia) and one for the rest of the world. Even if these internets are not physically separated, national policy, censorship, and enterprise risk management will drive logically separated ones.</p><p>What this likely means for identity professionals is that within these separate Internets, separate identity schemes will arise. If today identity is the perimeter of the enterprise, in 10 years, identity will be the perimeter of these Balkanized Internets. We can see the beginnings of this with WeChat and given nationalism on the rise around the world, one can easily imagine non-interoperable identity perimeters to our online worlds. And this an outcome we must fight.</p><p>Predicting where currently successful things will continue to be successful is often the role of an industry analyst – a role I used to do. But I think there is a more challenging and exciting way to think about the future – one isn’t based on likely successfully and frankly reasonably obvious things.</p> The Discontinuous Future <p>A third way to think about the future is to imagine one not as a smooth path forward but one abruptly shifts and radically changes. This discontinuous future is hidden by our biases, our investment in our current projects and approaches, and our natural tendency to rely on the familiar to navigate the dimly lit room that is the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the discontinuous future is focused, not on account management, but actual identity management. So what if we choose, just for the next few minutes, to imagine this hidden, discontinuous future? What would we see there?</p><p>I believe we will see 3 actions and 1 actor in this discontinuous future.</p>  Introductions  Recognition  Counselors  Data Handling<br>   Introductions <p>The act of introducing someone is the act of creating a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine digital assistants managing our introductions. In this case, one service says to another “This is an entity which I know about and with whom you should have a relationship.”&nbsp; In some regards you can think of this a social sign-on++.</p> Recognition <p>The act of recognition is a way to acknowledge parties in a relationship and is a way to demonstrate the existence of the relationship to some other entity or service. For example, I am a member of IDPro or I am an employee of Salesforce or I am a citizen of Japan. I think the act of acknowledging a relationship will supersede our current forms of consent. The relationship defines “normal” acceptable behavior between the parties. So long as actions are within the regular boundaries of the relationship then the person doesn’t need to provide additional consent. The parties’ behavior within the context of the relationship would be monitored by active clients.</p> Counselors <p>Counselors are new actors in this discontinuous future. They are entities who can:</p>  Act on your behalf  Vouch for you and your relationships  Create and sever relationships on your behalf  Can counsel you on your behavior  <p>Counselors can provide data needed to form a relationship. They can step in before you share data with a service that could be considered risky. Imagine something stepping in before you hand over your form of payment and email address and suggest using an anonymous one instead. Imagine that service can even generate that anonymous forms of payment and a pseudonymous email for you. That is the future role of a counselor.</p><p>For some a counselor could be a government or a private-sector supplied service. These counselors are true value-add active clients.</p> Data Handling <p>How we handle data will change in the discontinuous future. I believe that pseudonymization and differential privacy will have to be applied at the time of introduction. We will finally have an infrastructure that supports the idea that data gathered at the time of use is superior to previously stored away data. Provenance and relationship metadata will be applied all the time, even for insights derived from shared information. Finally, common privacy-preserving processing fabrics will arise to enable industry sectors to derive industry-specific insights and industry-shared risks; think of this as an industry-specific shared signals and attribute exchange.</p><p>I believe focusing on these actors and actions will enable use to move toward true digital identity management.</p> The Fourth Way <p>There is a fourth way to think about the future: They say that the way to predict the future is to create it. This might seem daunting. Not everyone can create a new protocol, not everyone can write a specification, not everyone can build something that has never been seen before.</p><p>But, each of us, in our own way, can create the future. We create the future by hiring without bias to form diverse work environments. We create the future by respectfully using data shared with us. We create the future by ensuring that our systems run in an environmentally sustainable manner. We create the future by ensuring the algorithms we use are ethical and without bias. We create the future by providing something wonderful for all of our stakeholders. And in these ways, we create a future far more meaningful than any talk about the future can describe.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I was awake in the early hours of the morning, staring at nothing, my heart racing. It was a bit like The Queen's Gambit, except instead of a chessboard on the ceiling, there was a kanban board, with a huge backlog of things I knew I'd failed to do.</p><p>This morning, I got up, turned my ceiling kanban board into a real one in Notion, and got to work. The world feels more manageable in the cold light of day. I'm making progress.</p><p>I'm not sure how to deal with the things that don't quite fit on a task list. You can't drag life from column to column or build it into a database. You've got to live it. Or at least, that's what I've always thought.</p><p>I'm more of an intuitive thinker than a planner. I always have been. I go off-recipe when I cook; I meander when I travel; I play with my code. Sometimes it works out and I discover things I never would have encountered otherwise; sometimes it doesn't, and I find myself in a mess of my own making. But I've started to write scripts for the hard stuff, and to my horror, it really helps.</p><p>I was stressed out about having to give difficult feedback to a colleague, but I wrote out what I was going to say ahead of time in detail, and it turned out to be nowhere near as bad as I expected it to be. I had to spend a day cold calling customers - an introvert's worst nightmare - but having my script in front of me meant my numbers were startlingly high.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing is that writing the script is a way to cut through the fear. Getting something down in writing works: it's a step in the right direction. Then comes editing, and iteration. Which is far better than staring at the ceiling at 3am beating yourself up for being behind.</p>

     Who is the “we”, this piece is co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a> and me, who together have worked for over 45 years on identity and personal data. For this article, we are looking at the role of values, principles and rules within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity.   <p>As we write this there is an ongoing conversation about the regulation of Facebook and the regulation of big tech in general. We see a problem with the frame of the conversation because we believe ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist as in no-one entity should have that much power and control over the global population’s identities, “their” data and the conversion we have. So any frame that accepts BIG TECH as acceptable won’t create rules that actually move towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is.</p>         <p>With this piece, we are seeking to look at how principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework we have today is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket.</p><p>So let’s get to the question at hand “Why does it matter that we connect values, principles and rules?” The connection is not clear because we have created so many words and variance in languages that there is significant confusion. We are often confused in ourselves to what we mean, we are very inconsistent in how we apply our understanding, often to provide a benefit to ourselves or justify our belief. To unpack the relationship we need to look at definitions, but we have to accept that even definitions are inconsistent. Our conformational bias is going to fight us, as we want to believe what we already know, rather than expand our thinking.</p> Are we imagining principles or&nbsp;values? <p>Worth noting our principles are defined by our values. Much like ethics (group beliefs) and morals (personal beliefs) and how in a complex adaptive system my morals affect the group’s ethics and a group’s ethics changes my morals. Situational awareness and experience play a significant part in what you believe right now, and what the group or society believes.</p><p>Values can be adaptable by context whereas principles are fixed for a period, withstanding the test of time. When setting up a framework where we are setting our principles implies that we are saying that we don’t want them to change every day, week, month, year, that they are good and stable for a generation but we can adapt/ revise/ adjust principles based on learning. Fundamentally principles are based on values which do change, so there are ebbs and flows of conflict between them, this means we frame principles and often refuse to see that they are not future proof forever. Indeed the further a principle is away from the time it was created, the less it will have in common with values.</p> Are we confusing principles and&nbsp;rules? <p>Considering characteristics, conceptually principles are abstract and universal whereas a rule is specific and particular. Principles cope with exceptions, rules need another rule. Principles provide the power of thought and decision making, rules prevent thought and discretion. Principles need knowledge and experience to deliver outcomes, rules don’t. Principles cope with risk, conflict and abstraction; conflict is not possible for a rule, it is this rule or a rule is needed.</p><p>We love rules-of-thumb, as such rules and heuristics provide time-saving frameworks which mean we don’t have to think. Not having to think saves energy for things we like to do. Take away the little ways you have that creates a stable place for yourself and you end up exhausted. Travel to a new place and you don’t know where the simple amenities of life are, COVID19 took away the structure of our lives which created exhaustion until we found a new routine. However, we often confuse “our heuristics”, the way I do something, or “my rules” as a principle. This diet rule is a principle for losing weight. We should accept that we purposely interchange rules, values and principles to provide assurance and bias to the philosophy, theory, thesis or point we are trying to gain acceptance of.</p><p>In companies and for a social policy we set rules and principles into matrices as below. Asking is it better to break rules or comply, is better to uphold principle or challenge them.</p><p>A review round the four quadrants highlights that there is no favourable sector and indeed as a society who wants to get improve, we continually travel through all of them. Companies and executives often feel that upholding principles and obeyed rules (top right) creates the best culture, but also ask the organisation to be adaptive, agile and innovative.</p><p>Given that principles are based on values, the leadership team will be instrumental into how upheld the principles are. Whereas the companies level of documentation for processes, procedures and rules will define what is to be obeyed, the culture of the top team will determine if they are to be obeyed or not.</p><p>The matrix below thinks about the combinations of values and principles. Where values are either mine as an individual or we as a collective society.</p><p>The fundamental issue with the two representations (rules or values and principles) is that they cannot highlight the dynamic nature of the relationship between them. By example, our collective values help normalise an individuals bias and that collective values informs and refine principles. Indeed as principles become extreme and too restrictive say as our collective values become too godly, our collective values opt to no-longer uphold them. When our individualism leads to the falling apart of society we raise the bar to create better virtues as it makes us more content, loved and at peace.</p><p>Movement within the “stable compromise” domain has been explored many times but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history </a>expands it very well.</p><p>In summary, a rules-based approach prescribes or describes in detail a set of rules and how to behave based on known and agreed principles. Whereas a principle-based approach develops principles which set the limits that enable controls, measures, procedures on how to achieve that outcome is left for each organisation to determine.</p> Risk frameworks help us to connect principles and&nbsp;rules <p>Having explored that a rules-based approach prescribes in detail the rules, methods, procedures, processes and tasks on how to behave and act, whereas a principle-based approach to creating outcomes crafts principles that frame boundaries, leaving the individual or organisation to determine its own interruption.</p>  In a linear system, we would agree on principles which would bound the rules.  In a non-linear system, we would agree on the principles, which would bound the rules and as we learn from the rules we would refine the principles.  In a complex adaptive system, we are changing principles, as our values change because of the rules which are continually be modified to cope with the response to the rules.  <p>This post is titled “In a digital age, how can we reconnect values, principles and rules?” and the obvious reason is that rules change, values, which change principles that means our rules need to be updated. However, this process of learning and adoption depends on understanding the connection which offers closed-loop feedback. An effective connection is our risk frameworks.</p><p>The diagram below places rules and principles at two extremes. As already explored we move from principles to rules but rarely go back to rethink our principles, principally because of the time. Rules should refine and improve in real-time, principles are generational. However to create and refine rules we use and apply a risk framework. The risk framework identifies risk and to help us manage it, we create rules that are capable of ensuring we get the right data/ information to be able to determine if we have control over risk. As humans, we are not experts in always forecasting the unimagined and so when we implement rules things break and clever minds think how to bend, break or avoid them. To that end we create more rules to manage exceptions. However, occasionally we need to check that our rules are aligned to our principles and indeed go back and check and refine our principles.</p><p>Starting from “Principles” these are anchored in ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity">Human Dignity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity_%28European_Union%29">Subsidiarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity">Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_theology">Covenantal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">The common good</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship">Stewardship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Equality">Equality</a>.</p><p>Once we decide that one or more of these should anchor our principles and form a north star, a direction to travel in and towards. The reason to agree on the Principle(s) is that collectively we agree on a commitment to get to a better place. We state our principles as an ambition, goal, target with allow us to understand, manage and control uncertainty using a risk framework. The risk framework frame or bounds the risk we are prepared to take. The risk framework enables us to define rules that get to our known outcomes. We implement the rules to create controls using regulation, code and standards. Our risk frameworks use tools to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on the risk, the delta in risk and compliance with the rules. Whilst all is good we use the risk framework to create more rules and better framing and boundaries, creating better outcomes. However, when the desired outcomes are not being created we revert to the principles, check our north star and take our new knowledge to refine/ redefine the risk we are prepared to take.</p> Data and Identity Principles <p>Having established this framework, the idea is to apply this to the authors favourite topics of data and identity. We have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve through identity and data ownership. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global. This is not a bill of rights, this is “what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><blockquote>“what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder&nbsp;us?</blockquote><p>Our problems probably started a while back when information could travel faster than people (the telegraph rollout of 1850). This was a change in the fabric of values and principles. The person who was trusted was passed over and that person-to-person trust was no longer needed. Delays that allowed time for consideration gave way to immediacy; a shift in values and principles.</p><p>The question is how do our principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes, the world we designed for was physical; it is now digital-first. Now we are becoming aware that the fabric has changed, where next? By example, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis </a>is the legal system and database. With a case in mind, you use this tool to uncover previous judgments and specific cases to determine and inform your thinking. However, this database is built on humans and physical first. Any digital judgements in this database are still predicated on the old frameworks, what is its value when the very fabric of all those judgements changes. Do we use it to slow us down and prevent adoption? Time to unpack this</p><p>Physical-world first (framed as AD 00 to 2010)</p><p>Classic thinking (western capital civilisation philosophy) defined values and principles which have created policy, norms and rules. Today’s policy is governed by people and processes. We have history to provide visibility over time and can call on millennia of thought, thinking and wisdom. Depending on what is trending/ leading as a philosophy we create norms. In a physical and human first world, we have multi-starting positioning. We can start with a market, followed by norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture — creating law and regulations OR we can start with norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture, followed by market-creating law.</p><p>Without our common and accepted belief, our physical world would not work. Law, money, rights are not real, they are command and control schema with shared beliefs. Our created norms are based on our experience with the belief. We cope by managing our appetite to risk.</p><p>Digital world first (frame as AD 2020 — AD MMMCCX )</p><p>People-in-companies rather than people-in-government form the new norms as companies have the capital to include how to avoid the rules and regulations. The best companies are forming new rules to suit them. Companies have the users to mould the norms with the use of their data. Behaviour can be directed. Companies set their own rules. Doctrine/architecture creates the market, forming norms, and the law protects those who control the market. Policy can create rules but it has no idea how rules are implemented or governed as the companies make it complex and hide the data. There are few signs of visible “core” human values, indeed there are no shared and visible data principles. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined.</p><p>The companies automate, the decisions become automated, the machine defines the rules and changes the risk model. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined as we have no data principles.</p><p>By example. Our news and media have changed models. The editor crafted control to meet the demand of an audience were willing to pay to have orchestrated content that they liked. As advertising became important, content mirrored advertising preferences and editorial became the advertising and advertising the content. Digital created clicks that drove a new model to anything that drives clicks works. The fabric changed from physical to digital and in doing so we lost the principles and rules of the physical first world to a digital-first world that has not yet agreed on principles for data.</p> To our favourite topic: Data and&nbsp;Identity <p>Imagine looking at this framework of “principles, rules and risk” within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity. How would privacy and identity be presented?</p><p>Within data and identity, we have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global.</p><p>The stated <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">GDPR principles are</a> set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a>:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimisation.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security)  Accountability.  <p>We know they are called “Principles” by the framing of the heading in Article 5, however, are these principles, values or rules? Further are these boundaries, stewardships or a bit of a mashup. By example to get round “Purpose Limitation,” terms and conditions become as wide as possible so that all and or any use is possible. Data minimisation is only possible if you know the data you want, which is rarely the case if you are a data platform. If a principle of The European Union is to ensure the free “movement/mobility” of people, goods, services and capital within the Union (the ‘four freedoms’), does data identity ideals and GDPR align?</p><p>Considering the issue with “the regulation of Facebook” or the “regulation of” Big Tech, in general, is that ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist, <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">no one entity should have that much power</a> and control over people’s identities and their data? So the framings that accept them, as acceptable, won’t create rules that actually moves towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is. If we add in open API’s and the increasing level of data mobility, portability and sharing whose “rules or principles” should be adopted?</p><p>How do your principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework, say in the US today, is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket. Alas, IMHO, GDPR is not a lot better than rules with no truly human-based core principles.</p> The lobby of&nbsp;time <p>By example here is the <a href="https://simson.net/ref/2004/csg357/handouts/01_fips.pdf">1973: The Code of Fair Information Practices</a> This Code was the central contribution of the HEW (Health, Education, Welfare) Advisory Committee on Automated Data Systems. The Advisory Committee was established in 1972, and the report released in July. The simplicity and the power of the code have been eroded and water down so that the code is now ineffective. Would we be in a much better place if we had adopted such thinking at the time?</p>  There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.  There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used.  There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person’s consent.  There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person.  Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.   Conclusion <p>We have outdated “principles” driving rules in a digital-first world. This world is now dominated by companies setting norms and without reference to any widely agreed-upon values. The downside of big tech gaining so much power that they are actually seen by people-in-government as “equivalent to nation-states” is telling. We have small well-networked organizations attempting to make a dent in this. <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData</a>, for example, has generated, from an engaged collaborative community, a set of ideals (principles) that provide a good starting point for a wider constructive discussion, but we need historians, anthropologists, ontologist, psychologist, data scientists and regular every day people who are the users to be able to close the loop between the rules we have, the risk frameworks we manage to and the principles that we should be aiming for.</p><p>How can we leverage innovative democratic deliberative processes like <a href="https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/methods/citizens-jury">citizen’s jury</a>’s that are used in some parts of Europe to close the loop between rules and principles around emerging technology?</p><p>Take Away</p>  How are we checking the rules we have are aligned to our principles?  How are we checking our principles?  Is our risk framework able to adapt to new principles and changes to rules?  How do we test the rules that define and constrain create better outcomes?

<p></p><p>I want to unlearn the definition of "disruption".</p><p>Disruption in the Clayton Christensen sense <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation">is all about removing an incumbent business from its perch by reaching an audience it has overlooked and growing from there</a>. It's about building a business by out-competing another business. As far as business goes, it's good strategy, but it doesn't do much to change the status quo. You may have out-innovated someone else's company, but the rules of business remain in place.</p><p>The thing is, the rules of business aren't working. The systems we have in place depend on outrageous inequality and are enforced by police who gun down people in the street with relative impunity. They incentivize keeping millions of people homeless so that others can grow wealthier. They enforce a widening divide between people who are inside the system and people who are locked out in such a way that the only way to beat the system for your own well-being is to perpetuate it.</p><p>Originally, the web was a movement. It's hard to remember now, but allowing everyone to publish was a major social change; giving everyone a voice was a new idea that many people argued (and continue to argue) against. Previously, publishing was a privilege that was bestowed by a circle of predominantly white men. Now, any old riff-raff (or to put it another way, anyone regardless of whether or not they had received permission) could stick up a website and be read by millions. It was a revolution.</p><p>It was that revolution - not the ability to make money or the opportunity to create new businesses - that made me fall in love with the web.</p><p>Of course, what came next was hardly revolutionary. The existing gatekeepers fell, and were replaced with yet more gatekeepers, who used the global nature of the web to become bigger and more powerful than their predecessors. The excitement of empowering communities all over the world gave way to a wave of people who were excited about building bigger companies and generating more wealth than ever before. The incumbent structures were disrupted in favor of yet more of the same old business.</p><p>I want to return to that revolutionary spirit and reclaim the web's radical core.</p><p>That doesn't mean I want to turn back the clock. The web movement was, itself, predominantly white and male. As a direct outcome, it tended to overlook the abuse and systemic oppression overwhelmingly experienced by women, communities of color, and LGBTQIA+ communities. As a whole, it was Euro-centric and dismissive of the global south. It's not revolutionary if the same old faces are in charge: the only way the movement can succeed is through radical inclusion. Leadership must be open to people of all backgrounds and contexts; ownership of the process, as well as its outcomes, must be truly democratic.</p><p>But we badly need to get back to the business of disrupting global capitalism itself, in order to create something that truly works for everyone. To do so, we must be informed by the past, but ready to build something genuinely new. In the same way that allowing everyone to publish radically changed the cultural landscape forever, we need to change nothing less than who is allowed to be an owner of the processes that run the world. The flow of money; the flow of political power; the flow of permission. Speech was just the first step.</p><p>This North Star of real, radical change is the definition of disruption I want to be governed by. I want to help create a more democratic, more equal world, where authority is devolved to all of us. It's not about getting rich. It's about sharing power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gmalhotra?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Gayatri Malhotra</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/revolution?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

As this is an opinion, I take full responsibility for any implied, explicit, or unconscious bias. I am open to feedback and correction; this opinion is subject to change at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’re almost there for truly global trusted interoperability. We almost have all of the networks we need. Let’s go through the networks we already have or will have soon (please note — I am only focusing on electronic networks, not physical or social networks)</p><p>Global Communication Network — The Internet as we know it today. Conceptualized as a singular, ubiquitous thing that we take for granted, it is actually a network of networks and an amalgam of protocols and technologies abstracted and unified bound by a set of rules known as Internet Protocol. We can just communicate with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Global Location Network — This is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is so embedded in our lives — it is baked into the chips that we wear and take with up(watches, Fitbits, cycling computers, etc.), we no longer notice its presence. We can just know where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>Global Monetary Network — This network is still emerging. Bitcoin is the frontrunner, but there are contenders and competitors, such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However this will play out, we will soon be able to exchange monetary value with one another, without the backing of governments and relying on financial intermediaries we have used for centuries.</p><p>So what is the next stop for the network? It’s&nbsp;this:</p><p>Global Verification Network — A network to independently verify without reliance on trusted intermediaries. Simply put, someone presents you with something — a claim, a statement, or whatever, and you will be able to prove that it is true without accepting it a face value or calling home to a centralized system that could deny you service, surveil you, or give you a false confirmation (for whatever reason). The business of trust can then be between you and the presenter, and you decide what you need to independently verify.</p><p>The exact capabilities of this global verification network are still to be determined but it is becoming clearer every day. Much of what is required as ingredients already exist as siloed bespoke add-ons onto the Internet as we today (TLS, etc.). Further, the cryptography that will enable this global verification network has already existed for years if not&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The hardest part ahead is not the technology, it’s the wholesale re-conceptualization of what is required for a global verification network that puts the power of the network back into the endpoints that is you and&nbsp;me.</p><p>In the coming weeks, I will be providing more detail, but I want you to take away from this post, that the next major stop for networks is a global verification network.</p>

   Last week's weeknotes took the form of my Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data talk write-up, which represented most of what I got done that week. This week I mainly worked on datasette-indieauth, but I also gave a keynote at PyCon Argentina and released a version of datasette-graphql with a small security fix.

  <p>Last week's weeknotes took the form of my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/">Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data</a> talk write-up, which represented most of what I got done that week. This week I mainly worked on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth">datasette-indieauth</a>, but I also gave a keynote at PyCon Argentina and released a version of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> with a small security fix.</p>
 datasette-indieauth 
<p>I wrote about this project in detail in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/18/indieauth/">Implementing IndieAuth for Datasette</a> - it was inspired by last weekend's IndieWebCamp East and provides Datasette with a password-less sign in option with the least possible amount of configuration.</p>
<p>Shortly after release version 1.0 of the plugin I realized it had a critical security vulnerability, where a malicious authorization server could fake a sign-in as any user! I fixed this in version 1.1 and released that along with a GitHub security advisory: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth/security/advisories/GHSA-mjcr-rqjg-rhg3">Implementation trusts the "me" field returned by the authorization server without verifying it</a>.</p>
<p>The IndieAuth community has an active <code>#dev</code> chat channel, available in Slack and through IRC and their <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/">web chat interface</a>. I've had some very productive conversations there about parts of the specification that I found confusing.</p>
 datasette-graphql 
<p>This week I also issued a security advisory for my datasette-graphql plugin. This one was thankfully much less severe: I realized that the plugin was leaking details of the schema of otherwise private databases, if they were protected by Datasette's permission system.</p>
<p>Here's the advisory: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/security/advisories/GHSA-74hv-qjjq-h7g5">datasette-graphql leaks details of the schema of private database files</a>. It's important to note that the actual content of the tables was not exposed - just the schema details such as the names of the tables and columns.</p>
<p>To my knowledge no-one has installed that plugin on an internet-exposed Datasette instance that includes private databases, so I don't think anyone was affected by the vulnerability. The fix is available in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.2">datasette-graphql 1.2</a>.</p>
<p>Also in that release: I've added table action items that link to an example GraphQL query for each table. This is a pretty neat usability enhancement, since the example includes all of the non-foreign-key columns making it a useful starting point for iterating on a query. You can try that out starting <a href="https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/github/milestones">on this page</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Keynoting PyCon Argentina 
<p>On Friday I presented a keynote at <a href="https://eventos.python.org.ar/events/pyconar2020/">PyCon Argentina</a>. I actually recorded this several weeks ago, but the keynote was broadcast live on YouTube so I got to watch the talk and post real-time notes and links to an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/179RCKpPHk8QzNBqcXIzAxuGR4wwXaDZ2a1xAd1QrSGc/edit?usp=sharing">accompanying Google Doc</a>, which I also used for Q&amp;A after tha talk.</p>
<p>The conference was really well organized, with top notch production values. They made a pixel-art version of my for the poster!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The video isn't available yet, but I'll link to it when they share it. I'm particularly excited about the professionally translated subtitles en Español.</p>
 Miscellaneous 
<p>Since Datasette depends on Python 3.6 these days, I decided to try out f-strings. I used <a href="https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt">flynt</a> to automatically <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/30e64c8d3b3728a86c3ca42a75322cc3feb5b0c8">convert all of my usage</a> of <code>.format()</code> to use f-strings instead. Flynt is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor">astor</a>, a really neat looking library for more productively manipulating Python source code using Python's AST.</p>
<p>I've long been envious of the JavaScript community's aggressive use of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift">codemods</a> for automated refactoring, so I'm excited to see that kind of thing become more common in the Python community.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all">datasette-search-all</a> is my plugin that returns search results from ALL attached searchable database tables, using a barrage of <code>fetch()</code> calls. I bumped it to a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all/releases/tag/1.0">1.0 release</a> adding loading indicators, more reliable URL construction (with the new <code>datasette.urls</code> utilities) and a menu item in Datasette's new navigation menu.</p>

<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date specification has now been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8943">RFC 8943</a>.  In particular, the <code>full-date</code> tag requested for use by the ISO Mobile Driver’s License specification in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17</a> “Cards and security devices for personal identification” working group has been created by this RFC.  The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC 7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</p>
<p><br>
In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time:  CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX “seconds since the epoch”).  Since then, additional requirements have become known.  This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar without a time.  It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric date representation without a time.  This specification is the reference document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that a gifted musical singer/songwriter appears in this RFC in a contextually appropriate fashion, should you need an additional incentive to read the specification. ;-)</p>

 David Seddon provides a detailed explanation of Django's nestable transaction.atomic() context manager and describes a gotcha that can occur if you lose track of whether your code is already running in a transaction block, since you may be working with savepoints instead - along with some smart workarounds.

Make sure the board creates and delivers value and wealth for the shareholders; almost at any cost. The skills, processes, practices and values needed were largely simple and financially driven/ rewarded. Much has been written about the topic and the theory forms the basis of the practices that control where we are today. The fundamental fabric has now changed. Indeed shareholders never owned the company and real-time trade removed a belief about responsibilities and ownership. It has to be said that these ideals were only a mechanism we created to exercise accountability and responsibility controls. However, those controls and beliefs are now themselves lost. By example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-quality-and-effectiveness-of-audit-independent-review">audit is broken and does not work</a>. <br><br>  When reframing the purpose for a board, based on 2020 reasons for a business to exist, of which there are many, but:  when framed for say sustainability, becomes complex. Sustainability for whom, what metrics, skills, data and who decides?  when framed for say ESG, becomes complex. ESG for whom, what metrics, data and who decides?  when framed for eco-system survival, become complex .....  when framed by the provision of help, service and support, it becomes complex&nbsp;   <br> Questions I am sat on?   Are boards working for us?<br>Who is "the us" you framed in the last question?<br>Of whom are you asking the question and what voices are you not listening to?  <br>Perhaps we need to start with a question. What is the one clear purpose a board exists in this instance? Is it say for Accountability OR Better judgment and who decides?

   IndieAuth is a spiritual successor to OpenID, developed and maintained by the IndieWeb community and based on OAuth 2. This weekend I attended IndieWebCamp East Coast and was inspired to try my hand at an implementation. datasette-indieauth is the result, a new plugin which enables IndieAuth logins to a Datasette instance. 
 Surprisingly this was my first IndieWebCamp - I've been adjacent to that

  <p><a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> is a spiritual successor to <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, developed and maintained by the IndieWeb community and based on OAuth 2. This weekend I attended <a href="https://indieweb.org/2020/East">IndieWebCamp East Coast</a> and was inspired to try my hand at an implementation. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth">datasette-indieauth</a> is the result, a new plugin which enables IndieAuth logins to a Datasette instance.</p>
<p>Surprisingly this was my first IndieWebCamp - I've been adjacent to that community for over a decade, but I'd never made it to one of their in-person events before. Now that everything's virtual I didn't even have to travel anywhere, so I finally got to break my streak of non-attendance.</p>
 Understanding IndieAuth 
<p>The key idea behind IndieAuth is to provide federated login based on URLs. Users enter a URL that they own (e.g. <code>simonwillison.net</code>), and the protocol then derives their identity provider, redirects the user there, waits for them to sign in and get redirected back and then uses tokens passed in the redirect to prove the user's ownership of the URL and sign them in.</p>
<p>Here's what that authentication flow looks like, using <a href="https://datasette-indieauth-demo.datasette.io/">this demo of the plugin</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>IndieAuth works by scanning the linked page for a <code>&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth"&gt;</code> HTML element which indicates a service that should be redirected to in order to authenticate the user.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://indieauth.com">IndieAuth.com</a> for my own site's authorization endpoint, an identity provider run by IndieAuth spec author <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron Parecki</a>. IndieAuth.com implements <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth">RelMeAuth</a>.</p>
<p>RelMeAuth is a neat hack where the authentication provider can scan the user's URL for a <code>&lt;link href="https://github.com/simonw" rel="me"&gt;</code> element, confirm that the GitHub profile in question links back to the same page, and then delegate to GitHub authentication for the actual sign-in.</p>
 Why implement this for Datasette? 
<p>A key goal of Datasette is to reduce the friction involved in publishing data online as much as possible.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/publish.html#datasette-publish">datasette publish</a> command addresses this by providing a single CLI command for publishing a SQLite database to the internet and assigning it a new URL.</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun ca-fires.db \
    --service ca-fires \
    --title "Latest fires in California"
</code> 
<p>This command will create a new Google Cloud Run service, package up the <code>ca-fires.db</code> (created <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/">in this talk</a>) along with the Datasette web application, and deploy the resulting site using Google Cloud Run.</p>
<p>It will output a URL that looks like this: <code>https://ca-fires-j7hipcg4aq-uc.a.run.app</code></p>
<p>Datasette is unauthenticated by default - anyone can view the published data. If you want to add authentication you can do so using a plugin, for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-passwords">datasette-auth-passwords</a>.</p>
<p>Authentication without passwords is better. The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-github">datasette-auth-github</a> plugin implements single-sign-on against the GitHub API, but comes with a slight disadvantage: you need to register and configure your application with GitHub in order to configure things like the redirect URL needed for authentication.</p>
<p>For most applications this isn't a problem, but when you're deploying dozens or potentially hundreds of applications with Datasette - each with initially unpredictable URLs - this can add quite a bit of friction.</p>
<p>The joy of IndieAuth (and OpenID before it) is that there's no centralized authority to register with. You can deploy an application to any URL, install the <code>datasette-indieauth</code> plugin and users can start authenticating with your site.</p>
<p>Even better... IndieAuth means you can grant people permission to access a site without them needing to create an account, provided they have their own domain with IndieAuth setup.</p>
<p>I took advantage of that in the design of <code>datasette-indieauth</code>. Say you want to publish a Datasette that only I can access - you can do that using the <code>restrict_access</code> plugin configuration setting like so:</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun simon-only.db \
  --service simon-only \
  --title "For Simon's eye only" \
  --install datasette-indieauth \
  --plugin-secret datasette-indieauth \
    restrict_access https://simonwillison.net/
</code> 
<p>The resulting Datasette instance will require the user to authenticate in order to view it - and will only allow access to the user who can use IndieAuth to prove that they are the owner of <code>simonwillison.net</code>.</p>
 Next steps 
<p>There are two sides to the IndieAuth specification: client sites that allow sign-in with IndieAuth, and authorization providers that handle that authentication.</p>
<p><code>datasette-indieauth</code> currently acts as a client, allowing sign-in with IndieAuth.</p>
<p>I'm considering extending the plugin to act as an authorization provider as well. This is a bit more challenging as authentication providers need to maintain some small aspects of session state, but it would be good for the IndieAuth ecosystem for there to be more providers. The most widely used provider at the moment is the excellent <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">IndieAuth WordPress plugin</a>, which I used while testing my Datasette plugin and really was just a one-click install from the WordPress plugin directory.</p>
<p><code>datasette-indieauth</code> has 100% test coverage, and I wrote the bulk of the logic in a standalone <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-indieauth/blob/1.0/datasette_indieauth/utils.py">utils.py module</a> which could potentially be extracted out of the plugin and used to implement IndieAuth in Python against other frameworks. A Django IndieAuth provider is another potential project, which could integrate directly with my Django blog.</p>
 Addendum: what about OpenID? 
<p>Fom 2006 to 2010 I was a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/openid/">passionate advocate</a> for <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. It was clear to me that passwords were an increasingly unpleasant barrier to secure usage of the web, and that some form of federated sign-in was inevitable. I was terrified that Microsoft Passport would take over all authentication on the web!</p>
<p>With hindsight that's not quite what happened: for a while it looked like Facebook would win instead, but today it seems to be a fairly even balance between Facebook, Google, community-specific authentication providers like GitHub and Apple's iPhone-monopoly-enforced Sign in with Apple.</p>
<p>OpenID as an open standard didn't really make it. The specification grew in complicated new directions (Yadis, XRDS, i-names, OpenID Connect, OpenID 2.0) and it never quite overcame the usability hurdle of users having to understand URLs as identifiers.</p>
<p>IndieAuth is a much simpler specification, based on lessons learned from OAuth. I'm still worried about URLs as identifiers, but helping people reclaim their online presence and understand those concepts is core to what the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb movement</a> is all about.</p>
<p>IndieAuth also has some clever additional tricks up its sleeve. My favourite is that IndieAuth can return an identifier for the user that's different from the one they typed in the box. This means that if a top-level domain with many users supports IndieAuth, each user can learn to just type <code>example.com</code> in (or click a branded button) to start the authentication flow - they'll be signed in as <code>example.com/users/simonw</code> based on who they authenticated as. This feels like an enormous usability improvement to me, and one that could really help avoid users having to remember their own profile URLs.</p>
<p>OpenID was trying to solve authentication for every user of the internet. IndieAuth is less ambitious - if it only takes off with the subset of people who embrace the IndieWeb movement I think that's OK.</p>
<p>The <code>datasette-indieauth</code> project is yet another example of the benefit of having a plugin ecosystem around Datasette: I can add support for technologies like IndieAuth without baking them into Datasette's core, which almost eliminates the risk to the integrity of the larger project of trying out something new.</p>

As I struggled to understand the Buddhist description of selflessness, I realized I was limited by an existing indoctrination that had a very different (mis?) interpretation of selflessness, that comes from my midwestern religious upbringing.</p> Selflessness <p>I was taught selflessness as some aspect of Christianity, that Jesus was selfless and we should be too. And I learned that this kind of selflessness was about thinking about others, considering others, putting others before you. And I was indoctrinated that I should put others before&nbsp;me.</p><p>Well this didn’t work so great for me. While I was busy putting others before me, I did not receive the same treatment. I was expected to put others before me, AND ALSO meet all my own needs. Hello burnout, not to mention unfairness.</p> Selfish <p>I rebelled against this and went to take care of my needs first (well first I had to figure out what I needed cause I’d been brainwashed by society). This caused the Christians in my life to call me selfish. But if I didn’t take care of my needs, and other people didn’t take care of my needs either, where did that leave me? Was I supposed to be ok with&nbsp;that?</p> Selflessness Redux <p>As I’ve gone deeper into the Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist canon of emptiness, I came against “selflessness” again. Selflessness is supposedly one of the easiest ways to understand the weight and important of emptiness (I disagree, but that is a post for another day), because by starting with selflessness, you supposedly realize emptiness directly and relatedly to yourself. (There are also some epic mental logistics!)</p><p>Selfless in the Buddhist canon means you (and everyone) has an ever changing “I” aka this thing you think is you, that you ascribe an identity too, is not solid or everlasting — it is constantly changing based on the context and relation to the world. A bunch of years ago, I gave a talk called “How We Create I(dentity)” which talked about how we each have complex identities that change based on&nbsp;context.</p><p>Remember the uproar when Facebook was like you can only have one identity there, and it has to be the legal you? That’s the wrong view of identity. Your FB identity is constrained to the FB platform. (And teaser: your FB identity is dependent on the platform&nbsp;too.)</p> Dependent Arising <p>This “you” is dependent on many things. It’s dependent on the evolution of DNA so you have a brain and a body to move around in this world. It’s dependent on the social structure and education and global politics and the food you eat and what your ancestors ate and food is itself dependent on the earth and the&nbsp;sun.</p><p>We have a business description for this: the supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Think about it. You go to a store, you have shelves of products. Those products didn’t just magically appear out of nothing! They don’t exist on their own. The box of cookies exists because of all the steps it took along the supply chain, from the growing of the farmer’s wheat, the harvest tracked on an IoT connected John Deere tractor, the grain shipped cross border (and taxed) to a factory, which makes, say, King Arthur flour, which then is sold to bakeries, and those bakeries use human and machine labor to combine the flour with eggs, sugar, butter, baking soda, and chocolate, which is baked, packaged, marketed, shipped to your store where you can buy and eat them during a global pandemic.</p><p>This is called “dependent arising.” Which basically means, the thing does not, can not, exist on its own, of its own&nbsp;accord.</p><p>The box of cookies does not magically pop into existence from emptiness. It comes into existence bit by bit as it moves along the supply chain. We Create the Identity (and the product) of the&nbsp;thing.</p> The Supply Chain of&nbsp;You <p>Now, apply this scenario to you. You are the box of cookies. Your existence is dependent on many things. You can not exist separately. You are dependent arising. If you understand and accept that you are a result of the “supply chain of you” and you are constantly changing based on context, you may also accept/realize that you are not as solid as you think you&nbsp;are.</p><p>This is selflessness. It is the understanding that your existence is dependent on the world around you AND this constantly changing you is not a solid everlasting thing. You have no self to center on — because the self is a constantly changing projection. (I like to think about the self as disco lights at the club creating the ambiance of the dancefloor.)</p> Resolution? <p>My Christian understanding of selflessness is about putting others first because&nbsp;??? IDK Jesus said&nbsp;so?</p><p>My Buddhist understanding of selflessness is about realizing I could not exist without everything in the world, and that I do not exist — my identity/self does not exist — outside of the world. And so in this understanding I see how I connect and am created/influenced by everything.</p><p>In the Christian sense, if I do not put others first, I am “bad,” but this is self alienating. Whereas in the Buddhist sense, who I am is created by the world, and thus, I have the power to influence and create others as much as they have to influence and create me. So I can authentically consider others in order to influence and co-create who they are. Which if I think about it, is perhaps not so different from intention of considering others in the first place, with one key difference, considering others as if they are you instead of not-you, because together We Create (individual &amp; collective) I(dentity).</p>

<p>I need to train my memory so I don’t get too far behind these daily Microblogvember posts, but also not to far ahead - because that would be spooky and I guess the judge probably wouldn’t wear it - what say you <a href="https://micro.blog/macgenie">@macgenie</a> ? or do the elderly get a free pass - no pressure, no force, just asking, because I don’t want to put you in a bind if you have to inflate the stats - I mean that would just be too puzzling, besides I don’t want to stoop that low in trying to make this work, I mean I am near - but so far its nothing that might astonish you because it’s hard to concentrate and this is the most exciting thing I’ve written today … I am that dreary.</p>

<p>The DKIM standard allows email providers such as Gmail to include cryptographic headers that protect against spoofing, proving that an email was sent by a specific host and has not been tampered with. But it has an unintended side effect: if someone's email is leaked (as happened to John Podesta in 2016) DKIM headers can be used to prove the validity of the leaked emails. This makes DKIM an enabling factor for blackmail and other security breach related crimes.

Matthew Green proposes a neat solution: providers like Gmail should rotate their DKIM keys frequently and publish the PRIVATE key after rotation. By enabling spoofing of past email headers they would provide deniability for victims of leaks, fixing this unintended consequence of the DKIM standard.</p>

 Understanding the future of the Internet and the flows of identity &amp; personal information 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed interviewing Kaliya Young, The Identity Women, last week, during an Identity Praxis Experts Corner Interview on November 13, 2020.</p>
  
 About Kaliya and Her Purpose 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaliya, “The Identity Women,” is a preeminent expert in all things identity and personal information management standards, protocols, resources, and relationships.</p>
<p>If you listen to our interview, you’ll hear about her purpose and passion, how she is living it, and how she helps guide the world down a path toward self-sovereignty. At the end of this path is the promise that one day people—you, me…everyone—will have control, i.e., self-determination and agency, over their identity and personal information.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kaliya’s purpose is to answer this profound question: “How do we own, control, manage, and represent ourselves in the digital world, independently of the BigTech companies (Facebook, Google, etc.)?”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the last 15+ years, Kaliya has been at the center of the self-sovereign identity (SSI) movement.</p>
<p>The SSI movement is all about creating open standards and technologies that change how identity and personal information are collected, managed, and exchanged throughout society. In other words, SSI is about getting our identity out of the grip of BigTech and into the hands of the individual, the data subject. But, SSI is so much more; it is also about evolving the Internet, making it more efficient and secure, and creating new opportunities for businesses to innovate and to forge new and lasting relationships with the people they serve.</p>
<p>The Opportunities form SSI.</p>
<p>In our interview, Kaliya highlights several opportunities that SSI can make possible, including:</p>
 
 The availability of new protocols will make it possible to securely and efficiently move data across the Internet without it being centralized in a few players’ hands. 
 The possibility for people to have control over their identity and data is created and moved, rather than it being in control of BigTech like Facebook and Google (see Kaliya’s Jan. 2020 interview in Wired, where she discusses making Facebook obsolete). 
 The chance for businesses to build a new kind of trusted, secure, and transparent relationship with their customers, and to do so while saving time, money, and reducing risk (Kaliya recommends that you check out DIDComm Messaging, an emerging protocol that is promised to bring this opportunity to light). 
 
 SSI Use Cases 
<p>It is still early days for SSI, but people worldwide are working diligently to create the foundation of SSI so that a wealth of privacy and people-centric services can come to light.</p>
<p>Following my interview with Kaliya, I took a look at the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group (VCWG), as recommended by Kaliya. The W3C VCWG is a team diligently working on adding a new, secure identity management layer to the Internet. Among other efforts that they are working on, I found that, in Sept. 2020, they released a list of use cases and technical requirements for self-sovereign identity, see the Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers draft spec.</p>
 Here is a list of high-lighted use cases, 
 
 The online shopper is assured that the product they’re buying is authentic. 
 Owners of manufactured goods, e.g., a car, can track the product’s ownership history and the provenance of every part (original and replaced) while preserving players’ anonymity up and down the supply chain for the life of the product. 
 Support for data vaults, aka personal data stores; people can securely store their data in the cloud and be confident that they and only they have access to it and that they can offer fine-grained access to their data when&nbsp;they want to. For example, they can securely share their age in a way that someone else can verify and trust without needing the person’s actual birth date or any additional information. 
 Track verifiable credentials back to their issuer; people or organizations looking to verify someone’s data will be able to track a verifiable credential or piece of data back to a trusted source, like a chamber of commerce, bank, or DMV. 
 New and improved data exchange consent management, not just for data exchange but to manage online tracking&nbsp;to power personalization and analytics 
 Power secure and anonymous payments 
 Secure physical and digital identity cards or licensing credentials that allow for fine-grained control of exactly what data is shared when the proof of identity or licensee rights need to be verified 
 
 The Challenges for SSI 
<p>According to Kaliya, the most significant challenges that we must overcome to make SSI a reality include,</p>
 
 Counteract the inertia of the status-quo; people don’t like change; they are used to existing knowledge-based authentication practices, processes, and systems. 
 People’s awareness generation and adoption of new SSI empowered services. 
 Education for everyone: developers, users, executives, customers, clients, investors, regulators, and so much more. 
 The new market model, i.e., we now face a three-sided market, and all the business models and systems operations must evolve to accommodate the new use cases. 
 
 Kaliya: A wealth of resources and knowledge&nbsp; 
<p>Kaliya is a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>She knows the SSI industry structure. She knows the leading players. She can point you to the right resources to introduce you to people that can help you understand, plan, and execute SSI solutions and services.</p>
<p>To put a fine point on it, working with Kaliya can save you months, if not years, of stumbling around in the dark as you look to figure out what SSI can do for you and your business.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the people and resources that Kaliya high-lighted and alluded to in our interview:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 W3C Credentials community group, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 Trust over IP Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards and governance models. 
 Kim Cameron and the 7 Laws of Identity, a godfather and visionary in all things identity 
 DIDComm Messaging Protocol, a protocol for trusted data exchange 
 Internet Identity Workshop, a bi-annual incoherence where all things SSI are discussed 
 Domains of Identity, a book she wrote on identity. 
 Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity, a book she wrote on self-sovereign identity. 
 
<p>That’s it for now. Enjoy. We’ll be sure to bring Kaliya back soon.</p>

  It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential. So what exactly have I doing with all that time?

<p>It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential.</p>

<p>So what exactly have I doing with all that time?</p>



 Managing Emotions 

<p>If you haven’t been following my story, so far, the short version is that I quit drinking a few years ago, and all of this info-gathering has been an important part of my recovery process, and a path to creating a new life.</p>

<p>All the same, however far along I had come in my work, and self-education, I still had the challenges processing every day emotions, which I’d been primarily avoiding by processing as much information on valuable topics as possible.</p>

<p>Turning that around, I shifted most of my info-gathering from blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized-identity, to focus more on mental hygiene and emotional agility.</p>

<p>The most valuable information I’ve encountered in that regard is <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re interested, in nonviolent communication, with the kind of honesty that supports people connecting with each other in a way that makes compassionate giving inevitable, that makes it enjoyable for people to contribute to each other’s well being. - Marshall Rosenberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve got a couple projects brewing on that topic, and will write more about that later, so don’t want to take too much space for that now.</p>

<p>In brief, I can say that spending time with the teachings of Marshall Rosenberg has made a significant contribution to my mental health and emotional wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you’re curious to learn more, I called a session at my first IIW on the topic, you can check out the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Introduction%5CDiscussion_-_Marshall_Rosenberg%27s_Nonviolent_Communication_(perhaps_discussing_integration_with_standards_processes)">notes for that session on the IIW Wiki</a>, which provides a high-level overview, and lots of links.</p>

 Developing the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter 

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Instead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a>  (a resource I’ve created along that journey) 
 

<p>Static Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form 

   <code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form class="staticman" method="POST" action="https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[redirect]" type="hidden" value="https://infominer.xyz/subscribed"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[slug]" type="hidden" value="infohub"&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[name]" type="text" placeholder="Name (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[email]" type="email" placeholder="Email"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[message]" type="text" placeholder="Areas of Interest (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="links" type="hidden" placeholder="links"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code>   
 The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo 

   <code>subscribe:
  allowedFields: ["name", "email", "message"]
  allowedOrigins: ["infominer.xyz","identosphere.net"]
  branch: "master"
  commitMessage: "New subscriber: {fields.name}"
  filename: "subscribe-{@timestamp}"
  format: "yaml"
  generatedFields:
    date:
      type: "date"
      options:
        format: "iso8601" 
  moderation: false
  name: "infominer.xyz"
  path: "{options.slug}" 
  requiredFields: ["email"]
</code>   

<p>It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008">struggling with GitHub’s recent move</a> to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.</p>

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<p>Trying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly <a href="https://feedly.com/i/pro/welcome">$50 a month</a> for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.</p>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.</p>

<p>What <a href="https://github.com/feedreader/">Pluto Feed reader</a> does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>Last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/identitywoman">Kaliya</a> suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/">identosphere.substack.com</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

Trust frameworks are being developed by the private sector and the public sector, as collaborative or sector-specific efforts. Trust mark and trust certification programs are also emerging alongside trust framework development efforts.</p><p>These trust framework development efforts are worthy undertakings and the results of these efforts should automatically engender trust. But the problem that we are now faced with, all good intentions aside, is — how do we truly trust a trust framework?</p><p>The answer is simple — with standards.</p><p>Trust frameworks need standards to be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Within the Canadian context, a <a href="https://www.scc.ca/standards/what-are-standards">standard</a> is defined by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of Canada</a>,&nbsp;as:</p><p>“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse&nbsp;fields.”</p><p>This standard definition might sound straightforward — making a ‘standard” might sound easy but the hard part is all the work leading up to agreeing on those things that are part of a standard — an agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their&nbsp;results.</p><p>That’s where trust frameworks come into play. Much of the work that eventually ends up in a standard is years if not decades in the making. For years I have been part of developing the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>. This work had started in earnest in early 2015, and building on work that goes as far as back as 2007 (you can find a lot of the historical material in the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">docs</a> folder in the PCTF repository on&nbsp;GitHub)</p><p>What has come out of all of this work is a trust framework — a set of agreed on principles, definitions, standards, specifications, conformance criteria, and assessment approach.</p><p>This definition of a trust framework, sounds pretty much like a standard, doesn’t it? Yes and no. What the trust framework has not gone through is a standards development process that respects and safeguards the interests of all stakeholders affected by the standard. Within the Canadian context, that’s where Standards Council of Canada comes into play by specifying how standards should be <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/what-are-standards/developing-standards#Development%20of%20National%20Standards%20of%20Canada">developed</a> and how to <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/accreditation">accredit</a> certain bodies to be standards development organizations.</p><p>So trust frameworks, however good and complete they are, still need to go through the step of becoming an official standard. Fortunately, this is the case in Canada, where the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework </a>was used to develop <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">CAN/CIOSC 103–1:2020 Digital trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals</a>. This standard was developed by the <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/home/">CIO Strategy Council</a>, a standards development organization accredited by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of&nbsp;Canada.</a></p><p>In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself. In Canada, we have been extremely fortunate to see the good work that we have done in the public sector to be transformed into a national standard that serves the interests of all Canadians.</p>

rolling back
surveillance capitalism, improving
privacy and user agency, and cleaning up the unholy mess that on-line advertising has become.
Finally I have read the book, and here are a few notes.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>, improving
privacy and user agency, and cleaning up the unholy mess that on-line advertising has become.
Finally I have read the book, and here are a few notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://timhwang.org/">Tim Hwang</a> makes three core points:</p>
 
 Programmatic, on-line advertising is fundamentally, irredeamably broken. 
 It’s not a matter of whether it will implode, but just when. 
 Apply the lessons from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">2018 subprime mortgage crisis</a>:
advertising inventory is a different asset class, but the situation is fundamentally the same:
eroding fundamentals in the face of an opaque, overhyped market, which
will lead to a crash with similarly major consequences when it occurs. 
 
<p>I buy his first point. I mostly buy his second, but there are too many important differences
with the market for collateralized mortgages in 2008 for me to buy his third. Ultimately that
parallel isn’t that important, however: if he’s right that programmatic on-line advertising
is headed for something dramatic, whether it’s like 2008 subprime mortgages or some other crash
doesn’t matter in the end.</p>
<p>Why would anybody say programmatic, on-line advertising is broken? He has many examples,
go read the book, but let me mention my personal favorite from personal experience:
ads, to me, on Spotify:</p>
 
 
<p>Spotify, for a long time, advertised joining the Marine Corps to me. I should be
flattered how young, vigorous, and gung-ho they consider me, but hmm, I don’t think so.
This must be because they have some wrong data about me, and while Spotify got the
Marine Corps' money all the same, the Marine Corps totally wasted their spend.</p>
<p>While this example is particularly egregious, Hwang has many other examples, which
argue that this is a major and pervasive problem.</p>
 
 
<p>I recently downloaded the personal data Spotify have about me, as I can because we have
the CCPA in California. Looking at the advertising subjects they have tagged me
with, guess what?</p>
 
 
<p>It was worse than I was afraid of. I loaded the tags into a spreadsheet, and
categorized them into three groups:</p>
 
 
<p>Interests I definitely have. Example: “Computers and software high spender”. Guilty
as charged.</p>
 
 
<p>Interests I definitely do not have. Example: “March Madness Basketball Fan”. What?
Never watched basketball in my life. I don’t actually know what “March Madness”
might even be and I’m disinclined to look it up.</p>
 
 
<p>Interests that I might or might not have, Meh so to speak. Example: “Vitamin C
category purchasers”. Maybe I bought some one day. I don’t remember.</p>
 
 
<p>How do you think these categories break down? The majority (30/66, almost half) of tags
Spotify has about me is in the Meh category. Will I buy more Vitamin C if they advertise
it to me? Maybe, but quite unlikely. Consider the ad spend money in this category mostly
wasted on me.</p>
<p>But this is the kicker: 24 of the remaining tags were “definitely not” and only 12 were
“definitely yes”. Twice as many categories about me were absolutely wrong as were correct!!</p>
<p>Only 18% of the total categories were clearly correct, and worth spending ad money on
to target me.</p>
<p>Eighteen.</p>
<p>From the name of the tags in the Spotify export, I guess most of them were purchased
from third parties. (Makes sense: how would Spotify know I’m interested in Vitamin C,
or not?) In other words, 18% of the data they purchased about me was correct, 36%
incorrect, and the rest more or less random. No wonder Hwang immediately thinks of junk
mortgage bonds with numbers like these.</p>
<p>But as he points out, advertisers keep spending money, however. Why? I suggest the
answer is very simple: because of a lack of alternatives.</p>
<p>If you stop advertising on-line, what are you going to do instead? As long as there isn’t a
better alternative, it’s a better plan to pinch your nose and go to your CEO and say,
yes, I know that today, not just
<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/john_wanamaker_389609">half</a> but a full
82% of our advertising money is wasted, but it’s better to waste all that money than
not to advertise at all. I can understand that. Terrible, but reality.</p>
<p>So, for me, the more interesting question is: “How can we do better?” And I think the
times are getting ripe for doing something better… stay tuned :-)</p>

<p>Companies and organizations have strategic decisions to make at the Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) front. First, they have to decide whether to invest into a dedicated CIAM solution or to build on existing infrastructure. If there is already a foundation, what should be their next steps to have a mature CIAM strategy in place? If they do not have a CIAM solution, where do they start? Applications, systems, identities tend to be siloed while as a business grows, it’s imperative they are cohesive and well-integrated in order to provide a superior customer experience.</p><p>An effective CIAM solution will help connect various applications and systems such as CRM, data management, analytics and marketing platforms. This helps to move towards a 360-degree view of the customer which is a key prerequisite for successful digital transformation.</p><p>In the following webinar recording, I join with KuppingerCole Senior Analyst and Lead Advisor Matthias Reinwarth to explain how CIAM helps to achieve digital transformation, best practices in CIAM and pitfalls to avoid. Also we talk about the 5 pillars in CIAM essential for your CIAM strategy and maturity models to determine stage of&nbsp;growth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-role-of-ciam-in-digital-transformation-66e0fff623d">The Role of CIAM in Digital Transformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>I gave a talk yesterday about personal data warehouses for <a href="https://octo.github.com/speakerseries/SimonWillison/">GitHub's OCTO Speaker Series</a>, focusing on my <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> and <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> projects. The video of the talk is now available, and I'm presenting that here along with <a>an annotated summary of the talk</a>, including links to demos and further information.</p>

<p>There's a short technical glitch with the screen sharing in the first couple of minutes of the talk - I've added screenshots to the notes which show what you would have seen if my screen had been correctly shared.</p>

     
        
         <a>Unstick</a> 
     

     
        
        <p>I'm going to be talking about personal data warehouses, what they are, why you want one, how to build them and some of the interesting things you can do once you've set one up.</p>
        <p>I'm going to start with a demo.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>This is my dog, Cleo - when she won first place in a dog costume competition here, dressed as the Golden Gate Bridge!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>So the question I want to answer is: How much of a San Francisco hipster is Cleo?</p>
        <p>I can answer it using my personal data warehouse. </p>
        <p>I have a database of ten year's worth of my checkins on Foursquare Swarm - generated using my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/swarm-to-sqlite">swarm-to-sqlite</a> tool. Every time I check in somewhere with Cleo I use the Wolf emoji in the checkin message.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I can filter for just checkins where the checkin message includes the wolf emoji.</p>
        <p>Which means I can see just her checkins - all 280 of them.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>If I facet by venue category, I can see she's checked in at 57 parks, 32 dog runs, 19 coffee shops and 12 organic groceries.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Then I can facet by venue category and filter down to just her 19 checkins at coffee shops.</p>
        <p>Turns out she's a Blue Bottle girl at heart.</p>
        <p>Being able to build a map of the coffee shops that your dog likes is obviously a very valuable reason to build your own personal data warehouse.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Let's take a step back and talk about how this demo works.</p>
        <p>The key to this demo is this web application I'm running called <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>. I've been working on this project for three years now, and the goal is to make it as easy and cheap as possible to explore data in all sorts of shapes and sizes.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Ten years ago I was working for the Guardian newspaper in London. One of the things I realized when I joined the organization is that newspapers collect enormous amounts of data. Any time they publish a chart or map in the newspaper someone has to collect the underlying information.</p>
        <p>There was a journalist there called Simon Rogers who was a wizard at collecting any data you could think to ask for. He knew exactly where to get it from, and had collected a huge number of brilliant spreadsheets on his desktop computer.</p>
        <p>We decided we wanted to publish the data behind the stories. We started something called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/27/data-store-office-for-national-statistics">the Data Blog</a>, and aimed to accompany our stories with the raw data behind them.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>We ended up using Google Sheets to publish the data. It worked, but I always felt like there should be a better way to publish this kind of structured data in a way that was as useful and flexible as possible for our audience.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Fast forward to 2017, when I was looking into this new thing called "serverless" hosting - in particular one called Zeit Now, which has since rebranded as <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</p>
        <p>My favourite aspect of Serverless is "Scale to zero" - the idea that you only pay for hosting when your project is receiving traffic.</p>
        <p>If you're like me, and you love building side-projects but you don't like paying $5/month for them for the rest of your life, this is perfect.</p>
        <p>The catch is that serverless providers tend to charge you extra for databases, or require you to buy a hosted database from another provider.</p>
        <p>But what if your database doesn't change? Can you bundle your database in the same container as your code?</p>
        <p>This was the initial inspiration behind creating Datasette.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's another demo. The <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/global-power-plant-database">World Resources Institute</a> maintain a CSV file of every power plant in the world.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Like many groups, they publish <a href="https://github.com/wri/global-power-plant-database">that data</a> on GitHub.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/global-power-plants-datasette/blob/main/.github/workflows/scheduled.yml">a script</a> that grabs their most recent data and publishes it using Datasette.</p>
        <p><a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants">Here's the contents of their CSV file</a> published using Datasette</p>
        <p>Datasette supports plugins. You've already seen this plugin in my demo of Cleo's coffee shops - it's called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> and it works by looking for tables with a latitude and longitude column and plotting the data on a map.</p>
        <p></p>
     
     
        
        <p>Straight away looking at this data you notice that there's a couple of power plants down here in Antarctica. This is McMurdo station, and it has a 6.6MW oil generator.</p>
        <p>And oh look, there's a wind farm down there too on Ross Island knocking out 1MW of electricity.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>But this is also a demonstration of faceting. I can slice down to just the <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants?primary_fuel=Nuclear&amp;country_long=France">nuclear power plants in France</a> and see those on a map.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>And anything i can see in the interface, I can get out as JSON. Here's <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants.json?primary_fuel=Nuclear&amp;country_long=France">a JSON file</a> showing all of those nuclear power plants in France.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>And here's <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants.csv?primary_fuel=Nuclear&amp;country_long=France">a CSV export</a> which I can use to pull the data into Excel or other CSV-compatible software.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>If I click <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants?sql=select+rowid%2C+country%2C+country_long%2C+name%2C+gppd_idnr%2C+capacity_mw%2C+latitude%2C+longitude%2C+primary_fuel%2C+other_fuel1%2C+other_fuel2%2C+other_fuel3%2C+commissioning_year%2C+owner%2C+source%2C+url%2C+geolocation_source%2C+wepp_id%2C+year_of_capacity_data%2C+generation_gwh_2013%2C+generation_gwh_2014%2C+generation_gwh_2015%2C+generation_gwh_2016%2C+generation_gwh_2017%2C+generation_data_source%2C+estimated_generation_gwh+from+%5Bglobal-power-plants%5D+where+%22country_long%22+%3D+%3Ap0+and+%22primary_fuel%22+%3D+%3Ap1+order+by+rowid+limit+101&amp;p0=France&amp;p1=Nuclear">"view and edit SQL"</a> to get back the SQL query that was used to generate the page - and I can edit and re-execute that query.</p>
        <p>I can get those custom results back as CSV or JSON as well!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>In most web applications this would be seen as a terrifying security hole - it's a SQL injection attack, as a documented feature!</p>
        <p>A couple of reasons this isn't a problem here:</p>
        <p>Firstly, this is setup as a read-only database: INSERT and UPDATE statements that would modify it are not allowed. There's a one second time limit on queries as well.</p>
        <p>Secondly, everything in this database is designed to be published. There are no password hashes or private user data that could be exposed here.</p>
        <p>This also means we have a JSON API that lets JavaScript execute SQL queries against a backend! This turns out to be really useful for rapid prototyping.</p>
        <p></p>
     
     
        
        <p>It's worth talking about the secret sauce that makes this all possible.</p>
        <p>This is all built on top of <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. Everyone watching this talk uses SQLite every day, even if you don't know it.</p>
        <p>Most iPhone apps use SQLite, many desktop apps do, it's even running inside my Apple Watch.</p>
        <p>One of my favourite features is that a SQLite database is a single file on disk. This makes it easy to copy, send around and also means I can bundle data up in that single file, include it in a Docker file and deploy it to serverless hosts to serve it on the internet.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's another demo that helps show how GitHub fits into all of this.</p>
        <p>Last year PG&amp;E - the power company that covers much of California - turned off the power to large swathes of the state.</p>
        <p>I got lucky: six months earlier I had started scraping <a href="https://m.pge.com/#outages">their outage map</a> and recording the history to a GitHub repository.</p>
     
     
        
        <p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/pge-outages">simonw/pge-outages</a> is a git repository with 34,000 commits tracking the history of outages that PG&amp;E had published on their outage map.</p>
        <p>You can see that two minutes ago they added 35 new outages.</p>
        <p>I'm using this data to publish a Datasette instance with details of their historic outages. Here's a page <a href="https://pge-outages.simonwillison.net/pge-outages/most_recent_snapshot?_sort_desc=estCustAffected">showing their current outages</a> ordered by the most customers affected by the outage.</p>
        <p>Read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/">Tracking PG&amp;E outages by scraping to a git repo</a> for more details on this project.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I recently decided to give this technique a name. I'm calling it Git scraping - the idea is to take any data source on the web that represents a point-in-time and commit it to a git repository that tells the story of the history of that particular thing.</p>
        <p>Here's my article describing the pattern in more detail: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository</a>.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>This technique really stood out just last week during the US election.</p>
        <p>This is the <a href="https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html#">New York Times election scraper website</a>, built by Alex Gaynor and a growing team of contributors. It scrapes the New York Times election results and uses the data over time to show how the results are trending.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>It uses a <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper">GitHub Actions script</a> that runs on a schedule, plus a really clever Python script that turns it into a useful web page.</p>
        <p>You can find more examples of Git scraping under the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping topic</a> on GitHub.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I'm going to do a bit of live coding to show you how this stuff works.</p>
        <p>This is the <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">incidents page</a> from the state of California <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE</a> website.</p>
        <p>Any time I see a map like this, my first instinct is to open up the browser developer tools and try to figure out how it works.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>If I open the network tab, refresh the page and then filter to just XHR requests.</p>
        <p>A neat trick is to order by size - because inevitably the thing at the top of the list is the most interesting data on the page.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>This appears to be <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents">a JSON file</a> telling me about all of the current fires in the state of California!</p>
        <p>(I set up <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">a Git scraper for this</a> a while ago.)</p>
        <p>Now I'm going to take this a step further and turn it into a Datasette instance.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>It looks like the <code>AllYearIncidents</code> key is the most interesting bit here.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I'm going to use <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> to fetch that data, then pipe it through <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to filter for just that <code>AllYearIncidents</code> array.</p>
         <code>curl 'https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents' \
        | jq .AllYearIncidents</code> 
     
     
        
        <p>Now I have a list of incidents for this year.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Next I'm going to pipe it into a tool I've been building called <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> - it's a suite of tools for manipulating SQLite databases.</p>
        <p>I'm going to use the "insert" command and insert the data into a <code>ca-fires.db</code> in an <code>incidents</code> table.</p>
         <code>curl 'https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents' \
        | jq .AllYearIncidents \
        | sqlite-utils insert ca-fires.db incidents -</code> 
        <p>Now I've got a <code>ca-fires.db</code> file. I can open that in Datasette:</p>
         <code>datasette ca-fires.db -o</code> 
     
     
        
        <p>And here it is - a brand new database.</p>
        <p>You can straight away see that one of the rows has a bad location, hence it appears in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>But 258 of them look like they are in the right place.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I can also facet by county, to see which county had the most fires in 2020 - Riverside had 21.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I'm going to take this a step further and put it on the internet, using a command called <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html#datasette-publish">datasette publish</a>.</p>
        <p>Datasette publish supports a number of different hosting providers. I'm going to use <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I'm going to tell it to publish that database to a project called "ca-fires" - and tell it to install the <code>datasette-cluster-map</code> plugin.</p>
         <code>datasette publish vercel ca-fires.db \
        --project ca-fires \
        --install datasette-cluster-map</code> 
        <p>This then takes that database file, bundles it up with the Datasette application and deploys it to Vercel.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Vercel gives me a URL where I can watch the progress of the deploy.</p>
        <p>The goal here is to have as few steps as possible between finding some interesting data, turning it into a SQLite database you can use with Datasette and then publishing it online.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>And this here is that database I just created - available for anyone on the internet to visit and build against.</p>
        <p><a href="https://ca-fires.vercel.app/ca-fires/incidents">https://ca-fires.vercel.app/ca-fires/incidents</a></p>
     
     
        
        <p>I've given you a whistle-stop tour of Datasette for the purposes of publishing data, and hopefully doing some serious data journalism.</p>
        <p>So what does this all have to do with personal data warehouses?</p>
        <p>Last year, I read this essay by Stephen Wolfram: <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/">Seeking the Productive Life: Some Details of My Personal Infrastructure</a>. It's an incredible exploration of fourty years of productivity hacks that Stephen Wolfram has applied to become the CEO of a 1,000 person company that works remotely. He's optimized every aspect of his professional and personal life.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>It's a lot. </p>
        <p>But there was one part of this that really caught my eye. He talks about a thing he calls a "metasearcher" - a search engine on his personal homepage that searches every email, journals, files, everything he's ever done - all in one place.</p>
        <p>And I thought to myself, I really want THAT. I love this idea of a personal portal to my own stuff.</p>
        <p>And because it was inspired by Stephen Wolfram, but I was planning on building a much less impressive version, I decided to call it Dogsheep.</p>
        <p>Wolf, ram. Dog, sheep.</p>
        <p>I've been building this over the past year.</p>
        <p></p>
     
     
        
        <p>So essentially this is my personal data warehouse. It pulls in my personal data from as many sources as I can find and gives me an interface to browse that data and run queries against it.</p>
        <p>I've got data from Twitter, Apple HealthKit, GitHub, Swarm, Hacker News, Photos, a copy of my genome... all sorts of things.</p>
        <p>I'll show a few more demos.</p>
        <p></p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's another one about Cleo. Cleo has <a href="https://twitter.com/cleopaws">a Twitter account</a>, and every time she goes to the vet she posts a selfie and says how much she weighs.</p>
        <p></p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's a SQL query that finds every tweet that mentions her weight, pulls out her weight in pounds using a regular expression, then uses the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> charting plugin to show a self-reported chart of her weight over time.</p>
         <code>select
    created_at,
    regexp_match('.*?(\d+(\.\d+))lb.*', full_text, 1) as lbs,
    full_text,
    case
        when (media_url_https is not null)
        then json_object('img_src', media_url_https, 'width', 300)
    end as photo
    from
    tweets
    left join media_tweets on tweets.id = media_tweets.tweets_id
    left join media on media.id = media_tweets.media_id
    where
    full_text like '%lb%'
    and user = 3166449535
    and lbs is not null
    group by
    tweets.id
    order by
    created_at desc
    limit
    101</code> 
     
     
        
        <p>I did <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23AndMe</a> a few years ago, so I have a copy of my genome in Dogsheep. This SQL query tells me what colour my eyes are.</p>
        <p>Apparently they are blue, 99% of the time.</p>
         <code>select rsid, genotype, case genotype
    when 'AA' then 'brown eye color, 80% of the time'
    when 'AG' then 'brown eye color'
    when 'GG' then 'blue eye color, 99% of the time'
    end as interpretation from genome where rsid = 'rs12913832'</code> 
     
     
        
        <p>I have HealthKit data from my Apple Watch.</p>
        <p>Something I really like about Apple's approach to this stuff is that they don't just upload all of your data to the cloud.</p>
        <p>This data lives on your watch and on your phone, and there's an option in the Health app on your phone to export it - as a zip file full of XML.</p>
        <p>I wrote a script called <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/healthkit-to-sqlite">healthkit-to-sqlite</a> that converts that zip file into a SQLite database, and now I have tables for things like my basal energy burned, my body fat percentage, flights of stairs I've climbed.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>But the really fun part is that it turns out any time you track an outdoor workout on your Apple Watch it records your exact location every few seconds, and you can get that data back out again!</p>
        <p>This is a map of my exact route for the San Francisco Half Marathon three years ago.</p>
        <p>I've started tracking an "outdoor walk" every time I go on a walk now, just so I can get the GPS data out again later.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I have a lot of data from GitHub about my projects - all of my commits, issues, issue comments and releases - everything I can get out of the GitHub API using my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> tool.</p>
        <p>So I can do things like see all of my commits across all of my projects, search and facet them.</p>
        <p>I have a public demo of a subset of this data at <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/">github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net</a>.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I can search my commits for <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/commits?_search=pytest&amp;_sort_desc=author_date">any commit that mentions "pytest"</a>.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I have <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/recent_releases">all of my releases</a>, which is useful for when I write <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">my weeknotes</a> and want to figure out what I've been working on.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Apple Photos is a particularly interesting source of data.</p>
        <p>It turns out the Apple Photos app uses a SQLite database, and if you know what you're doing you can extract photo metadata from it.</p>
        <p>They actually run machine learning models on your own device to figure out what your photos are of!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>You can use the machine learning labels to see all of the photos you have taken of pelicans. Here are all of the photos I have taken that Apple Photos have identified as pelicans.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>It also turns out they have columns called things like ZOVERALLAESTHETICSCORE, ZHARMONIOUSCOLORSCORE, ZPLEASANTCAMERATILTSCORE and more.</p>
        <p>So I can sort my pelican photos with the most aesthetically pleasing first!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I wrote more about this on my blog; <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/21/dogsheep-photos/">Using SQL to find my best photo of a pelican according to Apple Photos</a>.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>And a few weeks ago I finally got around to building the thing I'd always wanted: the search engine.</p>
        <p>I called it <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta">Dogsheep Beta</a>, because Stephen Wolfram has a search engine called <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>.</p>
        <p>This is pun-driven development: I came up with this pun a while ago and liked it so much I committed to building the software.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I wanted to know when the last time I had eaten a waffle-fish ice cream was. I knew it was in Cupertino, so I searched Dogsheep Beta for Cupertino and found this photo.</p>
        <p>I hope this illustrates how much you can do if you pull all of your personal data into one place!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>The GDPR law that passed in Europe a few years ago really helps with this stuff.</p>
        <p>Companies have to provide you with access to the data that they store about you.</p>
        <p>Many big internet companies have responded to this by providing a self-service export feature, usually buried somewhere in the settings.</p>
        <p>You can also request data directly from companies, but the self-service option helps them keep their customer support costs down.</p>
        <p>This stuff becomes easier over time as more companies build out these features.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>The other challenge is how we democratize access to this.</p>
        <p>Everything I've shown you today is open source: you can install this software and use it yourself, for free.</p>
        <p>But there's a lot of assembly required. You need to figure out authentication tokens, find somewhere to host it, set up cron jobs and authentication.</p>
        <p>But this should be accessible to regular non-uber-nerd humans!</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Expecting regular humans to run a secure web server somewhere is pretty terrifying. I've been looking at <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> and <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to help make secure access between devices easier, but that's still very much for super-users only.</p>
        <p>Running this as a hosted service doesn't appeal: taking responsibility for people's personal data is scary, and it's probably not a great business.</p>
        <p>I think the best options are to run on people's own personal devices - their mobile phones and their laptops. I think it's feasible to get Datasette running in those environments, and I really like the idea of users being able to import their personal data onto a device that they control and analyzing it there.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>I invite you to try this all out for yourself!</p>
        <p><a href="https://datasette.io">datasette.io</a> for Datasette</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep">github.com/dogsheep</a> and <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io">dogsheep.github.io</a> for Dogsheep</p>
        <p><a href="https://simonwillison.net">simonwillison.net</a> is my personal blog</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/simonw">twitter.com/simonw</a> is my Twitter account</p>
     
     
        
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep">Dogsheep GitHub organization</a> has most of the tools that I've used to build out my personal Dogsheep warehouse - many of them using the naming convention of something-to-sqlite.</p>
     
     Q&amp;A, from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rFp2tXLvaCK5khbPbSfV8nfVjZLGTX3KkMZ2FMpgi-k/edit">this Google Doc</a> 
     
        
        <p>Q: Is there/will there be a Datasette hosted service that I can pay $ for? I would like to pay $5/month to get access to the latest version of Dogsheep with all the latest plugins!</p>
        <p>I don’t want to build a hosting site for personal private data because I think people should stay in control of that themselves, plus I don’t think there’s a particularly good business model for that.</p>
        <p>Instead, I’m building a hosted service for Datasette (called Datasette Cloud) which is aimed at companies and organizations. I want to be able to provide newsrooms and other groups with a private, secure, hosted environment where they can share data with each other and run analysis.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Q: How do you sync your data from your phone/watch to the data warehouse? Is it a manual process?</p>
        <p>The health data is manual: the iOS Health app has an export button which generates a zip file of XML which you can then AirDrop to a laptop. I then run my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/healthkit-to-sqlite">healthkit-to-sqlite</a> script against it to generate the DB file and SCP that to my Dogsheep server.</p>
        <p>Many of my other Dogsheep tools use APIs and can run on cron, to fetch the most recent data from Swarm and Twitter and GitHub and so on.</p>
        <p>Q: When accessing Github/Twitter etc do you run queries against their API or you periodically sync (retrieve mostly I guess) the data to the warehouse first and then query locally? </p>
        <p>I always try to get ALL the data so I can query it locally. The problem with APIs that let you run queries is that inevitably there’s something I want to do that can’t be done of the API - so I’d much rather suck everything down into my own database so I can write my own SQL queries.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's an example of my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/swarm-to-sqlite">swarm-to-sqlite</a> script, pulling in just checkins from the past two weeks (using authentication credentials from an environment variable).</p>
         <code>swarm-to-sqlite swarm.db --since=2w</code> 
        <p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1299d61d17637d1145955ebc019ea3c4">a redacted copy</a> of my Dogsheep crontab.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Q: Have you explored doing this as a single page app so that it is possible to deploy this as a static site? What are the constraints there?</p>
        <p>It’s actually possible to query SQLite databases entirely within client-side JavaScript using <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">SQL.js</a> (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly)</p>
     
     
        
        <p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/sqlite">This Observable notebook</a> is an example that uses this to run SQL queries against a SQLite database file loaded from a URL.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Datasette’s JSON and GraphQL APIs mean it can easily act as an API backend to SPAs</p>
        <p>I built this site to offer a search engine for trees in San Francisco. View source to see how it hits a Datasette API in the background: <a href="https://sf-trees.com/?q=palm">https://sf-trees.com/?q=palm</a></p>
     
     
        
        <p>You can use the network pane to see that it's running queries against a Datasette backend.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Here's the JavaScript code which calls the API.</p>
     
     
        
        <p><a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20repos%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20full_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20owner%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%20%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">This demo</a> shows Datasette’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">GraphQL plugin</a> in action.</p>
     
     
        
        <p>Q: What possibilities for data entry tools do the writable canned queries open up?</p>
        <p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#writable-canned-queries">Writable canned queries</a> are a relatively recent Datasette feature that allow administrators to configure a UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE query that can be called by users filling in forms or accessed via a JSON API.</p>
        <p>The idea is to make it easy to build backends that handle simple data entry in addition to serving read-only queries. It’s a feature with a lot of potential but so far I’ve not used it for anything significant.</p>
        <p>Currently it can generate a VERY basic form (with single-line input values, similar to <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/neighborhood_search">this search example</a>) but I hope to expand it in the future to support <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1090">custom form widgets</a> via plugins for things like dates, map locations or autocomplete against other tables.</p>
        <p>Q: For the local version where you had a 1-line push to deploy a new datasette: how do you handle updates? Is there a similar 1-line update to update an existing deployed datasette?</p>
        <p>I deploy a brand new installation every time the data changes! This works great for data that only changes a few times a day. If I have a project that changes multiple times an hour I’ll run it as a regular VPS instead rather than use a serverless hosting provider.</p>
        <p></p>

I have asked Adrian’s permission to post this material and he has graciously granted me permission. The post is a lightly edited version of the interview transcript. The interview took place in September 2020.</p><p>Note: All views and opinions expressed are mine only and do not represent that of my employer or organizations with whom I am involved.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lili_popper?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Lili Popper</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/pathway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> The growth factors of Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions in&nbsp;Europe” <p>Adrian Doerk: My research question is concerned about the growth factors of self-sovereign identity solutions in Europe. You as somebody who is very familiar with the topic of SSI, what would you think about, when you read the term growth factor of self-sovereign identity, what comes to your&nbsp;mind?</p><p>Tim Bouma: I believe the main growth factor is going to be adoption by users and it has to be really easy. Another growth factor is that SSI will need to be part of an infrastructure. I’m not sure if SSI is viable being marketed as a separate product because I don’t think end-users really understand it. The growth factor is going to be similar to plumbing — some additional standardized capabilities that we need to build. It will be as exciting as buying a 1/4 inch washer and bolt. It will just be part of the infrastructure and the demand will be from higher-order products not for SSI itself. I’d say most people won’t even know what it is, nor should they know about it. It’s not that different from the markets in the early days of PC networking. Remember you had your choice of drivers and different companies providing those things and after a while, it just gets baked in the operating system and people don’t even know that they’re using it. As it for being a discrete market, I see very quickly being subsumed by a higher-order products and like subsumed into mobile operating systems, into desktop devices, tablets, etc. It’s not that different from how a lot of other products or technologies evolved over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: We as SSI for German consortia we want to build infrastructure for Europe, so you might have read our press release. Probably not — no worries. So basically, our idea is to come up with a base layer infrastructure which is used as a public utility as defined in the Trust over IP stack level one with a European scope in terms of the governance and a worldwide usage. So considering this plan as public private partnership. What would be your recommendations for the governance for this&nbsp;network?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Well, you are totally aligned with my thinking. In fact, we’re about to announce a challenge. There’s a couple of things going on within the government, Canada. We’re launching a technology challenge (note: since this interview the challenge has been <a href="http://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">launched.</a>) to figure out exactly what layer one would be for the digital infrastructure with the standards, and also what specifically is the scope of layer one and I can point you to that link afterwards, but that’s what I’ve been working on. We were just awarding the contracts as we speak. We’re getting six vendors to help us out. I think to answer your questions, I have some good ideas, but I’m not 100% sure because it is relatively new area and I think we need to be quite open on having our assumptions challenged and change during the course, but I see a very clear differentiation between the technical interoperability and the business interoperability, and in fact the challenge that I’m doing We’ve got six different use cases ranging from government security clearances to issuing of cannabis licenses to name a few. I’m not concerned about the content of the credential because that’s more business interoperability. I’m concerned that whatever credential, SSI credential or whatever is being issued into the system can actually be verified from the system irrespective of what’s inside. I hope I’m not losing track your question here. I see a very clear division of the private sector operating that system. I don’t see why government needs to build it and operate it. We don’t do that for networks, we don’t do that for payment rails. It has to be done in a way that governments have optionality that if a new operator comes along that’s more trustworthy or has different characteristics, there’s no reason why they can’t be used. There’s a risk. Maybe it’s not a risk for this to turn into a natural monopoly if we aren’t careful to make sure that we don’t have the standards 100% right? We have to be very, very careful that we want to have a plurality of operators. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot of them. I see that there were probably only for national infrastructure that maybe one or two domestic operators. And then probably, you know there’s going to be some international operators, but they need to work together so that’s a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Who exactly do you mean with operators? Do you mean the Stewards?</p><p>Tim Bouma: OK, so there’s two different things. There’s a steward, the governance which and again this is going to be a tricky and I’ve noticed that the Trust over IP Foundation revised their model that you could have governance at each of the layers. And so the question is governance at which layer and then what’s the composition of that governance? I would see at layer one. It’s largely a technical&nbsp;issue. It could be just part predominantly private sector players, maybe some government or nonprofit, but I just don’t know yet. I think where a government really will play is not in the infrastructure itself, but how that infrastructure is used and relied on for doing administration of programs. Provision of services. You know it could be passports. It can be currency. It could be educational credentials or whatever. I think government needs to be concerned at that level, but less so at the lower levels. But having confidence in those lower&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: When we speak about adoption, one of the big topics is use cases in general. We think that more or less the low hanging fruit, which is really easy to implement, is where you have the issuer also as a relying party. For example a University, which issued a student ID and then checks it again to issue him some other credentials. What would you think would be good for the start for different use cases? Let me reframe the question shortly. What are your recommendations for use cases to start with? What is the best&nbsp;one?</p><p>Tim Bouma: We had six vendors propose to us and they came up with six different use cases, and they’re quite varied, and I don’t think I can say which one is going to take off by adoption or not, but there is a government security clearances, there’s a cannabis licensing, there’s one for having your digital birth certificate, there’s one for a job site permit, it came from oil and gas. I’m not so sure which one is going to play out. I think what’s more important is really having a crystal clear understanding of what’s the digital infrastructure that can serve all of those use cases. That’s where my thinking is. What’s the absolute minimum that needs to be built? That could be an infrastructure so I think any one of these use cases can take off, but I think that model of issuer Holder verifier and we’ve generalized it to methods. It doesn’t have to be a blockchain. It could be a database. It could be different ways of doing it. There’s a super pattern there that will just serve all the use cases and this is where I’ve been putting a lot of intellectual effort just on my own time just to understand what the parallels are to digital currency and digital identity. It all boils down to kind of the similar idea is that I need to independently verify something. And I need to do it in a way that’s as flexible as possible, and then I need to have some additional functions. Digital currency. You need a transfer capability for digital identity or digital verification. I don’t think you need that. What are the absolute minimal requirements for this digital infrastructure? And it’s kind of like standardizing on paper and ink for doing contracts. You know you need paper and you need ink. What should we all standardize on? 8 1/2 by 11 or 8, four and a special type of ink that you need to use or just ink. Can’t be pencil or graphite or crayon and that’s good enough to move on to all the other very use cases. I don’t know what use case is going to take off. I think the important thing for us to do is do the critical thinking to figure out what are the common patterns on underneath there that are going to apply in all of those use cases. And as I said my working hypothesis now is that the issuer, holder, verifier with some ornamentation will do the&nbsp;job.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Considering you your knowledge with the pan Canadian trust framework. You, as a policymaker, what will be your recommendation for policymakers in the European Union which work for example at the European self-sovereign identity framework?</p><p>Tim Bouma: It’s interesting. ’cause I actually had a call on this very same issue. I think policymakers actually have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts and see if they have the right concepts to actually build out a framework and regulation, and that’s what we’ve been doing with Pan Canadian Trust Framework. We’ve recognized that what we tried to do is ingest all the latest concepts, such as issuer, holder, verifier credentials and express them in a way that does not limit them by assumption, like you don’t assume the credential is a document for example, or physical document. Or it’s just manifested only as a physical document. A credentials is a claim that can be independently verifiable and coming up with those concepts. So when you’re actually building up the frameworks and regulations you have a robust and a framework that doesn’t constrain you to a particular technological approach. There may be new technologies that come along that you didn’t even anticipate, but if you’ve done your critical thinking up front, there should be no reason why you can’t adopt that, so I think we’re just at this interesting point right now. I think we have an opportunity to go back to the drawing board. And this is just not an issue of just updating like eIDAS or other regulations and just tweaking a bit. It’s like going back to the drawing board and just say do we have the right policy constructs, which then could become regulatory requirements or legislative requirements. I think that we’re building a next generation of solutions here, and I think it’s really important that that we have the right constructs going forward, and I think we do have good confidence because I’ve looked at my evolution of thinking. You know I really started to get deep in the space in 2016 and really spend a lot of time internalizing the concepts. And it’s just a lot of iterations, but I feel like we’re in a good spot now to actually have a conversation of what these frameworks and regulations might be. It’s not just taking a paper analogue and saying, You know, just let’s do a digital equivalent of that, or a document analogue. We have to think about it differently.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Then I would like to come to my last question. What do you think will be the negative sites or the danger sites of&nbsp;SSI?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Aside from all the hype and blue-sky stuff that has no merit. You see this often with any type of new technology, for example that SSI will solve hunger. It will solve society’s problems. First of all, just making sure it doesn’t get implicated in outrageous claims and that it has nothing that those are deeper problems to solve. So I think, as Gartner calls it, there’s the hype cycle. Of course, when you have the hype cycle, you get the what I call the allergic reaction that people will say, “We’re not going to use it because, you know, it’s got a bad name.” The other thing that we need to be concerned with or cognizant of is that we could build some capabilities that are outside of the states control. And I don’t know how that would manifest itself. All right, the great example is the Bitcoin Blockchain. It basically is a system that just runs on its own and no one can stop it because the way it’s structured, there’s no Corporation or operator that you can actually like take down and the algorithms, proof of work, and that it’s all open and permissionless. People are valuing like whatever is associated with their Bitcoin address because they value it. And there’s basically no way that a state or large actor can actually control that. And also not really bad thing. You know the way I’ve been describing it is that in the Bitcoin context from the economic context, we may have a new macroeconomic factor coming on the horizon that we need to work into our models around a proof of work turning energy into a digital assets and how that plays out, don’t know. So I, I think some of the downsides might be is. There may be some key capabilities that could be built. That could be viewed as illegal or unlawful in certain contexts, and so they they ban it outright. So I think we have to be very careful with this new technology to make sure that we bring the stakeholders along so we can embrace the positive side of the technology. Every technology is a two-edged sword, gunpowder, guns, you know anything? There’s an upside and there’s the downside, right? And I think that’s something that we have to be very cognizant of just like you know. In the mid 90s you had the crypto wars with the clipper chip. You can only have expert with certain key strengths and that caused a reaction and so we have to be careful that we don’t get caught into those same traps of us against the government or government against them. I think we have to figure out how to work this out together.</p>

It's been in browsers for over five years now and adoption is terrible. "Over the past 28 days [...] 99.97% of connections never received a pushed stream that got matched with a request [...] These numbers are exactly the same as in June 2019". Datasette serves redirects with Link: preload headers that cause smart proxies (like Cloudflare) to push the redirected page to the client along with the redirect, but I don't exepect to miss that optimization if it quietly stops working.</p>

  <p>Summary: DIDComm is the messaging protocol that provides utility for DID-based relationships. DIDComm is more than just a way to exchange credentials, it's a protocol layer capable of supporting specialized application protocols for specific workflows. Because of its general nature and inherent support for self-sovereign relationships, DIDComm provides a basis for a self-sovereign internet much more private, enabling, and flexible than the one we've built using Web 2.0 technologies.</p>




<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">DID-based relationships</a> are the foundation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). The exchange of DIDs to form a connection with another party gives both parties a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship that is self-certifying and mutually authenticated</a>. Further, the connection forms a secure messaging channel called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DID Communication or DIDComm</a>. DIDComm messaging is more important than most understand, providing a secure, interoperable, and flexible general messaging <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/overlay-network">overlay</a> for the entire internet. 
</p>

<p>
    Most people familiar with SSI equate DIDComm with verifiable credential exchange, but it's much more than that. Credential exchange is just one of an infinite variety of protocols that can ride on top of the general messaging protocol that DIDComm provides. Comparing DIDComm to the venerable TCP/IP protocol suite does not go too far. Just as numerous application protocols ride on top of TCP/IP, so too can various application protocols take advantage of DIDComm's secure messaging overlay network. The result is more than a secure messaging overlay for the internet, it is the foundation for a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign internet with all that that implies</a>.  
</p>

<a></a>
 DID Communications Protocol 

<p>
    DIDComm messages are exchanged between software <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agents</a> that act on behalf of the people or organizations that control them. I often use the term "wallet" to denote both the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> and agent, but in this post we should distinguish between them. Agents are rule-executing software systems that exchange DIDComm messages. Wallets store DIDs, credentials, personally identifying information, cryptographic keys, and much more. Agents use wallets for some of the things they do, but not all agents need a wallet to function. 
</p>

<p>
    For example, imagine Alice and Bob wish to play a game of TicTacToe using game software that employs DIDComm. Alice's agent and Bob's agent will exchange a series of messages. Alice and Bob may be using a game UI and be unaware of the details but the agents are preparing plaintext JSON messages1 for each move using a TicTacToe protocol that describes the format and appropriateness of a given message based on the current state of the game.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob play TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging (click to enlarge)


<p>
    When Alice places an X in a square in the game interface, her agent looks up Bob's DID Document. She received this when she and Bob exchanged DIDs and it's kept up to date by Bob whenever he rotates the keys underlying the DID2. Alice's agent gets two key pieces of information from the DID Document: the endpoint where messages can be sent to Bob and the public key Bob's agent is using for the Alice:Bob relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice's agent uses Bob's public key to encrypt the JSON message to ensure only Bob's agent can read it and adds authentication using the private key Alice uses in the Alice:Bob relationship. Alice's agent arranges to deliver the message to Bob's agent through whatever means are necessary given his choice of endpoint. DIDComm messages are often routed through other agents under Alice and Bob's control.
</p>

<p>
    Once Bob's agent receives the message, it authenticates that it came from Alice and decrypts it. For a game of TicTacToe, it would ensure the message complies with the TicTacToe protocol given the current state of play. If it complies, the agent would present Alice's move to Bob through the game UI and await his response so that the process could continue. But different protocols could behave differently. For example, not all protocols need to take turns like the TicTacToe protocol does.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Properties 

<p>
    The DIDComm Protocol is designed to be
</p>
 
     Secure 
     Private 
     Interoperable 
     Transport-agnostic 
     Extensible 
 
<p>
    Secure and private follow from the protocol's support for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">heterachical (peer-to-peer) connections and decentralized design</a> along with its use of end-to-end encryption. 
</p>

<p>
    As an interoperable protocol, DIDComm is not dependent on a specific operating system, programming language, vendor, network, hardware platform, or ledger3. While DIDComm was originally developed within the Hyperledger Aries project, it aims to be the common language of any secure, private, self-sovereign interaction on, or off, the internet.  
</p>

<p>
    In addition to being interoperable, DIDComm should be able to make use of any transport mechanism including HTTP(S) 1.x and 2.0, WebSockets, IRC, Bluetooth, NFC, Signal, email, push notifications to mobile devices, Ham radio, multicast, snail mail, and more.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm is an asynchronous, simplex messaging protocol that is designed for extensibility by allowing for protocols to be run on top of it. By using asynchronous, simplex messaging as the lowest common denominator, almost any other interaction pattern can be built on top of DIDComm. Application-layer protocols running on top of DIDComm allow extensibility in a way that also supports interoperability.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Protocols 

<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.  DIDComm and its application protocols are one of the cornerstones of the SSI metasystem, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#metasystem">giving rise to a protocological culture</a> within the metasystem that is open, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">agentic</a>, inclusive, flexible, modular, and universal.
</p>

<p>
    While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. Many others are possible. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm: 
</p>
 
     <a>Connecting with others</a> 
     <a>Requesting and issuing credentials</a> 
     <a>Proving things using credentials</a> 
 
<p>
    There's a protocol for agents to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0031-discover-features/README.md">discover the protocols that another agent supports</a>. And another for one agent to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">make an introduction</a>4 of one agent to another. The TicTacToe game Alice and Bob played above is enabled by a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/tictactoe/README.md">protocol for TicTacToe</a>. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol</a> for picos, which are DIDComm. 
</p>

<p>
    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#roles-participants-parties-and-controllers">tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm</a>. We can imagine a host of DIDComm protocols for all kinds of specialized interactions that people might want to undertake online including the following:
</p>
 
     Delegating 
     Commenting 
     Notifying 
     Buying and selling 
     Negotiating 
     Enacting and enforcing contracts 
     Putting things in escrow (and taking them out again) 
     Transferring ownership 
     Scheduling 
     Auditing 
     Reporting errors 
 
<p>
    As you can see from this partial list, DIDComm is not just a secure, private way to connect and exchange credentials. Rather DIDComm is a foundation protocol that provides a secure and private overlay to the internet for carrying out almost any online workflow. Consequently, agents are more than the name "wallet" would imply, although that's a convenient shorthand for the common uses of DIDComm today. 
</p>

<a></a>
 A Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>Because of the self-sovereign nature of agents and the flexibility and interoperable characteristics they gain from DIDComm, they form the basis for new, more empowering internet. While self-sovereign identity is the current focus of DIDComm, its capabilities exceed what many think of as "identity." When you combine the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">vast landscape of potential verifiable credentials</a> with DIDComm's ability to create custom message-based workflows to support very specific interactions, it's easy to imagine that the DIDComm protocol and the heterarchical network of agents it enables will have an impact as large as the web, perhaps the internet itself.
</p>

 

 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     DIDComm messages do not strictly have to be formatted as JSON. 
     Alice's agent can verify that it has the right DID Document and the most recent key by requesting a copy of Bob's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">key event log</a> (called delta's for peer DIDs) and validating it. This is the basis for saying peer DIDs are self certifying. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/10/fuse_with_two_owners.shtml">Fuse with Two Owners</a> shows an introduction protocol for picos I used in building Fuse in 2014 before picos used DIDComm. I'd like to revisit this as a way of building introductions into picos using a DIDComm protocol.

  <p>Summary:      An SSI wallet provides a place for people to stand in the digital realm. Using the wallet, people can operationalize their digital relationships as peers with others online. The result is better, more authentic, digital relationships, more flexible online interactions, and the preservation of human freedom, privacy, and dignity.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    Recently, I've been making the case for self-sovereign identity and why it is the correct architecture for online identity systems.
</p>

 
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a>, I discuss why identity systems are really built to manage relationships rather than identities. I also show how the architecture of the identity system affects the three important properties relationships must have to function effectively: integrity, lifespan, and utility.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> I introduced a classification scheme that broadly categorized identity systems into one of three broad architectures: administrative, algorithmic, or autonomic.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>, I discuss how the architecture of an identity system affects the authenticity of the relationships it manages. 
 

<p>
   This post focuses how people can operationalize the relationships they are party to and become full fledged participants online. Last week, Doc Searls posted <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">What SSI Needs</a> where he recalls how the graphical web browser was the catalyst for making the web real. Free (in both the beer and freedom senses) and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>, browsers provided the spark that gave rise to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">generative</a> qualities that ignited an explosion of innovation.  Doc goes on to posit that the SSI equivalent of the web browser is what we have <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">called a "wallet"</a> since it holds, analogously to your physical wallet, credentials.
</p>

<p>
    The SSI wallet Doc is discussing is the tool people use to operationalize their digital relationships. I created the following picture to help illustrate how the wallet fulfills that purpose.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in Sovrin Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This figure shows the relationships and interactions in SSI networks enabled by the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> protocols. The most complete example of these protocols in production is the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the figure, Alice has an SSI wallet1. She uses the wallet to manage her relationships with Bob and Carol as well as a host of organizations. Bob and Carol also have wallets. They have a relationship with each other and Carol has a relationship with Bravo Corp, just as Alice does2.  These relationships are enabled by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a> in the form of peer DIDs (blue arrows).  The SSI wallet each participant uses provides a consistent user experience, like the browser did for the Web. People using wallets don't see the DIDs (identifiers) but rather the connections they have to other people, organizations, and things. 
</p>

<p>
    These autonomic relationships are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-certifying</a> meaning they don't rely on any third party for their trust basis. They are also mutually authenticating: each of the parties in the relationship can authenticate the other. Further, these relationships create a secure communications channel using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm protocol</a>. Because of the built-in mutual authentication, DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml"> batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication. As a result, Alice has trustworthy communication channels with everyone with whom she has a peer DID relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, as mentioned, also has a relationship with various organizations. One of them, Attester Org, has issued a verifiable credential to Alice. They issued the credential (green arrows) using the Aries credential exchange protocol that runs on top of the DIDComm-based communication channel enabled by the peer DID relationship Alice has with Attester. The credential they issue is founded on the credential definition and public DID (an algorithmic identifier) that Attester Org wrote to the ledger.
</p>

<p>
    When Alice later needs to prove something (e.g. her address) to Certiphi Corp, she presents the proof over the DIDComm protocol, again enabled by the peer DID relationship she has with Certiphi Corp. Certiphi is able to validate the fidelity of the credential by reading the credential definition from the ledger, retrieving Attester Org's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attester Org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, Certiphi can use cryptography to know that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked.
</p>

<p>
    This diagram has elements of each architectural style described <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>.
</p>

 
     Alice has relationships with five different entities: her friends Bob and Carol as well as three different organizations. These relationships are based on autonomic identifiers in the form of peer DIDs. All of the organizations use enterprise wallets to manage autonomic relationships4.  

   As a credential issuer, Attester Org has an algorithmic identifier in the form of a public DID that has been recorded on the ledger. The use of  algorithmic identifiers on a ledger3 allows public discovery of the credential definition and the public DID by Certiphi Corp when it validates the credential. The use of a ledger for this purpose is not optional unless we give up the loose coupling it provides. Loose coupling provides scalability, flexibility, and isolation. Isolation is critical to the privacy protections that verifiable credential exchange via Aries promises.  

   Each company will keep track of attributes and other properties they need for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">relationship to provide the needed utility</a>. These are administrative systems since they are administered by the organization for their own purpose and their root of trust is a database managed by the organization. The difference between these administrative systems and those common in online identity today is that only the organization is depending on them. People have their own autonomic root of trust in the key event log that supports their wallet.  
 

<p>
    Alice's SSI wallet allows her to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. Alice's wallet is also the place where specific, protocol-enabled interactions like credential exchange happen. The wallet is flexible tool that Alice uses to manage her digital life. 
</p>

<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">prevented from acting by their anemic natures</a>. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online</a>. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become digitally embodied to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.
</p>

 

<a></a>
 notes 

 
     Alice's SSI wallet is like other wallets she has on her phone with several important differences. First, it is enabled by open protocols and second, it is entirely under her control. I'm using the term "wallet" fairly loosely here to denote not only the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> but also the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agent</a> necessary for the interactions in an SSI ecosystem. For purposes of this post, delineating them isn't important. In particular, Alice may not be aware of the agent, but she will know about her wallet and see it as the tool she uses.  
     Note that Bob doesn't have a relationship with any of the organizations shown. Each participant has the set of relationships they choose to have to meet their differing circumstances and needs. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     Enterprise wallets speak the same protocols as the wallets people use, but are adapted to the increased scale an enterprise would likely need and are designed to be integrated with the enterprise's other administrative systems.

The show is over. Biden won. Trump lost.</p>
<p>Sure, there is more to be said, details to argue. But the main story—Biden vs. Trump, the 2020 Presidential Election, is over. So is the Trump presidency, now in the lame duck stage.</p>
<p>We’re in the epilogue now.</p>
<p>There are many stories within and behind the story, but this was the big one, and it had to end. Enough refs calling it made the ending official. President Trump will continue to fight, but the outcome won’t change. Biden will be the next president. The story of the Trump presidency will end with Biden’s inauguration.</p>
<p>The story of the Biden presidency began last night. Attempts by Trump to keep the story of his own presidency going will be written in the epilogue, heard in the coda, the outro, the postlude.</p>
<p>Fox News, which had been the Trump administration’s house organ, concluded the story when it declared Biden the winner and moved on to covering him as the next president.</p>
<p>This is how stories go.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that the story was right in every factual sense. Stories aren’t.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has covered much and has been covered as well, I can vouch for the inevitability of inaccuracy, of overlooked details, of patches, approximations, compressions, misquotes and summaries that are more true to story, arc, flow and narrative than to all the facts involved, or the truths that might be told.</p>
<p>Stories have loose ends, and big stories like this one have lots of them. But they are ends. And The End is here.</p>
<p>We are also at the beginning of something new that isn’t a story, and does not comport with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">the imperatives of journalism</a>: of storytelling, of narrative, of characters with problems struggling toward resolutions.</p>
<p>What’s new is the ground on which all the figures in every story now stand. That ground is digital. Decades old at most, it will be with us for centuries or millennia. Arriving on digital ground is as profound a turn in the history of our species on Earth as the one our distant ancestors faced when they waddled out of the sea and grew lungs to replace their gills.</p>
<p>We live in the digital world now now, in addition to the physical one where I am typing and you are reading, as embodied beings.</p>
<p>In this world we are not just bodies. We are something and somewhere else, in a place that isn’t a place: one without distance or gravity, where the only preposition that applies without stretch or irony is&nbsp;with. (Because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/prepositions-list.htm">the others</a>—over, under, beside, around, though, within, upon, etc.—pertain too fully to positions and relationships in the physical world.)</p>
<p>Because the digital world is ground and not figure (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)">here’s the difference</a>), it is as hard for us to make full sense of being there as it was for the first fish to do the same with ocean or for our amphibian grandparents to make sense of land. (For some help with this, dig David Foster Wallace’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water">This is water</a>.)</p>
<p>The challenge of understanding digital life will likely not figure in the story of Joe Biden’s presidency. But nothing is more important than the ground under everything. And this ground is the same as the one without which we would not have had an Obama or a Trump presidency. It will at least help to think about that.</p>

  <p>Natalie and I decided to escape San Francisco for election week, and have been holed up in Fort Bragg on the Northern California coast. I've mostly been on vacation, but I did find time to make some significant changes to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>. Plus notes on an exciting Git scraping project.</p>
 Better search in the sqlite-utils 3.0 alpha 
<p>I practice <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=cus2&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=semver">semantic versioning</a> with sqlite-utils, which means it only gets a major version bump if I break backwards compatibility in some way.</p>
<p>My goal is to avoid breaking backwards compatibility as much as possible, and I was proud to have made it all the way to <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-23">version 2.23</a> representing 23 new feature releases since the 2.0 release without breaking any documented features!</p>
<p>Sadly this run has come to an end: I realized that the <code>table.search()</code> method was poorly designed, and I also needed to grab back the <code>-c</code> command-line option (a shortcut for <code>--csv</code> output) to be used for another purpose.</p>
<p>The chances that either of these changes will break anyone are pretty small, but semantic versioning dictates a major version bump so here we are.</p>
<p>I shipped a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/3.0a0">3.0 alpha</a> today, which should hopefully become a stable release very shortly (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/milestone/4">milestone here</a>).</p>
<p>The big new feature is <code>sqlite-utils search</code> - a command-line tool for executing searches against a full-text search enabled table:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils search 24ways-fts4.db articles maps -c title
[{"rowid": 163, "title": "Get To Grips with Slippy Maps", "rank": -10.028754920576421},
 {"rowid": 220, "title": "Finding Your Way with Static Maps", "rank": -9.952534352591737},
 {"rowid": 27, "title": "Putting Design on the Map", "rank": -5.667327088267961},
 {"rowid": 168, "title": "Unobtrusively Mapping Microformats with jQuery", "rank": -4.662224207228984},
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#cli-search">full documentation</a> for the new command.</p>
<p>Notably, this command works against both FTS4 and FTS5 tables in SQLite - despite FTS4 not shipping with a built-in ranking function. I'm using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4">sqlite-fts4</a> package for this, which I described back in January 2019 in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/">Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite</a>.</p>
 Git scraping to predict the election 
<p>It's not quite over yet but the end is in sight, and one of the best tools to track the late arriving vote counts is <a href="https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html">this Election 2020 results site</a> built by Alex Gaynor and a growing cohort of contributors.</p>
<p>The site is a beautiful example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> in action, and I'm thrilled that it links to my article in the README!</p>
<p>Take a look <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper">at the repo</a> to see how it works. Short version: this <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/01060c06c35442c0654e18b84e22394ef3ef5a9c/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">GitHub Action workflow</a> grabs the latest snapshot of this <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/votes-remaining-page/national/president.json">undocumented New York Times JSON API</a> once every five minutes and commits it to the repository. It then runs <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/01060c06c35442c0654e18b84e22394ef3ef5a9c/print-battleground-state-changes">this Python script</a> which iterates through the Git history and generates an HTML summary showing the different batches of new votes that were reported and their impact on the overall race.</p>
<p>The resulting report is published to GitHub pages - resulting in a site that can handle a great deal of traffic and is updated entirely by code running in scheduled actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a perfect use-case for Git scraping: it takes a JSON endpoint that represents the current state of the world and turns it into a sequence of historic snapshots, then uses those snapshots to build a unique and useful new source of information to help people understand what's going on.</p>

My grandmother collected snails and cooked them out of sight of the Japanese guards. Around them, people were tortured and killed on a daily basis.</p><p>On paper, the Allies won the war. For my family, it continued to rage.</p><p>To this day, trauma has rippled from generation to generation. That simple act of ripping my aunts from their lives mid-education has led to cycles of poverty and misery that continue to this day. Some of my family, like my father, were able to break the cycle. Some were not. The recent history of my family runs the gamut from stability to crime and heroin addiction. At every end of the spectrum, a culture of anxiety - you've got to be safe; get an education because they can't take that away from you - underpinned every choice.</p><p>Joe Biden has won the Presidency. The cruelest policies of the Trump administration will likely come to an end; we will need to be vigilant and apply pressure so that the long tail of cruelty is replaced by a dogma of inclusion and care.</p><p>For some families, the effects of the Trump administration will be felt not just for years, but for generations. Family separation, willful mismanagement of the pandemic, and sanctioned police brutality have created centers of trauma that are difficult to escape from. These are Trump's victims. For them, regardless of the result of this election, Trump won.</p><p>They will need help to escape the cycle. We owe it to them because we did this to them. Regardless of their nationality or context, they are our responsibility.</p><p>The real work begins now. It starts by setting things right. And then we start to build the society we actually want.</p>

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating.

We will see you all at&nbsp;IIW32!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/highlights-of-iiw31-c36883cb70db">Highlights of #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For many decades, one of the landmark radio stations in Washington, DC was WMAL-AM (now re-branded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN">WSPN</a>), at 630 on (what in pre-digital times we called) the dial. As AM listening faded, so did WMAL, which moved its talk format to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAL-FM">105.9 FM</a> in Woodbridge and its signal to a less ideal location, far out to the northwest of town.</p>
<p>They made the latter move because the 75 acres of land under the station’s four towers in Bethesda had become far more valuable than the signal. So, like many other station owners with valuable real estate under legacy transmitter sites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_Media">Cumulus Media</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insideradio.com/free/cumulus-closes-74-million-sale-of-maryland-tower-site/article_9f233cbc-b70a-11ea-af89-eb5e61f8fbba.html#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20it%20struck%20a%20%2475%20million,%2474.1%20million%2C%20including%20%245%20million%20paid%20in%202019.">sold sold the old site for $74 million</a>. Nice haul.</p>
<p>I’ve written at some length about this&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/02/10/will-wmal-survive-losing-its-transmitter/">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/11/01/wmal630am-2-0/">here</a> in 2015, and&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/01/05/the-slow-sidelining-of-over-the-air-radio/">here in 2016</a>. I’ve also covered the whole topic of radio and its decline&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I only bring the whole mess up today because it’s a five-year story that ended this morning, when WMAL’s towers were demolished. The Washington Post wrote about it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/demolition-of-bethesda-radio-towers-will-take-a-piece-of-history-rare-open-space/2020/11/02/238b4bc4-1945-11eb-aeec-b93bcc29a01b_story.html">here</a>, and provided the video from which I pulled the screen-grab above.&nbsp;<a href="http://Pedestrians.org" title="http://Pedestrians. ">Pedestrians.org</a> also has a much more complete video on YouTube, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>. WRC-TV, channel 4, has a chopper view (best I’ve seen yet) <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/watch-400-foot-towers-in-maryland-demolished-with-explosives/2463073/?fbclid=IwAR1uLKwtW06wQVlgamKybJLSIeQI6RHfh8GEyLemi-kbwPf2E13BeA0ROmg">here</a>. Spake the&nbsp;Post,</p>
<blockquote><p>When the four orange and white steel towers first soared over Bethesda in 1941, they stood in a field surrounded by sparse suburbs emerging just north of where the Capital Beltway didn’t yet exist. Reaching 400 feet, they beamed the voices of WMAL 630 AM talk radio across the nation’s capital for 77 years.</p>
<p>As the area grew, the 75 acres of open land surrounding the towers became a de facto park for runners, dog owners and generations of teenagers who recall sneaking smokes and beer at “field parties.”</p>
<p>Shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday, the towers came down in four quick controlled explosions to make way for a new subdivision of 309 homes, taking with them a remarkably large piece of privately owned — but publicly accessible — green space. The developer, Toll Brothers, said construction is scheduled to begin in 2021.</p>
<p>Local radio buffs say the Washington region will lose a piece of history. Residents say they’ll lose a public play space that close-in suburbs have too little of.</p></blockquote>
<p>After seeing those towers fall, I posted this to a private discussion among broadcast engineers (a role I once played, briefly and inexpertly, many years ago):</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s like watching a public execution.</p>
<p>I’m sure that’s how many of who have spent our lives looking at and maintaining these things feel at a sight like this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that the AM band is a century old, and that nearly all listening today is to other media. We know how these towers make waves that spread like ripples across the land and echo off invisible mirrors in the night sky. We know from experience how the inverse square law works, how nulls and lobes are formed, how oceans and prairie soils make small signals large and how rocky mountains and crappy soils are like mud to a strong signal’s wheels. We know how and why it is good to know these things, because we can see an invisible world where other people only hear songs, talk and noise.</p>
<p>We also know that, in time, all these towers are going away, or repurposed to hold up antennas sending and receiving radio frequencies better suited for carrying data.</p>
<p>We know that everything ends, and in that respect AM radio is no different than any other medium.</p>
<p>What matters isn’t whether it ends with a bang (such as here with WMAL’s classic towers) or with a whimper (as with so many other stations going dark or shrinking away in lesser facilities). It’s that there’s still some good work and fun in the time this old friend still has left.</p></blockquote>

<p>Travel always has its ups and downs but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced both at the same time as intensely as right now.</p>
<p>I’m at Moonstone Beach in Cambria, just south of San Simeon, in a rented camper van. After a walk on the beach I hop in, reverse, clip a rock, blow a tire, and come to rest alongside the guard rail facing the ocean.</p>
<p>I call roadside assistance; they can deliver a tire but not until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I may be about to win the road trip breakdown lottery. I’m snuggled in my two-sleeping-bag nest on the air mattress in the back of the van, on a bluff about 25 feet above the beach, with the van’s big side door open, watching and hearing the tide roll in.</p>
<p>The worst and best parts of my trip are happening at the same time. I screwed up, am stuck, cannot go anywhere. But of all the places I could have been stuck on this trip, I’m stuck in the place I most want to be.</p>
<p>The sign says the gate closes at 6, but nobody has shown up by 7 when everyone else is gone. I can’t reach the authorities. This would be the campsite of my dreams if I’m allowed to stay.</p>
<p>The suspense is killing me. </p>
<p>Eventually a cop shows up, agrees that I can’t go anywhere, and gives me permission to stay for the night. I win the lottery! Nobody ever gets to stay here overnight. But here I am.</p>
<p>We’re all stuck in many ways for many reasons. A road trip during the final week before the election seemed like a way to silence the demons. Roaming around the state didn’t really help. But this night on the bluff over Moonstone Beach most certainly will.</p>
<p>In the light of the full moon, the crests of the waves are sometimes curls of silver, sometimes wraiths of foam that drift slowly south, continually morphing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how we’re all going to get through this winter. I don’t know what comes next. I don’t even have a plan for tomorrow. But I am so grateful to be here now.</p>

time wandering around <a href="https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/the-pool" title="Central Park Conservancy: The Pool">The Pool</a> yesterday. Lots of folks were about, taking in
the views, shooting photos. The spectacular foliage photographed best backlit

  <p>I shipped <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-51">Datasette 0.51</a> today, with a new visual design, plugin hooks for adding navigation options, better handling of binary data, URL building utility methods and better support for running Datasette behind a proxy. It's a lot of stuff! Here are the annotated release notes.</p>
 New visual design 
<blockquote>
<p>Datasette is no longer white and grey with blue and purple links! <a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie Downe</a> has been working on a visual refresh, the first iteration of which is included in this release. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1056">#1056</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's about time Datasette grew beyond its clearly-designed-by-a-mostly-backend-engineer roots. Natalie has been helping me start adding some visual polish: we've started with an update to the colour scheme and will be continuing to iterate on the visual design as the project evolves towards the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>The new design makes the navigation bar much more obvious, which is important for this release since the new navigation menu (tucked away behind a three-bar icon) is a key new feature.</p>
<p></p>
 Plugins can now add links within Datasette 
<blockquote>
<p>A number of existing Datasette plugins add new pages to the Datasette interface, providig tools for things like <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">uploading CSVs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema">editing table schemas</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-configure-fts">configuring full-text search</a>.</p>
<p>Plugins like this can now link to themselves from other parts of Datasette interface. The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-menu-links">menu_links(datasette, actor)</a> hook (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1064">#1064</a>) lets plugins add links to Datasette's new top-right application menu, and the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-table-actions">table_actions(datasette, actor, database, table)</a> hook (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1066">#1066</a>) adds links to a new "table actions" menu on the table page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feature has been a long time coming. I've been writing an increasing number of plugins that add new pages to Datasette, and so far the main way of using them has been to memorise and type in their URLs!</p>
<p>The new navigation menu (which only displays if it has something in it) provides a global location to add new links. I've already released several plugin updates that take advantage of this.</p>
<p>The new "table actions" menu imitates Datasette's existing column header menu icon - it's a cog. Clicking it opens a menu of actions relating to the current table.</p>
<p>Want to see a demo?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demo at <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/">latest.datasette.io</a> now includes some example plugins. To see the new table actions menu first <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/login-as-root">sign into that demo as root</a> and then visit the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">facetable</a> table to see the new cog icon menu at the top of the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an animated GIF demo showing the new menus in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Binary data 
<blockquote>
<p>SQLite tables can contain binary data in <code>BLOB</code> columns. Datasette now provides links for users to download this data directly from Datasette, and uses those links to make binary data available from CSV exports. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/binary_data.html#binary">Binary data</a> for more details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1036">#1036</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1034">#1034</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spent a ton of time on this over the past few weeks. The initial impetus was a realization that Datasette CSV exports included ugly Python <code>b'\x15\x1c\x02\xc7\xad\x05\xfe'</code> strings, which felt like the worst possible way to display binary in a CSV file, out of universally bad options.</p>
<p>Datasette's main interface punted on binary entirely - it would show a <code>&lt;Binary data: 7 bytes&gt;</code> label which didn't help much either.</p>
<p>The only way to get at binary data stored in a Datasette instance was to request the JSON version and then manually decode the Base-64 value within it!</p>
<p>This is now fixed: binary columns can be downloaded directly to your computer, using a new <code>.blob</code> output renderer. The approach is described on <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/binary_data.html#binary">this new page in the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Security was a major consideration when building this feature. Allowing the download of arbitrary byte payloads from a web server is dangerous business: it can easily result in XSS holes where HTML with dangerous <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> content can end up hosted on the primary domain.</p>
<p>After some research, I decided to serve up binary content for download using the following headings:</p>
 <code>content-type: application/binary
x-content-type-options: nosniff
content-disposition: attachment; filename="data-f30889.blob"
</code> 
<p><code>application/binary</code> is a safer Content-Type option than the more common <code>application/octet-stream</code>, according to Michal Zalewski's renowned web application security book The Tangled Web (<a href="https://neexee.github.io/posts-en/the-tangled-web/">quoted here</a>)</p>
<p><code>x-content-type-options: nosniff</code> disables the XSS-tastic content sniffing feature in older versions of Internet Explorer, where IE would helpfully guess that you intended to serve HTML based on the first few bytes of the response.</p>
<p>The <code>content-disposition: attachment</code> header causes the browser to show a "download this file" dialog, using the suggested filename.</p>
<p>If you know of a reason that this isn't secure enough, please <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw">let me know</a>!</p>
 URL building 
<blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-urls">datasette.urls</a> family of methods can be used to generate URLs to key pages within the Datasette interface, both within custom templates and Datasette plugins. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html#writing-plugins-building-urls">Building URLs within plugins</a> for more details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/904">#904</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/config.html#config-base-url">base_url</a> configuration setting was the forcing factor around this piece of work.</p>
<p>It allows you to configure Datasette to serve content starting at a path other than <code>/</code> - for example:</p>
 <code>datasette --config base_url:/path-to-datasette/
</code> 
<p>This will serve all Datasette pages at locations starting with <code>/path-to-datasette/</code>.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? It's useful if you are proxying traffic to Datasette from within the URL hierarchy of an existing website.</p>
<p>The feature didn't work properly, and enough people care about it that I had a steady stream of bug reports. For 0.51 I gathered them all into a single giant <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1023">tracking issue</a> and worked through them all one by one.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that the key challenge was building URLs within Datasette - not just within HTML template pages, but also for things like HTTP redirects.</p>
<p>Datasette itself needed to generate URLs that took the <code>base_url</code> setting into account, but so do Datasette plugins. So I built <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-urls">a new datasette.urls</a> collection of helper methods and made them part of the documented internals API for plugins. The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html#building-urls-within-plugins">Building URLs within plugins</a> documentation shows how these should be used.</p>
<p>I also added documentation on <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-proxy">Running Datasette behind a proxy</a> with example configs (tested on my laptop) for both nginx and Apache.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-client">datasette.client</a> mechanism from Datasette 0.50 allows plugins to make calls to Datasette's internal JSON API without the overhead of an HTTP request. This is another place where plugins need to be able to construct valid URLs to internal Datasette pages.</p>
<p>I added this example to the documentation showing how the two features can work together:</p>
 table_json = (
    await datasette.client.get(
        datasette.urls.table("fixtures", "facetable", format="json")
    )
).json() 
<p>One final weird detail on this: Datasette now has various methods that automatically add the <code>base_url</code> prefix to a URL. I got worried about what would happen if these were applied more than once (as above, where <code>datasette.urls.table()</code> applies the prefix so does <code>datasette.client.get()</code>).</p>
<p>I fixed this using the same trick that Django and Jinja use to avoid appliying auto-escaping twice to content that will be displayed in HTML: the <code>datasette.urls</code> methods actually return a <code>PrefixedUrlString</code> object which is a subclass of <code>str</code> that knows that the prefix has been applied! Code for that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette/utils/__init__.py#L1015">lives here</a>.</p>
 Smaller changes 
<p>A few highlights from the "smaller changes" in Datasette 0.51:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Wide tables shown within Datasette now scroll horizontally (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/998">#998</a>). This is achieved using a new <code>&lt;div class="table-wrapper"&gt;</code> element which may impact the implementation of some plugins (for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/commit/fcb4abbe7df9071c5ab57defd39147de7145b34e">this change to datasette-cluster-map</a>). 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a big improvement: if your database table is too wide, it now scrolls horizontally on the page (rather than blowing the entire page out to a wider width). You can see that in action on the <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants">global-power-plants demo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions-debug-menu">debug-menu</a> permission. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1068">#1068</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>If you are signed in as <code>root</code> the new navigation menu links to a whole plethora of previously-undiscoverable Datasette debugging tools. This new permission controls the display of those items.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>Link:</code> HTTP header pagination. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1014">#1014</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by GitHub and WordPress, which both use the HTTP <code>Link</code> header in this way. It's an optional extra though: Datasette will always offer in-JSON pagination information.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Edit SQL button on canned queries, (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">#1019</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Suggested by Jacob Fenton <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">in this issue</a>. The implementation had quite a few edge cases since there are certain categories of canned query that can't be executed as custom SQL by the user. See the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019#issuecomment-708128286">issue comments</a> for details and a demo.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>--load-extension=spatialite</code> shortcut. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1028">#1028</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/136">a similar feature</a> in <code>sqlite-utils</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette -o</code> option now opens the most relevant page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/976">#976</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fun little feature. If your Datasette only loads a single database, and that database only has a single table (common if you've just run a single CSV import) then running this will open your browser directly to that table page:</p>
 <code>datasette data.db -o
</code> 
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette --cors</code> option now enables access to <code>/database.db</code> downloads. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1057">#1057</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This was inspired by Mike Bostock's <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/sqlite">Observable Notebook</a> that uses the Emscripten-compiled <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">JavaScript version</a> of SQLite to run queries against SQLite database files.</p>
<p>It turned out you couldn't use that notebook against SQLite files hosted in Datasette because they weren't covered by Datasette's CORS option. Now they are!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Recommendations for plugin authors, inspired by a question <a href="https://twitter.com/kanedr/status/1320653434895347713">from David Kane</a> on Twitter. David has been building <a href="https://github.com/drkane/datasette-reconcile">datasette-reconcile</a>, a Datasette plugin that offers a reconciliation API endpoint that can be used with <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>. What a brilliant idea!</p>
 datasette-edit-templates (almost) 
<p>Inspired by a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/obra">Jesse Vincent</a>, I also spent some time experimenting with the idea of a plugin that can load and edit templates from the database - which would turn a personal Datasette into a really fun interface hacking environment. I nearly got this working, and even shipped a preview of a <code>load_template()</code> plugin hook in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.51a2">Datasette 0.51a2</a> alpha... before crashing into a road block when I realized that it also needed to work with Jinja's <code>{% extends %}</code> and <code>{% include %}</code> template tags and loaders for those <a href="https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1304">don't currenty support async functions</a>.</p>
<p>In exploring this I also realized that my <code>load_template()</code> plugin hook wasn't actually necessary - if I'm going to solve this problem with Jinja loaders I can do so using the existing <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#prepare-jinja2-environment-env">prepare_jinja2_environment(env)</a> hook.</p>
<p>My not-yet-functional prototype for this is caled <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-templates">datasette-edit-templates</a>. I'm pretty confident I can get it working against the old plugin hook with a little more work.</p>
 Other weeknotes 
<p>Most of my time this week was spent on Datasette 0.51 - but I did find a little bit of time for other projects.</p>
<p>I finished recording my talk for PyCon Argentina. It will air on November 20th.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/2.23">sqlite-utils 2.23</a> is out, with a <code>.m2m()</code> bug fix from Adam Wolf and the new ability to display progress bars when importing TSV and CSV files.</p>

<p>
 Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail. For my previous build, I used Gatsby to build a static site which I hosted on Netlify. The dynamic content of the site was stored in an instance of Ghost which was then pulled in at build-time.
</p>
<p>
 Overall, I was quite disappointed with Gatsby. I found the framework to be quite over-engineered. At one point, I found myself trying to resize a photo or something and it required some (to me at least) very complex configuration and some fancy graphQL query just to get the image to load. Another issue I have is with the offline plugin. Gatsby uses service workers to cache your entire site offline which can then be served by a service worker in case your users have spotty internet. Or no internet. The problem comes with removing this service worker once you move away from the framework. I needed to do quite a bit of research to figure out how to delete the service worker once I moved over to the new site since Gatsby chooses to use caching very aggressively which is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
 I understand why Gatsby makes these choices. Their goal is to make websites load insanely fast which I think they accomplish at a great cost of complexity. And they work hard to ensure that Gatsby sites score highly on the Google Lighthouse test. I have two issues with these goals. First, I'm not sure pursuing a high score on Lighthouse is a good goal to optimize for. Making a website load quickly is important, but Lighthouse will ding you for things using a particular Javascript library instead of their recommended smaller library. This is a game of cat-and-mouse which has little benefit beyond speeding up your website (which is important). Second, the amount of complexity that Gatsby introduces will likely slow down the development of your site and stifle your creativity. I can't comment on the experience of using Gatsby in the context of a larger team, but for me I know it led to making fewer improvements to the site because of the complexity.
</p>
<p>
 As for Ghost as a headless CMS – I think there are some limitations there. Overall, Ghost is a great platform. It's reliable and usable and has a good writing experience. I do think that their push into the JAMStack fad was mostly a marketing play since some limitations were never addressed even after several years. I would definitely use Ghost again, just not as a headless CMS. I would use it how it was primarily designed to be used.
</p>
<p>
 So why did I choose Django and Wagtail? Well, I've been using Django on and off for a long time. Probably 7 years at this point. The framework is reliable and seriously productive. Wagtail is built as a Django "app" so it's very familiar to me and it's very powerful. Overall, I'm content with the developer experience so far. I think the admin interface that is used to publish content could use some work. It's functional but frankly it's pretty ugly. Especially compared to something like Statamic which has been getting some attention lately.
</p>
<p>
 It's been a while since I've run my blog with server-rendered pages with dynamic content as opposed to a static site published to a CDN. I think the fact that I can log into a dashboard and publish content is so much more ergonomic from a writing and publishing perspective that I'm more likely to write more. Compared to the process of building a static site and deploying an update, it's quite nice. The downside, obviously, is that I need to worry again about load on the site and downtime during traffic spikes. I'm hopeful that this is something that I can avoid by using caching and a CDN. The site now has virtually no javascript. Compared to Gatsby this is a big change. We'll see how it turns out but my theory is that I should be able to achieve similar speeds (good enough anyway) using some clever caching and a CDN. Browsers are pretty good at rendering plain HTML after all.

For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After a cup of menstrual blood went flying across the Senate floor, I had assumed 2019 would be California’s wildest legislative session for a while. Covid-19 proved me unfortunately wrong. The Legislative process, calendar and agenda was quickly thrown into the dumpster fire of March and everyone turned back to the white&nbsp;board.</p><p>When the Legislature returned from its two-month long “stay at home” recess in May, it passed a stripped-down state budget which reflected lower revenues given the pandemic-induced recession. They then began prioritizing and shelving hundreds of bills that would no longer make the cut in the truncated legislative calendar. Faced with less time to hold hearings and less money to spend on new proposals, legislators shelved an estimated three-quarters of the bills introduced at the beginning of the two-year&nbsp;session.</p><p>Here’s what happened for BAC’s blockchain/crypto sponsored bills:</p><p>AB 953 (Ting, San Francisco), which would have allowed state and local taxes to be paid with stablecoins, was sadly withdrawn, lacking a clear Covid-19&nbsp;nexus.</p><p>AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next&nbsp;year.</p><p>AB 2150 (Calderon, Whittier) spun through several dizzying iterations. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition worked closely with Assemblymember Calderon’s office to suggest amended language that would have directed the Department of Business Oversight to study the applicability of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce’s Proposal to an intrastate safe harbor. An idea that in previous years seemed far fetched suddenly had political legs and was well received by the agency and several committees. It died in the Senate Appropriations Committee along with nearly everything else that had a significant price tag or wasn’t urgently related to the pandemic.</p><p>Fruitful discussions with the DBO about crypto regulation were well timed, however. Given the microscope on consumer protections due to the economic distress caused by the pandemic, the agency received a $19.2 million allocation and a new name: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (CDFPI- much worse acronym&nbsp;imo).</p><p>HERE’S THE PART YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO:</p><p>With this new agency budget/mission, comes a very likely change in the way cryptocurrency is regulated in <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1864">CA. AB 1864</a> does a few&nbsp;things:</p>  Establishes a Financial Technology Innovation Office based in San Francisco  Requires the department to promulgate rules regarding registration requirements  Charges this department with regulating currently unregulated financial services including issuers of stored value or such&nbsp;business  <p>This marks a departure from the agency’s previous approach. Virtual currency businesses did not have any separate registration requirements or the need to apply for a money transmitter license. BAC participated in stakeholder calls this summer about the agency’s expansion and we are continuing to engage with the agency about how these registration requirements will be created. Cryptocurrency businesses need to understand that the agency has been given the authority to create these standards without going back to the legislature, so early engagement is&nbsp;key.</p><p>Interested in joining our coalition and having a seat at the table? Contact: <a href="mailto:ally@blockadvocacy.org">ally@blockadvocacy.org</a></p><p>BAC has previously facilitated educational workshops with the Department of Business Oversight and hosted roundtables with Gov. Newsom, Treasurer Ma and the Legislature to build an understanding of the importance of the blockchain industry in&nbsp;CA.</p>

<p>How to enable the Enterprise to move from existing centralized or federated identity access management systems to a decentralized model was the topic in the 15th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup*. &nbsp;In both the private and public sector the capital investments in IAMs runs into the billions of dollars, for decentralized identity models to make serious inroads in this sector providing a of roadmap or transition journey that both educates and enables the enterprise to make the move is required. </p><p>In our 15th event we discussed the routes &nbsp;being taken by Raonsecure and IdRamp. &nbsp;Both Raonsecure and IdRamp are being successful in making the introduction of &nbsp;decentralized identity concepts to the market and helping their customers start on this transition journey. </p><p>Alex David (Senior Manager, Raonsecure) started with brief update on the forces driving decentralized identifiers in the Korean market and then presented Raonsecure’s Omnione product. &nbsp;In keeping with the theme on the ‘bridging’ to bring DIDs and VCs into the market Alex went through six different pilots, &nbsp;and proof of concept solutions that Omnione has implemented in the Korean market. &nbsp;These include working with the Korean Military Manpower Association on DID based authentication and issuing of verifiable credentials (VCs) to Korean veterans to the use of DIDs for driverless car identification in an autonomous vehicle pilot in Sejong, Korea. </p><p>Mike Vesey (CEO, IdRamp) introduced IdRamp and discussed their core objective of bringing DIDs and VCs into the enterprise market by creating a ’non-frightening’ educational path to adoption of decentralized identity. &nbsp;IdRamp is a session based transactional gateway (no logging) to all things identity, providing common service delivery and compliance and consent management across identity platforms. &nbsp;They are not an identity service provider but resemble more closely as a digital notary in the generation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. &nbsp;The service integration capability of IdRamp was demonstrated with the use of employee issued verifiable credentials to authenticate to a enterprise service (in this case a Zoom session login). &nbsp; </p><p>Finally, the seed of an upcoming event was planted. &nbsp;As with any new technology market breaking through the ’noise’ of everyday life is very difficult. &nbsp;This is no different for DIDs and VCs. &nbsp;You will have to watch the recording to get the topic….&nbsp; </p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/472937478">https://vimeo.com/472937478</a> </p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:05:04 - State of DIDs in South Korea</p>  <p>0:13:29 - Introducing Omnione</p>  <p>0:24:00 - DIDs and VCs in action in South Korea</p>  <p>0:51:18 - Introduction to IdRamp </p>  <p>1:04:00 - Interactive demo on IdRamp </p>  <p>1:08:00 - Wallets and compatibility</p>  <p>1:11:00 - Service integration demo &amp; discussion</p>  <p>1:31:57 - Upcoming events</p>  <p>For more information on Raonsecure Omnione:&nbsp;<a href="https://omnione.net/en/main">https://omnione.net/en/main</a> </p><p>For more information on IdRamp:&nbsp;<a href="https://idramp.com/">https://idramp.com/</a> </p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

 MyData Canada Privacy Law Reform Submission <p>MyData Canada recently submitted a report to the Government of Ontario in response to its <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">consultation</a> for strengthening privacy protections in Ontario. You can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g03gwjdh76wllt9/MyData%20Canada%20Ontario%20Privacy%20Reform%20Submission%20%28Final%29.pdf?dl=0">download the submission</a> from the <a href="https://mydatacanada.webflow.io/">MyData Canada</a> site. I am a board member of MyData Global and a member of the MyData Canada hub. This is a brief summary of some of the recommendations in that report.</p><p>Part of what MyData Canada would like the province of Ontario to address is the current ‘gatekeeper model’ where each of us cede control to information about us under terms or privacy policies based on a flawed consent model. As the report puts it,</p><blockquote>Behind each of the gate-keepers (“data controllers” in GDPR terms) in the centralized model are thousands of intermediaries and data brokers invisible to the individuals whose data they process. Individuals’ personal data is used in ways they could not anticipate, and often without their awareness or even the opportunity to meaningfully consent.</blockquote><p>This needs to be fixed.</p> Background <p>Canada has a multi-jurisdictional privacy environment. That means that both levels of government have privacy commissioners and privacy laws. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, does not have a private sector privacy law. This leaves a number of categories of persons and organizations uncovered; don’t ask why, it’s a constitutional jurisdictional thing. Thus the consultation and submission. MyData Canada believes that,</p><blockquote>…our proposed approach will help accelerate the development and uptake of privacy- focused, human-centric innovation and ultimately serve to regain public trust and confidence in the digital economy.</blockquote> 2-Branch Privacy Reform <p>MyData Canada proposes a two branch approach to privacy law reform; a harmonization branch, and a transformation branch.</p>  The harmonization branch proposes an incremental approach to enable any new Ontario law to work harmoniously with other regimes, both in Canada and in the rest of the world. This branch is intended to ensure that Ontario is a low friction end point for cross border data flows with other data protection data. At the same time this branch will introduce a regulatory framework with a functional equivalency to the CCPA in the US and to the GDPR in the EU. In essence, this broad framework skates to where the puck will be with respect to global data protection laws.  The digital transformation branch proposes to simultaneously create a ‘next-generation’ regulatory space within Ontario. This space will allow Ontario based companies or organization to create new forward looking and individually centred solutions. To continue the metaphor, this branch will allow breakaway solutions that will disrupt the current platform information gatekeepers and return autonomy to individuals.   Harmonize Up <p>Rather than seeking a lowest common denominator or participating in a race to the bottom, MyData recommends harmonizing ‘up’ including the following:</p>  Adopting a principled and risk based approach to privacy regulation;  Coordinating with other provinces and the federal government, perhaps including a pan-Canadian council of information and privacy commissioners;  Aligning with Convention 108 and 108+;  Increased enforcement powers; and  Implementation support for businesses and organizations for compliance.   Digital Transformation <p>Create a regulatory environment to reward first movers with privacy enhancing technologies that put people at the centre of their own data. Recommendations include:</p>  Creating a privacy technology incubator;  Host regulatory sandboxes and hackathons;  Grants and other incentives for privacy ‘retrofits’;  Create and support a regime for seals, badges, and privacy trust marks;  Foster interoperability by requiring api or similar means to prevent or counter ‘platform dominance’ and network affects; and  Create up-skilling programs for a multi-disciplinary privacy engineering centre of excellence in Ontario.   Summing up <p>The above is just a summary of the first recommendations of the report. It includes further recommendations on:</p>  Taking a comprehensive approach to move beyond compliance;  Adopting a Consumer Protection and Human Rights oriented regulatory enforcement model  Adopting a multi-stakeholder and inclusive model to spur innovation and open data  <p>If you find this interesting please download and share the report.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

    name: Release on GitHub and PGXN
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    env:
      # Required to create GitHub release and upload the bundle.
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Bundle the Release
      id: bundle
      run: pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      env:
        # Required to release on PGXN.
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
      run: pgxn-release
    - name: Create GitHub Release
      id: release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body: |
          Changes in this Release
          - First Change
          - Second Change          
    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        # Reference the upload URL and bundle name from previous steps.
        upload_url: ${{ steps.release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should look like this, with
<code>$filename</code> representing the name of the release file, usually
<code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>::set-output name=bundle::$filename
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

  This is a flight of fancy written a week and a half before the US election. I hope it proves to be bad speculation.

 What if? <p>Here’s a speculative fiction plot, NOT a prediction, prompted by the news frenzy of US presidential politics, influenced by my own contrarian nature. If you read history and science fiction we live in an interesting time. Whether it will be a historical turning point in US and global history is not something that we are privileged to know at the time. But if this is a historic turning point I would like to plot out a story based on where we are, not much more than a week before the US election between President Trump and former Vice-President Biden. Let’s ignore that reality strains credulity, and proceed from there. Nothing below should be read as representative of my own views or preferences.</p> Biden wins? <p>The Democrats win the House and the Senate. Joe Biden wins the popular vote but the electoral college remains unclear pending delayed counts for mail-in ballots. Election night ends with both candidates being declared the victor by different media outlets.</p> Taking it to the streets <p>On the day after the election Trump claims to be the legitimate President based on claims of a rigged election. From the White House he asks his supporters to come out to defend his victory. Activists from both sides take to the streets in every major American city. The national guard takes sides, but on different sides in different states or cities, and civic order breaks down.</p> COVID confusion <p>The electoral college convenes and declares Biden to be the winner. Trump and his staff leave the White House under political pressure. President elect Biden is then revealed to be ill with COVID, increasing uncertainty. Before the inauguration Biden dies in hospital, and Kamala Harris is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, with Pete Buttigieg as her vice-president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are prominently on display at the inauguration even as conflict rages on the streets of America.</p> Consolidation <p>President Harris deploys the military, aided by private military contractors, to establish order on the streets. Former President Trump flees the country to Moscow, declaring a government in exile. The Harris administration declares a continuing state of military emergency with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The state of emergency delays elections until the ‘emergency is over’.</p> Epilogue <p>10 years after the start of the Harris dynasty, the United States has become the Democratic Republic of America, run by the United Democratic Party under Grand President Harris. The former Republican Party has been absorbed into the United Democratic Party. Wall Street has become a financial back-water. The US overseas military presence has been dramatically reduced because of domestic military requirements. There is an underground resistance, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most wanted fugitive in American. Climate change is at 2.5 degrees and increasing. China has become the dominant global power, dominating the United Nation, based on its Belt and Road initiative.</p> End note <p>I hope that this will prove to be really bad speculation. The past is prologue but it is our job to create the history we want to inhabit. I wish my American friends a successful and well-run election with a successful and peaceful transition of power if the Biden-Harris ticket wins.</p>

<p>You don’t walk around wearing a name badge.&nbsp; Except maybe at a conference, or some other enclosed space where people need to share their names and affiliations with each other. But otherwise, no.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because you don’t need a name badge for people who know you—or for people who don’t.</p>
<p>Here in civilization we typically reveal information about ourselves to others on a need-to-know basis: “I’m over 18.” “I’m a citizen of Canada.” “Here’s my Costco card.” “Hi, I’m Jane.” We may or may not present credentials in these encounters. And in most we don’t say our names. “Michael” being a common name, a guy called “Mike” may tell a barista his name is “Clive” if the guy in front of him just said&nbsp;his name is “Mike.” (My given name is David, a name so common that another David re-branded me Doc. Later I learned that his middle name was David and his first name was Paul. True story.)</p>
<p>This is how civilization works in the offline world.</p>
<p>Kim Cameron wrote up how this ought to work, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Laws of Identity</a>, first published in 2004. The Laws include&nbsp;personal control and consent,&nbsp;minimum disclosure for a constrained use,&nbsp;justifiable parties, and&nbsp;plurality of operators. Again, we have those in here in the offline world where your body is reading this on a screen.</p>
<p>In the online world behind that screen, however, you have a monstrous mess. I won’t go into why. The results are what matter, and you already know those anyway.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d like to share what (at least for now) I think is the best approach to the challenge of presenting verifiable credentials in the digital world. It’s called KERI, and you can read about it here:&nbsp;<a href="https://keri.one/">https://keri.one/</a>. If you’d like to contribute to the code work, that’s here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/</a>.</p>
<p>I’m still just getting acquainted with it, in sessions at <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a>. The main thing is that I’m sure it matters. So I’m sharing that sentiment, along with those links.</p>

 Filling in the&nbsp;GNAP <p>About a year ago I wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">arguing for creating the next generation of the OAuth protocol</a>. That article, and some of the other writing around it, has been picked up recently, and so people have been asking me what’s the deal with XYZ, TxAuth, OAuth 3.0, and anything else mentioned there. As you can imagine, a lot has happened in the last year and we’re in a very different place.</p><p>The short version is that there is now a new working group in the IETF: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/about/">Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (gnap)</a>. The mailing list is still at <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/txauth/">txauth</a>, and the first WG draft is available online now as <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00</a>.</p> How Are These All&nbsp;Related? <p>OK, so there’s GNAP, but now you’re probably asking yourself what’s the difference between GNAP and XYZ, or TxAuth, or OAuth 3.0. With the alphabet soup of names, it’s certainly confusing if you haven’t been following along the story in the last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">XYZ project</a> started as a concrete proposal for how a security protocol could work post-OAuth 2.0. It was based on experience with a variety of OAuth-based and non-OAuth-based deployments, and on conversations with developers from many different backgrounds and walks. This started out as a test implementation of ideas, which was later written down into a website and even later incorporated into an IETF individual draft. The most important thing about XYZ is that it has always been implementation-driven: things almost always started with code and moved forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>This led to the project itself being called OAuth.XYZ after the website, and later just XYZ. When it came time to write the specification, this document was named after a core concept in the architecture: Transactional Authorization. The mailing list at IETF that was created for discussing this proposal was named after this draft: TxAuth. As such, the draft, project, and website were all referred to as either XYZ or TxAuth depending on who and when you&nbsp;asked.</p><p>After months of discussion and debate (because naming things is really hard), the working group settled on GNAP, and GNAP is now the official name of both the working group and the protocol the group is working on publishing.</p><p>As for OAuth 3.0? Simply put, it <a href="https://oauth.net/3/">canonically does not exist</a>. The GNAP work is being done by many members of the OAuth community, but not as part of the OAuth working group. While there may be people who refer to GNAP as OAuth 3.0, and it does represent a similar shift forward that OAuth 2.0 did, GNAP is not part of the OAuth protocol family. It’s not out of the question for the OAuth working group decides to adopt GNAP or something else in the future to create OAuth 3.0, but right now that is not on the&nbsp;table.</p> The GNAP&nbsp;Protocol <p>Not only is GNAP an official working group, but the GNAP protocol has also been <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">defined in an official working group draft document</a>. This draft represents the output of several months of concerted effort by a design team within the GNAP working group. The protocol in this document is not exactly the same as the earlier XYZ/TxAuth protocol, since it pulled from multiple sources and discussions, but there are some familiar&nbsp;pieces.</p><p>The upshot is that GNAP is now an official draft protocol.</p><p>GNAP is also not a final protocol by any stretch. If you read through the draft, you’ll notice that there are a large number of things tagged as “Editor’s Notes” and similar commentary throughout, making up a significant portion of the page count. These represent portions of the protocol or document where the design team identified some specific decisions and choices that need to be made by the working group. The goal was to present a set of initial choices along with rationale and context for&nbsp;them.</p><p>But that’s not to say that the only flexible portions are those marked in the editor’s notes. What’s important about the gnap-00 document is that it’s a starting point for the working group discussion. It gives the working group something concrete to talk about and debate instead of a blank page of unknown possibilities (and monsters). With this document in hand, the working group can and will change the protocol and how it’s presented over the specification’s lifecycle.</p> The Immediate Future <p>Now that GNAP is an active standard under development, XYZ will shift into being an open-source implementation of GNAP from here out. As of the time of publication, we are actively working to implement all of the changes that were introduced during the design team process. Other developers are gearing up to implement the gnap-00 draft as well, and it will be really interesting to try to plug these into each other to test interoperability at a first&nbsp;stage.</p><p>TxAuth and Transactional Authorization are functionally retired as names for this work, though the mailing list at IETF will remain txauth so you might still hear reference to that from time to time because of&nbsp;this.</p><p>And as stated above, OAuth 3.0 is not a real thing. Which is fine, since OAuth 2.0 isn’t going anywhere any time soon. The work on GNAP is shifting into a new phase that is really just starting. I think we’ve probably got a couple years of active work on this specification, and a few more years after that before anything we do really sees any kind of wide adoption on the internet. These things take a long time and a lot of work, and it’s my hope to see a diverse and engaged group building things&nbsp;out!</p>

As a byproduct of the pandemic, the world is collectively facing persistent supply chain disruption and unpredictability. This coupled with increasing traceability regulations is driving an urgency for importers to fortify their supply chains. COVID-19 especially has highlighted the need for preventing counterfeit goods and having certainty about your suppliers (and their suppliers).</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/"></a>Transmute Co-founders, Karyl Fowler &amp; Orie Steele @ SXSW&nbsp;2019<p>Transmute’s software is upgrading trade documentation today to give importers a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic, global marketplace. Leveraging decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) tech with existing cloud-based systems, Transmute is able to offer digital product and supplier credentials that are traceable across an entire logistics ecosystem. From point of origin to end customer, we are unlocking unprecedented visibility into customers’ supplier networks.</p><blockquote>Disrupting a highly regulated and old-fashioned industry is complex, and an intentional first step in our go-to-market strategy has been balancing both the needs of regulators and commercial customers.</blockquote><p>This is why we’re incredibly proud to join forces with our lead investors at <a href="https://medium.com/leadership-prevails">Moonshots Capital</a>, a VC firm focused on investing in extraordinary leaders. We look forward to growing alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyperdew/">Kelly Perdew</a> (our newest Board of Directors member) and his founding partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unleashcraig/">Craig Cummings</a>.

Between their commitment to diverse teams, building sustainable futures and their deep expertise in global shipping and logistics, we feel more than ready to take on global trade with this&nbsp;firm.</p><p>The support of Kerr Tech Investments, led by Josh and Michael Kerr, further validates our company’s innovative approach to data exchange. <a href="https://joshkerr.com/">Josh</a> is a seasoned entrepreneur, an e-signature expert and has been advising us since Transmute’s inception.</p><p>Closing our seed round coincides with another exciting announcement: our recent launch of Phase II work with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science &amp; Technology’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) to enhance “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/08/news-release-dhs-awards-198k-raw-material-import-tracking">transparency, automation and security in processing the importation of raw materials</a>” like&nbsp;steel.</p><p>Our vision is more broad than just improving how trade gets done, and steel imports are just the beginning. We’re inserting revolutionary changes into the fabric of how enterprises manage product and supplier identity, effectively building a bridge — or a fulcrum, rather — towards new revenue streams and business models across industries.</p><p>Last — but absolutely not least — I want to give a personal shoutout to my core teammates; startups are a team sport, and our team is stacked! Tremendous congratulations as these backers will accelerate our progress in a huge way. And finally, thanks also to our stellar team of advisors who commit significant time coaching us through blind spots as we bring Transmute’s product to&nbsp;market.</p> Also, we’re&nbsp;Hiring! <p>Expanding our capacity to meet customer demand is our top nearterm priority.

<p>The MATTR team is excited to announce a critical new addition to our product capabilities. We’re continuing to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs), leveraging the best efforts of the open-source community along with a number of distinct product innovations. These innovations include our recent work related to using <a href="https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/">BBS+ signatures for privacy-preserving selective disclosure</a> and our earlier work on the<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/"> OIDC Credential Provider spec.</a> We’ve also been busy sharing new tools for <a href="https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/">checking the syntax of a JSON-LD credential</a> during development.</p><p>In this product release, we are focused on one of the fundamental capabilities in any credential-based system: the ability to provably revoke a credential when it’s no longer valid. Using verifiable data in combination with open standards not only improves the quality of the data exchanged in an ecosystem, it also enables the authority (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer">issuer</a>) on any piece of information to maintain that data throughout its lifecycle. In practice, this means that credential issuers can manage the status of a credential directly, using the same general mechanism as the one used for issuing&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Credentials are typically stored by the user (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">subject</a>) in some kind of digital wallet where they are able to manage their credentials and control when and how to share their data. When accessing services, the user may consent to present their VCs to a relying party (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>). The relying party needs to be able to be able to verify the credential is genuine and tamper free. They also need to be able to easily validate whether a presented credential has been revoked or&nbsp;not.</p><p>For example, say you’re issued a digital driver’s license, then you go and get several speeding tickets. The department that issued your license determines you have breached the terms of your license and consequently, suspends your license. In doing so, the credential status is changed, and next time a relying party checks the status they will be able to see that you are no longer entitled to drive. If a car rental office is checking your driving status in order to loan you a vehicle, they’d like to be able to verify if the digital license is still valid and legitimate.</p>User journey viewing a credential &amp; presentation request with a revoked credential.<p>In general, we want to accomplish all of these goals while minimizing the burden on data issuers and verifiers, and preserving the autonomy of credential holders in deciding how to store and disclose their data. We also want to remain flexible around where the revocation list is stored and managed, so we opted to implement an approach that’s extensible to different types of infrastructure supported by the issuer. The resulting solution contrasts with others that have tended to be tightly coupled with a particular kind of infrastructure such as a distributed ledger. We believe revocation should be built in a simple, transparent, and standardizable manner, which is why we built our approach on the W3C CCG’s <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020/">Credential Revocation List</a>.</p><p>Practically, the information regarding whether a credential has been revoked is represented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#status">credential status</a> property of a VC, as defined in the W3C spec. When a credential is first created, the issuer can include in the credential status field a reference to a publicly available revocation list. This list can be updated by the issuer at any time, so resolving this reference will always get you the latest revocation status. The retrieved revocation list is in the form of a <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> based verifiable credential, making it straightforward to validate. Holders and verifiers can simply check this revocation list to determine if a specific VC has been revoked or not. Since the revocation list contains the revocation status of many credentials, credential subjects get “herd privacy” with regards to the issuer, meaning the issuer doesn’t know where an issued credential is being used. This protects the holder against one form of surveillance and potential leakage of their personal data. Some use cases will require solutions that offer an even greater level of privacy for credential subjects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)">cryptographic accumulators</a>. We are actively working on a number of improvements in this area which will offer enhanced privacy for credential holders when it’s required and simplify the process of relying parties validating a credential’s status.</p><p>We’ve implemented this functionality using a simple optional flag on our VC issuance API, allowing issuers to toggle between credentials that support revocation and those that don’t. On the holder side, our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet App</a> automatically checks the revocation status when opened, alerting the user of any changes and giving them a warning if it’s revoked. For verifiers, validating credential status is a standard part of our VC verification API, so validation will automatically fail if the credential is&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Integrating revocation into our platform brings us one step closer to building a fully realized verifiable data ecosystem, an environment where verifiers can have more confidence and trust in the decisions they’re making and people can participate in the sharing and exchange of information without eroding their basic privacy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the community and gathering feedback from industry to enhance and extend different ways to accomplish revocation while respecting users’ digital rights. <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a> on our website to get access to our platform and check out <a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a> to start issuing revocable credentials.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-revocation-of-verifiable-credentials-2342b66b0997">Adding support for revocation of Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The goal here is to obsolesce this brilliant poster by Despair.com: I got launched on that path a couple months ago, when I&nbsp;got this email from &nbsp;The_New_Yorker at e-mail.condenast.com: Why did they “need” a “confirmation” to a subscription which, best I could recall, was last renewed early this year?

<p></p>
<p>The goal here is to obsolesce this brilliant <a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice">poster</a> by <a href="https://despair.com/">Despair.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice"></a></p>
<p>I got launched on that path a couple months ago, when I&nbsp;got this email from &nbsp;<a href="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:" title="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:">The_New_Yorker at e-mail.condenast.com:</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why did they “need” a “confirmation” to a subscription which, best I could recall, was last renewed early this year?</p>
<p>So I looked at the links.</p>
<p>The “renew,” Confirmation Needed” and “Discounted Subscription” links all go to a page with a URL that began with&nbsp;<a href="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp" title="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp">https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs…</a>, followed by a lot of tracking cruft. Here’s a screen shot of that one, cut short of where one filled in a credit card number. Note the price:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was sure I had been paying $80-something per year, for years. As I also recalled, this was a price one could only obtain by calling the 800 number at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">NewYorker.com</a>.</p>
<p>Or somewhere. After digging around, I found it at<br>
&nbsp;<a href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp" title="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp">https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/accoun…</a>, which is where the link to Customer Care under My Account on the NewYorker website goes. It also required yet another login.</p>
<p>So, when I told the representative at the call center that I’d rather not “confirm” a year for a “discount” that probably wasn’t, she said I could renew for the $89.99 I had paid in the past, and that the deal would be good&nbsp; through February of 2022. I said fine, let’s do that. So I gave her my credit card, said this was way too complicated, and added that a single simple subscription price would be better.&nbsp;She replied,&nbsp; “Never gonna happen.” Let’s repeat that:</p>
<p>Never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Then I got this by email:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This appeared to confirm the subscription I already had. To see if that was the case, I went back to the&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> website and looked under the Account Summary tab, where it said this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this means that I last renewed on February 3 of this year, and what I did on the phone in August was commit to paying $89.99/year until February 10 of 2022.</p>
<p>If that’s what happened, all my call did was extend my existing subscription. Which was fine, but why require a phone call for that?</p>
<p>And WTF was that “Account Confirmation Required” email about? I assume it was&nbsp;bait to switch existing subscribers into paying $50 more per year.</p>
<p>Then there was this, at the bottom of the Account summary page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This might explain why I stopped getting Vanity Fair, which I suppose I should still be getting.</p>
<p>So I clicked on”Reactivate&nbsp;and got a login page where the login I had used to get this far didn’t work.</p>
<p>After other failing efforts that I neglected to write down, I decided to go back to the New Yorker site and work my way back through two logins to the same page, and then click Reactivate one more time.&nbsp;Voila! ::::::</p>
<p></p>
<p>So now I’ve got one page that tells me I’m good to March 2021 next to a link that takes me to another page that says I ordered 12 issues last December and I can “start” a new subscription for $15 that would begin nine months ago. This is how one “reactivates” a subscription?&nbsp; OMFG.</p>
<p>I’m also not going into the hell of moving the print subscription back and forth between the two places where I live. Nor will I bother now, in October, to ask why I haven’t seen another copy of Vanity Fair. (Maybe they’re going to the other place. Maybe not. I don’t know, and I’m too weary to try finding out.)</p>
<p>I want to be clear here that I am not sharing this to complain. In fact, I don’t want&nbsp;The New Yorker,&nbsp; Vanity Fair, Wred, Condé Nast (their parent company) or&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> to do a damn thing. They’re all <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fubar">FUBAR</a>. By design. (<a href="https://www.gapingvoidart.com/gallery/dinosaur/">Bonus link.</a>)</p>
<p>Nor do I want any action out of Spectrum, SiriusXM, Dish Network or the other subscription-based whatevers whose customer disservice systems have recently soaked up many hours of my life.</p>
<p>See, with too many subscription systems (especially ones for periodicals), FUBAR is the norm. A matter of course. Pro forma. Entrenched. A box outside of which nobody making, managing or working in those systems can think.</p>
<p>This is why, when an alien idea appears, for example from a loyal customer just wanting a single and simple damn price, the response is “Never gonna happen.”</p>
<p>This is also why the subscription fecosystem can only be turned into an ecosystem from the outside. Our side. The subscribers’ side.</p>
<p>I’ll explain how at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, which we created for <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/">exactly that purpose</a>. Stay tuned for that.</p>
 
<p>Two exceptions are <a href="https://account.thesunmagazine.org/SUN/?s=I2010SMN&amp;f=paid">Consumer Reports</a> and <a href="https://account.thesunmagazine.org/SUN/?s=I2010SMN&amp;f=paid">The Sun</a>.</p>

Other stories in the same vein are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-turkey-ships-idUSKBN26O0LC">here</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cruisemapper.com/news/7837-carnival-cruise-line-carnival-imagination-scrapped">here</a>, <a href="https://www.duvarenglish.com/economy/2020/09/29/turkeys-ship-recycling-soars-amid-covid-19-pandemic/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.cruisehive.com/which-cruise-ships-are-being-scrapped-or-sold-due-to-the-covid-10-pandemic/40597">here</a>, <a href="https://www.cruisemapper.com/cruise-lines/Scrapped-Cruise-Ships-121">here</a> and <a href="http://www.oldsaltblog.com/2020/07/first-mega-cruise-ships-go-to-scrap-yard">here</a>.</p>
<p>I been on a number of cruises (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/1104825">here’s one</a>) in the course of my work as a journalist, and I’ve enjoyed them all. I’ve also hung out at a similar number of colleges and universities, and have long found myself wondering how well the former might be a good metaphor for the latter. Both are expensive, well-branded and self-contained structures with a lot of specialized staff and overhead. Both are also vulnerable to pandemics, and in doomed cases their physical components turn out to be worth more than their institutional ones. John Naughton also <a href="https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/monday-5-october-2020?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjQ1NDA1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3NDQ3NDk1LCJfIjoibUp0Q2IiLCJpYXQiOjE2MDIwMDI2MzEsImV4cCI6MTYwMjAwNjIzMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTMxOTk5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.GmIJtENeMvRcf_8fB2n40km_wTzmA63x6MKh1QlL30M">notes the resemblance</a>. But it’s Scott Galloway who runs all the way with it; first with <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/higher-ed-enough-already">Higher Ed: Enough Already</a>, and then with a long and research-filled post titled <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/uss-university/">USS University</a>, featuring this title graphic:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/uss-university/"></a></p>
<p>Those three schools are adrift across&nbsp;<a href="https://api.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US_Higher_Ed_Update_073020.png">a 2×2</a> with low value&lt;—&gt;high value on the X axis and high vulnerability&lt;—&gt;low vulnerability on the Y axis. At the lower left are the low-value/high vulnerability schools in a quadrant Scott calls “challenged,” meaning “high admit rates, high tuition, low endowments, dependence on international students, and weak brand equity.” Among those are—</p>
 
 Adelphi 
 Brandeis 
 Bard 
 Dickenson 
 Dennison 
 Hofstra 
 Kent State 
 Kenyon 
 LIU 
 Mt. Holyoke 
 Old Dominion 
 Pace 
 Pacific 
 Robert Morris 
 Sarah Lawrence 
 Seton Hall 
 Skidmore 
 Smith 
 St. John’s (Maryland &amp; New Mexico) 
 The New School 
 Union 
 UC Santa Cruz 
 U Mass Dartmouth 
 Valparaiso 
 Wittenberg 
 
<p>— plus a plethora of mostly state-run “directional” schools (e.g. University of Somewhere at Somewhere).</p>
<p>The Hmm here is, How many have more value as real estate than as what they are today?</p>
<p>I started wondering in the same direction in May, when I posted&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/06/figuring-the-future/">Figuring the Future</a> and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/09/choose-one/">Choose One</a>. Both pivoted off&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-economic-outlook/">this 2×2</a> by <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/">Arnold Kling</a>—</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-economic-outlook/"></a></p>
<p>On Arnold’s rectangle, D (Fragile/Inessential) is Scott’s “challenged” quadrant. What I’m wondering, now that school is in session and at least&nbsp;some results should be coming in (or at least trending in a direction), if any colleges or universities in that group (or in the other quadrants) are headed already toward their own&nbsp;Aliağa.</p>
<p>Thoughts? If so, let me know on Twitter (where I am <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls">@dsearls</a>), Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls">here</a>) or by email (doc at searls dot com).&nbsp;I hope to have comments working again here soon, but for now they don’t, alas.</p>

 Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraud 



<p>Digital Identity in an Online WorldThe isolation of worldwide lockdowns this year have presented criminals with new opportunities for phishing, and this only adds to already existing trends in the rise of synthetic IDs, account takeover and SIM swap fraud. This panel will explore solutions which utilise digital identity to fight back against the fraudsters.</p>

<p>The data on this site is super interesting. Whatever is running the site is not great. It’s some sort of out of the box Microsoft thing including default loading animations.</p>

<p>But! It aims to be a sort of Wikipedia. I’ve signed up to be a contributor and I hope that this can be built on and be licensed for re-use.</p>

<p>I did a search for “Vancouver” and found only one entry, so my used cookbook collection may be able to add a handful more. It does say it only wants pre-1940 cookbooks, but it’s unclear why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It provides a bird’s-eye view of long-term trends in European and American cuisines, from shifting trade routes and dining habits to culinary fads. Search “cupcakes,” for example, and you’ll find the term may have first popped up in Mrs. Putnam’s Receipt Book And Young Housekeeper’s Assistant, a guide for ladies running middle-class households in the 1850s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Super interesting to me. Looking forward to see how this evolves.</p>

<p>IIF Annual Membership Meeting – Digital Identity panel</p>



<p>In the accelerated move to a digitalized world, new technology is changing how people are identified and what we know about them, in an environment where trust has to be built differently from physical interactions. As well as presenting opportunities for efficiency and access, this also drives debate about roles, responsibilities, standards, and privacy. These issues will grow as new technologies in data, sensors, 5G connected devices, and biometrics come online with platforms of systemic scale. This session will discuss how technology and market trends are changing the costs, responsibilities, business models, and opportunities in identity and authentication, and how financial services firms can build on compliance capabilities to create new services and revenue streams.</p>



<p>Tuesday, October 13,&nbsp;from&nbsp;1:00pm London / 2:00pm Madrid / 8:00pm Singapore / 9:00pm Tokyo (55 minutes)</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the Python Package Index so that others can install and use your work.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

 <p>
 In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  
   Py
  
  thon
  
   P
  
  ackage
  
   I
  
  ndex
 </a>
 so that others can install and use your work. Once the package is available on PyPI, anyone will be able to run
 <code>
  pip install
 </code>
 to install the package on their machine. This allows people to import your code into their own modules as a library, but you can also release command-line tools via PyPI; I will show you how to do both.
</p>
<p>
 
  note
 
 : these instructions are Mac and Linux centric. I don't think they would be much different, but I don't do much development work on Windows so I don't know the nuances of that platform.
</p>
 
 The Code
 
<p>
 This first thing you need is some code to publish! I have created a minimal project that you can use as a starting point. You can find the code
 <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/python-package-boilerplate">
  here
 </a>
 . Let's take a look.
</p>
<p>
 First let's walk through the folder structure:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9 
     
   
   
     
      <code>├── README.md
├── package_boilerplate
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── importable.py
├── requirements.txt
├── scripts
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── boilerplate-cli
├── setup.py
└── version.py
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 These are all of the files inside of the python package. First, we have a directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 . This directory contains all of the code for our module. All of the files outside of this directory are metadata for the package itself and are used in the package publishing process, for installing dependencies, and stuff like that. We'll go through the other files shortly.
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 is
 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">
  markdown
 </a>
 formatted text containing details about the package. This content is usually rendered as HTML and made visible in places like GitHub and PyPI.
</p>
<p>
 If we look inside of
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages">
  <code>
   __init__.py
  </code>
 </a>
 , we see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

def main():
        print(f"{fg('dark_orange')}{attr('bold')}You called me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 We're doing a couple of things here: &nbsp;first, we import a library called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colored/">
  colored
 </a>
 . Colored is a tool to colourize your program's terminal output. It's fun!
</p>
<p>
 So basically, this file will print some coloured text to the terminal if
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 is called. If you continue reading, you will see how we can publish this as a command-line tool through
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 !
</p>
<p>
 Next, let's look inside of
 <code>
  importable.py
 </code>
 :
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

print(f"{fg('orchid')}{attr('bold')}You imported me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Again, we're just print some coloured text to the terminal but this time we can import this code in an external module. The text will be printed as soon as the file is imported since the code is not contained in a function.
</p>
<p>
 Ok, so that is the logic of our program. Let's continue down the folder structure to see what else is needed to make this publishable.
</p>
<p>
 The next file is
 <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">
  requirements.txt
 </a>
 . If you've ever written a python module that depends on other external python packages, then you may be familiar with this file. The file is used to tell
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 which versions of which modules it should install all at once if you run
 <code>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 </code>
 . Python packages are no different; if they rely on dependencies,
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 needs to know what to install. We'll reference this file in
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Next, we have the
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 directory. The folder name doesn't matter and isn't required, but I prefer to keep things separate and organized. Inside of this folder we have a file called
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 . Notice how we don't give the file an extension like
 <code>
  .py
 </code>
 and we used the naming convention
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 instead of
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli
 </code>
 . This is because this is the file that will be installed as a command-line program in the users
 <code>
  PATH
 </code>
 . We want the the user to be able to invoke the program by running
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 and not
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli.py
 </code>
 because that is the expected convention for command-line programs.
</p>
<p>
 Inside of this file we have this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5 
     
   
   
     
      <code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from package_boilerplate import main

main()
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The first line is important because we have to tell the user's operating system what kind of code this it because it doesn't have a file extension. This is called a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">
  shebang
 </a>
 . Next we import the entrypoint into the program from
 <code>
  __init__.py
 </code>
 that we named
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 and we run the function.
</p>
<p>
 Calling this function kicks off our program! Right now it only prints text to the terminal, but it could be the entrypoint into a more complicated program. We will reference this file in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 section to make it available as a command-line program for the user.
</p>
<p>
 The most important part of this process is the
 <code>
  [setup.py](https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html)
 </code>
 file. This tells pip how to bundle the package and what all the settings and dependencies are.

        long_description = fh.read()


def parse_requirements(filename):
        """Load requirements from a pip requirements file."""
        lineiter = (line.strip() for line in open(filename))
        return [line for line in lineiter if line and not line.startswith("#")]


if __name__ == "__main__":
        setup(
                name=PACKAGE_NAME,
                version=VERSION,
                packages=find_packages(),
                install_requires=parse_requirements("requirements.txt"),
                python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3",
                scripts=["scripts/boilerplate-cli"],
                description="This is a description.",
                long_description=long_description,
                long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
        )
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 First we import a few utilities called
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 .
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 is built into python, but
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 needs to be installed which we will go over in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next, we get the python metadata out of the file
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 and obtain the current version number
 <code>
  VERSION
 </code>
 . This file just contains the current version number of the package you are publishing. We'll go over why it's split into its own file in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next,
 <code>
  long_description
 </code>
 is pulled out of the content from
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 . Using the content from the readme means that this description only needs to live in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Then, I've added a helper function called
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 . The python
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 format expects that
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 property contains a list of dependencies that this package relies on. Since it's burdensome to maintain a
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 file with your dependencies as well as the dependencies in a list here, this
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 function simple imports the dependencies from
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 so that you only need to maintain them in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, we call
 <code>
  setup
 </code>
 with some values to define the package. The section that specifies
 <code>
  packages=find_packages()
 </code>
 is pointing to the directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 and is discovered automatically by this function. Name and version are used in the PyPI directory listing and also are what people reference when they want to install the package.
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 pulls in the list of requirements from the
 <code>
  requirement.txt
 </code>
 file.
 <code>
  python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3"
 </code>
 is the version of python that the user must have installed. And finally,
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 is where you specify the command line program that should be installed for the user.
</p>
<p>
 There are other values that you should set as well such as
 <code>
  description
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  author
 </code>
 . You can read more about the setup values available
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html">
  here
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The last file,
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 is quite small. This file is used for two things: first, it is imported in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 module above to use as the package version; and second, the version value is stored in the
 <code>
  __version__
 </code>
 attribute.
 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification">
  This is recommend
 </a>
 so that the package version can be discovered programatically.
</p>
<p>
 
  A tip
 
 : as you are working, you can install your package locally before you even publish it. This way, you will know that it works before submitting it to PyPI. To install the package locally, you can run
 <code>
  pip install -e .
 </code>
 in the package directory.
</p>
 
 Publishing Your Package
 
<p>
 So you've written your package and you want to publish it! We're almost there. There are just a few more steps to publish your package.
</p>
<p>
 The first thing will want to do is install a tool called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">
  twine
 </a>
 by running
 <code>
  pip install twine
 </code>
 . Twine is a tool for publishing Python packages on PyPI. Then, we also need to install
 <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
  setuptools
 </a>
 since we are using it in our setup script:
 <code>
  pip install setuptools
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Now, we need to create a
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package">
  distribution package
 </a>
 that we will publish. To do this, run: &nbsp;
 <code>
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
 </code>
 which will create
 <code>
  build
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  dist
 </code>
 directories.
</p>
<p>
 Once the build has completed, we can check for any errors or warnings using
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 . Run
 <code>
  twine check dist/*
 </code>
 &nbsp;to check the distribution package for errors. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Checking distribution dist/package_boilerplate-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl: Passed
Checking distribution dist/package-boilerplate-1.0.0.tar.gz: Passed
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Once this is done, we want to publish our package to the PyPI test site. We can publish to
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org">
  test.pypi.org
 </a>
 before we publish to the real index to make sure everything looks good! To do this, we can instruct
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 to use a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
 </code>
</p>
<p>
 If we run this now, we will see the following:
</p>

      <code>Enter your username:

<p>
 Looks like we need to create an account! So head over to the
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org/account/register/">
  registration page
 </a>
 for the PyPI test site and create an account. If you run the command again and enter your username and password hopefully you should see:

<p>
 If you do, congratulations! You have successfully published your package!
</p>
<p>
 
  Note:
 
 make sure your package name is unique!
</p>
<p>
 All that remains is to publish your package to the official
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  pypi.org
 </a>
 . To do this, you just need to create another account there and publish your package without specifying a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload dist/*
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Installing Your Package
 
<p>
 Now that your package is installed, I bet you want to install it to see how it works! Let's install our package from the PyPI test index:
 <code>
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . In the future, if we don't provide the
 <code>
  --index-url
 </code>
 parameter, then we would be requesting a package from the official index. If all goes well, you should see this:

 It works! And we even get the coloured text.
</p>
<p>
 Once you publish your package to the official PyPI index, you will be able to install the package by running
 <code>
  pip install package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . Of course, you would want to choose a different name for the package throughout the process and use that here.

 Unpacking the biases &amp; algorithms that govern our&nbsp;lives <p>In the recently released Netflix documentary <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224">The Social Dilemma</a>, the world is ablaze. Through the eyes of a number of wealthy and well-spoken whistleblowers, we are told a somewhat familiar story about the failure of modern democracy and the breakdown of public discourse that’s happening simultaneously in many different areas across the globe. Rather than placing the blame squarely on politicians or institutions, director Jeff Orlowski instead takes aim at the omnipresent tech giants of silicon valley. Sure, we know that using social media platforms is probably bad for us, but what’s worse, we are told, is the way that these platforms are manipulating our behavior and exploiting us for profit. The film alternates between interviews with former employees at the likes of Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, and a series of increasingly cheesy re-enactments of a “modern family” dealing with social media’s effect on their lives, as well as a matrix-like simulation of a virtual avatar puppet. Yeah, it’s as weird as it&nbsp;sounds.</p><p>The main story surrounds our society’s relationship with the technology that’s intertwined with our lives on a personal and social level, and it does a fairly compelling job of building out its world, or our world, in the style of a blockbuster sci-fi thriller (with a twist: in this story, the aliens are already&nbsp;here).</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way first. Yes, the re-enactments are bizarre, and at times completely unbearable. In all fairness, I think it speaks to a larger issue about why it’s so hard to tell this story, and perhaps why it’s taken so long to be told in the first place. The way that modern technology is reprogramming our behavior is significant but also incredibly subtle. It’s hard to point to any succinct visual representation of what’s happening to our minds or to our behavior. It seems like the producers decided to use these re-enactments to try to humanize something which is fundamentally opaque and programmatic. The result of this experiment is not particularly great, but certainly justifiable.</p><p>I believe it’s incredibly important that everybody understand how the technology we use every day works, because it is not neutral, nor is it natural in any sense of the word. And contrary to popular opinion, it doesn’t work like magic. It works the way it does because of deliberate and calculated design decisions; and boy, does it work like clockwork.</p><p>The movie defines what it calls the three main goals of modern technology platforms, which&nbsp;are:</p>  Engagement (to keep you clicking)  Growth (to invite your&nbsp;friends)  Advertisement (to sell you products)  <p>This feels like a pretty good starting point. Essentially, these are the primary design principles that decide what information you see on the internet. They are the main inputs into the algorithms that churn out content for every single person on the web by closely monitoring what we do and how we behave. Though the algorithms are just automated machine processes, they are by no means objective or neutral. These processes are built to maximize and satisfy the aforementioned goals, and they’re impacted by the biases of their creators at a fundamental level. You use these products for free, but don’t be fooled into thinking they’re not taking something from you in&nbsp;return.</p><p>So, what can we do to fix&nbsp;it?</p><p>The movie offers an unsatisfying answer to this question. It presents a compelling and complex problem, but the solution they provide essentially boils down to: “Learn to unplug.” Ah! A revelation. Even though, as they mention earlier in the film, the basic and innate desire for human connection makes it incredibly difficult to “opt out” of these platforms. And, frankly, there are no realistic alternatives that people can use to satisfy this human need for connection and belonging whilst preserving people’s privacy and putting their interests first. Not to mention those pesky but critical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>. There are very few people that want to use a piece of technology or software that very few people are&nbsp;using.</p><p>Besides unplugging, the film also suggests we somehow pressure wealthy corporations, including the ones that own these platforms, to put the interest of users over their own profits. As early Google and Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein puts it, “For so long as… corporations go unregulated, they’re going to continue to destroy trees, to kill whales, to mine the earth and to continue to pull oil out of the ground, even though we know it is destroying the planet and we know that it’s going to leave a worse world for future generations.” Software design ethicist Tristan Harris echoes this idea, stating, “We have to have the platforms be responsible… when they take over election advertising, they’re responsible for protecting elections. When they take over [the] mental health of kids on Saturday morning, they’re responsible for protecting Saturday morning.”</p><p>Is that realistically possible with today’s platforms? I don’t really think so. The fundamental business model and economic incentives behind these corporations make it very unlikely they will ever make a drastic change. What’s more, even if they could, or wanted to change, their solution would likely be harmless in a best-case scenario and abysmal at worst. Their business models mandate that revenue and usage grow quarter over quarter to increase shareholder value. They have existing products and investors that they must maintain, and a whole assortment of expectations, promises, and debts to satisfy. These are powerful forces, ones that will nearly always take precedence over any deeper philosophical, moral, or human issue they may encounter along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Even from a regulatory perspective, though we can try to limit the more addictive features of these platforms or try to curb their power, barring a cataclysmic event, they’re unlikely to be removed or completely redesigned from first principles. It’s important to keep in mind, the problem with modern technology isn’t necessarily with any individual product or feature, it’s with the rationale and design philosophy that drives these products in the first place. In addition, we should try to be at least somewhat realistic about the status quo. We’re over a decade into the domination of modern social media platforms and personal smartphones. We can’t fully put the genie back in the bottle, nor do most people actually want&nbsp;to.</p><blockquote>Sidenote: the movie briefly presents a somewhat interesting idea: enact a tax on data collection and processing so that companies would have to pay for the data assets they choose to keep. This would serve as an incentive for corporations, especially those that handle a lot of data, to not acquire and store this data by default. This likely has a number of downstream economic effects which aren’t explored in any detail, and would definitely receive quite a bit of political opposition, but I&nbsp;digress.</blockquote><p>Instead of trying to legislate and socially pressure these massive technology institutions into rethinking their fundamental business models, we may be much better served to rethink these things from the ground up. If rules and regulations won’t fully stop the effects of technology, then perhaps competition can provide something even better. Building an alternative to today’s monoliths will have to be a collective effort, the product of many different people collaborating in unison and working together to demonstrate what a digital social platform can and should look&nbsp;like.</p><p>The effectiveness and addictiveness of social media has eclipsed almost all other forms of internet usage. It’s made it so that instead of exploring the web in a free and open environment, we scroll on our feeds, viewing the vastness of the internet through a set of very tiny keyholes. We have a biological need to connect with each other, to communicate, and share information. How can we do this&nbsp;better?</p><p>At a minimum, there are 3 major changes that a new platform must implement in order to create a realistic alternative to the existing tech business&nbsp;model.</p>  Have users decide how they want to engage with&nbsp;content  Give users an environment that’s free of surveillance  Invert the user attention model  <p>Using examples, interviews, and logic presented by The Social Dilemma, let’s delve into each of these areas to explore how we might practically solve the issues at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Starting with…</p> Have users decide how they want to engage with&nbsp;content <p>Having worked in the tech industry for several years across a handful of different startups, I can say that software developers generally want to build useful or interesting things. I’ll also state the obvious, that businesses and corporations have a profit motive, and oftentimes these two things directly conflict in the process of building something. The profit motive always wins this battle, and if it doesn’t, the company usually dies. It seems harsh, but that’s the world we live in, and it’s that very environment that created so many beloved American success stories like that of Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak, Larry Page &amp; Sergey&nbsp;Brin.</p><p>Under this system, your needs and wants as a user are by definition secondary to how you can play a role in producing profits and creating value for the companies in charge of your apps and services. Oftentimes, they need to provide you with some addictive hook, something that keeps you coming back and continually producing more value for them. This may seem like a fair trade, because you’re getting to use the service in return, but the value you’re getting out of the experience isn’t actually the point at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Engineers and supercomputers and advertisers have a fundamentally different set of goals than we do as people, yet their goals are the ones driving the software we use, without giving us as users any choice or transparency in the process. This is especially true considering that as a species, we have evolved for over thousands of years without this disruptive technology that has suddenly been thrust upon us. We haven’t even given our biological hardware a chance to adapt or understand this change, yet in the meantime we’ve handed over complete control over our digital lives to a handful of software companies who get to decide how this stuff&nbsp;works.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can’t just will your way out of such a system either. As interface designer Aza Raskin describes it, “You can imagine these things are sort of like, they tilt the floor of human behavior. They make some behavior harder, and some easier. And you’re always free to walk up the hill, but fewer people do. So at society scale, you really are just tilting the floor and changing what billions of people think and&nbsp;do.”</p><p>What’s more is that knowing you’re being manipulated doesn’t necessarily make it any easier to avoid being manipulated. Even the former president of Pinterest Tim Kendall admitted, “I’m going to work during the day and building something that then I am falling prey to [at night]… knowing what was going on behind the curtain, I still couldn’t control my&nbsp;usage.”</p><p>Over time, these platforms are able to gradually change what you do, how you think, and even how you define yourself. Don’t you think that’s something that you should be in charge&nbsp;of?</p><p>We have the potential to take back control over our lives by creating a fundamentally different model, one that puts users at the center of the system and allows them to make informed, consent-driven decisions based on information that exists in context with other relevant data. Instead of a sequence of never-ending algorithms and automated reasoning systems deciding how these platforms function at scale, we can place real people, not software systems, in charge of what we see. This doesn’t mean we go and get rid of all automation. Where there is automation, we should be building in human supervision and human intervention to enable us to mold these systems over time. What it means is effectively redistributing the power from the people creating the platforms to the people using the platforms. When we ask the companies who created these problems to police themselves, the consequences are dire, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/23/21450904/youtube-content-moderator-lawsuit-machine-learning-tradeoffs">devastating effects of content moderation</a> faced by their employees who have experienced trauma-induced health issues and&nbsp;worse.</p><p>The only realistic option is to reframe the problem entirely. We need to redistribute the power that these platforms have been hoarding by decoupling platforms from the monolithic and intractable algorithms that govern their&nbsp;usage.</p><p>If you’ve read this far, congratulations, and I apologize for the speculative science fiction that&nbsp;follows.</p><p>By creating new platforms based on distributed systems that give users substantial control over which platforms, apps, and algorithms they use, and giving them data portability between these choices, we can perhaps start to replace all these unconscious habits (the ones that keep us clicking and scrolling) with better, conscious habits that are more in alignment with who we are and who we want to be (a novel concept, I&nbsp;know).</p><p>Connecting is fundamental to the human experience, and online connection should not be manipulated and coordinated solely by third parties. Users should have the primary say in how we engage with these platforms, which means having some control over how the platforms work.</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;which…</p> Give users an environment that’s free of surveillance <p>You’ve heard it before, but everything you do online is being monitored, stored, analyzed at scale along with the data of everybody you know who uses the internet. This isn’t just a set of harmless analytics that let a business know how their product is performing, this is mass-scale surveillance that serves as the backbone of nearly every popular product and service on the market today. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_advertising">advertising model</a> of today’s “free” consumer platforms makes this behavior nearly impossible to change, simply because it’s so incredibly effective.</p><p>Essentially, by having control over all of the data generated by every single user on a platform, these companies are able to predict, to an increasingly accurate degree, how we will behave and what we will do. This creates what Harvard economist Shoshana Zuboff calls the “<a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/18/google-facebook-online-advertising-ban-surveillance-capitalism/">human futures market</a>,” which allows our behavior and attention to be bought and sold as easily as commodities like oil and&nbsp;steel.</p><p>It’s a feedback loop that changes how we use our apps, what kinds of content we see, and what ideas we encounter. It’s why we are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/268982/impact-increased-political-polarization.aspx">more politically divided than ever</a> and why we can’t seem to break out of our bubbles no matter how hard we try. As long as data is being collected, it is being used, often with complete disregard for the negative effects on us as&nbsp;users.</p><p>The only real way to counteract this phenomenon is to flip it entirely: give users privacy by default instead of surveillance by default. Create an alternative to the human futures market — behavioral prediction based on user data — instead, giving users the tools to build exactly the kind of futures they want for themselves. To do this, we need to give users an environment that allows them to connect with each other without any form of intermediary surveillance, whether that be direct or indirect. This should go beyond what’s being done on encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. We need secure and private connections to be the default mechanism for communication on the web, not the exception, and that means building secure messaging infrastructure into the very core of our new and open internet, making it accessible to&nbsp;all.</p><p>Doing so doesn’t preclude the possibility of users consenting to share their data with others for specific reasons or under specific circumstances. However, it’s imperative that we make this a clear and transparent choice, letting users themselves decide what feedback they give will serve as inputs to the kinds of experiences, user interfaces, and algorithms they use every&nbsp;day.</p><p>And finally…</p> Invert the user attention model <p>Right now, every app, service, and device you use is competing for your attention, giving you a fractured sense of awareness and constantly pulling your focus in circles. This is by design, because each service is constantly making decisions on how to tweak and manipulate our behavior according to their own goals. We travel from our email to Twitter, text messages to Instagram DM’s, YouTube videos then back to email, and so on. Even though this perpetual cycle generally makes us feel terrible, we can’t really escape it, because we have no real alternatives.</p><p>The usage of social media platform TikTok has <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/856051/how-tiktok-captured-generation">exploded in popularity with younger generations</a>, precisely because it’s one of the only platforms that users report makes them feel better after using it, instead of worse. In an effort to be transparent, TikTok recently released information about <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you/">how their algorithms work</a>, confirming that they use a more localized model to dynamically group users based on common interests, rather than using static profiles that lump users into predetermined categories. Despite these important steps, platforms like TikTok remain subject to extreme censorship and manipulation because they rely on an inherently centralized technical architecture. The recent battle over Chinese ownership and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-drops-out-of-bidding-for-tiktoks-u-s-operations-11600039821">transfer of U.S. operations to Oracle</a> are evidence of this, and they don’t bode well for future censorship of the platform.</p><p>What if apps weren’t competing for your attention but actually competing to deliver the most value to you in the most efficient and transparent way possible? In other words, what if the measure of success for a product or service was you spending less time on the app, not&nbsp;more?</p><p>We constantly say technology is a tool, but when we’re not the ones wielding that tool — someone or something else is. As Tristan Harris mentions, the early internet consisted of functional and localized services, essentially it was a “tools-based technology environment.” Over time, it’s evolved into an “addiction-and-manipulation-based technology environment.”</p><p>To return to the original promise of the web, we want to give people the tools to opt out of the manipulation and reclaim their digital experience. Our current system is overpowering human nature and exploiting weaknesses in our biology. Our bodies haven’t adapted to our rapidly progressing technology, and our platforms haven’t given us the option&nbsp;to.</p><p>Obviously, in the grander scheme, these problems aren’t exactly new. Media companies face a very similar issue — they are selling our attention to advertisers and special interests, corrupting the product of “news” by giving us opinion and spin over fact and truth. The internet simply makes this process more efficient than ever, and it’s being adopted in every possible domain, not only by media companies, but also authoritarian governments, political lobbyists, and economic opportunists.</p><p>By inverting the attention model, we can give power back to the people by giving them back their time and their agency. These are irreplaceable resources, precious tools in an age that’s increasingly distracting and fragmented.</p><p>Taking these steps may not solve the problem overnight, but it’s a step in the right direction. If history is any indication, it’s much harder to build protection for users after the fact than to build it as a fundamental feature of the system from its conception. Instead of a handful of people choosing to unplug, or trying to fix a drowning ship, we’re better off starting with a shared vision based on strongly held principles: user agency, privacy, and&nbsp;consent.</p><p>Full disclosure: I work on developing open-source standards and technologies to <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/events-and-conferences/joe-lubins-full-speech-from-devcon-5-how-we-get-to-a-decentralized-world-wide-web/">decentralize the web</a>, building the infrastructure that will give internet users real social and economic agency for the first time and deliver on the original promise of the “web of trust.” You can find more of my writing on the topic on <a href="https://medium.com/@CreatorNader">my blog</a>.

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.jonudell.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

   I have a cute little like green Bodum charcoal BBQ that we can take to the park at the end of the street. But charcoal is a bit of an ordeal so doesn’t get used often. What about a Scottish made gas pizza oven???

 <p>
 If you’ve ever worked on a large piece of software, I’m sure you’ve endured the pain of setting up a complex development environment. Installing and configuring a database, message broker, web server, worker processes, local smtp server, (and who knows what else!) is time consuming for every developer starting on a project. This guide will show you how to set up a docker development environment which will enable you and new developers to get up and running in minutes with even the most complex system. This will make your life much easier in the long run and get new developers up and running on the project much more quickly.
</p>
<p>
 In this guide, we’ll be using
 <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition">
  Docker Community Edition
 </a>
 and
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">
  Docker Compose
 </a>
 . You may want to read up on these tools a bit before proceeding.
</p>
<p>

 Installing Docker
 
<p>
 Grab Docker for your operating system
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community">
  here
 </a>
 . Docker is available for all modern operating systems. For most users, this will also include Docker Compose. Once installed, keep Docker running in the background to use Docker commands!
</p>
 
 Dockerfile Example
 
<p>
 Your
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">
  Dockerfile
 </a>
 is the blueprint for your container. You’ll want to use your Dockerfile to create your desired environment. This includes installing any language runtimes you might need and installing any dependencies your project relies on. Luckily, most languages have a
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from">
  base image
 </a>
 that you can inherit. We’ll get dig into this further with the Dockerfile example below.
</p>
<p>
 Your Dockerfile doesn’t need to include any instructions for installing a database, cache server, or other tools. Each container should be built around a single process. Other processes would normally be defined in other Dockerfiles but you don’t even need to worry about that; in this example, we use 3 readymade containers for our databases and message broker.
</p>

      <code># Inherit from node base image
FROM node

# This is an alternative to mounting our source code as a volume.
# ADD . /app

# Install Yarn repository
RUN curl -sS http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
RUN echo "deb http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Install OS dependencies
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install yarn

# Install Node dependencies
RUN yarn install
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The Dockerfile above does a couple things: first, we inherit from the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/images/node">
  node
 </a>
 base image. This means that it includes the instructions from
 <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/581eebd097343c9f1c1ceb5260cd2ec770410e29/7.10/Dockerfile">
  that image’s Dockerfile
 </a>
 (including whatever base image it inherits from). Second, I install the
 <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">
  Yarn
 </a>
 package manager since I prefer it over the default NodeJs package manager. Note that while my preferred language here is NodeJs, this guide is language independent. Set up your container for whatever language runtime you prefer to work in.
</p>
<p>
 Give it a try and run
 <code>
  docker-compose build
 </code>
 and see what happens.
</p>
 
 Docker Compose Example
 
<p>
 A few sections ago, I mentioned Docker Compose which is a tool to declaratively define your container formation. This means that you can define multiple different process types which all run concurrently in different containers and communicate with one another via http. Docker makes exposing interfaces between containers easier by using what they call
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/service-links/">
  links
 </a>
 . The beauty here is that it’s as simple as working with multiple processes on single machine but you can be sure that there are no tightly coupled components that might not work in a production environment!

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Let’s walk through this example:
</p>
<p>
 We have 7 different containers in our formation:
 
  web
 
 ,
 
  clock
 
 ,
 
  worker
 
 ,
 
  shell
 
 ,
 
  postgres
 
 ,
 
  rabbitmq
 
 , and
 
  redis
 
 . That’s a lot! In a production environment, these processes might each run on separate physical servers; or, the processes all might run on a single machine.
</p>
<p>
 Notice how the web, clock, worker, and shell containers are all built from the current directory. So each of those 4 processes all run on the container that we defined in our Dockerfile. The postgres, rabbitmq, and redis containers, on the other hand, are built from prebuilt images which are found on the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/">
  Docker Store
 </a>
 . Building containers for these tools from images is much quicker than installing each of the tools on your local machine.
</p>
<p>
 Take a look at the
 <code>
  volumes
 </code>
 key. Here, we mounted our current directory at
 <code>
  /app
 </code>
 . Then the
 <code>
  working_dir
 </code>
 key indicates that all commands shall be run relative to this directory.
</p>
<p>
 Ok. Now, take a look at the
 <code>
  links
 </code>
 key present on the locally built containers. This exposes a network interface between this container and the containers listed. Notice how we use the name of the link as the hostname in our environment variables. In this example, we link the containers and then we expose the uri for each of our linked services as environment variables.
</p>
<p>
 Try running one of the services: run the command
 <code>
  docker-compose up web
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Write your application code
 
<p>
 Ok, our server architecture includes 3 process types that run your application code; we have our web process that is responsible for serving web requests and pushing work to a job queue; we have our worker process that is responsible for pulling jobs off the queue and doing the work; and we have our clock process is effectively a cron runner that pushes work onto our job queue.
</p>
<p>
 Our architecture also includes 3 other services that you commonly see in web server architecture: a Postgres database, a Redis datastore, and a RabbitMQ message broker.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s a minimal implementation of the 3 aforementioned processes that also showcase the usage of our 3 data backends:

<p>
 There are example endpoints for each of the different components of our architecture. Visiting
 <code>
  /postgres/:something
 </code>
 will insert something into the postgres database and render a view containing all of the contents. Visiting
 <code>
  /redis
 </code>
 will count the number of visits to that page and display the count. Visiting
 <code>
  /rabbit/:msg
 </code>
 will send a message to the worker process and you can check the terminal logs to see the message. The clock process will also run continuously and send a message to the worker process once every minute. Not bad for a 1 minute set up!
</p>
 
 Pull it all together with a bash script
 
<p>
 I like to write a simple script so I don’t have to memorize as many commands:

 manage.sh

 Done! Now, we don’t need to worry about remembering docker-compose commands. To run our entire server stack we now simply run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh start
 </code>
 . If we need to build our containers again because we changed our Dockerfile or we need to install new dependencies, we can run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh build
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Our shell container exists so that we can shell into our container or run one-off commands in the context of our container. Using the script above, you can run
 <code>
  ./manage shell
 </code>
 to start a terminal session in the container. If you want to run a single command in your container, you can use
 <code>
  ./manage run &lt;command&gt;
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If you’re familiar with the difficulty caused by complex development environments running on your local machine, then investigating a Docker powered development environment could save you time. There is a bit of set up involved but the productivity gained in the long term by using a tool like Docker pays for itself.

   Developing a Framework  <br>  In this post, I am going to explore the relationship between power, agency and influence. The intent is to unpack each of these words and their relationships to each other. Power, agency and influence can have a constructive or destructive relationship cycle. We will explore how power, agency and influence in a constructive cycle lead to better outcomes and conversely how power, agency and influence in a destructive cycle lead to worse outcomes.  <br>  We love the analogy about peeling an onion. We peel back one layer to reveal a new similar layer, each layer enabling us to offer a new idea or thinking and adding complexity. Often we use this model for ourselves to get to our inner core and what values drive us.  <br>    <br>   As we peel back each layer of power, agency and influence, we will find there more complexity and interconnectedness; much we cannot grasp in the context of decision making and governance.  As we peel back more layers of interconnections, we will find there are more dependencies which give rise to layers of uncertainty, ambiguity and remaining is increased risk and uncertainty. No one single outcome is possible; there are always at least two.  <br>  We find we are not peeling an onion but unpicking different ideals, beliefs and connectedness. Peeling the onion does not pick up the relationship and interconnectedness between the layers it does “just removing” layers.  Further, even with different layers, it does not highlight the dynamic and relational processes between different onions.  Power, Agency, and Influence  <br>  <br>    <br>  Figure 1 power, agency and influence  <br>  Power, in the context of figure 1, is that someone/ thing has mastery and is be able to exercise control. Control can be exercised by muscle, state (through policy and legislation), through the mind, through societal norms or state law. There are enormous bodies of work which explore the vast varieties of types of power. The purpose is not to write an essay on power but rather to understand power, in a context of agency and influence.  <br>  We do not consider by whose authority power is sort, taken or given in any situation, only that someone has control, neither are we exploring the links to sovereignty.  <br>  Agency in the context of figure 1, specifically human agency, can be defined as an actor who has the capacity to act. Individual agency is framed by our views on responsibility and accountability. Agency in terms of our action depends on our motivation, capacity, and experience. Given that agency is defined by an actor who has the capacity, there is a deep link to biochemistry and nutrition. Agency on its own, without understanding the brain-gut axis alongside traditional capacities, means we don't fully appreciate why we might do act in a certain way.  <br>  Influence in the context of figure 1, is the “person” in this case who can help determine an outcome. The influencer can affect the character, development, or behaviour of someone or something. Influence and influencers can use incentives, skills and tools on those with Agency and Power. Incentives may be economic in terms of more power, more agency or money and the influencer has changed behaviour in the system, player or actors such that they have created the outcome they wanted. To influence, they may use skills such as creating doubt, forgetting to pass on information, inducing guilt, shame, research, presentation of risk or creating/ ignoring bias. The influencer who uses these kinds of skills is like Machiavelli, where the outcome happens using any means. The tools which an influencer can use include: education, knowledge, facts, access, nudge, behavioural economics and science.  <br>  With power, agency and influence, we have to consider who, in and given context the actors are.  In the vast majority of cases, the actor will come with a bias towards a political agenda, an economic/commerce agenda or a personal agenda.  It is self-evident when we discuss power agency and influence that power might rest with a politician, the actor with agency might be represented as a business, and the influencer could be individual. While all the other combinations are possibilities, this paper is not going to explore all scenarios. Still, we want to think through what leads to a constructive relationship or a destructive relationship and how we might understand it. As this helps inform the future of governance.  <br>  The scenario below explores starts from the influencer, which in this case is the prime mover. Again it would be entirely possible that we could start from power or agency as the prime mover.  The scenario is summarised in Figure 2, destructive relationships.  <br>  Consider an influencer, a regulator, whose primary role is to write and provide regulation. [In many cases the regulator has power to enforce regulation, but consider the power in this case rests with those who provide the legislative framework for the regulator to exist, act and as such have teeth[powers.]) As an influencer of the market, you wish to have the most significant regulatory body possible. The larger your staff and reach of your regulatory body, the more kudos and job opportunities will come to the senior leadership team. You will win more<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"> awards</a> and be paid more. As the influencer, you propose rules, regulation and law to the person in power. Of note, power is shifting in this relationship as a regulator has both delegated authority to create more regulation and take on more power. The relationship between the influencer and the person with power is such that the influencer persuades the body with power that the more rules and regulations they have the more power the person who holds power will have. In this scenario, we can see that the person with power is the government. The government, through its economic policy, believes that rules, regulation and law provides the right degree of control and restriction over the people with agency. The government interpretation of what is best for the market leads them to believe that control and restriction will end up with a more efficient and effective market than one left to run on its own.  The person with agency and a free market position now face a barrage of red tape, rules, regulation and law in which they can operate. The person with agency treats the person with influence with suspicion, and they are unwilling to share data or information openly. The person with the influence has to write more rules to create enforcement and reporting. The relationship between the person with agency and the person with influence is one driven by secrecy and trying to avoid the overly restrictive regulatory environment. This scenario creates a very destructive loop, one that we see in highly regulated markets. Each of the players is unable to break their behaviour. The person with influence wants more rules and regulation, the person with power enjoys the control and probably a conflict of interest with tax income, the person with agency finds every way to ensure there is not more regulation by sharing the least information possible and complying to tick box compliance.  <br>    <br>  Figure 2 Destructive Relationships  <br>  What this scenario starts to set out is that is when each of the players in a destructive loop behaves destructively it is a near-impossible cycle to escape. What may be less evident is that if one player acts destructively, and in their own interests, all the players will start to work in their own interests, and a destructive cycle will evolve. The player who kicks starts a destructive cycle can be the influencer wanting a more significant role, the person in power wanting more control over the agents, or the person with agency who wants to hide and not be transparent. When we look at the constructive cycle next, we can see that if all the players act constructively, there's a very different outcome, but it does require all of the players to continue to act constructively to keep the cycle going. A diversion into game theory would be prudent here if this were a book&nbsp;  <br>  Starting with the same prime mover who is the ‘influencer’ let's now consider a constructive cycle. This is summarised in Figure 3 constructive Relationships.  <br>  In this scenario, the influencer believes in a smaller lighter regulator doing the right thing; they believe in education and rights. The influencer can approach the person with power and rather than demanding more rules and regulations, they suggest that the person with power should educate and give more freedom to the person with agency.  In this case, the person with the agency can respond by effectively giving the person with power more power through the freedom that's been granted to them. By example, highly competitive markets in capitalist based economies (transport, entertainment, leisure, utilities) have become less regulated. Still, aspects of the delivery and operations, such as health and safety, remain highly regulated.  <br>  Further, in a constructive cycle, the person with agency will likely have an open and trusting relationship with the person with influence. It could be likely, but the agency/influencer relationship is one of the relevant transparency. The influencer, because they can determine what the person with agency is doing by, say API access to the dataset can instruct the person with power on the right types of education that the market needs.  Further, considering “<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">Rights</a>” to be offered to various people with agency in the market who can use freedom constructively for a better society, which builds more trust relationships.  <br>    <br>  Figure 3 Constructive Relationships  <br>  Contrasting the two cycles,  constructive and destructive, the obvious question is what leads to a constructive or a destructive outcome. Further, in the destructive cycle, do the consequences get worse for all the players and in the constructive cycle, do the outcomes get better? In the destructive cycle, it could be argued that the outcome for the influencer is hugely beneficial as they end up with the larger regulatory body, more market kudos and an increase in their income. Equally, the person with power may believe this route enables them to raise more tax income. So if we look purely at outcomes it depends on which outcomes for whom as how we make the judgement if the cycle is constructive or destructive. Do we want better outcomes for humanity and society or a few players?  <br>  This framework is to set oversight and governance in a different context. The current governance thinking for a regulated industry is biased towards more rules, regulation and law. Given this political design, driven by a desire to change those with agencies behaviour?  We may not end up with the outcome we intended, better banking, better transport or better utilities. The current government thinking on unregulated Industries is more liberal. Still, that thinking has not generated better outcomes for society as we have seen from climate change and the broken supply chain model as a result of the pandemic. The reason for presenting this framework is to reflect on the question; “is this working for us”. As shown in the opening pages of this paper, it is clear that the current cycles of governance and oversight are not working for regulated or unregulated Industries. Therefore, we need to think about the future of governance that can take us forward from where we are and does not just do more of the same.  <br>  Using the model to consider the set of relationships between shareholders, director, and the executive team.  This is set out in Figure 4 Board Relationships  <br>  Whilst the diagram shows power rests with the shareholder, equally, power can be the directors or exec team, agency can with the shareholders and exec team and influence with the shareholder or directors.  Every combination is possible.  The point here is less about the possible scenarios and relationships but the special case where a founder is a Director, major shareholder and CEO.  <br>    <br>  Figure 4 Board Relationships  <br>  In the special cases where a team is able to hold power, agency and influence there is a significant increase in the need for better governance and oversight to outside parties that decisions are fair, reasonable, explainable and have wider benefits.  <br>  It is worth drawing a personal view of a commercial, charity or health situation you are aware of, using the power, agency and influence framework to think about how the actors act to create better outcomes for say the capital providers.

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  The Green New Deal may not be Joe Biden's climate plan, but you better believe he knows it deeply and could dive deep into the details.

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t news, Kellyanne.</p>
<p>Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so
we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to
address the planetary crisis at our feet.</p>
<p>Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! Let’s do this thing.</p>

There are some serious consequences for those who are Directors with responsibly.  How do you know when someone presenting to you is trying to bluff, mislead, guide, lie, direct or nudge you to a particular outcome. Over time individuals who serve on boards learn the skills of emotional maturity to help determine if they are being guided to a decision or a decision made for them. In truth, unpicking intent was hard anyway even when we all met up in one room, but it is far harder now with video. We have lost access to the face-to-face skills and the experiences we have built up as we are not in the same room. How do we detect the signals again? <br><br>We need to recognise that we have not (yet) developed all the essential skills for a digital life. This is never more true than when we are making judgement or decisions that matter as they have consequences. We have no eye contact (we look at screens and not the camera), everything is in reverse, poor video quality and block images take away our concentration, I look at my stream far too much, I am easily distracted by other inbound messages, I cannot look round and see how others are reacting, there is no body language ( are they hot, are they sweating, are they nervous, are they ….) and no sense of gut or instinct.<br><br>Technology could help, but we are not sure it is the right answer. We can detect heart rate variance, changes in skin resistance (sweat), we can monitor blood pressure, we can follow eye movement, we can monitor breathing rates and indeed we can sense movement. Voice, language, words choice, pitch and tone can also be captured and analysed. All the basic physiological signals we as humans pick up can be detected and captured in a digital scenario. However, all these sensors will be owned by someone else who will have control over your data, your emotions and what I am told about your reaction will be based on an algorithm and not on my own sense. How do we know the sensors to analysis is right and not biased? <br><br>Alternatively, we could improve the provenance and lineage of data we receive in a board pack, we can utilise API’s to gain data and reports directly from the system with no-human intervention but is this really the role of the board to verify and check everything. Such a remit driven by FUD becomes control, the loss of trust prevails and there is a change in culture to the detriment of the stakeholders. <br><br>It is an interesting crossroads, do we learn new skills, new ways of doing things, new ways of sensing and monitoring or do we delegate our capacity to an algorithm to help us?  <br>   Who decides?   <br>

<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Explore the standards-based scalable identifiers and encrypted data storage tools that power Transmute’s product.</p>An example of the Transmute Encrypted Data Vaults Workbench document&nbsp;preview.<p>Transmute is proud to announce the release of several new technical workbenches as a part of our continued commitment to open-standards development, interoperability, and product transparency. Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Lists can help solve some of Twitter’s major pain&nbsp;points <p>“Unfollowing everyone on Twitter and switching to lists for better control of my feed. Nothing personal, love you all! “ — Github CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=03">Nat Friedman&nbsp;9/19/20</a></p><p>Twitter is my favorite social&nbsp;network.</p><p>It is a treasure trove of enlightening blog posts, news articles, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmorieBeck/status/1303800700829392902">research papers</a>, and video content that I would never see in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795110">the stagnant echo chamber</a> that is my Facebook news feed; a place filled with content posted primarily by former classmates who seem to have frighteningly homogenous political opinions and little apparent interest in seriously engaging with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>On Twitter, I have the freedom to engage with a heterogeneous network of thinkers from diverse geographical and ideological backgrounds. The platform has vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current events and trends. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/">A 2018 study</a> found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf">compelling evidence</a> that Twitter isn’t very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209">the abundance</a> of content comes at a high psychological cost:</p>  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9">Information overload</a> makes me feel like I’m drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds. Finding the signal that I’m searching for in a sea of noise takes&nbsp;work.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922">Fear</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629">missing out</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html">fear of not knowing</a> compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may have missed. “Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling…”  <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a> are an under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform’s potential to facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues&nbsp;by:</p>  Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to manage lists provides a much smoother Twitter user experience.  Providing raw data, via the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list">Twitter API</a>, that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling.  <p>Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic discourse that transcends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">left/right paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en">focuses</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728">addressing</a> systemic <a href="https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995">issues</a> rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.</p><p>Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help citizens fulfill their obligation to be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html">well informed</a> and perhaps even allow us to escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us&nbsp;in.</p><p>Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum">recently announced</a> plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists and drastically increase Twitter’s potential to serve the common&nbsp;good.</p><p>You can get started with exploring lists by checking out a few that I’ve&nbsp;made:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086059106874474496">AI</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/197289909">Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153">Blockchain Gaming</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1202739597286854656">Cryptofunds</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576">Cryptogurus</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276220409445101568">Decentralized Finance</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1054920788019572736">Ethereum</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1306382711196590081">Gen Z&nbsp;Mafia</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584">Systems Thinkers</a>  <p>And some great public lists that others have&nbsp;created:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460429">Astronomers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/967118678205505536">Bitcoin Developers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/875371355570487296">Crypto</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295245028386918402">Cryptoart</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/93883642">Congress</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/128331">Digital and Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/5158212">Economics</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/55356059">Financial News</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/84693025">Futurists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/73010929">Health Innovators</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/7450">Investors/VC/Angel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1023884">Machine Learning</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226161844793966593">Media \\&nbsp;Content</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/222800557">Neuroscience</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215437668">Philosophers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460480">Physicists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/68365941">Wall Street Influencers</a>  <p>Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/shingaithornton">@shingaithornton</a> with any thoughts on lists or suggestions for how to improve the ones I’m working&nbsp;on.</p><p>This piece was originally posted <a href="https://blog.shingaithornton.com/twitter-lists-are-underrated/">on my personal&nbsp;blog</a>.</p>

<p>But I can't take credit for APConf 2020... organization and support are thanks to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Sebastian Lasse, and <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">FOSSHost</a> for hosting the website and BigBlueButton instance and <a href="https://conf.tube/">conf.tube</a> for generously hosting all the videos.  There's a <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/87bc99dd-b1b8-4fc3-b034-dca805388179">panel about the organization of APConf</a> you can watch if you're interested in more of that!  (And of course, all the other great videos too!)</p>
<p>So... what about that week I was going to work on Terminal Phase?
Well... I'm still planning on doing it but admittedly it hasn't
happened yet.  All of the above took more time than expected.
However, today I am working on my talk about Spritely Goblins for
RacketCon, and as it turns out, extending Terminal Phase is a big part
of that talk.  But I'll announce more soon when the Terminal Phase
stuff happens.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>

   <p></p>  <br> <br> <p>I wrote about the original reactions to COVID <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/entering-the-3rd-phase-of-the-business-response-to-covid19-burnout-a75174fa220a">here</a>, in that post I reviewed how we had responded and the cost to human by examining Burnout and Breakdown.&nbsp; These are the first two B’s.&nbsp; Burnout being the rising at 6 AM walking 23.5 steps to the computer, 12 hours of zoom calls. 37 steps via the fridge back to bed and repeat.&nbsp; A few unable to escape the workload and demands of being able to work from home.&nbsp; Breakdown being two working adults in a one bed flat with young children, desperate to work but unable. Lacking private space and with a burden or threat of losing their paid role, breakdown becomes a reality for far too many families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Blue-collar workers have done the same job, the same role, having the same breakfast and lunch, driving the same route to the same office for 20 years.&nbsp; The repetitive nature leads to call centre levels of boredom.&nbsp; White-collar workers have lost travel, flexibility, meeting people and all aspects that gave them a spark. We are now all repeating the same role, at the same screen with the same people and life has become boring and there is no end in sight.&nbsp;Thrid B</p><p>A few with capital and have assets are Blessed by this lockdown.&nbsp; The 4th B. This came from a chat with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian-tett/">Gillian Tett</a> whom I have known since growing up and those formation days.&nbsp; Blessed being we have space and assets and that the change in lifestyle has had a positive impact.&nbsp; A (re)discovery of family, friends, the outside and sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>The 5th B is that we don’t want a “new normal” or the “old normal.”&nbsp; The old normal was rubbish when we look back.&nbsp; A new normal build on the old will not be better.&nbsp; I really want something Better.&nbsp; I am not sure what Better looks like right now, but I know what it does not look like.&nbsp; It is clear that Better will have a more equal view about space, time and humanity.&nbsp;We might value things that don't have a cost or price.</p><p>The 6th B is a major worry for me - this is the "Bottom of the market". Again something Gillain and I explored.  The students, those who left school, those in their early career, those left adrift from the loss of the travel, entertainment and retail markets.&nbsp; We have saddled this generation with debts, both in the form of capital and emotional. Right now we have also removed hope.&nbsp; We have to find a way to care for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last B is one that affects all of us. It is a loss of community, a loss of togetherness, a loss of connection, and a loss of connectedness.&nbsp; We have lost #belonging.&nbsp; I belonged to groups from the office to friends on the train,my sports club, the coffee shop all the way to meeting new people.&nbsp; We have become individuals by the nature of our policies, politics and capital which means I am now personalised in everything, but I now realise I want to belong.&nbsp; </p> <br>

And I didn’t hear about it, actually; I saw it on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sunday-morning/">CBS’ Sunday Morning</a>, where her face passed somewhere between Tom Seaver’s and John Thompson’s in the September 6 show’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/passage-in-memoriam-9-6-2020/">roster of the freshly dead</a>. I was shocked: She was older than both those guys and far less done. Or done at all, except technically. Death seems especially out of character for her, of all people.</p>
<p>Credit where due: The New York Times did post <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/books/gail-sheehy-dead.html">a fine obituary</a>, and&nbsp;New York, for which she wrote much, has&nbsp;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/gail-sheehy-never-stopped-reporting-a-tribute-from-new-york-magazine.html">an excellent remembrance</a>&nbsp;in the magazine by&nbsp;Christopher Bonanos (<a href="https://twitter.com/heybonanos">@heybonanos</a>). Writes Bonanos,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sheehy had an 18th book in the works, and it would have been — or will be, if someone else takes to the finish line — a fascinating one. Instead of reporting amid her peers (she was a few years older than the boomers, but roughly in their cohort), she set out to write a kind of echo of Passages, but this time about the millennial generation. And I can tell you that she was reveling in the immersion among people 50 and 60 years younger than she. She went to clubs with college guys and got out on the dance floor, and (by her account, at least) they were disarmed and amused by her — which is to say that she’d found every journalist’s sweet spot, where people get loose and comfortable enough to reveal themselves. She was constantly offering bits and pieces of her findings as magazine stories and columns. Some would work as stand-alone pieces and others wouldn’t, but all were tesserae in what was clearly going to be a big ambitious swoop of sociology. At New York, we were so taken with this project that we had also begun work on a profile of her…</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gail_sheehy">@Gail_Sheehy</a> is chronologically uncorrected. Her website, <a href="https://gailsheehy.com/">GailSheehy.com</a>, also still speaks of her in the present tense: “For her new book-in-progress, she’s a woman on a mission to redefine the most misunderstood generation: millennials. They are struggling with the rupture in gender roles and a crisis in mental health. But this generation of 20- and 30-somethings is also inventing radically new passages.”</p>
<p>Gail Sheehy’s writing isn’t just solid; it is enviably good. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/gail-sheehy-quotes">BrainyQuotes has 71 samples</a>, which is&nbsp;far short of sufficient. One goes,&nbsp;It is a paradox that as we reach our prime, we also see there is a place where it finishes. (Tell me about it. I’m only ten years younger than she was.)</p>
<p>As it happens, I’m writing this in the home library of a friend. On its many shelves a single spine stands out:&nbsp;<a href="https://gailsheehy.com/pathfinders">Pathfinders</a>, published in 1981. I pull it down and open it at random, knowing I’ll find something worth sharing from a page there. Here ya go, under the subhead&nbsp;Secrets of Well-being:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like the dance of brilliant reflections on a clear pond, well-being is a shimmer that accumulates from many important life choices, mad over the years by a mind that is not often muddied by pretense or ignorance and a heart that is open enough to sense people in their depths and to intuit the meaning of most situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is an afterlife, I am sure Gail Sheehy is already reporting on it.</p>

  <p>Summary: The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>



	<a></a>

<p>
    Introductory note: I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>, that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a used model for thinking about identity online.
</p>

<p>
    John Locke was an English philosopher who thought a lot about power: who had it, how it was used, and how it impacted the structure of society. Locke’s theory of mind forms the foundation for our modern ideas about identity and independence. Locke argued that "sovereign and independent" was man’s natural state and that we gave up freedom, our sovereignty,  in exchange for something else, protection, sociality, and commerce, among others. This grand bargain forms the basis for any society. 
</p>

<p>
    This question of power and authority is vital in identity systems. We can ask "what do we give up and to whom in a given identity system?" More succinctly we ask: who controls what? In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> I made the argument that self-sovereign identity, supporting heterarchical (peer-to-peer) interaction, enables rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents. I argued that the architecture of SSI, its structure, made those relationships more authentic.
</p>

<p>
    In this post, I intend to explore the details of that architecture so we can better understand the legitimacy of SSI as an identity system for online interaction. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)">defines legitimacy</a> as 
</p>
<blockquote>the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.</blockquote>
<p>
    While the idea of legitimacy is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that function in an authoritative manner and have large impacts on people and society.  Without legitimacy, people and organizations using an identity system will be unable to act because anyone they interact with will not see that action as authorized. My thesis is that SSI provides a more legitimate basis for online identity than administrative identity systems of the past. 
</p>


 Terminology 
<p>
    While we properly talk of identity systems, identity systems do not manage identities, but rather relationships. Identity systems provide the means necessary for remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered. Identifiers are unique within some namespace. The namespace gives context to the identifiers since the same string of characters might be a phone number in one system and a product ID in another. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller who by virtue of knowing the authentication factors can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claiming it by logging in). The controller might be a person, organization, or software system. The controller might be the subject that the identifier refers to, but not necessarily. The authentication factors might be a password, key fob, cryptographic keys, or something else. The strength and nature of the bindings between the controller, authentication factors, and identifier determine the strength and nature of the relationships built on top of them. 
</p>

<p>
    To understand why that's so, we introduce the concept of a root of trust1. A root of trust is a foundational component or process in the identity system that is relied on by other components of the system and whose failure would compromise the integrity of the bindings. A root of trust might be primary or secondary depending on whether or not it is replaceable. Primary roots of trust are irreplaceable. Together, the roots of trust form the trust basis for the system.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis enabled by the identity system underlies a particular trust domain. The trust domain is the set of digital activities that depend on the binding of the controller to the identifier. For example, binding a customer to an identifier allows Amazon to trust that the actions linked to the identifier are authorized by the controller. Another way to look at this is that the strength of the binding between the identifier and customer (controller) determines the risk that Amazon assumes in honoring those actions.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of the controller-identifier binding depends on the strength of the binding between the controller and the authentication factors and between the authentication factors and the identifier. Attacking either of those bindings reduces the trust we have in the controller-identifier binding and increases the risk that actions taken through a particular identifier are unauthorized.
</p>


 Identity Architectures 

<p>
    We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust: 
</p>
 
     Administrative
     
     Algorithmic
     
     Autonomic
     
 

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic are SSI systems. They are distinguished by their trust bases. Some SSI systems use one or the other and some (like Sovrin) are hybrid, employing each for different purposes. We'll discuss the properties of the trust basis for each of these in an effort to understand the comparative legitimacy of SSI solutions to traditional administrative ones. 
</p>

<p>
    These architectures differ in who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. We call this control authority. The entity with control authority takes action through operations that affect the creation (inception), updating, rotation, revocation, deletion, and delegation of the authentication factors and their relation to the identifier. How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Administrative Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an administrative architecture rely on an administrator to bind the identifier to the authentication factors. The administrator is the primary root of trust for any domain with an administrative architecture. Almost every identity system in use today has an administrative architecture and their trust basis is founded on the administrator.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: The trust basis in administrative identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the interactions between the controller, identifier and authentication factors in an administrative identity system, the role of the administrator, and the impact these have on the strength of the bindings. The controller usually generates the authentication factors by choosing a password, linking a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism, or generating keys.
</p>

<p>
    Even though the identifier might be the controller's email address, phone number, public key, or other ID, the administrator "assigns" the identifier to the controller because it is their policy that determines which identifiers are allowed, whether they can be updated, and their legitimacy within the identity system's domain. The administrator "owns" the identifier within the domain. The administrator also asserts the binding between the identifier and the authentication factors. An employee's mistake, a policy change, or a hack could affect the binding between the identifier and authentication factors or the identifier and the controller. Consequently, these bindings are relatively weak. Only the binding between the controller and authentication factors is strong because the controller generates them.
</p>

<p>
    The administrator's primary duty is to authoritatively assert the controller-identifier binding. Authoritative control statements about the identifier are recorded in the administrator's database, the source of truth in the system, subject to change by employees and hackers. The administrator might be an ecommerce site that maintains an identity system as the basis for its customer's account. In this case the binding is private, and its integrity is of interest only to the web site and the customer. Alternatively, the administrator might provide federated login services. In this case the administrator is asserting the controller-identifier binding in a semi-public manner to anyone who relies on the federated login. A certificate authority is an example of an administrator who publicly asserts the controller-identifier binding, signing a certificate to that effect.
</p>

<p>
    Because the administrator is responsible for binding the identifier to both the authentication factors and the controller, the  administrator is the primary root of trust and thus the basis for trust in the overall system. Regardless of whether the binding is private, semi-public, or public, the integrity of the binding is entirely dependent on the administrator and the strength of their infrastructure, policies, employees, and continued existence. The failure of any of those can jeopardize the binding, rendering the identity system unusable by those who rely on it.
</p>

<a></a>
 Algorithmic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems that rely on a ledger have an algorithmic architecture. I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others. Of course, it's not just algorithms. Algorithms are embodied in code, written by people, running on servers. How the code is written, its availability to scrutiny, and the means by which it is executed all impact the trust basis for the system. "Algorithmic" is just shorthand for all of this. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: The trust basis in algorithmic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 3 shows how the controller, authentication factors, identifier, and ledger are bound in an identity system with an algorithmic architecture. As in the administrative identity system, the controller generates the authentication factors, albeit in the form of a public-private key pair. The controller keeps and does not share the private key. The public key, on the other hand, is used to derive an identifier (at least in well-designed SSI systems) and both are registered on the ledger. This registration is the inception of the controller-identifier binding since the controller can use the private key to assert her control over the identifier as registered on the ledger. Anyone with access to the ledger can determine algorithmically that the controller-identifier binding is valid.
</p>

<p>
    The controller makes authoritative control statements about the identifier. The events marking these operations are recorded on the ledger which becomes the source of truth for anyone interested in the binding between the identifier and authentication factors.
</p>

<p>
    In an identity system with an algorithmic trust basis, computer algorithms create a ledger that records the key events. The point of the ledger is that no party has the power to unilaterally decide whether these records are made, modified, or deleted and how they're ordered. Instead, the system relies on code executed in a decentralized manner to make these decisions. The nature of the algorithm, the manner in which the code is written, and the methods and rules for its execution all impact the integrity of the algorithmic identity system and consequently any bindings that it records.
</p>


<a></a>
 Autonomic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an autonomic architecture function similarly to those with an algorithmic architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the controller generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with anyone.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 4: Trust basis in autonomic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The controller uses her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log2. One of the important realizations that make autonomic identity systems possible is that the key event log must only be ordered in the context of a single identifier, not globally. So, a ledger is not needed for recording operations on identifiers that are not public. The key event log can be shared with and verified by anyone who cares to see it.
</p>

<p>
    The controller also uses the private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means of cryptographically responding to challenges to prove her control of the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for the controller to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier. Thus anyone (any entity) can create and establish control over an identifier namespace in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority. 
</p>

<p>
    Autonomic identifiers have a number of advantages: 
</p>
 
     Self-Certification—autonomic identifiers are self-certifying so there is no reliance on a third party.
     
     Self-Administration—autonomic identifiers can be independently administered by the controller.  
      Cost—autonomic identifiers are virtually free to create and manage. 
     
     Security—because the keys are decentralized, there is no trove of secrets that can be stolen. 
     
     Regulatory—since autonomic identifiers need not be publicly shared or stored in an organization’s database, regulatory concern over personal data can be reduced.
     
     Scale—autonomic identifiers scale with the combined computing capacity of all participants, not some central system. 
     
     Independent—autonomic identifiers are not dependent on any specific technology or even being online.

 Algorithmic and Autonomic Identity In Practice 

<p>
    We are all familiar with administrative identity systems. We use them all the time. Less familiar are algorithmic and autonomic identity systems. Their use is emerging under the title of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a>.

<p>
    There are several parallel development efforts supporting algorithmic and autonomic identifiers. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier specification</a> is the primary guide to algorithmic identifiers that live on a ledger. The DID specification provides for many DID methods that allow DIDs to live on a variety of data stores. There's nothing in the DID specification itself that requires that the data store be a blockchain or ledger, but that is the primary use case.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">written about the details of decentralized identifiers</a> before. DIDs have a number of important properties that make them ideal as algorithmic identifiers. Specifically, they are non-reassignable, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized.
</p>

<p>
    As algorithmic identifiers, DIDs allow the controller to cryptographically make authoritative statements about the identifier and the keys it is bound to. Those statements are recorded on a ledger or blockchain to provide a record of the key events that anyone with access to the ledger can evaluate. The record is usually public since the purpose of putting them on a ledger is to allow parties who don't have an existing relationship to evaluate the identifier and its linkage to the controller and public keys. 
</p>

<p>
    There are two related efforts for autonomic identifiers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> is a general-purpose self-certifying system for autonomic identifiers. KERI identifiers are strongly bound at inception to a public-private key pair. All operations on the identifier are recorded in a cryptographic key event log. KERI has strong security and accountability properties. Drummond Reed has made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_564J1B3LfBHc_FQnO8jUMiYEx084LVUsHsY1mYPa6U/edit#slide=id.g9398465ffb_33_0">proposal that would allow KERI autonomic identifiers to be used with any DID method</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The second option is <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">Peer DIDs</a>. The vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things need not be public and thus have no need for the ability to publicly resolve the DID. Peer DIDs fill this need with the benefits of autonomic identifiers listed above. 
</p>

<p>
    Like KERI, Peer DIDs maintain a key event log (called "deltas") that records the relevant operations on the keys in a cryptographic manner. The Peer DID key event log can be shared with other parties in the relationship over <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a>, a protocol that allows parties to a relationship to securely and privately share authenticated messages. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">security and authority of a DIDComm channel</a> are rooted in DIDs and their associated authentication factors. DIDComm can be used over a wide variety of transports.
</p>

<p>
    The vast majority of digital relationships are peer to peer and should use autonomic identifiers. Algorithmic identifiers allow for public discovery of identifier properties when relationships are not peer to peer. In the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>3, the ledger records public DIDs for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential</a> issuers. But people, organizations, and things form relationships using peer DIDs without need for the ledger. This hybrid use of both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems was designed so that credential exchange would be practical, secure, and private while reducing the correlation that might occur if individuals used a few DIDs on a ledger.
</p>


 Comparing Identity Architectures 
<p>
    Table 1 summarizes the architectural properties of identity systems with administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic bases of trust. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Table 1: Architectural properties of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The table shows how the locus of control, source of truth, root of trust, and trust basis differ for each of our three architectures. For Administrative systems, the administrator is directly in control of all four of these. In an algorithmic architecture, the controller is the locus of control because the ledger is set up to allow the controller to be in charge of all key operations. Sometimes this is done using special administrative keys instead of the keys associated with the identifier. The organizations or people operating nodes on the ledger <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">never have access to the keys necessary to unilaterally change the record of operations</a>. No third party is involved in autonomic identity systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Table 2 summarizes the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems4.
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Table 2: Summarizing the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We can see from the evaluation that algorithmic and autonomic architectures are decentralized while the administrative system has a single point of failure—the third party administrator. As a result administrative systems are less secure since an attack on one party can yield a trove of valuable information. Administrative systems also rely on privacy by policy rather than having privacy preserving features built into the architecture. And, as we've seen, all too often privacy is in direct conflict with the administrator's profit motive leading to weak privacy policies. 
</p>

 Power and Legitimacy 

<p>
    I started this post by talking about power and legitimacy. From our discussion and the summary tables above, we know that power is held very differently in these three systems. In an administrative system, the administrator holds all the power. I argued in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> that the architecture of our identity systems directly impacts the quality and utility of the digital relationships they support. Specifically, the power imbalance inherent in administrative identity systems yields anemic relationships. In contrast, the balance of power engendered by SSI systems (both algorithmic and autonomic) yields richer relationships since all parties can contribute to it.  
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, administrative identity systems have legitimacy—if they didn't, no one would use or trust them.  As new architectures, algorithmic and autonomic systems have yet to prove themselves through usage. But we can evaluate each architecture in terms of the promises it makes and how well it does in the purposes of an identity system: recognizing, remembering, and relying on other parties in the relationship. These are largely a function of the trust basis for the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems promise an account for taking actions that the administrator allows. They also promise these accounts will be secure and private. But people and organizations are increasingly concerned with privacy and seemingly non-stop security breaches are chipping away at that legitimacy. As noted above, the privacy promise is often quite limited. Since the administrator is the basis for trust, administrative systems allow the administrator to recognize, remember, and rely on the identifier depending on their security. But the account holder does not get any support from the administrative system in recognizing, remembering, or relying on the administrator. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship is strictly one-way and anemic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    SSI systems promise to give anyone the means to securely and privately create online relationships and trustworthily share self-asserted and third-party-attested attributes with whoever they chose. These promises are embodied in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">property I call fidelity</a>. To the extent that algorithmic and autonomic identity systems deliver on these promises, they will be seen as legitimate. 
</p>

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems provide strong means for recognizing, remembering, and relying on the identifiers in the relationship. For an algorithmic system, we must trust the ledger as the primary root of trust and the trust basis. Clearly our trust in the ledger will depend on many factors, including the code and the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">governance that controls its operation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis for an autonomic identity system is cryptography. This implies that digital key management will become an important factor in its legitimacy. If people and organizations cannot easily manage the keys in such a system, then it will not be trusted. There is hope that key management can be solved since the primary artifacts that people using an SSI system manipulate are relationships and credentials, not keys and secrets. By supporting a consistent user experience rooted in familiar artifacts from the physical world, SSI promises to make cryptography a usable technology by the majority of people on the Internet.
</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>
    In this article, we've explored the high-level architectures for the identity systems in use today as well as new designs that promise richer, more authentic online relationships, better security, and more privacy. By exploring the trust bases that arise from these architectures we've been able to explore the legitimacy of these architectures as a basis for online identity. My belief is that a hybrid system that combines algorithmic public identifiers with autonomic private identifiers can provide a universal identity layer for the Internet, increasing security and privacy, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">reducing friction</a>, and providing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">new</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">better</a> online experiences.

 Notes 
 
     Often the term root of trust is used to a hardware device or some trusted hardware component in the computer. The usage here is broader and refers to anything that is relied on for trust in the identity system. Trust anchor is a term that has sometimes been used in the cryptography community to refer to this same concept.   
     A number of cryptographic systems are trivially self-certifying (e.g. PGP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). What sets the autonomic identity systems described here apart is the key event log. Sam Smith calls these identifiers “autonomic identifiers” to set them apart from their less capable counterparts and emphasize their ability to self-manage keys without recourse to a third party system.
     
     The Sovrin Network is an operational instance of the code found in the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> projects.

<p>Understanding the harms caused from datism </p>

<p>Yesterday was a big day, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™ released their <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>See my related post and <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/09/25/the-release-of-the-humanity-power-action-kit-and-the-30-day-challenge/">my personal testimonial</a> on the value of the Humanity Power framework.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I reflect on the powerful framework and message that Humanity Power has built, I’ve not been able to not stop considering how it relates to the emerging personal information economy and the role that data plays, both positively and negatively, throughout society.</p>



<p>I believe that datism, data’s dark side, is one of the many ‘ism that we must strive to eradicate if we are to truly be free to thrive in today’s data-driven society.</p>



 What is an ‘ism 



<p>Lets first start with understanding what an ‘ism is and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?</p>



 
<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>

<blockquote>
<p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>
Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>




<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 Identity Praxis is a proponent of Humanity Power and looks to add one more ‘ism to the conversation: dataism 



<p><a href="https://www.identitypraxis.com">Identity Praxis</a> is a proponent of Humanity Power, it is through unity that we can all find balance, joy, and achievement of purpose. Also, it is the perfect platform to discuss another ‘ism that is plaguing society, dataism.</p>



<p>David Brooks in his 2013&nbsp;article “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html">The Philosophy of Data</a>,” considers dataism an ethical system. And, Yuval Noah Harari, in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537994938&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=homo+deus">Homo Deus</a>, suggested dataism is a new form of religion that reveres big data. I see it as something more sinister. I see it to be more in the light of the other ‘isms, in that is divides and segregates more than drives unity.</p>




<blockquote>
<p>Dataism, as an economic and social movement, relates to how people’s data, their identity and personal information, is being used by society’s private and public actors for gain to the detriment of the society-at-large and the individual who is the data subject.</p>
</blockquote>




<p>Today, data is being used and co-opted by public (aka government) and private (aka organizations) for economic, political, and social gain, a situation often referred to as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">surveillance capitalism</a>. People, individual data subjects, are being left out of the data flow equation, they don’t have a seat at the table.</p>



<p>While the flow of data throughout the world brings significant good to our societies and economies, and to the individual in many contexts, the fact that individuals have largely been left out of the decision-making process as to how their data is collected and used is a problem.</p>



<p>As with the other isms, dataism is causing harm to individuals and society at large, impart and due to, among other things, an imbalance of the flow of data, the value derived from the flow of data, and the risks generated by the flow of data; and, sadly, most people don’t even know this is happening or comprehend the long-term implications.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that dataism is both independent and interdependent in relation to the other ‘isms. It stands alone, as well as influences and is influenced by the other ‘isms.</p>



<p>At a micro level, dataism is causing harm, both <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue3/Solove154U.Pa.L.Rev.477(2006).pdf">legally recognized data harm</a>, such as identity left, as well as <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">other data harms</a> that are not strictly measured or recognized, such as increased anxiety, loss of time, money, reputation, discrimination, opportunity (personal, economic, social, influence), and death.</p>



<p>At a macro level, dataism can create class wars, generate division, stimulate distrust, discriminate, silence free speech, suppress minorities, and more. Why, because dataism is causing a disequilibrium of power (money, resources, and influence), opportunity, social good, risk, and externalities among society’s actors. The lion share of the externalities are being born by people (you, me, and everyone around us), and the majority of the value is going to private institutions, aka “Big Tech”.</p>



<p>Data has power. Used properly data can create great prosperity. Used improperly it can create great harm.</p>



 
 
 
<a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/"></a>
A screen shot of The Opportunity Atlas

 



 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know a single data point, a child’s zip code, can predict their future success? See <a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/">The Opportunity Atlas</a> and learn more.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
 
 



<p>How does The Opportunity Atlas fit into dataism? Here is just one example. It is quite common for marketers to use geofencing to target their ads. If marketers know that a particular zip code is populated by the economically disadvantaged, for instance, they will hold back their advertising and not reach out to people in those areas. Individuals in those areas, that may otherwise value seeing the ad are being lumped in with the “poor,” and are hurt by this application of data. While I’m not putting forth a moral judgment to this practice, this is a form of dataism.</p>



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism, including dataism. It is time to give people, the data subject, agency and control over their data, and to bring unity to our phygital lives.</p>



<p>It is through unity, the eradication of datism, and all the other ‘isms, that we’ll achieve and sustain The Identity Nexus™, the equilibrium point where the value, risk, social good, and externalities of identity and personal information exchange within society are equitably and fairly shared among public institutions, private organizations, and people.</p>



<p>How can we eradicate dataism. We can empower people and start giving them agency over their identity and personal information. We can start giving them tools–personal information management solutions–so that they can be in control of the flow of their information and determine for themselves, who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose their identity and personal information can be used. And, if they’re so inclined they should be able to charge for their data. They should be able to require organizations to have to accept their terms of access rather than only being forced to accept the organization’s terms of service.</p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living, working, and playing in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings prosperity and joy without causing harm to others. It is time we end dataism.</p>

<p>Putting an end to the ‘isms that plague humanity</p>



<p>Today is a big day at <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™, and for all.  </p>



<p>Charisse and the team at Humanity Power have launched the <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<p>I encourage you to take the leap into Humanity Power. Follow the six-actions outlined in the action kit, and personally contribute, in your own unique way, to bring joy, prosperity, and purpose to your life and those around you, and afar.  </p>



 What are humanity’s ‘isms 



<p>So, what is an ‘ism and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?   </p>



 <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanities ‘isms 



<blockquote><p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>



<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 The Six Actions for Claiming Your Humanity Power  



<p>The Humanity Power action kit lays out six actions, steps, you can take to claim your humanity and to help bring prosperity to yourself and the world. </p>



<p>Humanity Power Action List</p>



  Learn the ‘isms, start by building awareness of the ‘isms and what they mean and who they affect.  Learn about high-vibration Humanity, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">learn</a> what it means to use your high-vibration Humanity.  Buy a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">wear the message</a> of Humanity Power, and support the mission (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Gift a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">give the gift of unity</a> and spread the message of Humanity (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Take the 30-day Humanity Power challenge, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">put your humanity to action</a> and practice high-vibrational activities to help end the ‘isms.  Subscribe and Stay connected, we’re just getting started and you are a big part in that. Let’s stay connected so we can experience mpact together.  



<p>Oh, and be sure to keep an eye you for future actions that you can engage in, like </p>



  sharing the Humanity the Manatee™ stuffy and book that teaches kids about humanity  supporting the Humanity Power “3rd Thursday” community enrichment events that provide people in need with a free meal while supporting local small businesses  taking part in action-based education. More on all of these later  



 Personal Testimonial 



<p>As for my part, I’m a walking billboard for the impact that Humanity Power can have on your life. Humanity Power has brought me positivity, joy, energy, friends, connections, commercial opportunity, prosperity, and more. </p>

<p>I am using Humanity Power to change my attitude, providing self-care. This has lead to me being more positive. I’m writing more. I am more protective and am finding renewed interest in my work. </p>



<p>I’ve finished all but one of the six actions. Action 5 of the action kit, the one I’m most excited about. It is next on my plate. I won’t give away the surprise as to what is in the daily challenge, you can take action yourself and download the kit. </p>



<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanity Power 30 Day Challenge



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism. </p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings property and joy without causing harm to others.</p>



<p>If you’re not ready to start the Humanity Power journey just yet, that’s ok. Humanity Power attests that there is unity in humanity. Well, guess what, there is unity in community as well. As a first step, I encourage you to at least join the community, start with action 6, and stay connected with the movement and the mission. If you are ready, jump right in. I encourage you to <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">join</a> the Humanity Power community and take part. You won’t regret it. </p>



<p>For our part at Identity Praxis, we’re focused on helping public institutions, private organizations, and people find an equitable balance as it relates to the exchange of identity and personal information throughout society. After reflecting on the Humanity Power framework, this brings another ‘ism to mind, dataism. We’ll reflect on Datism in a future post. </p>

<p>I’m thrilled to have been invited to speak at the Atlanta Innovation Forum’s live web event, on October 15, 2020, 6:00 PM EST, “<a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/4591045295960859662">The Challenging New World of Privacy &amp; Security</a>,” and to have the opportunity to discuss the state of privacy, self-sovereignty, The Identity Nexus™, and more with my fellow panelists. </p>



Atlanta Innovation Forum Live Event



 Program Abstract 



<p>Keeping Pace with the Explosion of Online Traffic… and the Surge of Online Threats Technology has always moved at an accelerating pace. But, since the start of the global pandemic, Internet usage has exploded at a never-before-seen pace, creating an equally explosive opportunity for cybercrime and online security risks. </p>



<p>In 2020: </p>



  Internet traffic has increased by 70% this year; streaming has increased by more than 12%  Ecommerce during the first six months increased more than 30% over online sales from the same time period last year (compared to the previous year to year same period growth of 13%)  Ecommerce sales for June 2020 were up 76% over June 2019 sales; for July 2020, they were up 56% from July 2019   10% of shoppers are making an online purchase for the first time this year, due to social distancing concerns  



<p>The increase is great news for Internet retailers and online service providers. But, it’s also a great opportunity for online criminals. It’s estimated that online crime in 2020 could result in over $6 trillion in losses this year. So what’s being done to address this? What steps are being taken to make online use by businesses and consumers more secure, to keep pace for with the bad guys? What new tech is being employed? How are businesses and technology vendors – many who are competitors – working together to protect their consumer and business customers to reduce losses, protect privacy and confidential data and to keep the ever-smarter bad guys from getting ahead? Join us as a panel of experts from B2B, B2C, Security and InfoSec explore what “high tech” is doing to thwart “high crime”</p>



 My Contribution  



<p>For my part, I’m going to speak about The Identity Nexus. The Identity Nexus is the elusive equilibrium point where mutual and equitable personal information value exchange between people, public, and private institutions can be had. I’ll discuss the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/08/26/iapp-releases-us-state-comprehensive-privacy-law-comparison-why-this-is-relevant-to-the-identity-nexus/">trinity of self-sovereignty</a> (Privacy, Security, Compliance) and the solutions needed to help us all thrive in the emerging personal information economy.</p>

  An expertly-reported, deeply disturbing piece by Katherine Eban on Jared Kushner's key role in the colossal federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

<p>Katherine Eban, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">deeply reported piece</a>, for Vanity Faire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
government’s strategy?</p>
<p>According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
“Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
states to figure out what they want to do.”</p>
<p>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
leadership and direction.</p>
<p>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
role of government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
about New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his desperate call for supplies.</p>
<p>“That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told Vanity
Fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed we sure have been. Nearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-09-19-2020-11600512793" title="Wall Street Journal: “U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Near 200,000”">200,000 have died</a> from Covid-19 in the
United States to date, with close to 400,000 deaths <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/briefing_US_091820.pdf" title="Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Pandemic Forecast for September 17">forecast by January 1</a>.</p>
<p>I’m restraining myself from quoting more; the reporting is impeccable, and the
truth of the situation deeply alarming. Read <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">the whole thing</a>, then
maybe go for a long walk and practice deep breathing.</p>
<p>And then <a href="https://vote.org/">Vote</a>. And make sure everyone you know is registered and ready to
vote.</p>

<p>From the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mtwilson.edu/">Mt. Wilson Observatory website:</a></p>
<blockquote>
 Mount Wilson Observatory&nbsp;Status 
<p>Angeles National Forest is CLOSED due to the extreme fire hazard conditions. To see how the Observatory is faring during the ongoing Bobcat fire, check our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WilsonObs/">Facebook link</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MtWilsonObs">Twitter link</a>, or go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/cameras/wilson.html">HPWREN Tower Cam</a>&nbsp;and click on the second frame from the left at the top, which looks east towards the fire (also check the south-facing cam and the recently archived timelapse movies below which offer a good look at the latest events in 3-hour segments. Note to media: These images can be used with credit to HPWREN).&nbsp;For the latest updates on the Bobcat fire from U.S. Forest Service, please check out their&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Angeles_NF">Twitter page</a>.</p>
<p>Last night the firefighters set a strategic backfire to make a barrier to the fire on our southern flank. To many of us who did not know what was happening it looked like the end. Click <a href="http://c1.hpwren.ucsd.edu/archive/wilson-s-mobo-c/large/20200917/MP4/Q7.mp4">here</a> to watch the timelapse. The 12 ground crews up there have now declared us safe. They will remain to make sure nothing gets by as the fires tend to linger in the canyons below. They are our heroes and we owe them our existence. They are true professionals, artists with those backfires, and willing to put themselves at considerable risk to protect us. We thank them!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>There will be plenty of stories about how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory">Observatory</a> and the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157700380351064">many broadcast transmitters</a> nearby were saved from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat_Fire">Bobcat Fire</a>.

<p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>In my never-ending quest to come up with super-simple models I came up with this diagram. This post is a slight editorial refactoring of my recent Twitter thread found&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1305852608087756802?s=20">here</a>.</p>A simple ecosystem model<p>The above illustration is not intended to be an architectural diagram — rather, it helps to 1) clarify conflations, 2) help define scope (the dotted box) and 3) understand motivations — of the parties that exist ‘outside of the&nbsp;system’</p><p>For example, ‘Issuer” usually gets conflated with ‘Authority’ — an authority merely ‘Attests’ — if you recognize it, then you can assume it is authoritative.</p><p>Anyone can attest to anything and issue something. The point of this model is that everything inside the box is neutral to that and solely focused on specific properties everyone needs regardless of intent or&nbsp;role.</p><p>The “Verifier” usually gets conflated with Relying Party. But a Verifier could be an off-the-shelf black box with the firmware baked in to verify against the right DIDs, challenging the holder with Bluetooth or NFC. The “Acceptor” could be logic that simply throws a switch to open a secure door. All done on behalf of a Relying&nbsp;Party.</p><p>The Holder can be anyone outside the system. An individual, organization or device, that is the ultimate ‘holder’ of secrets or cryptographic keys that is the basis of their power to convey intention.</p><p>Finally, the Registrar, is anyone or anything that is responsible for integrity of the ledger (doesn’t have to be blockchain). This ledger is responsible for two fundamental interactions: validation and transfer. In the case of a permissionless system, the ‘Registrar’ is actually an agreed-on set of rules, and proven (or not yet disproven) cryptographic primitives. For permissioned, or centralized systems, it could be a group of people, or even a single person in the back room with an Excel spreadsheet (not blockchain).</p><p>As for the dotted box — you need to determine who/what sits inside or outside of the box. For many outside the box, they may only care about a black box that they trust. This dotted box is also useful when you start thinking about the non-functional properties of the system — black or grey, should it be permissioned, permissionless, restricted access, globally available?</p><p>In the end, what I am trying to achieve is the expression of a simple conceptual model to help me express what could serve the wide range of use cases e.g.: opening a door, applying for university, letting someone across the border, etc. The model could also be used to express simply what we need to start building as a new digital infrastructure.</p><p>As always, this is a work-in-progress. Constructive comments&nbsp;welcome.</p>

<p>MATTR is proud to announce we’ve added support for privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our platform using <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec">BBS+ signatures</a>. Using a technique to implement selective disclosure, we’ve added the ability to generate credentials that support zero knowledge proofs without revealing any unnecessary information about the end-user, or placing any added burden on issuers, in the process. Since we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">open-sourced</a> JSON-LD BBS+ Signatures at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> in April of this year, we’ve received lots of engagement, feedback and contributions from the broader technical community to further develop the implementations and specifications we presented. You can read more about our approach to privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our introductory <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>One of the benefits of using the BBS+ cryptographic scheme to sign credentials is the ability to derive a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proof</a> from the signature, where the party generating the proof can choose to partially disclose statements from the original message. When enabled, this feature allows issuers to create a credential that effectively enforces minimal data disclosure using the MATTR Platform and a compliant digital&nbsp;wallet.</p>Issuers can create ZKP-enabled credentials that allow the user to selectively disclose&nbsp;data<p>To support this functionality, we generate the keys required to support these signatures and create a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID) with the keys referenced in the DID Document. BBS+ signatures require what’s called a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly curve</a>, we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. This DID can be referenced in credentials to establish the issuer of the data, a common practice to allow a verifier or relying party to trace the root of trust in a credential.</p><p>To issue a ZKP-enabled credential, simply use our API endpoint to create a new DID Key with type set to BLS 12–381. Then, create a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) using your new DID Key as the issuer DID. Our platform will automatically detect this capability is available in your DID and create a ZKP-enabled BBS+ credential for you. You can use the platform this way to create a privacy-enabled credential, or you can create a regular credential by providing a DID with a different key type — you have the&nbsp;option.</p><p>On the user side, you can hold ZKP-enabled credentials in your wallet alongside all of your other credentials. We’ve designed this process in a way that minimizes friction to the user. In future updates, our Mobile Wallet App will be able to detect if BBS+ signatures are being used in a credential. When you get a request to verify some information contained in one of these privacy-enabled credentials, it will derive a new presentation that selectively discloses the required info using a zero-knowledge proof. The platform will then allow verification of the proof using the same interface as any other type of presentation.</p><p>Our integrated approach treats zero-knowledge proofs as an extension of VCs, rather than an entirely new framework with a separate set of dependencies. We have built BBS+ Signatures and privacy-enabled credentials into our platform for anybody to experiment with, in what we think is a significant milestone for standards-based credential solutions on the market&nbsp;today.</p><p>As a technology, BBS+ digital signatures can be used to sign more than just verifiable credentials. Combining these technologies is quite effective, though they can also be treated as modular or separate components. We’ve open-sourced software for creating and verifying BBS+ signatures in <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">browser</a> environments as well as <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node.js</a>, and we’ve also published a library for generating <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bls12381-key-pair">BLS 12–381</a> keypairs for signing and verifying BBS+ Signatures.</p><p>By leveraging pairing-friendly elliptic-curve cryptography in the context of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>, our approach provides an unprecedented way to perform zero-knowledge proofs using the semantics of <a href="https://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a>. This allows credential issuers to tap into vast data vocabularies that exist on the web today, such as <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a>, making user data more context-rich without sacrificing security and privacy of the user in the process. Not only is this approach more interoperable with existing implementations of the VC data model and semantic web technologies, it also doesn’t rely on any external dependencies to operate (like a distributed ledger), meaning it’s <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">far more efficient</a> than other approaches based on <a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/cl">CL-signatures</a> and <a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARKs</a>. We’ve open-sourced our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">LD-Proofs suite for VCs</a> including performance benchmarks so you can check it out yourself.</p><p>We’re excited to finally make these powerful privacy features easily accessible for everyone, and we can’t wait to see what you build with it.

And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

<p>The <a href="https://info.braze.com/rs/367-GUY-242/images/BrazeDataPrivacyReport.pdf">Braze Privacy Data Report</a> provides useful insights toward understanding U.S. consumers’ (n=2,000) and marketer executives’ (n=500) opinions regarding personal data usage and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are insightful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marketers should start to take action now, and prepare themselves for the rise of the self-sovereign individual.&nbsp;</p>



 Individuals expect transparency 



<p>According to the study, individuals want transparency. They want to know,&nbsp;</p>



  
  how their data will be used (94%)  who it will be shared with (74%)  what will be done with it (74%)  what data has been collected (70%)  how long it will be retained (59%)  who is storing it (56%)  
  



<p>Marketers agree (99%), but what consumers and marketers don’t agree on is the value exchange and who should be in control of the policies and rules for privacy and personal information management &amp; oversight.</p>



 Ignoring privacy concerns will hurt the bottom line 



<p>Marketers beware!</p>



<p>The Braze report notes that 84% of U.S. adults have decided against engaging a brand due to personal information requests, and 71% did so more than once; and, 75% stopped engaging with a company all together over privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message is clear, properly handling privacy will have a positive impact on the bottom line, and not doing so will be detrimental.&nbsp;</p>



 Value exchange is possible 



<p>People are open to exchanging their personal information, but they want something in return; 71% of consumers will share their personal information in exchange for value:&nbsp;</p>



  60% in exchange for cash; a 2018 study by SYZYGY suggested this could be as much as $150 USD (The Price of Personal Data, 2018)  26% for product and incentives  21% for free content.&nbsp;  



<p>We see a gap here between consumers and marketing executives, as only 31% of marketing executives believe consumers should receive cash in exchange for personal data.&nbsp;</p>



 The privacy expectation gap 



<p>Again, we have a privacy expectations gap in the U.S.; the report finds that 82% of U.S. adults say privacy is important to them, while only 29% of marketing executives hold the same opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is time for the market to listen and begin to respect the sovereignty of the individual.</p>



 Rules and regulations 



<p>As for who should set the rules and regulations for personal information management &amp; oversight and exchange and privacy protection, it’s not clear.</p>



<p>Marketing executives (88%) find the state-by-state sectoral approach in the US burdensome and believe that federal direction could provide clearer directions. And yet, just 52% of marketers and consumers believe the Federal governments should do more.&nbsp;</p>



 The Bottom line 



<p>The bottom line is clear. People are waking up to the fact that their personal information has value. They’re open to exchange, but they expect transparency and compensation. Clearly, from a consumer attitudinal perspective, the personal information economy is at hand, but it is also clear there are industry and regulatory gaps that must first start to close; moreover, we need to develop and deploy the tools to help people safely and securely engage in the exchange of their personal information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Proactively managing your privacy is no longer a luxury, it is a must and it takes conscious effort. One step you may not have considered is blurring your house, face, car or license plate, or some other object on Google Maps? </p>



<p>Why would you want to do this, you might ask? Well, here are a few reasons; I’m sure there are more.</p>



  You have street-facing windows from your bedroom or living room  You’ve been a victim and want to minimize your digital footprint  You generally want to maintain your privacy&nbsp;  



<p>If you decide to do it, it is surprisingly easy. &nbsp;</p>



 Steps to Blur your house on Google Maps 



<p>You can follow the steps below to blur your house on Google Maps.</p>



<p>Warning: According to Google, the blurring of an image on Google Maps is permanent; you can’t reverse it. So, be sure this is what you want to do before you proceed.&nbsp;</p>







  Go to <a href="http://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and enter your home address  Click on the picture of your house to enter Street View mode  Click “Report a problem” link in the bottom-right corner of the screen  Center the red box on the object you want to blur, like your car or home  Click on the object type in the “Request blurring” list  Provide an explanation of why you want to blur the object, in the filed that appears  Enter your email address and hit Sumit.  



<p>Google will evaluate your request. The team (or systems) at Google will consider your request; it is not clear how long this will take. Once they’ve finished reviewing your request, they will let you know if it has been approved or rejected.&nbsp;</p>

This is the first release featuring

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

<p>The white mess in the image above is the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7152/">Bobcat Fire</a>, spreading now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, against which Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl (that’s it, on the right) reaches its limits of advance to the north. It makes no sense to build very far up or into these mountains, for two good reasons. One is fire, which happens often and awfully. The other is that the mountains are geologically new, and falling down almost as fast as they are rising up. At the mouths of valleys emptying into the sprawl are vast empty reservoirs—catch basins—ready to be filled with rocks, soil and mud “downwasting,” as geologists say, from a range as big as the Smokies, twice as high, ready to burn and shed.</p>
<p>Outside of its northern rain forests and snow-capped mountains, California has just two seasons: fire and rain. Right now we’re in the midst of fire season. Rain is called Winter, and it has been dry since the last one. If the Bobcat fire burns down to the edge of Monrovia, or Altadena, or any of the towns at the base of the mountains, heavy winter rains will cause downwasting in a form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> describes in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The water was now spreading over the street. It descended in heavy sheets. As the young Genofiles and their mother glimpsed it in the all but total darkness, the scene was suddenly illuminated by a blue electrical flash. In the blue light they saw a massive blackness, moving. It was not a landslide, not a mudslide, not a rock avalanche; nor by any means was it the front of a conventional flood. In Jackie’s words, “It was just one big black thing coming at us, rolling, rolling with a lot of water in front of it, pushing the water, this big black thing. It was just one big black hill coming toward us.</p>
<p>In geology, it would be known as a debris flow. Debris flows amass in stream valleys and more or less resemble fresh concrete. They consist of water mixed with a good deal of solid material, most of which is above sand size. Some of it is Chevrolet size. Boulders bigger than cars ride long distances in debris flows. Boulders grouped like fish eggs pour downhill in debris flows. The dark material coming toward the Genofiles was not only full of boulders; it was so full of automobiles it was like bread dough mixed with raisins. On its way down Pine Cone Road, it plucked up cars from driveways and the street. When it crashed into the Genofiles’ house, the shattering of safety glass made terrific explosive sounds. A door burst open. Mud and boulders poured into the hall. We’re going to go, Jackie thought. Oh, my God, what a hell of a way for the four of us to die together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three rains ago we had debris flows in Montecito, the next zip code over from our home in Santa Barbara. I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/01/15/montecito/">Making sense of what happened to Montecito</a>. The flows, which destroyed much of the town and killed about two dozen people, were caused by heavy rains following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire">Thomas Fire</a>, which at 281,893 acres was biggest fire in California history at the time. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)">Camp Fire</a>, a few months later, burned a bit less land but killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including whole towns. This year we already have two fires bigger than the Thomas, and at least three more growing fast enough to take the lead. You can see the whole updated list on the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/">Los Angeles Times California Wildfires Map</a>.</p>
<p>For a good high-altitude picture of what’s going on, I recommend NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)</a>. It’s a highly interactive map that lets you mix input from satellite photographs and fire detection by orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> and <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/">VIIRS</a>&nbsp;systems. MODIS is onboard the <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra</a> and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> satellites; and VIIRS is onboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html">Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)</a> spacecraft. (It’s actually more complicated than that. If you’re interested, dig into those links.) Here’s how the FIRMS map shows the active West Coast fires and the smoke they’re producing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a lot of cremated forest and wildlife right there.</p>
<p>I just put those two images and a bunch of others up on Flickr,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157715920586418">here</a>. Most are of MODIS fire detections superimposed on 3-D Google Earth maps. The main thing I want to get across with these is how large and anomalous these fires are.</p>
<p>True: fire is essential to many of the West’s wild ecosystems. It’s no accident that the California state tree, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coast Redwood</a>, grows so tall and lives so long: it’s&nbsp;adapted to fire. (One can also make a case that the state flower, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia_californica">California Poppy</a>, which thrives amidst fresh rocks and soil, is adapted to earthquakes.) But what’s going on here is something much bigger. Explain it any way you like, including strange luck.</p>
<p>Whatever you conclude, it’s a hell of a show. And vice versa.</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>Geofence Warrants&nbsp;are a law enforcement practice. Law enforcement submits a request to tech companies, notably Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, for a list of all the devices in, at, or near a location during a specific period of time. The objective of this practice is to identify people to be interviewed as part of an investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example,</p>



  To identify devices within a few hundred yards to a mile of a murder scene, or accident.   



<p>As of the summer of 2020, this practice is coming under scrutiny, as some have raised privacy concerns about the practice; the practice could cause harm. It could have an adverse effect on individuals’ right to privacy and civil liberties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, it could be used</p>



  
  to identify people during a protest in violation of the protesters’<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">&nbsp;First Amendment rights</a>, i.e. the right to free speech.  in densely populated areas in violation of individuals’&nbsp;<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth Amendment rights</a>, namely their right to “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizure.”  



<p>I’m all for the development of technology and the use of technology to maintain societal safety and democracy, but I do have my concerns. I want to believe that most people and organizations have well-meaning intentions, that they want to create value for people and themselves, but capabilities like geofencing have so many applications that can be used for malign purposes. We need to be careful.</p>



<p>I think it is crucial that we develop a wide range of technology that leverages personal data, like an individual’s location, to generate value for both society and for the individual, but it is imperative that we find ways to ensure individual users of this technology have the ability to maintain their agency and self-sovereignty.  </p>

   Are KPI’s innovations nemesis?  Apple’s underlying philosophy is about “better.” It is likely that if Apple’s executives were leading the response to COVID19, they would not be planning for a “Return to Normal” or creating a “New Normal,” they would be focussed on how to make what we have better! <p>The demands of complex judgment, coupled with changing requirements in a volatile environment, determine that stability is prioritised over change, as risk is already difficult enough to explain and manage.&nbsp; Outstanding leadership in 2020 is to focus on making one thing better; it must make a difference whilst adjusting other concerns for better outcomes.&nbsp; Therefore, what is the one stand out priority that demands attention and focus that delivers “better?”</p><p>Throughout lockdown, I have remained focused on how to provide data that has provenance and lineage to the Board, the aim to improve decisions and get to better outcomes.&nbsp; Central to the thinking was a linkage between measurement, performance, management and judging if the outcome was better.&nbsp; The insights shared below are independent of company size, structure or leadership. The prime recommendations are 1. Discover and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ incentives. 2. Find and modify reinforcement linkages between outcomes and culture so that all questions can be rewarded.</p><p>The focus of this article is on the application of #data for #growth through #innovation. The insights are independent of company structure or leadership.&nbsp; The challenge is if you can only make one thing better, as you will read, HR is a strong contender.</p><p>+ + + + + +&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 1 details the blocks that are used in the diagrams which will describe the systems of innovation. The blue circle is a choice or a decision point; the grey squares are where people are involved in the system, and the oval shape is the beginning or end of a process.</p><p></p><p>Figure 1: explaining the blocks</p><br><p>Figure 2 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation process in startups. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all startups, but to identify critical differences to the corporate world and why innovation feels easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 2: Innovation process in startups</p><p>Explaining figure 2. Starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram,&nbsp; “Hypothesis or Thesis”.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically a team will come together with an idea, and the Hypothesis Or Thesis determines the data required for the Data Lake. There is a flow from a Data Lake to Knowledge and Insights on the left. The process tests the Thesis the team created through analysis using the available data. The analysis process generates Knowledge and Insight, which closes an agile feedback system as knowledge and Insight refines what data we need in a Data Lake to complement the analysis which tests the team’s Thesis or Hypothesis. Knowledge and Insights give rise to recommendations which leads to Decisions. Decisions over time, become Outcomes, which we measure. Knowing and measuring Outcomes help us refine and define better the requirements we have for the data in our Data Lake, thus creating a second slower iterative improvement system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our Data Lake has a relationship or correlation to the Bias and Assumptions we have as a team.&nbsp; There is a closed-loop system between Bias and Assumptions and the Data Lake that further helps inform the Data Lake and reminds us of our Bias and Assumptions. A second influence on Bias and Assumption is the team’s Beliefs and Culture. Open cultures enable teams to question their Bias and Assumptions, whilst other cultures may avoid questions. A culture that encourages questioning will enable open-minded teams to continually check if they have the correct thesis and data in a Data Lake, and undertake the analysis without creating an outcome that was forecast. There is a link between Bias and Assumptions, which helps us in our decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><p>In a collaborative, open and free-thinking system, being able to check assumptions will enlighten decisions, leading to better outcomes. In an early-stage company, Reward and Motivation structure are not coupled to Outcomes as there is no revenue or direct causal correlation. The Reward and Motivation is fundamentally the team and individuals driven to do their best, as the team is there to prove their Hypothesis or Thesis, and to grow a company based on their collective thinking. Reward and Motivation structures create Patterns and Alignments. When the team’s perception of Patterns and Alignments are open, the loop is responsive and adaptive to questions and problems. We know our behaviours link Patterns and Alignments with the Knowledge and Insights we search for. We see this linkage in the methods and priorities that are created and focussed on. Priorities will give rise to recommendations which lead to decisions where outcomes help us refine a data Lake to improve continually and hypothesis. An agile loop of continual improvement.</p><p>In startups, this system leads to rapid development, creative thinking within an adaptive self-improving process.&nbsp; The improvement is creating a refinement of the hypothesis, the data, the analysis and witnessed as outcomes which create change. In a system driven by data, and the ability to challenge and question everything, we find outcomes and culture focus on refining a hypothesis/thesis and the team strives to refine continually and improve which supports innovation and drives growth. It feels easy as the system enables flow.</p><p>Moving our attention to mature businesses,&nbsp; before the actions are presented.&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 3 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation cycle in mature businesses. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all enterprises, but to identify critical differences to the startup world and why innovation feels harder. More dependencies are immediately noticeable.</p><p></p><p>Figure 3: Innovation process in mature businesses&nbsp;</p><p>In figure 3, starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram, “Memory and/or Processes”.&nbsp; This block was a “Hypothesis or Thesis” in startups.&nbsp; In the corporate world, trading history has provided experience, teams, revenue and methodology, which includes memory and processes that deliver barriers to entry, IP and often the core value of the company.</p><p>A critical link is already established between Memory and/or Processes and, Beliefs and Culture.&nbsp; Often this is visible in recruiting people who already adhere to the Beliefs and Culture of the company (search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=organisational+fit">organisational fit</a>). An influential culture determines that this is the way we do things, based on Memory and Processes, which usually removes the ability to question Bias and Assumptions (this is how we do it.)&nbsp; We retain the same Bias and Assumptions which taints/ colours or distorts Decisions.&nbsp; Decisions over time, become Outcomes.&nbsp; In mature businesses, everything is measured (what does not get measured cannot be managed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We measure the success of our Outcomes. Successful Outcomes re-enforces that our Beliefs and Culture are right so we should not change.&nbsp; Unsuccessful outcomes are seen as an error in the model, data or analysis and that we need more of the right data.&nbsp; The Outcome tends to favour or aligns to Rewards and Motivations as incentives and bonuses are linked directly to the outcome.&nbsp; With Outcomes measures and aligned to Rewards and Motivations, we have a confirmational bias towards certain Patterns and Alignments, that favours individual success.&nbsp; This restricts the options and learning from outcomes and will direct our priorities, meaning we will search for certain Knowledge and Insights in our data set, especially ones that we can recommend as a decision, that creates an outcome which aligns to our personal performance metrics, established by the memory in the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Central in the diagram in Figure 3 is Delta in Risk.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; When an organisation is finance-led, risk is modelled, defined and understood. Financial data and controls ensure that processes are designed to control risk at the agreed level.&nbsp; Data creates many dynamic changes within an organisation.&nbsp; Critically data introduces clarity and understanding of risks that could not be seen through the pure lens of finance. Ignoring cyber attacks and loss of data as a systemic risk, the data risk of interest here is the identification of new insights about products, services, teams, partners, processes that data brings to the attention of employees and Directors—a delta in risk.&nbsp; Many of the closed-loop reinforcement and confirmational biased feedback loops can be identified, but are structured to ignore this new risk. Where risk is identified, it creates instability in memory, bias, assumptions and decision making. Still, because of the strength of existing processes, the tension may not lead to change but rather a higher level of frustration, denial and protectionism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Existing processes have memory and efficiency of flow that can improve incrementally what already exists. The same memory is designed to resist flow-oriented towards a change of the process itself.</p><p>In a complicated closed-loop system driven by data; where outcomes drive rewards and culture removes the ability to challenge and question, our memory and processes continually re-enforce the same patterns. We find we are unable to adapt to the new vulnerabilities and risks that data adds, which is destabilising. We unpack that our processes are not set to support disruptive innovation or iteration at scale. Data can define a set of possibilities and constraints&nbsp;located in the past. Data has and is biased, and those biases are different and unique. Data has no imagination or creativity, and it will keep doing the same thing.&nbsp; Data cannot create a solution on its own.</p> Comparing the models <p>In mature business's innovation appears more difficult, my experience shows innovation itself is not more difficult, however, the willingness to accept, create change, adapt, steer to a new course that innovation brings is more difficult due to closed-loop feedback systems. The take away is that in start-up land there is less measurement and that means there are fewer linkages to confirmational loops.&nbsp; Are KPI’s innovations nemesis?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Figure 4: Simplified models compared</p><p>By example, from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesmith9/">Mike Smith,</a> here are three measurements that create continual frustration for innovation teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As a legal representative for this company, it’s my job to make sure we don’t sign any contracts that put us in a perilous position, and to make sure that we’re abiding by all local laws and regulations”. I am a Fellow of my legal institution and am professionally bound by their code of conduct, and I am measured by how few lawsuits we are involved in, both with other companies and with other institutions. I am incentivised to avoid that risky innovative contract.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As the lead for HR in this company, and being responsible for employee retention and well-being, it’s my responsibility to make sure we recruit carefully following appropriate laws (no discrimination etc), and ideally minimize employee dismissals as they are disruptive and represent risk to the company. “ I am measured on the avoidance of claims, and really don't want to recruit that brilliant and outspoken evangelist who has 1,000,000 followers on BLM.</p>  <p>“As CFO, I need to make sure our books balance and are fiscally responsible. When it comes to the product team needing money for research and development, we need to balance investment with income, and ensure that the solvency of the company isn’t in question.” I am a member of a professional body and my reputation is my next job. It will count against me if as the CFO I agree to a large loan to accomplish some critical work that others view as essential for company growth and it goes wrong. My bonus is based on avoiding risky financial transactions.</p>  <p>Often the system we have created for stability, measurement and risk avoidance which rewards key individuals for doing their job well, but this can stand counter to innovation.</p> People in the Loop&nbsp; <p>Whilst the model recognises the processes that surround our peers, teams, people and staff, it does not wholly recognise the agency of individuals.&nbsp; Our company may have ethics but our divisions, functions and eco-systems all have their own unique moral codes, which changes.&nbsp; Our company often thinks about culture rather than seeing the 100 cultures by clusters of our stakeholders and wider dependent communities, including extended family.&nbsp; What is driving an individual at this moment and how they make a choice which will have implications is not seen by the systems, as our systems are crafted for efficiency and stability.&nbsp; Humans are both in the loop, but more often are the loop.&nbsp; Humans are the workforces and feedback loops with their creativity, reluctance and behaviour creating colour in a very grey scale process driven organisation.&nbsp; This simple model would be a 100 page book, just by adding people's behaviour and attitude to innovation at each point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Recommendations for becoming more innovative by breaking something? <p>My recommendation based on experience and experiment is that innovation, disruption and transformation are difficult but not impossible. They all start from knowing what to transform.&nbsp; Therefore if innovation is what you are seeking in mature businesses, here are some ideas:-</p>  <p>Find and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ motivations. This means taking a critical view of reward calculations, annual reviews, remuneration packages and incentive programs. HR will need to support,</p>  <p>Find and modify reinforcement linkages between outcomes and culture so that all questions can be asked and all questions are rewarded.&nbsp; This means that unsuccessful outcomes help to create more questions and focus on remedy not blame,</p>  <p>Swop out a love for corporate memory to create a hypothesis and not a millstone,&nbsp;</p>  <p>Find ways to enable and deliver the diversity of thinking that creates openness, which may change the people you employee and that focus on values and behaviours more likely to result in a healthier culture</p>  <br><br><br>

   <p>Organisational fitness is being capable to do the job efficiently and creating growth but fitness does not equally deliver effectiveness, sustainability or long-term survivability.&nbsp; The latter being characteristics of organisational wellness.&nbsp; Best outcomes require both fitness and wellness, however, fitness is easier to deliver, measure and reward. Balancing the ease of short-term measurement with long-term consequences is a critical task for leadership.</p><p></p><p>“Fitness” in human terms is a means of doing repetitive exercises with the aim of maintaining or improving physical condition, it is focused on physical health. We can measure a person’s level of fitness. “Organisational Fitness” is an approach to understanding current efficiency and performance of the company based on qualitative measurement. Organisational fitness provides metrics for the critical areas of systems and processes and through KPI’s enable management and reporting by comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>Fitness is seen as physical exercise to gain strength. Strength is gained from repetition but we know that strength gained by repetition can it can equally result in the reduction or loss of flexibility. Indeed strength may be gained only in a single dimension.&nbsp; Elite sportspersons are specialists and know that they train to be the best for the demands of their sport, which does not mean they perform well in all sports. Companies with highly automated and repetitive processes can be fit for purpose, highly efficient and outperform others but equally be brittle, fragile and stiff.&nbsp; Being an elite company in one sector does not mean your processes translate well to other sectors.</p><p>“Wellness” in humans terms, has a complex dependency on combining body health, mental health and a current emotional state. The determination of wellness or well-being takes into account how these concepts are balanced for good outcomes, based on experience and expertise.&nbsp; Whilst measurement of fitness is understood, measurement of body health,&nbsp; mental health and emotional state are subjective and less quantifiable. Trying to determine “Organisational Wellness” has the same subjective qualification. Organisation-wellness unpicks team, culture and behaviours to determine if when combined together the company has the capacity, capability and focus to continue to succeed in the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;  Human Wellness is not Fitness! <p>Fitness is focussed on being physically well (healthy), however, there is no assessment of your mental state or stress level.&nbsp; Wellness determines how you cope with all your mental issues and can help define a lifestyle that invigorates your soul. Wellness is more of a translation of your internal states in coping with the situations of life but does not mean you are fit.</p><p>When a person puts in physical efforts or any kind of physical activity that helps them stay in shape; this is fitness. Fitness programs solely indulge individuals in achieving the marked standards of a physically fit body like weight, fat content or BMI.&nbsp; It should include a specific diet planform a proper nutritionist to maintain and improve the physical health of a person. Wellness being about raising a person’s self-esteem, driving the person to find motivation within themselves. A <a href="https://www.nimba.in/packages/">Wellness program</a> helps improve the intellectual abilities of a person which in turn encourages the sense of being physically fit.</p><p>Fitness often becomes performance based on measurement of the weight, reputation or time, the higher the efficiency the more brittle or fragile the person becomes to anything outside of the demanded routine.&nbsp;</p><p>Wellness can become a defence, protection and the ability to cope.&nbsp; The measure of wellness is judged externally by others as happiness, contentedness or peace as we have no ability to grasp what is actually going on in the mind. We determine that actions are a correlation to the state of the mind.&nbsp; But coping and appearing content is not a true sign of wellness and wellness is not a sign of fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Organisational Fitness is not Wellness</p><p>Fitness for purpose is the concept in which a company, product or service is adequate for the purpose for which the stakeholder, buyer, user, consumer selected the offer. Achieving fit-for-purpose in each context is difficult but can be measured and improved. Business owners and creators of products and services need system and processes for understanding needs and to be able to deliver.&nbsp; Being fit for purpose does not determine anything beyond the short term demand or alignment.&nbsp; Organisation-wellness focusses on the team, culture and behaviours to determine the company has the capacity, capability and focus to continue to succeed in the long term.&nbsp; Organisational fitness is efficiency or efficacy whereas, wellness is effectiveness or purpose.</p><p>Organisational wellness determines how the company will cope with externalities that bring stress and strains. Wellness is more of a translation of your internal states in coping with the situations, complexities and market changes that you are unable to control.</p><p>When an organisation puts in the effort to become more efficient; this is improving organisational fitness. Efficiency programs indulge companies in achieving the best industry metrics and standards and focus teams to raise the bar that drives better outcomes for certain parties.&nbsp; Wellness being about an organisations purpose, mission and values drive the team to find a north star and then guide the organisation towards it. An organisational w<a href="https://www.nimba.in/packages/">ellness program</a> helps improve the abilities of leadership and staff to cope with market conditions, determine better outcomes and be better ancestors, which in turn encourages the sense of balancing a drive for efficiency and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisational Fitness often becomes purely performance-based and dependent on the measurement to program KPI’s, often without any consideration of the unintended consequences of any KPI or a combination fo KPI to drive behaviours. Higher efficiency demands better integration and this increased the brittleness/ dependency on other parties. As we move to more automation and an increasing dependency on data, ML and AL efficiency is a target, however, this same drive can be seen to make the system and processes more fragile to systemic shocks, which were so rare we discounted the risk to zero. Enter a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisation wellness can become a defence mechanism and self-repairing protection, setting-up the ability of a company to cope with significant externality shocks.&nbsp; The measure of wellness is beyond tricky, highly subjective and often driven by a particular political/ personal agenda but that does not mean we should not try. We can determine wellness over time and from past experience, but determining it right now is hard. This is where leadership and governance come into focus as skills. Critically is why some senior executives often fail to cross the chasm from being top of their game in the efficiency and KPI measurement world to the governance and oversight demand that a board requires.</p> Leadership for “organisational-fitness” is different from leadership required for “organisational- wellness” <p>There is a change in focus and requirements between being a senior team member and a director which is illustrated below, the Director being on the right and senior leadership on the left.</p><p></p><p>The behaviour of management is described by the blue diamond. The is a task to be completed, and there is an incentive to complete it and do it in the most efficient way. The motivation is a reward (money, profile), and we have a look of a driven professional who delivers the KPI’s. In this blue cycle, the outcome is achieved by the people in the system backed by the process.</p><p>The green diamond represents a system where everything is connected, each creating a dynamic dependency on everything else. Whilst the blue diamond orients towards employees, the green towards Directors. The point is that the blue diamond operating system trains for efficiency and does not train or develop skills for operating in the green diamond environment, effectiveness.&nbsp;</p> Back to skills needed for directors <p>The chart below shows how skills should be formed over a period to create individuals who can work together with other professionals who can deal with highly complex decision making (judgment). The grey areas are where the “<a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/the-accumulation-of-an-executives-successfulness-with-kpi-measures-is-not-an-indicator-of-a-future-a170409a0c8a">Peters Principle</a>” can be seen in practice; individuals act outside of their capacity and/or are not given sufficient responsibility and become disruptive.</p><p>The yellow/ mustard zone is where many senior executives get trapped as they are unable to adapt from acting in their own interests (blue diamond) to acting in the best interests of the organisation and eco-system (green diamond) as all their training is how to perform better in the blue.</p><p></p>  <br>   Organisational Wellness&nbsp; <p>Organisational fitness is hard but relatively simple to measure, an organisations wellness is far more difficult. However, in human wellness, we have determined that our actions are a correlation to the state of the mind.&nbsp; Perhaps the takeaway from this is how we measure and report on Board decisions is far more critical than just another data set, but is rather an indicator of the wellness of the organisation and its ability to continue in the future. If we measure wellness we can also measure sickness and highlight decisions that prevent the organisation from becoming sick.&nbsp;</p><br>

   <p>The unimagined: unimagined&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your mind will have already assumed that this chapter, from its title, is presenting the unimagined outcomes, a discourse to overly optimistic viewpoints.&nbsp; It is reasonable that anyone reading a book on Pathways to General AI will have interrupted the word, “unimagined” within this context. Before you skip this chapter as you are a believer that AI is the future or don’t need another comfort blanket chapter speaking to the fearful of AI,&nbsp; this chapter is neither. It is not a wild fantasy of the possible nor is a negative chapter of the unknown risks and likely machine run apocalyptics. This chapter presents a matrix which enables the holder of either viewpoint to debate and discuss the unimagined together.&nbsp;</p><p>However, to reach the matrix we have to create a framework first, which gives the reader a clear and coherent communication tool to position imagined AI initiatives.&nbsp;</p> THE SIMPLEST ECONOMIC MODEL <p>Figure 1 presents a straightforward process. Raw materials are inputs to a process called gain, which creates an output. This simple model describes any process of adding value and a central core of a business. Indeed, applying the same model to our daily human life where the inputs are food and water, the gain is our process of living, and the output is our activity.</p><br><p></p> Figure 1. A simple model <p>This simple model is an open-loop system, and it is unstable. It cannot exist in isolation as it exists in a complex world where single processes are continually interacting with other processes, all affecting each other. To create stability systems depend on feedback loops, where the output is fed back to create an input.</p><p>The most straightforward stable control system is termed a negative feedback loop. Figure 2 presents how you take the output after a process of gain and SUBTRACT (take is away) from the input. (the green loop.) If we took all of the gain away, there would be no value created [output — input*gain = 0], so we attenuate the output (reduce it by a factor) before the closing the loop. This negative feedback loop allows the output to track the input. Imagine the input increases, after a gain process, the output increases, however as the output is feedback and taken away from the higher input, the actual input into the process is corrected and controlled. Significant changes are avoided and small modifications are tracked. It is stable but enables innovation, agile changes and minor adjustments.</p><p></p> Figure 2. A simple negative feedback loop <p>This is a control system. The negative feedback loop (subtracting the output from the input) delivers stability and control. It has stood the test of time. Technically the system control order of response [1st, 2nd, 3rd or higher orders] will depend on internal dependencies and external complexities; but give rise to different response times and the accuracy in tracking changes.</p><p>As a business function, we like this negative feedback loop, using planning and controls to keep businesses stable but iterating and growing in a controlled manner; innovation is incremental. In psychology think Nudge. In human terms this loop of control is happening all the time in our cells and is called homeostasis. Our body temperature remains at c.37oC irrespective of environment, food, clothing and activity. Society, politics and economics thrive on this stability cycle, continually making small adjustments to maintain order. In perspective; our lives, societies, businesses and environment remain in this stable loop for over 90% of the time.</p><p>Another control loop is presented in Figure 3, and it is a positive feedback loop. In this case, you take the output after a process of gain and ADD it to the input. (the yellow loop.) In this case, we take the output after the process of gain and amplify (make it bigger) then add this to the input. In audio terms, this type of feedback loop creates that loud ringing sound or in business planning, it is the magical hockey curve or exponential growth for a unicorn. It establishes fundamental accelerating change.</p><br><p></p> Figure 3. A simple positive feedback loop <br><p>Positive feedback loops create instability, at the end of each cycle round the loop a new level is achieved. This positive feedback loop creates disruptive innovation and change. The control loop order (how quickly something changes and how much change) will depend on complexity, time and the resources available.</p><p>In the human terms, the negative feedback cycle delivered stability which is seen as homeostasis; this positive feedback loop delivers mitosis (cell division and growth) and meiosis (having children) or death when it gets out of control (cancer and virus).&nbsp;</p><p>In business terms, negative feedback loops are times of stability and slow growth, positive feedback loops exist in times of rapid change, disruption and high growth. In perspective; our lives, societies and environment can only remain in unstable change loops for a brief period, less than 10% as it is as destructive as well as creative.</p><p>It is possible to show change by attenuating the output and adding it to the input, rather than amplifying; however, often you can’t control the amplification or attenuation.</p> THE CONNECTED MODEL <p>Combining these two models (positive and negative feedback loops) is obvious, we need both to understand our world of stability and change. We see this in our bodies every day at a cell level every day or when the disruption of when we are ill or a child arrives. We see the history of societies change across the passing of centuries, and at an environmental/ecology level across the millennium.</p><p>In business, the negative feedback loop allows us to be increasingly smart at one thing in the short term driven through continuous improvement yielding efficiency and getting to the best or optimal solution. In contrast, the positive feedback loop allows us to change, do radical innovation to create new products or markets, buy companies, and sustain high growth over a long period.</p><p>There is much evidence that our behaviours swop between these different loops. In Jonathan Haidt’s book “The Righteous Mind” he looks into the psychology of human beings and why they believe what they believe. In his studies, he’s found that humans generally think of themselves and are selfish. They mostly behave like their ancestors, chimpanzees. They’ll take care of their own needs first, then think of others — stability. However, Haidt also explains that humans, in certain instances, also behave like bees with a hive mind. At times, a switch can be flipped, which causes a human to think of the group before him or herself. When this mental state is achieved, one will even die for the group they care for. They become a part of something much larger than themselves.</p> COMPLICATED COLLABORATIVE MODELS <p>To bring the two feedback loop models together we need to introduce a third idea, the choice selector, Figure 4. The Choice selector picks which feedback loop, stable or unstable, we should currently be in. How we get to choose which loop we are in now and how to move from stable to change (different) and back to stable at a new level is “complex.” This choice selector is either where intelligence (learning &amp;/or experience) is applied to change the cycle, meaning you are in control of the choice, or it is where you are reactive and forced to change. For humans we can see we can choose to change using a positive feedback loop two ways, we can choose to have a child (intelligence) or become ill (forced). In business, we can choose to be disruptive (intelligence) or react (forced) to the disruption.</p><br><p></p> Figure 4 Choice Selector  THE APPLICATION TO AI <p>Building on the feedback loops of stability and change with a choice selector it is possible to explore where Machine (AI) is best and where Human is best and if there are scenarios where Human + machine (AI) would be a better outcome.&nbsp; This becomes the AI matrix, figure 5.</p><p></p><p>Figure 5. The AI matrix</p> EXPLAINING THE AI MATRIX <p>Walking down the Stability column in Figure 5. In the stable loop (negative feedback loop/ green) without a doubt, AI can deliver. AI will be transformative in terms of getting to the best solution, fast. Why: because in stable loops there is lots of data and it has been and will likely remain stable. The past data is an excellent indicator of future outcomes, training data works. Be careful as it is not that easy. The data can be biased and corrupt, but the application of AI in this loop is a winning strategy. If the human is in this loop, we will probably get it wrong (motivations, bias and politics). If Human + AI, the human still likely get things wrong. However, as proven in gaming (chess and Go), human + machine does work well and can lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Walking down the Change column in Figure 5.&nbsp; In the change loop (positive feedback loop/ yellow) AI is just not up to it. The base reason is that we don’t know where we are starting from or where we are going, and there is no or very little data. What the machine determines to do and why will be random and unknown. If a project is being presented to you asking for funding to use AI to change anything, walk away. Putting the human as the lead for change (it is what we do today) but we know it is sub-optimal as humans have issues and limits. Human and machine (AI) is a fascinating solution as we can eliminate the worst human characterises that leads to bad decision making but getting the AI to support the decision but not take them.</p><p>The final column, the choice selector, picking which loop to follow. It is where we allow the AI/ machine to choose for us. Fear, uncertainty and doubt are outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>What this means is that if someone is presenting to you, an AI to make choices for you for which loop, probably right now the best action is to AVOID and run for the hills. The human leads on choice, and we have spent the past 5,000 years getting to rules, regulations, governance and government. We and our system have a few problems, but we (should be) are in control. Transparency is increasingly essential in choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Human and AI together to make choices highlights a critical issue, who decides and “who decides, who decides.”&nbsp; Who polices the police? How do you ever know what someone else has put in an AI that is helping you decide? Currently asking a machine to help you choose for stability or change does not feel right.</p> THE UNIMAGINED: UNIMAGINED&nbsp; <p>The previous framework gets us to a point where someone, somewhere has imagined something to do with AI, but without us all understanding how it fits into the systems of life which mean we struggle to make a judgment call if the outcome is favourable or not.&nbsp; This last section expands to the unimagined: unimagined and how we can discuss and debate what AI means for humanity and where AI may take us.</p><p></p> Figure 6: The unimagined: unimagined&nbsp; <p>Expanding on figure 6, starting from the top right corner.&nbsp; Two highly experienced professionals are problem-solving. They share a common understanding of the problem as it is imagined to them both.&nbsp; It is possible to grasp that they can easily and quickly get to a common language, agreement and a shared sense of what to do next.&nbsp; The majority of day-to-day problem solving is reaching through a shared and collective understanding and communication.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of AI, the imagined: imagined space is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, algorithms and data.&nbsp; Variance is acceptable but there is an appreciation of what the methods do and how they work. It embraces the concept that new methodologies will be created.</p><p>More difficult is when something is imagined to one expert as a clear route ahead based on deep insight and analysis. The expert has clarity based on their framing, bias, time to think and data, but this is the first time for another professional. In this situation, perfect clarity can look like madness to someone else. &nbsp; Similarly, if the expert and professional swopped positions an imaged a solution become obvious to the professional and foolish to an expert.&nbsp; In both these cases, the is no substitute for time and the sharing of facts, insight and knowledge. Over time and with compromise, the two should be able to agree on the route ahead as it becomes imagined to both of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Imagined to one expert and rejected by other experts is a wide range of topics around AI, based on bias, life expectation and experience. Elon Musk and Bill Gates talk to their fears where we allow the AI/ machine to choose which loop (stable or change) for us.&nbsp; To them, it is clear, to others, it is madness. With time, advancement and more data points positions will change, and we will come to agree on how to deliver governance, oversight and stewardship that allows for the better outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, unimagined: unimagined, the bottom right quadrant. It is where we can come together to consider beauty and systemic risk.&nbsp; We can park all imagined to any party and explore the unimagined. In this case, it is no longer about a decision based on interruption of available data or facts but the requirement for complex judgment.&nbsp; We have to work together to determine the bias that we each bring and to find a way to articulate what scenarios looks like so others can also imagine it.&nbsp; The unimagined: unimagined is not about the solution, but what the problem is and how to determine what an impact will be. It is right now that we realise that our words fail us in our ability to shared what is already imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Undoubtedly, the first step would be to accept that parts of all imagined scenarios will play out. We should stop arguing or rejecting models believing that we have foresight into highly dependent, emergent, complex and adaptive ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><p>A second step is to create new names, words and language that doesn’t have an immediate bias, but where we can explore what the ontology of our latest thinking would mean.&nbsp; We distort what we imagine to create outcomes that we favour in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p>The unimagined is long term, which is where we need to go for general AI, not the superficial imagined, not the next 1 or 10 years, but the forthcoming century and millennium.&nbsp; Let’s have fun creating new words such as “Onama” that means, “leave all the imagined ideas about sci-fi,&nbsp; cyborgs, robots and augmented reality outside.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With new names or words, that don’t have an immediate bias or expectation, we can turn our thinking to governance, stewardship and oversight, exploring who has power, agency or influence in the previously unimagined scenarios.&nbsp;</p> <br>

   <p></p><br><p>Data ethics is the integration of ethical thinking with the constraints of data and centres on how to make better decisions that ensures ethical outcomes. Data ethics is a broad topic encapsulating data and ethical decisions, data-based judgement, bias, ethics of collecting and analysing data, and the ethics of automation created by data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The data we collected in 2010 could paint a low quality, black and white, abstract picture of our world and the data could be used to inform, frame or guide. In 2020, the data collected can describe our world in high-definition colour and is being used to mould, form and shape actions in complicated environments. We are accelerating our collection and use of data.&nbsp; Boards need to get deep and dirty with data and the ethics of judgement based on data, it is complex and often requires new skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Boards are biased towards professionals who represent experience in finance, legal, operations, marketing and sales.&nbsp; These “core functions” are supported by professionals with information, innovation, technology and HR expertise.&nbsp; Boards will typically have a deep appreciation of and for the expertise in each of the core functions and will have their own experience in each core area to draw on as a reference point.&nbsp; Members feel comfortable understanding and questioning strategy, ratios, metrics, margins and returns. Often the supporting functions are represented by a single professional and there is little broader expertise amongst the other Board members. When data and ethics enter the room, most members feel uncomfortable. Still, there is a chorus of opinions backed from well known academic institutes, leading consultancies, articles and journals but little practical grounding. This paragraph is an observation on the current status and not a criticism, data, ethics and data ethics are new and this chapter details questions we should be reflecting on and asking, as data is now fundamentally a core function.</p><p>Lies, damn lies and statistics is an unattributed quote but helpful in the context of discussing data and ethics. The use of statistics to bolster weak arguments is now followed by the use of data to create the outcome you want. Like statistics which can back any opinion, data can be found to support any recommendation. The most fundamental question a board needs to wrestle with; “How do we know if the decision we are being asked to approve is only based on data that creates that recommendation?”&nbsp; Data is no different to any question a board has been asked to approve previously, however according to Mckinsey 95% of decisions made in business are based on financial data, which represents, according to Google Cloud, 3% of the data available.&nbsp; We accept that there is bias in the data that presented a board paper that came from this financial 3% of data but as the remaining 97% of data becomes available to the board for decision making, it is not going to get any easier to unpick if we are being asked to make the right “ethical” decision.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that data is not easy to understand and in many situations, not understood even by experts and professionals. Data is not oil, sunshine, time, labour or any other of the analogies which all fail. Data is Data.&nbsp; Data is closer to the discovery of a new element or quantum particle which has its own unique characteristics.&nbsp; Data itself creates data, and everything is data. Insight, knowledge and wisdom built on data, just create more data.&nbsp; Decisions are just more data.&nbsp; Data means that bias is amplified, which can hide ethical problems. Our systems are built on discrimination.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Data, Ethics is equally not easy to understand and in many situations not understood.&nbsp; However, as we study and gain a better understanding of human behaviour from more data, it becomes increasingly evident that determining an ethical outcome for two people is complicated, for society it is complex, and for everyone it is impossible. We must be able to explain and justify the rationale for any decisions which affect others. However linking our judgement and decision-making to a framework that our ethics or culture can be applied at scale, is a delusional claim.&nbsp; We have to get comfortable that our judgement and decisions, based on any ethical code, hold us to a standard by which we must be prepared to be judged by.&nbsp; If we are deemed to be lacking by professional standard, law or society, Directors must be willing to accept the consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data in this context is all data. All data embraces data that comes from the market, customers, partners, supply chain and internal data from all systems, as shown in the figure below. Data is collected and stored, analysed, and this creates value, insights and margin, which we observe as an outcome. More data comes from understanding how our actions, which are measured outcomes, effect and affect each of the data collection points. Governance and oversight cover how we manage the entire system and process from the collection of data to understand how our decisions impact outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Data enables a leadership team to qualify and quantify new risks beyond the obvious of data security, cyber-attacks and poor processes.&nbsp; Data enables leadership to enquire about any and every aspect of the business that can be measured, which means that whilst once we were unable to determine the impact of a decision, a Board can receive the direct feedback from the data that supported a decision, to the outcome and determine if the delta needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially all ethical and moral thinking has the same goal, and there are several diverse ways to help reach a positive impact by considering what is best for others and seeking mutual benefit. Selecting a model for a specific context increases the chances of a successful outcome, which is a positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous books in which moral philosophy and philosophers are categorised; however, there are three core schools: virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, and deontological or duty-based ethics. Each approach provides a different way to understand ethics and has implications on the decision marking process.&nbsp; If I asked the question “What is the best way to achieve a healthy life?” you can respond with one of three approaches: good nutrition, through exercise, and through spiritual discipline. Each being vital but inadequate by itself. It is bringing these and other strategies together that we can make create better outcomes from a complex decision.&nbsp;</p><p>In ethics, no one school answers all the issues, concerns and problems raised by a diverse society; therefore many schools need to be considered to reach an ethical decision.&nbsp;</p><br> Questions  Data Ethics   <p>Do we have a data ontology and/or data dictionary. What standard does it meet?</p>  <p>What confidence do we have in the lineage and provenance of data?</p>  <p>What bias could be in the data, what bias is in the data set, what are the implications?</p>  <p>What data do you get from third parties, what is their model and have you asked q2&nbsp;

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.

<p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>Today’s increasingly sophisticated consumers now view digital interactions as the primary mechanism for interacting with brands and, consequently, expect deeper online relationships delivered simply and unobtrusively. CIAM turns customer data into Gold! Scalability, Security &amp; Privacy, Usability, Extensibility, and APIs &amp; Integration are the five pillars of CIAM. The following video talks about these five pillars in&nbsp;detail.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/five-pillars-of-ciam-d5657a9e375b">Five Pillars of CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The other day I made a
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/104746037303599668">sadpost on the fediverse</a>
that said: "simultaneously regularly feel like people don't take the
directions I'm trying to push seriously enough and that I'm not worth
taking seriously".
(Similarly, I've also joked that "imposter syndrome and a Cassandra
complex are a hell of a combo" before.)
I got a number of replies from people, both publicly and privately, and
the general summary of most of them are, "We do care!  The stuff you're
working on seems really cool and valuable!  I'll admit that I don't
really know what it is you're talking about but it sounds important!"
(Okay, and I just re-read, and it was only a portion of it that even said
the latter part, but of course, what do I emphasize in my brain?)
That was nice to hear that people care and are enthusiastic, and I did
feel much better, but it did also kind of feel like confirmation that
I'm not getting through to people completely either.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred">jfred</a> made an
<a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred/104747234928467298">interesting reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that feels familiar. Impostor syndrome hits hard. You're
definitely worth taking seriously though, and the projects you're
working on are the most exciting ones I've been following.</p>
<p>As for people not taking the directions you're pushing
seriously... I've felt the same at work, and I think part of it is
that there's only so much one person can do. But also part of it is:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/</a></p>
<p>...it's hard to get ideas across to someone until they can interact
with it themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first of all, what a nice post!
Second of all, it's kind of funny that jfred replied with this because
out of everyone, jfred is one of the people who's picked up and
understood what's happening in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>
in particular the most, often running or creating demos of things on
top of it using things I haven't even documented yet (so definitely
not a person I would say isn't taking me seriously or getting what the
work is doing).</p>
<p>But third, that link to <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/">Habitat Chronicles</a>
is right on point for a few reasons: first of all, Spritely is hugely
influenced by the various generations of Habitat, from the original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc">first-ever-graphical-virtual-worlds Habitat</a>
(premiering on the Commodore 64 in the mid 1980s, of all things!)
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNiePoNiyvE">Electric Communities Habitat</a>,
especially because that's where the <a href="http://erights.org/">E programming language</a>
came from, which I think it's safe to say has had a bigger influence on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a> than anything
(except maybe
<a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">this paper by Jonathan Rees</a>,
which is the first time I realized that "oh, object capability security
is just normal programming flow").
But also, that blogpost in particular was so perfect about this subject:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a>...!</p>
<p>In summary, the blogpost isn't saying that people aren't foolishly
incapable of understanding things, but that people in general don't
understand well by "being explained to".
What helps people understand is experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually people can be educated, but what you have to do is find a
way give them the experience, to put them in the
situation. Sometimes this can only happen by making real the thing
you are describing, but sometimes by dint of clever artifice you can
simulate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really congealed for me and helped me feel justified in an
approach I've been taking in the Spritely project.
In general, up until now I've spent most of my time between two
states: coding the backend super-engineering stuff, and coding
demos on top of it.
You might in the meanwhile see me post technobabble onto
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">my fediverse</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb">birdsite</a> accounts, but I'm not in
general trying too hard to write about the structurally interesting
things going on until it comes time to write documentation
(whether it be for <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>,
or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/magenc/blob/master/magenc/scribblings/intro.org">immutable storage</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/crystal/blob/master/crystal/scribblings/intro.org">mutable storage</a> writeups).
But in general, the way that I'm convinced people will get it is not
by talk but by first, demonstration, and second, use.</p>
<p>Aside from the few people that have picked up and played with Goblins
yet, I don't think I've hit a sufficient amount of "use" yet in Spritely.
That's ok, I'm not at that stage yet, and when I am, it'll be fairly clear.
(ETA: one year from now.)
So let's talk about demonstration.</p>
<p>The first demo I wrote was the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/golem/blob/master/README.org">Golem demo</a>,
that showed roughly that distributed but encrypted storage could be
applied to the fediverse.
Cute and cool, and that turned the heads of a few fediverse
implementers.</p>
<p>But let's face it, the best demo I've done yet was the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
And it didn't hurt that it had a cool looking animated GIF to go
with it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to this demo, people would ask me, "What's this Goblins thing?"
And I'd try to say a number of things to them... "oh, its a
distributed, transactional, quasi-functional distributed programming
system safe to run in mutually suspicious networks that follows object
capability security and the classic actor model in the style of the E
programming language but written in Scheme!"
And I'd watch as their eyes glaze over because
why wouldn't their eyes glaze over after a statement like that, and
then I'd try to explain the individual pieces but I could tell
that the person would be losing interest by then and
why wouldn't they lose interest but even realizing that I'd kind of
feel despair settling in... </p>
<p>But when you show them a pew pew space lasers game and oh wow why
is there time travel, how did you add time travel, is it using
functional reactive programming or something?
(Usually FRP systems are the only other ones where people have
seen these kinds of time travel demos.)
And I'd say nope!
It doesn't require that.
Mostly it looks like writing just straightahead code but you get
this kind of thing for free.
And the person would say, wow!
Sounds really cool!  How much work does it take to add the time
travel into the game?
And I just say: no extra work at all.
I wrote the whole game without testing anything about time travel or
even thinking about it, then later I just threw a few extra lines to
write the UI to expose the time travel part and it just worked.  And
that's when I see peoples' heads explode with wonder and the
connections start to be made about what Goblins might be able to do.</p>
<p>But of course, that's only a partial connection for two reasons.
One is that the time travel demo above only shows off a small,
minute part of the features of Goblins.
And actually, the least interesting of them!
It doesn't show off the distributed programming or asynchronous
programming parts, it doesn't show off the cool object capability
security that's safe to run in mutually suspicious networks.
But still: it gave a taste that something cool is happening here.
Maybe Chris hasn't just been blowing a bunch of time since
finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standardization process
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785">about two and a half years ago</a>.
(Yikes, two and a half years ago!?!)</p>
<p>To complete the rest of that demonstration of the other things
in the system requires a different kind of demo.
Terminal Phase was a demo to show off the synchronous half of Goblins,
but where Goblins really shines is in the asynchronous, distributed
programming stuff.
That's not ready to show off yet, but I'll give you the first taste
of what's in progress:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Actually a bit more has progressed since I've recorded that GIF,
multiple chatrooms and etc, but not really worth bothering to show
off quite yet.)</p>
<p>Hmm, that's not really all that thrilling.  A chatroom that looks about
the same level of featureful, maybe less, than IRC?
Well, it could be more exciting if you hear that the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/chat-backend.rkt">full chat protocol implementation</a>
is only about 250 lines of code, including authenticating users and
posts by users.
That's smaller even than its
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">corresponding GUI code</a>,
which is less than 300 lines of code.
So the exciting thing there is how much heavy lifting Goblins takes
care of for you.</p>
<p>But that's hardly razzle-dazzle exciting.
In order for me to hint at the rest of what's happening here, we need
to put out an asynchronous programming demo that's as or more
interesting than the time travel demo.
And I expect to do that.
I hope soon enough to show off stuff that will make people go,
"Oh, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>But even that doesn't complete the connection for people,
because showing is one thing but to complete the loop, we need
people to use things.
We need to get this stuff in the hands of users to play with and
experiment themselves.
I have plans to do that... and not only that, make this stuff
not intimidating for newcomers.
When Spritely guides everyday people towards extending Spritely from
inside of Spritely as it runs, that's when it'll really click.</p>
<p>And once it clicks sufficiently, it'll no longer become exciting,
because people will just come to expect it.
A good example of that comes from the aforementioned
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, before Lucasfilm, I worked for <a href="http://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>
(the original hypertext project, way before this newfangled World
Wide Web thing). One of the things I did was travel around the
country trying to evangelize the idea of hypertext. People loved it,
but nobody got it. Nobody. We provided lots of explanation. We had
pictures. We had scenarios, little stories that told what it would
be like. People would ask astonishing questions, like “who’s going
to pay to make all those links?” or “why would anyone want to put
documents online?” Alas, many things really must be experienced to
be understood. We didn’t have much of an experience to deliver to
them though — after all, the whole point of all this evangelizing
was to get people to give us money to pay for developing the
software in the first place! But someone who’s spent even 10 minutes
using the Web would never think to ask some of the questions we got
asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, if we succeed, the ideas in Spritely will no longer seem
exciting... because people will have internalized and come to expect
them.
Just like hyperlinks on the web today.</p>
<p>But to get there, in the meanwhile, we have to get people interested.
To become so successful as to be mundane, we have to first be
razzle-dazzle exciting.
And to that end, that's why I take the demo approach to Spritely.
Because it's hard to tell someone something... but showing them,
that's another matter.</p>
<p>PS: It's also not true that people don't get what I'm doing, and
that's even been reflected materially.
I've been lucky to be supported over the last few years from a
combination of
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/samsung-stack-zero-grant/">a grant from Samsung's Stack Zero</a>
and
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">one from NLNet</a>,
not to mention quite a few <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">donors on Patreon</a>.
I do recognize and appreciate that people are supporting me.
In some ways receiving this support makes me feel more seriously about the
need to demonstrate and prove that what I'm doing is real.
I hope I am doing and will continue to do a sufficient job, and hope that
the upcoming demos contribute to that more materially!</p>
<p>PPS: If, in the meanwhile, you're already excited, check out
the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins documentation</a>.
The most exciting stuff is coming in the next major release
(which will be out soon), which is when the distributed programming
tools will be made available to users of the system for the first time.
But if you want to get a head start, the code you'll be writing will
mostly work the same between the distributed and non-distributed
(as in, distributed across computers/processes) asynchronous stuff,
so if you start reading the docs today, most of your code will already
just work on the new stuff once released.
And if you do start playing around, maybe drop by the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=spritely">#spritely channel on freenode</a>
and say hello!</p>

<p>The following letter from a group of UK parliamentarians rings alarm bells that should awaken all of us – I suspect similar things are happening in the shadows well beyond the borders of the United Kingdom…</p>
<p>The letter recounts the sad story of one more politician with no need for science or expertise – for him, rigorous attention to what systems do to data protection and privacy can simply be dismissed as “bureaucracy”.&nbsp; Here we see a man in over his head – evidently unaware that failure to follow operational procedures protecting security and privacy introduces great risk and undermines both public trust and national security.&nbsp; I sincerely hope Mr. Hancock brings in some advisors who have paid their dues and know how this type of shortcut wastes precious time and introduces weakness into our technical infrastructure at a time when cyberattack by organized crime and nation states should get politicians to sober up and get on the case.</p>

Information Commissioner’s Office<br>
Wycliffe House<br>

Wilmslow<br>
Cheshire SK9 5AF</p>
<p>Dear Elizabeth Denham,</p>
<p>We are writing to you about the Government’s approach to data protection and privacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also the ICO’s approach to ensuring the Government is held to account.<br>
During the crisis, the Government has paid scant regard to both privacy concerns and data protection duties. It has engaged private contractors with problematic reputations to process personal data, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/it-started-as-1-now-its-1-million-wheres-the-mandate-for-letting-palantir-into-our-nhs/">Open Democracy and Foxglove</a>. It has built a data store of unproven benefit. It chose to build a contact tracing proximity App that centralised and stored more data than was necessary, without sufficient safeguards, as <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1284/documents/11453/default/">highlighted by the Human Rights Committee</a>. On releasing the App for trial, it failed to notify yourselves in advance of its Data Protection Impact Assessment – a fact <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/334/html/">you highlighted</a> to the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1037/documents/8502/default/">Human Rights Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Government has admitted breaching their data protection obligations by failing to conduct an impact assessment prior to the launch of their Test and Trace programme. They have only acknowledged this failing in the face of a threat of legal action by <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/app/uploads/2020/07/200715-PAP-Response-Letter.pdf">Open Rights Group</a>.The Government have highlighted your role at every turn, citing you as an advisor looking at the detail of their work, and using you to justify their actions.</p>
<p>On Monday 20 July, Matt Hancock indicated his disregard for data protection safeguards, saying to Parliament that “I will not be held back by bureaucracy” and claiming, against the stated position of the Government’s own legal service, that three DPIAs covered “all of the necessary”.</p>
<p>In this context, Parliamentarians and the public need to be able to rely on the Regulator. However, the Government not only appears unwilling to understand its legal duties, it also seems to lack any sense that it needs your advice, except as a shield against criticism.<br>
Regarding Test and Trace, it is imperative that you take action to establish public confidence – a trusted system is critical to protecting public health. The ICO has p<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/information-notices/enacted">owers to compel documents to understand data processing, contractual relations and the like (Information Notices</a>). The ICO has powers to assess <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/assessment-notices/enacted">what needs to change</a> (Assessment Notices). The ICO can demand particular changes are made (Enforcement notices).&nbsp; Ultimately the I<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/enforcement-notices/enacted">CO has powers to fin</a>e Government, if it fails to adhere to the standards which the ICO is responsible for upholding.</p>
<p>ICO action is urgently required for Parliament and the public to have confidence that their data is being treated safely and legally, in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p>

<p>事後報告ですが、金融庁と日本経済新聞の共催の『Fin/Sum | BG2C 2020』に出演しました。本来は3月に行う予定だったものですが、新型コロナ禍により延期になっていたものです。</p>



<p>会場は東京は日本橋のコレド室町テラス３階の「室町三井ホール＆カンファレンス」で、座席はありましたが、ソーシャルディスタンスを撮っておりましたし、参加人数的にはちょっと寂しい感じで、麻生大臣はビデオメッセージ、その他の登壇者も多くはリモートという形でした。</p>



    ビデオ出演の麻生大臣  キーノートのメインホールの様子  モデレータの佐古早稲田大学教授j以外はリモート参加  松尾ジョージタウン大学教授はこのために来日、２週間の隔離生活  ルーム２はこんな感じ  珍しく日本のパネリストのみのパネル  <a></a><a></a><a></a>   



<p>わたしのセッションは、11:20からのBG2Cの一環としての「ブロックチェーンとアイデンティティ」というパネルディスカッションでした。モデレータのわたしだけが部屋にいて、登壇者の</p>



  <a>アイリーン・ヘルナンデス</a><br>GATACA<br>創業者 兼 CEO  <a>マリア・ヴァッチーノ</a><br>Easy Dynamics Corp.<br>ディレクター  <a>キム・キャメロン</a><br>Convergence Tech<br>チーフアイデンティティオフィサー<br>www.identityblog.comモデレーター  



<p>は、当然のことながら、それぞれ、スペイン、アメリカ、カナダからのリモート参加です。アイリーンは午前３時２０分からというすごい時間帯でしたが、ビシッと服装も整えておしゃれして出てくれました。もちろん、マリアもです。総じて海外パネリストは男性陣は髪ボサボサに対して女性陣はビシッとしてた感じがします。</p>



<p>しかし、こういうリモートのパネルはやっぱり心臓に悪いですね。リモート側の音が会場ではリバーブがかかりすぎてよく聞こえなかったりなど、コンディションが良くないですし、それ以前に、ちゃんとコールインしてくれるか、その時の回線は大丈夫か、などいろいろ不安要素があります。</p>



<p>そんなこんなで、自分のセッションのスクショとか取るの忘れてしまいました。主催者からそのうち写真や録音が出てくるのではないかと期待して…。</p>



<p>なお、Fin/Sum | BG2C では、他に２つのアンカンファレンスセッションにも出て、そのうち一つではファシリテーターをやらせていただきました。リモートのアンカンファレンスもなかなかおもしろい経験でした。</p>

<p>I host a <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">weekly call on distributed governance</a>. This blog provides my personal opinions but by all means view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">entire discussion here</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>One of the big debates in the Genesis DAO started by DAOstack was the question of anonymity. Should people be able to make proposals and ask for budgets without providing a real identity?</p><p>Part of the problem was a structural problem with DAOstack at the time: there was no escrow system. You could allocate funds to a project, but you could not hold the funds until the project was complete. In other words, everyone was paid up front for their project as soon as the group approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another aspect of the problem was human: we all feel a little weird chatting with someone faceless. On the discussion boards, one person could potentially have multiple pseudonyms. If we were discussing something controversial, it would be fairly easy for someone to pretend to be multiple people arguing for or against the proposal. It was also fairly easy to troll the system anonymously. It wasn’t as easy to game the voting, though it was certainly possible.</p> It Ain’t&nbsp;Real <p>The example of the Genesis DAO was somewhat trivial, because it was a small number of people who actually did know one another. None of the anonymous people seriously asked for budget (though there was an anonymous troll), the amounts of money in question weren’t huge, and it was a small enough community that everyone pretty much knew one&nbsp;another.</p><p>In real life, identity is fundamental to democracy. It amazes me how many people cherish their anonymity so much that this is under debate. <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">Our weekly chat</a> about anonymity was wide-ranging, and as usual, we came to the conclusion that “it depends.”</p> Does It Really&nbsp;Depend? <p>Personally, I think it doesn’t depend on the situation at all. At almost all stages of governance, you need to know some information about the person. You almost never need to know their actual name, but you almost always need to know, at a minimum, whether they have the right to influence a particular situation.</p><p>My minimum viable values statement about governance is: If the decision will impact you, you should have the ability to influence the decision. How much influence you should have is a different question. For example, if you are not an expert on hydroelectric dams, maybe you don’t get to decide where to build the dam, but if you live near the river, your perspective should be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>This isn’t the way democracy runs today. Corporations make decisions that impact their workers, customers and the environment with no regard for their opinions. Governments determine foreign policy without having any responsibility for the citizens of foreign countries who will be impacted by those policies. Lawmakers in one state make laws that influence neighboring states. We call that democracy. I digress but it’s important. We are completely normalized to a situation in which, as long as we feel fairly treated inside our organization, the external people’s feelings are irrelevant to what we call fair&nbsp;process.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;Name? <p>Throughout most of the decision-making process, therefore, full anonymity is not appropriate. Knowing people’s name isn’t particularly important, but in each stage of the process, some identifying information is helpful to democracy.</p>  In discussions and sentiment signalling, you need to know a person’s affiliation and expertise. Are they a resident? Do they work for the solar panel company? Are they an expert in urban planning? Is the electric company going to make a bid to buy up their land if this project is approved? Did they educate themselves and read multiple perspectives on the issue at hand? In the best of cases, you would also show an indicator of their reputation in the domains being discussed.  In problem definition, you need to know the person’s sentiment and perspective on the issue as well as something about their cognitive abilities. Are they good at detail or systems-wide analysis? Can they integrate multiple perspectives and listen well to others? Does the makeup of the problem-definition team appropriately represent enough different perspectives on the problem? Are they good at asking deeper questions, or do you use a highly-facilitated problem-definition process?  For proposal-making, while it is often optimal to let everyone propose ideas, it’s equally important to have the right experts in the room. Is this person an electrician or architect? Have they done other successful projects in this specific area? Again, the best ideas might come from someone who doesn’t have the proper background, but the process of solidifying the proposal needs to be grounded in&nbsp;reality.  For voting you need to know that this is the individual they said they were, and that they are voting in accordance with the rules of the voting&nbsp;system.  For execution of the decision, you need to know the qualifications of the people carrying out the&nbsp;work.  For accountability, oversight and assessment of the process, you need to know the qualifications and the vested interests of the&nbsp;people.  Finally, for whistle-blowing, you need some level of anonymity but you may also need verifiable evidence. Throughout the entire process, there needs to be some mechanism for people to give feedback safely when their own self-interest might be endangered. Scientists at a chemical company are the best qualified to expose if there might be unpublished side-effects to some new product. If there are good enough privacy and anonymity controls, such information could be leaked more transparently while verifying the reliability of the&nbsp;sources.   Collapsing reality and&nbsp;desire <p>One of the reasons people clamor for anonymity is that the tech collapses our identity and name and private data. Identity isn’t just your name. All of your data doesn’t have to be identified in every transaction — collapsing these concepts is sloppy and leads people to think there are only two possibilities: complete anonymity and complete exposure.</p><p>Identifying yourself by your name is the easiest way for people to eliminate anonymity, but it exposes more information than is necessary. I think that most of the debate over anonymity is due to the fact that we haven’t found creative ways to de-couple someone’s actual name from other attributes about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Technically, it would be possible to create a system where someone has a different name to different people. I would look at all of Alice’s posts and develop an opinion of her. You might be looking at Andrea’s posts — not knowing that Andrea and Alice were actually the same person, but anonymized so that when we met this person in real life, let’s say it’s really Alexa, we wouldn’t be able to attribute that information to her unless she wanted us to. She might appear differently on different forums, because she’s more of an expert in oceanography than in architecture. That’s an extreme implementation, but it’s just one example of how technology can be used to provide us the information we need to form opinions online without compromising someone’s identity.</p><p>As soon as we recognize that we can develop solutions for allowing different levels of participation and providing the data we need without exposing something sensitive, we can start to have a conversation about the need for anonymity in specific situations.</p><p>Enjoy our <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">talk about anonymity and democracy</a>. Most people don’t agree with me on the call! Feel free to join us. We have new topics every week, and <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">the call is open to&nbsp;all</a>.</p>

<p>Many readers will already know that I retired from Microsoft after twenty years working as Chief Architect of Identity and other related roles. I had a great time there, and Microsoft adopted the Laws of Identity in 2005 at a time when most tech companies were still under dark influence of “Privacy is Dead”, building systems destined to crash at endless cost into a privacy-enabled future. Microsoft is a big complicated place, but Bill Gates and Satya Nadella were as passionate as me about moving Microsoft and the industry towards digital identity respectful of the rights of individuals and able to empower both individuals and organizations.  I thank them and all my wonderful colleagues and friends for a really great ride. </p>
<p>In the last years I led Microsoft to support Decentralized Identity as the best way to recognize the needs and rights of individual people, as well as the way to move enterprises and governments past the security problems, privacy roadblocks and dead ends that had resulted from the backend systems of the last century.  Truly exciting, but I needed more time for my personal life.</p>
<p>I love being completely in control of my time, but my interest in digital identity is a keen as ever. So besides working with a small startup in Toronto called Convergence Tech on exciting innovation around Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity, I’ve decided to start blogging again.  I will, as always, attempt to dissuade those responsible for the most egregious assaults on the Laws of Identity.  Beyond that, I share my thoughts on developments in the world of Decentralized Identity and technology that enfranchises the individual person so each of us can play our role in a democratic and secure digital future.</p>

<p>Cloud security is about much more than security functionality. The top cloud providers all seem to have a capable suite of security features and most surveyed organizations report that they see all the top cloud platforms as generally secure. So, why do 92% of surveyed organizations still <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report/">report</a> a cloud security readiness gap? They’re not comfortable with the security implications of moving workloads to cloud even if they believe it’s a secure environment and even if the platform offers a robust set of security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Two contributing factors to that gap include:</p>  78% reported that cloud requires different security than on-prem. With security skills at a shortage, the ability to quickly ramp up on a new architecture and a new set of security capabilities can certainly slow progress.<br>  Only 8% of respondents claimed to fully understand the cloud security shared responsibilities model; they don’t even know what they’re responsible for; never mind how to implement the right policies and procedures, hire the right people, or find the right security technologies.  <p>I recently posted about how Oracle is addressing the gap  on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a>. There's a link in the post to a new whitepaper from Dao Research that evaluates the cloud security capabilities offered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Oracle took some criticism for arriving late to the game with our cloud infrastructure offering. But, several years of significant investments are paying off. Dao's research concludes that “Oracle has an edge over Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as it provides a more centralized security configuration and posture management, as well as more automated enforcement of security practices at no additional cost. This allows OCI customers to enhance overall security without requiring additional manual effort, as is the case with AWS, Azure, and GCP.”<br></p><p>A key take-away for me is that sometimes, the competitive edge in security in delivered through simplicity and ease of use. We've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2012/12/complexity_the_worst.html">heard</a> over and over for several years that complexity is the enemy of security. If we can remove human error, bake-in security by default, and automate security wherever possible, then the system will be more secure than if we're relying on human effort to properly configure and maintain the system and its security.<br></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Click here to check out the post and the Dao Research whitepaper</a>.<br></p>

     <p>Why is innovation perceived as so much easier in startup-land?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The focus of this article is on the application of #data for #growth through #innovation. The insights are independent of company structure or leadership. The prime recommendations are:&nbsp; One. Discover and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ incentives. Two. Find and modify reinforcement linkages between outcomes and culture so that all questions can be rewarded</p><p>+ + + + + +&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 1 details the blocks that are used in the diagrams which will describe the systems of innovation. The blue circle is choice or a decision-making block; the grey squares are where people are involved in the system, and the oval shape is the beginning or end of a process.</p><p></p><p>Figure 1: explaining the blocks</p><br><p>Figure 2 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation process in startup-land. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all startups, but to identify critical differences to the corporate world and why innovation feels easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 2: Innovation process in startup-land</p><p>Explaining figure 2. Starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram,&nbsp; “Hypothesis or Thesis”. Typically a team will come together with an idea, and the Hypothesis Or Thesis determines the data required for the Data Lake. There is a flow from a Data Lake to Knowledge and Insights on the left. The process tests the Thesis the team created through analysis using the available data. The analysis process generates Knowledge and Insight, which closes an agile feedback system as knowledge and Insight refines what data we need in a Data Lake to complement the analysis which tests the team’s Thesis or Hypothesis. Knowledge and Insights give rise to recommendations which leads to Decisions. Decisions over time, become Outcomes, which we measure. Knowing and measuring Outcomes help us refine and define better the requirements we have for the data in our Data Lake, thus creating a second slower iterative improvement system.&nbsp; Our Data Lake has a relationship or correlation to the Bias and Assumptions we have as a team.&nbsp; There is a closed-loop system between Bias and Assumptions and the Data Lake that further helps inform the Data Lake and reminds us of our Bias and Assumptions. A second influence on Bias and Assumption is the team’s Beliefs and Culture. Open cultures enable teams to question their Bias and Assumptions, whilst other cultures may avoid questions. A culture that encourages questioning will enable open-minded teams to continually check if they have the correct thesis and data in a Data Lake, and undertake the analysis without creating an outcome that was forecast. There is a link between Bias and Assumptions, which helps us in our decision-making process. In a collaborative, open and free-thinking system, being able to check assumptions will enlighten decisions, leading to better outcomes. In an early-stage company, Reward and Motivation structure are not coupled to Outcomes as there is no revenue or direct causal correlation. The Reward and Motivation is fundamentally the team and individuals driven to do their best, as the team is there to prove their Hypothesis or Thesis, and to grow a company based on their collective thinking. Reward and Motivation structures create Patterns and Alignments. When the team’s perception of Patterns and Alignments are open, the loop is responsive and adaptive to questions and problems. We know our behaviours link Patterns and Alignments with the Knowledge and Insights we search for. We see this linkage in the methods and priorities that are created and focussed on. Priorities will give rise to recommendations which lead to decisions where outcomes help us refine a data Lake to improve continually and hypothesis. An agile loop of continual improvement.</p><p>In startup-land, this system leads to rapid development, creative thinking within an adaptive self-improving process.&nbsp; The improvement is creating a refinement of the hypothesis, the data, the analysis and witnessed as outcomes which create change. In a system driven by data, and the ability to challenge and question everything, we find outcomes and culture focus on refining a hypothesis/thesis and the team strives to refine continually and improve which supports innovation and drives growth. It feels easy as the system enables flow.</p><p>Moving our attention to corporate-land before the actions are presented.&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 3 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation cycle in corporate-land. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all enterprises, but to identify critical difference to the startup world and why innovation feels harder. Immediately noticeable is there is that there are more dependencies.</p><p></p><p>Figure 3: Innovation process in corporate-land</p><p>In figure 3, starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram,&nbsp; which says “Memory and/or Processes”.&nbsp; This block was a “Hypothesis or Thesis” in startup-land.&nbsp; In the corporate world, trading history has provided experience, teams, revenue and methodology, which includes memory and processes that deliver barriers to entry, IP and often the core value of the company.</p><p>A critical link is already established between Memory and/or Processes and, Beliefs and Culture.&nbsp; Often this is visible in recruiting people who already adhere to the Beliefs and Culture of the company (search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=organisational+fit">organisational fit</a>). An influential culture determines that this is the way we do things, based on Memory and Processes, which usually removes the ability to question Bias and Assumptions (this is how we do it.)&nbsp; We retain the same Bias and Assumptions which taints/ colours or distorts Decisions.&nbsp; Decisions over time, become Outcomes.&nbsp; In corporate-land, everything is measured (what does not get measured cannot be managed).&nbsp; We measure the success of our Outcomes. Successful Outcomes re-enforces that our Beliefs and Culture are right so we should not change.&nbsp; Unsuccessful outcomes are seen as an error in the model, data or analysis and that we need more of the right data.&nbsp; The Outcome tends to favour or aligns to Rewards and Motivations as incentives and bonuses are linked directly to the outcome.&nbsp; With Outcomes measures and aligned to Rewards and Motivations, we have a confirmational bias towards certain Patterns and Alignments, that favours individual success.&nbsp; This restricts the options and learning from an outcomes and will direct our priorities, meaning we will search for certain Knowledge and Insights in our data set, especially ones that we can recommend as a decision, that creates an outcome which aligns to our personal performance metrics, established by the memory in the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Central in the diagram in Figure 3 is Delta in Risk.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; When an organisation is finance-led, risk is modelled, defined and understood. Financial data and controls ensure that processes are designed to control risk at the agreed level.&nbsp; Data creates many dynamic changes within an organisation.&nbsp; Critically data introduces clarity and understanding of risks that could not be seen through the pure lens of finance. Ignoring cyber attacks and loss of data as a systemic risk, the data risk of interest here is the identification of new insights about products, services, teams, partners, processes that data brings to the attention of employees and Directors—a delta in risk.&nbsp; Many of the closed-loop reinforcement and confirmational biased feedback loops can be identified, but are structured to ignore this new risk. Where risk is identified, it creates instability in memory, bias, assumptions and decision making. Still, because of the strength of existing processes, the tension may not lead to change but rather a higher level of frustration, denial and protectionism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Existing processes have memory and efficiency of flow that can improve incrementally what already exists. The same memory is designed to resist flow-oriented towards a change of the process itself.</p><p>In a complicated closed-loop system driven by data; where outcomes drive rewards and culture removes the ability to challenge and question, our memory and processes continually re-enforce the same patterns. We find we are unable to adapt to the new vulnerabilities and risks that data adds, which is destabilising. We unpack that our processes are not set to support disruptive innovation or iteration at scale. Data can define a set of possibilities and constraints&nbsp;located in the past. Data has and is biased, and those biases are different and unique. Data has no imagination or creativity, and it will keep doing the same thing.&nbsp; Data cannot create a solution on its own.</p> Comparing the models <p>In corporate-land innovation appears more difficult, my experience shows innovation itself is not more difficult, however, the willingness to accept, create change, adapt, steer to a new course that innovation brings is more difficult due to closed-loop feedback systems. The take away is that in start-up land there is less measurement and that means there are fewer linkages to confirmational loops.&nbsp; Is KPI’s innovations nemesis?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Figure 4: Simplified models compared</p><p>By example, from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesmith9/">Mike Smith,</a> here are three measurements that create continual frustration for innovation teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As a legal representative for this company, it’s my job to make sure we don’t sign any contracts that put us in a perilous position, and to make sure that we’re abiding by all local laws and regulations”. I am a Fellow of my legal institution and am professionally bound by their code of conduct, and I am measured by how few lawsuits we are involved in, both with other companies and with other institutions. I am incentivised to avoid that risky innovative contract.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As the lead for HR in this company, and being responsible for employee retention and well-being, it’s my responsibility to make sure we recruit carefully following appropriate laws (no discrimination etc), and ideally minimize employee dismissals as they are disruptive and represent risk to the company. “ I am measured on the avoidance of claims, and really don't want to recruit that brilliant and outspoken evangelist who has 1,000,000 followers on BLM.</p>  <p>“As CFO, I need to make sure our books balance and are fiscally responsible. When it comes to the product team needing money for research and development, we need to balance investment with income, and ensure that the solvency of the company isn’t in question.” I am a member of a professional body and my reputation is my next job. It will count against me if as the CFO I agree to a large loan to accomplish some critical work that others view as essential for company growth and it goes wrong. My bonus is based on avoiding risky financial transactions.</p>  <p>Often the system we have created for stability, measurement and risk avoidance, rewards key individuals for doing their job well, but this can stand counter to innovation.</p> Recommendations for becoming more innovative by breaking something? <p>My recommendation based on experience and experiment is that innovation, disruption and transformation are difficult but not impossible. They all start from knowing what to transform.&nbsp; Therefore if innovation is what you are seeking in corporate-land, here are some ideas:-</p>  <p>Find and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ motivations. This means breaking apart HR, reward calculations, annual reviews, remuneration packages and incentive programs. HR will kick and scream; they are not the issue.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Find and modify reinforcement linkages between outcomes and culture so that all questions can be asked and all questions are rewarded.&nbsp; This means that unsuccessful outcomes help to create more questions and not blame, which means some employees are going to find it beyond challenging.</p>  <p>Swop out a love for corporate memory to create a hypothesis and not a millstone.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Find ways to enable and deliver the diversity of thinking that creates openness, which changes who you will employee.&nbsp;</p>  <br>thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesmith9/">Mike Smith</a><br><br>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro-credentials, incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and instantly trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a personally held wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in interoperable achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. The lead author of that piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, also leads a group called the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/university-led-digital-credentials-consortium-explores-technology-digital-academic-credentials">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). DCC includes 14 intrepid schools, including the likes of MIT and Harvard, developing interoperability of achievements that are literally carried by the achievers. They also <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf">see VCs</a> as the basis for this interoperability, and are making exciting progress.</p><p>My conclusion: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad, even global academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that can securely transport the achievement or LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers, via the achiever&nbsp;herself.</p><p>By using this same VC technology for student ID, a school does three critical things to lay the foundation for later exchanging achievements:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by the school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?  What’s Ready   Code, Products, &amp; Services — Open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">code</a>; VC-oriented products from <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-booting-up-the-network/ba-p/1441552">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM</a>, and dozens of startups.  Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.  Standards Work — <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/participants">W3C</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>  Custodial Solutions — <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>  Broad Consensus About VCs — The Verifiable Credential is the only <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">container</a> I’m consistently seeing under consideration for <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">transporting verifiable data between trust domains</a>, which self-sovereign control and trust require, from academia to healthcare to finance and&nbsp;beyond.  Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system. Better to start a new identity project with self-sovereign student ID, which can begin to consolidate systems and reduce complexity, than build another layer that may well add to&nbsp;it.</p> In Conclusion <p>For those interested primarily in achievements, ID is an “and” and not an “or,” and it should come first, as it lays a technical and familiarity foundation for achievements to be issued and quickly useful. Communications could come soon after ID, because it becomes available as soon as the first connection with a student is&nbsp;created.</p><p>Achievements will come later, after the necessary consensus among schools and employers has been sorted to establish semantic meaning and interoperability for exchanged data payloads. Then this model — of people receiving, controlling, and sharing their achievements in a digital, verifiable form — will become the norm, and the future of work will become the&nbsp;present.</p><p>Until that day, schools can leap right past proprietary digital ID solutions and go straight to self-sovereign, and reap all its benefits without having to wait for anyone else to agree to anything, giving students a modern digital experience they’ll&nbsp;love.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-1-of-2-d3104ab0f8f2">Part 1: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</a></blockquote><p>¹ Down the road, VCs could also be used for authorization, where granular-level permissions and entitlements are carried and presented by individuals, simplifying the administration of centralized policy-based access control and moving enforcement to the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>Special thanks to several helpful reviewers, editors, and contributors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnphillips11kps/">John Phillips</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Dr. Phil Windley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phil Long</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-perry-1b7a254/">Scott Perry</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinkelk/">Alan Davies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taykendesign/">Taylor Kendal</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-hailstone-92a1a51/">Matthew Hailstone</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product, and do not result in vendor lock-in; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. I am the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, and co-creator of the first self-sovereign student ID product, <a href="http://studentpass.id">StudentPass</a>.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID is a breakthrough: students independently store verifiable data and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: strong, passwordless login, KBA-free call in, and cardless walk in authentication of students; granular, provable skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent;&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions.  <a href="https://link.medium.com/W3o6duQc19">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a>  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal or a QR code on a card for elementary school students— which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? Because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and likely perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship between a school and its students.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between that container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet and shares proofs of with others, when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that above-mentioned self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not always “credentials”; they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. (I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.)</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), earned a degree or other achievement, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from an iPhone to an Android device and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically end-verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized, not proprietary  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>Self-sovereign student ID has many, many uses. I’ll attempt to organize the most obvious ones into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within Part 1 (this post) and is where I’ll delve the most deeply. I’ll cover the other five categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC proofs and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The initial and primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a strong, digital version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords, personal questions, or physical&nbsp;cards.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords and can replace the hassle and expense of 2FA (2nd-factor authentication). See more about multi-factor authentication below.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly and without replacing or fundamentally altering the existing identity&nbsp;system.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, not just identity information. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with other information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, emergency contacts, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/avoid-shared-secrets-based-approaches-to-authentication/">shared secrets</a> (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics and location can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards that enable tools from different vendors to be interoperable. This means that a school isn’t locked into a vendor and can replace them without reissuing IDs (try that with a traditional ID system). Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS.</p><p>Use of student ID is no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet — note the irony of a physical card containing a wallet — with some of a student’s VCs. This greatly expands the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items a student can carry and benefit from, and makes it harder for fraudsters to swap out names, photos, ID numbers,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or simply a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests, and removes the UX-killing friction of dealing with passwords.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call. When walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than treated as a stranger at each interaction.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have the required thing. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. By minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors (while reducing vendor lock-in), a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into details about this topic within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For schools, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and quickly felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And ID is a prerequisite for most other SSI or VC-based use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by ensuring that you know with whom you are&nbsp;dealing.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be only the beginning of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. For achievements and several other cool and interesting use cases, read <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>
enables <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/host/" title="Docker documentation: “Use host networking”">host networking</a>, so on Linux, at least, you should be able to
connect to <code>localhost</code> to deploy your changes. On <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Mac”">macOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Windows”">Windows</a>, use
the <code>host.docker.internal</code> host name. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture? Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships: what is allowed and what behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

<a></a>
 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by an intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a> as NEA: No one owns it, Everyone can use it, and Anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

<a></a>
 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define its menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.

 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.  
     See Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">nice summary</a> of James C. Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.

     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifier for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>
<p>All are encouraged to review these drafts in advance of the formal OpenID Foundation review period for them, which should commence in a few weeks.  If you believe that changes are needed before they become Final Specifications, please file issues describing the proposed changes.  Discussion on the <a href="mailto:openid-specs-ab@lists.openid.net">OpenID Connect mailing list</a> is also encouraged.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for writing the initial logout certification tests.  And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_panva">Filip Skokan</a> for providing resolutions to two of the thornier Session Management issues.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

  Zeynep Tufekci on aerosolized Covid-19 transmission and the need for ventilation.

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground. As Peter Drucker famously said, “Innovate or&nbsp;die”.</p><p>References</p><p>Figure 1: A Verifiable Credentials Primer, by Manu Sporny, Digital&nbsp;Bazaar</p><p>W3C Verifiable Credentials - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/digital-credentials-for-a-safer-world-37a2e1694791">Digital Credentials for a Safer World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable.
