<p>Putting aside the obvious “well that’s good then”, I am bound to ask why Apple controlling all my life and having to work out how to keep me there is any worse than some dubious super app seeking to do the same, and whatever phone I use - there it is. Yes - convenient - but is that what we want?</p>

 Earlier this month, western countries led by the United States had issued terror warnings and told their citizens not to join public gatherings in Russia. On 8 March, the embassy wrote it was “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts, and U.S. citizens should be advised to avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours.”

<p>Threads users with public profiles in certain countries can now turn on a setting which makes their posts available in the fediverse - so users of ActivityPub systems such as Mastodon can follow their accounts to subscribe to their posts.</p>

<p>It's only a partial integration at the moment: Threads users can't themselves follow accounts from other providers yet, and their notifications will show them likes but not boosts or replies: "For now, people who want to see replies on their posts on other fediverse servers will have to visit those servers directly."</p>

<p>Depending on how you count, Mastodon has around 9m user accounts of which 1m are active. Threads claims more than 130m active monthly users. The Threads team are developing these features cautiously which is reassuring to see - a clumsy or thoughtless integration could cause all sorts of damage just from the sheer scale of their service.</p>

  <p>Here is a short, illustrative example of one of the ways in which I use Claude and ChatGPT on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I recently learned that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Adirondack Park</a> is the single largest park in the contiguous United States, taking up a fifth of the state of New York.</p>
<p>Naturally, my first thought was that it would be neat to have a GeoJSON file representing the boundary of the park.</p>
<p>A quick search landed me on the <a href="https://apa.ny.gov/gis/ApaData.html">Adirondack Park Agency GIS data page</a>, which offered me a shapefile of the "Outer boundary of the New York State Adirondack Park as described in Section 9-0101 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law". Sounds good!</p>
<p>I knew there were tools for converting shapefiles to GeoJSON, but I couldn't remember what they were. Since I had a terminal window open already, I typed the following:</p>
  llm -m opus -c 'give me options on macOS for CLI tools to turn a shapefile into GeoJSON'  
<p>Here I am using my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM tool</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin) to run a prompt through the new <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-family">Claude 3 Opus</a>, my current favorite language model.</p>
<p>It replied with a couple of options, but the first was this:</p>
  ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON output.geojson input.shp  
<p>So I ran that against the shapefile, and then pasted <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c941f3454cdec7e10f500dc5a752b614">the resulting GeoJSON</a> into <a href="https://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> to check if it worked... and nothing displayed. Then I looked at the GeoJSON and spotted this:</p>
<p><code>"coordinates": [ [ -8358911.527799999341369, 5379193.197800002992153 ] ...</code></p>
<p>That didn't look right. Those co-ordinates aren't the correct scale for latitude and longitude values.</p>
<p>So I sent a follow-up prompt to the model (the <code>-c</code> option means "continue previous conversation"):</p>
  llm -c 'i tried using ogr2ogr but it gave me back GeoJSON with a weird coordinate system that was not lat/lon that i am used to'  
<p>It suggested this new command:</p>
  ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs EPSG:4326 output.geojson input.shp  
<p>This time <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6c4cf102a8ea532dc365c2773f0eb6ea">it worked</a>! The shapefile has now been converted to GeoJSON.</p>
<p>Time elapsed so far: 2.5 minutes (I can tell from <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html">my LLM logs</a>).</p>
<p>I pasted it into <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> (with <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-paste">datasette-paste</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-leaflet-geojson">datasette-leaflet-geojson</a>) to take a look at it more closely, and got this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's not a single polygon! That's 106 line segments... and they are fascinating. Look at those descriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thence westerly along the northern line of lots 204 and 203 to the midpoint of the northern line of lot 203</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is utterly delightful. The shapefile description did say "as described in Section 9-0101 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law", so I guess this is how you write geographically boundaries into law!</p>
<p>But it's not what I wanted. I want a single polygon of the whole park, not 106 separate lines.</p>
<p>I decided to switch models. ChatGPT has access to Code Interpreter, and I happen to know that Code Interpreter is quite effective at processing GeoJSON.</p>
<p>I opened a new ChatGPT (with GPT-4) browser tab, uploaded my GeoJSON file and prompted it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This GeoJSON file is full of line segments. Use them to create me a single shape that is a Polygon</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>OK, so it wrote some Python code and ran it. But did it work?</p>
<p>I happen to know that Code Interpreter can save files to disk and provide links to download them, so I told it to do that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Save it to a GeoJSON file for me to download</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I pasted <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c1002dbf5249de7addd0b65cb774d3e9">that</a> into <a href="https://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a>, and it was clearly wrong:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So I told it to try again. I didn't think very hard about this prompt, I basically went with a version of "do better":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that doesn't look right to me, check that it has all of the lines in it</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It gave me a new file, optimistically named <code>complete_polygon.geojson</code>. Here's what that one looked like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is getting a lot closer! Note how the right hand boundary of the park looks correct, but the rest of the image is scrambled.</p>
<p>I had a hunch about the fix. I prompted:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I pasted in a screenshot of where we were so far and added my hunch about the solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That almost works but you need to sort the line segments first, it looked like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, pasting in the screenshot probably wasn't necessary here, but it amused me.</p>
<p>... and ChatGPT churned away again ...</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/b9e4325b76e4a3813ff5482aa278c342">sorted_polygon.geojson</a> is spot on! Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Total time spent in ChatGPT: 3 minutes and 35 seconds. Plus 2.5 minutes with Claude 3 earlier, so an overall total of just over 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0343cdd3568bbe28cad15d1097b1b1c7">the full Claude transcript</a> and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3eb845823c5ad4c48d2b4eb7586f1533">full transcript from ChatGPT</a>.</p>
 This isn't notable 
<p>The most notable thing about this example is how completely not notable it is.</p>
<p>I get results like this from these tools several times a day. I'm not at all surprised that this worked, in fact, I would've been mildly surprised if it had not.</p>
<p>Could I have done this without LLM assistance? Yes, but not nearly as quickly. And this was not a task on my critical path for the day - it was a sidequest at best and honestly more of a distraction.</p>
<p>So, without LLM tools, I would likely have given this one up at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>A year ago I wrote about how <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/">AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects</a>. They are now so firmly baked into my daily work that they influence not just side projects but tiny sidequests like this one as well.</p>
 This certainly wasn't simple 
<p>Something else I like about this example is that it illustrates quite how much depth there is to getting great results out of these systems.</p>
<p>In those few minutes I used two different interfaces to call two different models. I sent multiple follow-up prompts. I triggered Code Interpreter, took advantage of GPT-4 Vision and mixed in external tools like <a href="https://geojson.io/">geojson.io</a> and Datasette as well.</p>
<p>I leaned a lot on my existing knowledge and experience:</p>
 
 I knew that tools existed for commandline processing of shapefiles and GeoJSON 
 I instinctively knew that Claude 3 Opus was likely to correctly answer my initial prompt 
 I knew the capabilities of Code Interpreter, including that it has libraries that can process geometries, what to say to get it to kick into action and how to get it to give me files to download 
 My limited GIS knowledge was strong enough to spot a likely coordinate system problem, and I guessed the fix for the jumbled lines 
 My prompting intuition is developed to the point that I didn't have to think very hard about what to say to get the best results 
 
<p>If you have the right combination of domain knowledge and hard-won experience driving LLMs, you can fly with these things.</p>
 Isn't this a bit trivial? 
<p>Yes it is, and that's the point. This was a five minute sidequest. Writing about it here took ten times longer than the exercise itself.</p>
<p>I take on LLM-assisted sidequests like this one dozens of times a week. Many of them are substantially larger and more useful. They are having a very material impact on my work: I can get more done and solve much more interesting problems, because I'm not wasting valuable cycles figuring out <code>ogr2ogr</code> invocations or mucking around with polygon libraries.</p>
<p>Not to mention that I find working this way fun! It feels like science fiction every time I do it. Our AI-assisted future is here right now and I'm still finding it weird, fascinating and deeply entertaining.</p>
 LLMs are useful 
<p>There are many legitimate criticisms of LLMs. The copyright issues involved in their training, their enormous power consumption and the risks of people trusting them when they shouldn't (considering both accuracy and bias) are three that I think about a lot.</p>
<p>The one criticism I wont accept is that they aren't useful.</p>
<p>One of the greatest misconceptions concerning LLMs is the idea that they are easy to use. They really aren't: getting great results out of them requires a great deal of experience and hard-fought intuition, combined with deep domain knowledge of the problem you are applying them to.</p>
<p>I use these things every day. They help me take on much more interesting and ambitious problems than I could otherwise. I would miss them terribly if they were no longer available to me.</p>

   DuckDB as the New jq 
 The DuckDB CLI tool can query JSON files directly, making it a surprisingly effective replacement for jq. Paul Gross demonstrates the following query: 

 select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) from 'repos.json' group by 1 

 repos.json contains an array of {"license": {"key": "apache-2.0"}..} objects. This example query shows counts for each of those licenses.

<p>Update 2024-03-22: To compliment high-level discussions on the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>
channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>, I also created a <a href="https://github.com/theory/justatheory/pull/4">pull request</a> to make it
easer directly comment to this post point by point. Keep the feedback coming,
and thank you!</p>
 
<p>This post proposes a new metadata standard for extension packaging,
distribution, and delivery, building on the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a> to address its
shortcomings and emerging use cases 12 years on. The goals include:</p>
 
 Don’t break the existing standard, but add to it 
 Add explicit support for different types of Postgres extensions,
such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> 
 Add additional metadata for curation and automated binary compilation 
 Add hooks for registry and third-party-contributed metadata, including
binary distribution options and stats &amp; reports. 
 
<p>There are two high level categories of metadata, split into two separate
files:</p>
 
 <a>Package Metadata</a> provided by extension package
authors 
 <a>Registry Metadata</a> aggregated by the root registry
from various sources, including data derived from the extension source
code or package metadata, but also trusted third parties such as
packagers, smoke testers, security scanners, and more. 
 
<p>Following community discussion of this proposal, the <a>Package
Metadata</a>  will lead to a draft for PGXN Meta Spec version
2.0.0, while the <a>Registry Metadata</a> will guide the design
and implementation of the Root Registry APIs required to provide it.</p>
 Terms 
<p>Definition of terms as used in this document, because every language and
distribution system uses terms differently. These are ours.</p>
 
 
<p>Extension: a software component that extends the capabilities of a
PostgreSQL database or cluster. Extensions may be <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Package: A collection of extensions that are released, versioned, and
distributed together. Packages may be downloaded directly from version
control repositories or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_file" title="Wikipedia: “Archive file”">archive files</a> generated by a release tag.</p>
 
 
<p>Package Path: Identifies a package, declared in the <a>package
metadata</a> file. A package path should describe both
what the package does and where to find it. Typically, a package path
consists of a repository root path — the directory that contains the
metadata file — and a directory within the repository.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository: The version control repository where the package is
developed, referenced as package path or URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Repository root path: The portion of the package path that corresponds
to the root directory of the version control repository where the package
is developed, and which contains the metadata file. Most package are
defined in their repository’s root directory, so this is usually the
entire path. For example, <code>github.com/example/pgtap</code> is the repository
root path for the package of the same name.</p>
 
 
<p>Source Distribution: The contents of a single package bundled together
with <a>package metadata</a> into distributable archive
file, usually named with the last part of the package path or the main
extension, a dash, and the version, e.g., <code>pgtap-1.14.3.zip</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Binary Distribution: A binary software distribution of a package,
compiled and packaged for a particular OS version, platform, and hardware
architecture. Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)" title="Wikipedia: “Deb (file format)”">deb</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" title="Wikipedia: “RPM Package Manager”">RPM</a>, and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/" title="Python Packaging User Guide: Source distribution format">wheel</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Release: A single instance of a package and version published on PGXN,
expressed as the package path, an at sign, and the <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semver</a>. Example:
<code>github.com/theory/pgtap@v1.14.3</code>.</p>
 
 
 Package Metadata 
<p>The extension author provides this data as part of a release submitted to the
root registry. The registry itself will not change this data in any way, but
provide it as-is.</p>
 Essentials 
<p>Essential information about the package itself, including its path, name,
version, list of authors, license, etc. Ecosystem applications use this data
for indexing, naming conventions, and display information.</p>
<p>Fields (all required):</p>
 
 Package: A package path uniquely identifying the package (usually the
source repo host name and path; see <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/03/extension-namespace-rfc/" title="Extension Registry Namespacing RFC">this RFC</a>) 
 Name: The name of the extension package, usually the same as the main
extension, not unique but conflicts are resolved by escalation to
<code>package</code> 
 Version: The version of the package, expressed as a <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">SemVer</a> 
 Abstract: A short description of the purpose of the package 
 Description: A longer description of the package, answering the
question “what is this thing and what value is it?” 
 Maintainer: List of maintainers, each an object with <code>name</code> and either
<code>email</code> or <code>url</code> (or both) 
 License: An <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/SPDX-license-expressions/" title="Annex D SPDX license expressions (Normative)">SPDX 2.3 license expression</a> comprised of one or more
licenses from the <a href="https://spdx.github.io/license-list-data/" title="PREVIEW - SPDX License List">SPDX License List</a> 
 Spec: Information about the metadata spec itself, a version and URL 
 
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "package": "github.com/example/pg-pair",
  "name": "pair",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "abstract": "A key/value pair data type",

  ],
  "license": "PostgreSQL OR MIT",
  "spec": {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "url": "https://pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt"
  }
}
</code>  <p>Other possibilities:</p>
 
 License File: An alternative to <code>license</code> for nonstandard licenses
(from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The license and license-file fields">cargo</a>) 
 Contributors: List of people who have contributed to the package 
 Emeriti: List of former maintainers and contributors 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
 
 Overloads the string representation of the spec v1 field, but it should be
able to parse either one, especially with the spec version to
differentiate. 
 Uniqueness of <code>package</code> and relationship to <code>name</code> 
 
 Artifacts 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading the extension package in one or
more formats, including source code, binaries, system packages, and more. Apps
use this information (along with <a>registry metadata</a>) to
determine the best option for installing an extension on a particular system.</p>
<p>This information is optional, and provided in addition to the source code
available from the root registry itself. The idea is that, on release, the
release manager creates artifacts in one or more locations (such as GitHub
releases), and it’s useful to link to them from the registry. Binary builds
may be unlikely today, but leave the option open for now by allowing arbitrary
text in the <code>type</code> field.</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Type: The type of artifact: Source, binary, RPM, etc. 
 URL: Link the the artifact 
 SHA: A SHA checksum 
 
<p>Each URL must properly resolve and the checksum must match.</p>
  <code>[
  {
    "type": "source",
    "url": "https://github.com/theory/pg-pair/releases/download/v1.1.0/pair-1.1.0.zip",

</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>New object, no conflicts.</p>
 Resources 
<p>External information about the package, mostly links, including source code
repository, bug reporting, documentation, badges, funding, etc. Apps use this
data for links, of course, but also full text indexing, documentation
rendering, and displaying useful information about the extension.</p>

 <code>issues</code> replaces <code>bugtracker</code> and is just a URL. Can support either 
 <code>repository</code> is just a URL instead of an object. Can support either
but with the <code>package</code> key referencing the repository path perhaps
we don’t need to change it. 
 
 Contents 
<p>A description of what’s included in the package. Often a package consists of
multiple extensions, such as <a href="https://postgis.net" title="PostGIS">PostGIS</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apostgis%2Fpostgis+%22default_version+%3D%22&amp;type=code" title="postgis/postgis: control files">includes</a> <code>postgis</code>,
<code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, <code>address_standardizer</code>, and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some extensions are not <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>-type <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a> at
all, such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a>, command-line apps, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>,
shared libraries, and more. Each should be listed along with documentation
links where they differ from the package overall (or are simply more
specific).</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 Extensions: Object describing <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”">extensions</a>. Keys
are extension names, fields are objects with the fields <code>sql</code>, <code>doc</code>,
<code>abstract</code>, <code>control</code> (same as control file, but can use the file itself),
<code>tle</code> (meaning it can be used as a <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">trusted language extension</a>), and
<code>preload</code> (to indicate whether its libraries need to be loaded in advance
via <code>shared_preload_libraries</code>, <code>session_preload_libraries</code>, or
<code>local_preload_libraries</code>). 
 Workers: Object describing background workers. Keys are worker names,
fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and <code>abstract</code>. 
 Apps: Object describing applications, command-line or otherwise. Keys
are app names, fields are objects with the fields <code>bin</code>, <code>doc</code>, and
<code>abstract</code>. 
 Modules: Object describing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a> that can be loaded into
Postgres (not necessary for extensions that include libraries). Keys are
module names, fields are objects with the fields <code>lib</code> (without file
extension), <code>doc</code>, <code>abstract</code>, and <code>preload</code>. 
 Libraries: Other libraries that may ship in the package and need to be
installed but are not <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/gist-extensibility.html">loadable modules</a>, such as a dynamic library used
by an app. Keys are library names, fields are objects with the fields
<code>lib</code> (without file extension) or <code>dir</code> (for a directory of files), <code>doc</code>,
and <code>abstract</code>.

under <code>contents</code> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_file" title="Wikipedia: “Manifest file”"><code>manifest</code></a> and continue to support both.</p>
 Dependencies 
<p>A list of external dependencies required to configure, build, test, install,
and run the extensions in the package. These include not only other extension
packages, but also external libraries and system dependencies. And let’s not
forget the versions of Postgres required, as well as any OS and version
dependencies (e.g, does it work on Windows? FreeBSD? What versions?) and
architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64" title="Wikipedia: AArch64">arm64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amd64" title="Wikipedia: AMD64">amd64</a>, etc.)</p>
<p>Fields:</p>
 
 
<p>platforms: Platforms supported by the package, defined as OS and
architecture. Assume all platforms if none are listed.</p>
 
 
<p>postgres: Versions of PostgreSQL required by the package, specified as
a version range, as well as compiled features (<code>--with-*</code> configure
options)</p>
 
 
<p>pipeline: The build pipeline required to build the extension. Options:
<code>pgxs</code>, <code>meson</code> (?) <code>pgrx</code>, <code>gnu</code> (<code>./configure</code>), <code>gem</code>, <code>cpan</code>, <code>pip</code>,
<code>go</code>, etc.</p>
 
 
<p>prereqs: Object defining external dependencies required for different
phases:</p>
 
 configure: Dependencies to configure the package (e.g., items
required for <code>./configure</code> or <code>make</code> to work) 
 build: Dependencies to build the package (in addition to run
dependencies) 
 test: Dependencies to test the package (in addition to build and
run dependencies) 
 run: Dependencies to run the package 
 develop: Dependencies to develop the package (in addition to all
other phase dependencies) 
 
<p>Each points to an object with at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 requires: Required to use the package 
 recommends: Not required, but recommended as a best practice 
 suggests: Not required, but nice to have 
 conflicts: Package will not work with these items 
 
<p>These, in turn, contain at least one of these keys:</p>
 
 package: Other packages, expressed by their package paths,
pointing to a version expression 
 external: External dependencies not included with the package 
 contrib: List of Postgres contrib or development packages 
 
 
 
<p>variations: A list of dependency variations, each with two fields:</p>
 
 where: Specifies a configuration that, when matched, includes the
dependencies. For example, to specify alternate dependencies for Linux
arm64, it would be <code>"platforms": { "linux": "arm64" }</code>. For a specific
version of Postgres, it would be something like
<code>"postgres": { "version": "&gt;= 16, &lt; 17" }</code>. [This likely needs some
deep thinking through.] 
 dependencies: An object containing of the other key structures in
this object, defining the additional dependencies for environments
that match the <code>where</code> field. 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>packages</code> and <code>external</code> keys point to objects in which the keys are
dependency names and the values are version range expressions (empty string
means any version). The <code>postgres.version</code> field is also a version range
expression.</p>
<p>The <code>contrib</code> key points to an array of Postgres-supplied apps and extensions.
Versions are not necessary because they effectively have the same version as a
supported Postgres version.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "postgres": {
    "version": "&gt;= 12, &lt; 17",
    "with": [ "xml", "uuid", "perl" ]
  },
  "pipeline": "pgrx",
  "platforms": {
    "linux": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "darwin": [ "amd64", "arm64" ],
    "windows": [ "amd64" ],
    "freebsd": [ "amd64" ]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "configure": {
      "requires": {
        "external": { "cargo-pgrx": "" }
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "requires": {
        "external": {
          "curl": "",
          "awk": "",
          "sed": "",
          "perl": "5.20"
        }
      },
      "recommends": {
        "external": {
          "jq": "",
          "perl": "5.38"
        }
      }
    },
    "test": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "pg_regress", "plpgsql", "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/pgtap": "1.1.0"
        }
      }
    },
    "run": {
      "requires": {
        "contrib": [ "plperl" ],
        "packages": {
          "github.com/theory/hostname": ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
<p>The <code>external</code> field is the tricky one. How does one provide a canonical
dependency for a third-party library or app that may have loads of different
names on different platforms, different packaging systems (apt vs rpm), and
even different versions of them, or split apart for development and runtime
use? Some possibilities:</p>
 
 Use <a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec" title="purl-spec: A minimal specification for purl a.k.a. a package “mostly universal” URL">purl</a> and let downstream services handle the conversion 
 Create a rule set that allows one to predict dependency name changes
across ecosystems, similar to <a href="https://github.com/repology/repology-rules" title="Package normalization ruleset for Repology">repology-rules</a> 
 Just use <a href="https://repology.org" title="Repology, the packaging hub">Repology</a>? 
 
<p>Other notes:</p>
 
 Decide on a version range standards to adopt. Start with the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#Version.Ranges" title="PGXN Meta Spec: Version Ranges">PGXN version
range</a>, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/" title="PEP 508 – Dependency specification for Python Software Packages">pep-0508</a>, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver#ranges" title="npm docs: semver advanced range syntax">npm ranges</a>, and <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem/Version.html">Gem::Version</a>. 
 Is <code>pipeline</code> really necessary, given configure requirements? I think so,
because it tells the client the preferred build system to use, in case it
can’t detect it for some reason. 
 
<p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Significantly differs from the existing <code>prereqs</code> object, so this one is keyed
under <code>dependencies</code> and we can support either.</p>
 Classification 
<p>Classification metadata lets the extension developer associate additional
information to improve discovery, such as key words. It might also allow
selections from a curated list of extension classifications, such as the
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs" title="crates.io valid category slugs">category slugs</a> supported for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-categories-field" title="Cargo Manifest Format: The categories field">cargo categories field</a>.</p>
<p>Ecosystem apps use this data to organize extensions under key words or
categories, making it easier for users to find extensions that are frequently
used together or for specific workloads or tasks.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
  "tags": [
    "testing",
    "pair",
    "parameter"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "Machine Learning"
  ]
}
</code>  <p>PGXN Compatibility:</p>
<p>Conflicts with the existing root-level <code>tags</code> array, but we can support either
one.</p>

</code>  <p>Note that PostgresML also provides a dashboard app, but it does not ship with
the extension, so it’s not listed here. It could have its own package metadata
and be separately distributed.</p>
<p>For the Python dependencies, in the absence of a neutral standard for
specifying package, here they’re specified using a syntax borrowed from RPM to
make clear that they’re Python dependencies. A couple of those dependencies
are Linux-only, so listed in <code>variations</code> where the OS is Linux.</p>
 Registry Metadata 
<p>The second metadata format is registry metadata. It starts by with a copy the
<a>package metadata</a>, but builds from there, adding
information (such as the artifact link, SHA, and cryptographic signature from
the registry itself) and sections (defined below).</p>
<p>Providing a separate metadata format enables broader community collaboration
to augment the metadata for extension packages.</p>
<p>Ideally an ecosystem of trusted services will be developed by various parties,
who will report back to the root registry as the source of record for all
metadata about extension packages. For example, a binary distribution service
like <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt" title="PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu">apt.postgresql.org</a> or <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> will submit links and checksums for
binary packages and perhaps periodic download stats.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three typologies for registry metadata:
Distributions, Reports, and Classifications.</p>
 Distributions 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading binary distributions for the
extension package. The root registry page for the package can therefore list
all the ways to install an extension and expand the list as new binary
registries add it.</p>
<p>Along with the <a>Artifacts</a> package metadata, the distribution
metadata allows installer tools to select the best option to install based on
the OS, Postgres version, and cluster configuration (e.g., install the
community Apt package if the cluster was installed from the community Apt
registry).</p>
<p>Each item must have:</p>
 
 Registry: The name of the distribution registry, unique 
 Type: The type of distribution: Apt, RPM, TLE, etc. 
 URL: Link to the the registry’s page for the distribution 
 Command: In lieu of a URL and SHA it can provide instructions to
install the distribution, e.g., <code>apt-get install postgresql16-pair</code>. 
 
<p>Each distribution registry must be trusted by the root registry to submit this
information to add to the metadata, and have its own page with additional
contextual information: its home page, docs, basic instructions, whatever. A
README of sorts.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>[
  {
    "registry": "trunk.pgxn.org",
    "type": "trunk",
    "command": "pgxn install github.com/example/pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "apt.postgresql.org",
    "type": "apt",
    "command": "apt-get install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "yum.postgresql.org",
    "type": "rpm",
    "command": "yum install postgresql16-pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgt.dev",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgt.dev/extensions/pair",
    "command": "trunk install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "pgxman.com",
    "type": "apt",
    "url": "https://pgxman.com/x/pair",
    "command": "pgxman install pair"
  },
  {
    "registry": "database.dev",
    "type": "sql",
    "url": "https://database.dev/example/pair",
    "command": "SELECT dbdev.install('example-pair');"
  },
]
</code>  <p>Other Options:</p>
 
 Information about installing from a registry that doesn’t offer URLs, like
Homebrew, where one just needs to know what the formula is called. Maybe
the same should apply to Apt? 
 
 Metrics and Reports 
<p>This object includes data such as number of downloads, build and test status
on various Postgres/OS/version combinations, binary packaging distributions,
test coverage, security certification, vulnerability detection, quality
metrics and user ratings, and more. Some of these bits of data might include
badges, e.g., for ratings or security assessments.</p>
<p>In the broader ecosystem, it would be the responsibility of the root registry
to ensure that data comes only from trusted sources. However this data will be
publicly readable, allowing any downstream applications to extend and
publish metrics and reports with their own information.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
  <code>{
    "aggregates": {
      "downloads": 32
    },
    "sources": {
      "smoke-tester.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "passes": 32,
          "fails": 8,
          "unknown": 0
        },
        "link": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://smoke-tester.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "pgt.dev": {
        "downloads": 12,
        "tags": ["two", "kv"],
        "categories": ["Analytics"]
      },
      "pgxman.com": {
        "downloads": 20
      },
      "ratings.example.com": {
        "stats": {
          "ratings": 324,
          "average": 3.2,
          "comments": 13
        },
        "link": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair",
        "badge": "https://ratings.example.com/extension/pair.svg"
      },
      "stats.example.com": {
        "contributors": 2,
        "stars": 14,
        "last_active": "2024-01-12",
      },
      "security-scan.example.com": {
        "advisories": {
          "high": 2,
          "moderate": 11,

}
</code>  <p>Notes:</p>
 
 
<p>The <code>aggregates</code> section aggregates results from multiple sources, for
example summing all downloads or averaging ratings. The list of items to
aggregate could evolve regularly.</p>
 
 
<p>Each key in <code>sources</code> identifies a trusted downstream source of
information. Each would have its own schema describing its objects and
their meaning, along with URI templates to link to. For example,
<code>stats.example.com</code> might have these templates:</p>
  <code>{
  "contributors": {
    "alt": "List of people who have contributed to the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/contributors"
  },
  "stars": {
    "alt": "Star ratings for the {name} project",
    "badge": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars.svg",
    "uri": "https://stats.example.com/{ package }/stars"
  }
}
</code>   
 
<p>Might be worth adopting more of an API of multiple files, rather than one big file.
Example: <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/docs/api/#analytics" title="Homebrew JSON API Documentation: Analytics">Homebrew analytics</a>. Note also its support for date ranges for analytics
(30/90/365 days, stats when directly installed vs. installed as a dependency).</p>

<p>My co-authors and I published updated versions of eight specifications in preparation for <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/119/">IETF 119 in Brisbane</a>.  The specifications span three working groups:  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JOSE</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/">COSE</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">OAuth</a>.  The updated specifications and outcomes when discussed at IETF 119 are as follows.</p>
<p>1, 2, &amp; 3: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-proof-03.html">JSON Web Proof</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms-03.html">JSON Proof Algorithms</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-proof-token-03.html">JSON Proof Token</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Normatively defined header parameters used 
 Populated IANA Considerations sections 
 Allowed proof representations to contain multiple base64url-encoded parts 
 Specified representation of zero-length disclosed payloads 
 Added Terminology sections 
 Updated to use <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html">draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05</a> 
 Updated to use <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-bls-key-representations-04.html">draft-ietf-cose-bls-key-representations-04</a> 
 More and better examples 
 Improvements resulting from a full proofreading 
 
<p>Continued reviews and feedback from implementations are requested.</p>
<p>4: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-fully-specified-algorithms-02.html">Fully-Specified Algorithms for JOSE and COSE</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Published initial working group document following adoption 
 Added text on fully-specified computations using multiple algorithms 
 Added text on KEMs and encapsulated keys 
 Updated instructions to the designated experts 
 
<p>It was agreed during the JOSE meeting to describe what fully-specified algorithms for ECDH would look like, for consideration by the working group.</p>
<p>5: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-metadata-03.html">OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Switched from concatenating <code>.well-known</code> to the end of the resource identifier to inserting it between the host and path components of it 
 Have <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> return <code>resource_metadata</code> URL rather than <code>resource</code> identifier 
 
<p>It was decided to start working group last call during the OAuth meeting.</p>
<p>6: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-04.html">COSE “typ” (type) Header Parameter</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Added language about media type parameters 
 Addressed working group last call comments 
 Changed requested assignment from 14 to 16 due to conflict with a new assignment 
 Addressed GENART, OPSDIR, and SECDIR review comments 
 
<p>This document is scheduled for the April 4, 2024 IESG telechat.</p>
<p>7: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-bls-key-representations-05.html">Barreto-Lynn-Scott Elliptic Curve Key Representations for JOSE and COSE</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Changed to use key type <code>EC</code> for JOSE and equivalent <code>EC2</code> for COSE for uncompressed key representations 
 Changed identifier spellings from “Bls” to “BLS”, since these letters are people’s initials 
 
<p>We received feedback to not add compressed key representations to the draft.</p>
<p>8: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rha-jose-hpke-encrypt-06.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</a>.  Updates were:</p>
 
 Use existing <code>"alg": "dir"</code> value for HPKE Direct Encryption mode 
 Aligned choices more closely with those of <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-hpke-07.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)</a> 
 Defined both Integrated Encryption mode and Key Encryption mode 
 Added IANA Considerations section 
 Removed Post-Quantum Considerations 
 
<p>It was decided to start a working group call for adoption during the JOSE meeting.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who contributed to the progress made on these specifications, both before and during IETF 119!</p>

<p>Includes quite a lot of US public domain data - 21 million digitized out-of-copyright newspapers (or do they mean newspaper articles?)</p>

<p>"This is only an initial part of what we have collected so far, in part due to the lengthy process of copyright duration verification. In the following weeks and months, we’ll continue to publish many additional datasets also coming from other open sources, such as open data or open science."</p>

<p>Coordinated by French AI startup Pleias and supported by the French Ministry of Culture, among others.</p>

<p>I can't wait to try a model that's been trained on this.</p>

<p>Vercel have an ingenious solution to this problem. Their platform already makes it easy to deploy many different instances of an application. You can now turn on "skew protection" for a number of hours which will keep older versions of your backend deployed.</p>

<p>The application itself can then include its desired deployment ID in a x-deployment-id header, a __vdpl cookie or a ?dpl= query string parameter.</p>

<p>The article includes possibly the biggest abuse of the term "just" I have ever seen:</p>

<p>"But that’s where hopefully this research will come in and say ‘don’t bother.’ Just develop a scoring metric so that the system itself can tell whether one prompt is better than another, and then just let the model optimize itself."</p>

<p>Developing a scoring metric to determine which prompt works better remains one of the hardest challenges generative AI!</p>

<p>Imagine if we had a discipline of engineers who could reliably solve that problem - who spent their time developing such metrics and then using them to optimize their prompts. If the term "prompt engineer" hadn't already been reduced to basically meaning "someone who types out prompts" it would be a pretty fitting term for such experts.</p>

Bloomington Hospital on October 15, 2022, right after demolition began.
<p>After we came to Bloomington in the summer of 2021, we rented an apartment by <a href="https://www.prospecthillneighborhood.org/">Prospect Hill</a>, a quiet dome of old houses just west of downtown. There we were surprised to hear, nearly every night, as many police and ambulance sirens as we’d heard in our Manhattan apartment. Helicopters too. Soon we realized why: the city’s hospital was right across 2nd Street, a couple blocks away. In 2022, the beautiful new <a href="https://iuhealth.org/find-locations/iu-health-bloomington-hospital">IU Health Bloomington Hospital</a> opened up on the far side of town, and the sounds of sirens were replaced by the sounds of heavy machinery slowly tearing the old place down.</p>
<p>Being a photographer and a news junkie, I thought it would be a good idea to shoot the place often, to compile a chronicle of demolition and replacement, as I had done for <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72177720297048648">the transition of Hollywood Park to SoFi Stadium</a> in Inglewood, California. But I was too busy doing other things, and all I got was that photo above, which I think <a href="https://twitter.com/chronicallydave">Dave Askins</a> would categorize as a small contribution to <a href="https://thebloomingtonchronicle.org/index.php/Category:Topical_History">topical history</a>.</p>
<p>Dave is a highly productive local journalist, and—by grace of providence for a lifelong student of journalism such as me—the deepest and most original thinker about what local news needs. I’ve shared some of Dave’s other ideas (and work) in the <a href="https://doc.searls.com/news-commons/">News Commons</a> series, but this time I’m turning a whole post over to him. Dig:::::</p>
 
<p>In the same way that every little place in America used to have a printed newspaper, every little place in America could have an online local chronicle.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, an online local chronicle is a collection of facts organized mostly in chronological order. The “pages” of the chronicle can be thought of as subsets of a community’s universal timeline of events. These online local chronicles could become the backbone of local news operations.</p>
<p>First a word about what a local chronicle is not. It is not an online encyclopedia about the little place. It’s not a comprehensive history of the place in any conventional sense. Why should it not try to be those things? Because those things are too hard to think about building from scratch. Where would you even start?</p>
<p>It is at least conceivable that an online local chronicle could be built from scratch because you start by adding new facts that are newsworthy today. A new fact added to the chronicle is a touchstone, about which anyone can reasonably ask: What came just before that?</p>
<p>A working journalist in a little place with an online local chronicle will be in a good position to do two things: (1) add new facts to the local chronicle (2) help define sets of old facts that would be useful to include in the online local chronicle.</p>
<p>A journalist who is reporting the news for a little place would think not just about writing a report of new facts for readers today. They would keep this question in mind: What collection of old facts, if they were included in the local chronicle, would have made this news report easier to write?</p>
<p>Here’s a concrete example. A recent news report written for The B Square Bulletin included a mention of a planned new jail for Monroe County. It included a final sentence meant to give readers, who might be new to that particular topic, a sense of the basic reason why anyone was thinking about building a new jail: “A consultant’s report from two and a half years ago concluded that the current jail is failing to provide constitutional levels of care.”</p>
<p>About that sentence, a reader left the following comment on the website: “I know it’s the last sentence in an otherwise informative article, but at the risk of nit-picking that sentence seems inadequate to the task of explaining the context of the notion of a new jail and the role of the federal court and the ACLU.”</p>
<p>The comment continues: “It would have been better, Dave, to link to your own excellent previous work: <a href="https://bsquarebulletin.com/2023/02/20/monroe-county-sheriff-commissioners-square-off-at-committee-meeting-aclu-lawyer-says-look-you-need-a-new-jail-everyone-knows-that/">https://bsquarebulletin.com/2023/02/20/monroe-county-sheriff-commissioners-square-off-at-committee-meeting-aclu-lawyer-says-look-you-need-a-new-jail-everyone-knows-that/</a>”</p>
<p>What this reader did was to identify a set of old facts that should be a collection (a page) in Bloomington’s local chronicle.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to identify a need to add a specific collection of facts to the local chronicle. It’s quite another to figure out who might do that. Working journalists might have time to add a new fact or two. But to expect working journalists to add all the old sets of facts would, I think, be too tall an order.</p>
<p>The idea would be to recruit volunteers to do the work of adding old facts to the online local chronicle. They could be drawn from various segments of the community—including groups that have an interest in seeing the old facts about a particular topic not just preserved, but used by working journalists to help report new facts.</p>
<p>I think many community efforts to build a comprehensive community encyclopedia have foundered, because the motivation to make a contribution to the effort is mostly philosophical: History is generally good to preserve.</p>
<p>The motivation for helping to build the online local chronicle is not some general sense of good purpose. Rather it is to help working journalists provide useful facts for anyone who in the community who is trying to make a decision.</p>
<p>That includes elected leaders. They might want to know what the reasons were at the time for building the current jail at the spot where it is now.</p>
<p>Decision makers include voters, who might be trying to decide which candidate to support.</p>
<p>Decision makers also include rank-and-file residents—who might be trying to decide where to go out for dinner and want to know what the history of health inspections for a particular restaurant are.</p>
<p>For the online local chronicle I have set up for Bloomington, there are very few pages so far. They are meant to illustrate the general concept:</p>
 
 <a href="https://thebloomingtonchronicle.org/index.php/Main_Page">https://thebloomingtonchronicle.org/index.php/Main_Page</a> 
 
 
<p>The pages are long on facts that are organized in chronological order, and short on narrative. Here are the categories that include at least one page.</p>
<p>Category: People<br>
Category: Data<br>
Category: Boards, Commissions, Councils<br>
Category: List<br>
Category: Topical History</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/02/decentralized-extension-publishing/" title="Contemplating Decentralized Extension Publishing">brainstormed</a> about decentralized Postgres extension
publishing, inspired in part by an examination of <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a>.
It was…a lot. I’ve been deeply <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/91/" title="pgconf.dev: “The Future of the Extension Ecosystem”">pondering the future</a> of PGXN and the
broader extension ecosystem, and want to start to nail down some decisions. To
that end, I’d like to propose an update to extension namespacing.</p>
 Status Quo 
<p>There are currently three ways in which an extension is considered unique:</p>
 
 Only one extension can have a given name within a single Postgres cluster.
Names are defined by the name of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a>. It is therefore not
possible to have two extensions with the same name in the same Postgres
cluster. 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> follows this pattern: Only one extension can have a given name in the
PGXN registry. The first person to release an extension then “owns” its
name, and no one else can release an extension with the same name.<a>1</a>
I think <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a> follows the same pattern. 
 Other registries like <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> and <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> define an extension by the
distribution name, at least for the purposes of selecting a binary to
install. Thus when you <code>trunk install postgis</code>, you get all of the
extensions included, as you’d expect, while
<code>trunk install address_standardizer</code> wouldn’t work at all. In the few places
that <code>trunk</code> supports installation by extension name, it prompts the user to
use the appropriate package name if there’s a conflict. 
 
 A Modest Proposal 
<p>I’d like to propose the following changes to the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec">PGXN Meta Spec</a> to start to
move away from extension uniqueness in the broader extension ecosystem and more
toward package name.</p>
 
 Add a new field, call it <code>module_path</code>, <code>project_path</code>, <code>project_uri</code>, that,
if present, uniquely identifies an extension project and all of its parts.
It should be to a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-path">Go-style module path</a> (or URI) that identifies the
project repository path where a <code>META.json</code> file lives. 
 Retain the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec#provides" title="PGXN Meta Spec: provides"><code>provides</code></a> object where keys identify extensions, but those
keys will no longer be globally unique to the registry. In other words, the
combination of <code>module_path</code> and extension name uniquely identifies an
extension, including an empty <code>module_path</code>. 
 
 How it Works 
<p>Some examples. Let’s say there is an existing extension named <code>pair</code>, included
in the distribution named <code>pg_pair</code>:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "pg_pair",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "1.2.0"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>The extension name <code>pair</code> is unique, and <code>pgxn install pair</code> will download
the pg_pair v1.2.3 bundle and compile and install pair v1.2.0.</p>
<p>Now someone else comes along and wants to make their own pair with this
metadata:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "my_pair",
  "version": "0.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "0.2.3"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>Just like today, this upload would be rejected, because there is already a
registered <code>pair</code> extension. Under my proposal, they can disambiguate by
providing a <code>module_path</code>:</p>
  <code>{
  "name": "my_pair",
  "module_path": "github/example/pair",
  "version": "0.2.3",
  "provides": {
    "pair": {
      "file": "pair.sql",
      "version": "0.2.3"
    }
  }
}
</code>  <p>This upload would be allowed. With these two releases, someone attempting to
install <code>pair</code> would see something like this:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install pair
ERROR: Duplicate extension name “pair”. Install one of these instead:
       * pgxn.org/dist/pair
       * github/example/pair
</code>  <p>Note the the module path <code>pgxn.org/dist/pair</code> in the the first option. This is
the default module path for distributions without a module path.<a>2</a> But
now the user can select the proper one to install:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install pgxn.org/dist/pair
INFO: latest version: pgxn.org/dist/pair@1.2.3
INFO: building extension
INFO: installing extension
INFO: done!
</code>  <p>Furthermore, the PGXN client will prevent the user from later installing a
conflicting extension. The failure would look something like:</p>
  <code>$ pgxn install github/example/pair
INFO: latest version: pgxn.org/dist/pair@0.2.3
ERROR: Cannot install extension “pair” from pgxn.org/dist/pair:
ERROR: A conflicting extension named “pair” is already installed
ERROR: from pgxn.org/dist/pair
</code>   Features with Benefits 
<p>I see a number of benefits to this change:</p>
 
 Compatibility with the v1 metadata spec, so that no data migration or
distribution indexing is required. 
 It loosens up extension namespacing (or name registration, if you prefer)
while adding additional metadata to help users evaluate the quality of an
extension. For example, does it come from a well-known developer? You can
see it right in the module path. 
 It creates a pattern to eventually allow auto-indexing of extensions. For
example, if you run <code>pgxn install github.com/example/pew</code>, and PGXN doesn’t
have it, it can look for a <code>META.json</code> file in that repository and, if it
exists, and there’s a semver release tag, it could try to index it and let
the user install it. There are ownership issues to be worked out, but it
has possibilities. 
 It preserves the Postgres core concept of extension identity while putting
in place a well-established (by <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod" title="Go Modules Reference">Go modules</a> and widespread use of URIs in
general) that the Postgres core could eventually adopt to allow more
flexible extension namespacing. 
 
 Request for Comments 
<p>What do you think? Good idea? Terrible idea? Please hit me with your thoughts
<a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a>, or via the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>. I’d
like to get this decision (and a few others, stay tuned!) nailed down soon and
start development, so don’t hesitate? I need your help to prevent me from making
a huge mistake.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Unless the owner would like to share ownership with someone else, in
which case they can email me to request that another user be granted
“co-ownership”. They can also request to transfer ownership to another user,
after which the original owner will no longer be able to release the
extension.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Or, if the <code>META.json</code> file has a <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec#resources" title="PGXN Meta Spec: resources">repository resource</a> with a
URL, PGXN could index it as the implied module path. Or, failing that, maybe
it should fall back on the distribution name instead of a <code>pgxn.org</code> path,
and prompt with <code>pg_pair/pair</code>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>But not of who, how, and why. Start by looking here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide">TV Guide</a>, a required resource in every home with a TV, through most of the last half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Every program was on only at its scheduled times. Sources were called stations, which broadcast over the air on channels, which one found using a dial or a display with numbers on it. Stations at their largest were regional, meaning you could only get them if you were within reach of signals on channels. To get those signals you needed an antenna on “rabbit ears” on your TV. Signals came from high on towers, buildings, or mountains, but were thwarted by other buildings, mountains, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">the inverse square law</a>, and the inconvenient fact that the Earth is round.</p>
<p>By the time TV came along, America had already devoted its evenings to consuming scheduled</p>
<p></p>
<p>programs on AM radio, which was the only kind at the time.&nbsp; After TV took over, America whole populations sat in rooms bathed in soft blue light from TV screens. Radio was repurposed for music, especially rock &amp; roll. My first radio was the one on the right. My stations were WMCA/570, WMGM/1050, WINS/1010, WABC/770, and WKBW/1520. All of those are still on the air, but playing talk and sports.&nbsp; Many fewer people know that fact, or care, or listen to AM radio, or over-the-air anything, anymore. They watch and listen to glowing rectangles that connect to the nearest router, wi-fi hot spot, or cellular data site. Antennas exist, but wavelengths are so short that the antennas fit inside the rectangles.</p>
<p>The question “what’s on?” is mostly gone. “Where?” is still in play, because nobody knows what streaming service carries what you want. All the “guides”—Apple’s, Google’s, Amazon’s, everyone’s—suck, either because they’re biased to promote their own content or because there’s simply too much content and no system can cover all of it. Search engines help, but not enough.</p>
<p>The age we’re closing is the one Jeff Jarvis calls <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gutenberg-Parenthesis-Print-Lessons-Internet/dp/1501394827">The Gutenberg Parenthesis</a>. The age we’re entering is the Age of Optionality. It began for print with blogging, for TV with VCRs and DVRs, and for radio with podcasting and streaming. And it began to obsolesce all the media we knew, almost too well, by putting it in hands Clay Shirky told us about in 2009 with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Everybody_(book)">Here Comes Everybody</a>.</p>
<p>So what we make of it is up to all of us. We are who, how, and why.</p>

   Die federführenden Ausschüsse des EU-Parlaments haben heute mehrheitlich einschneidenden neuen Anti-Geldwäschegesetzen zugestimmt: Anonyme Barzahlungen über 3.000 € werden im geschäftlichen Verkehr verboten. Barzahlungen über 10.000 € werden im geschäftlichen Verkehr …

<p>Die federführenden Ausschüsse des EU-Parlaments haben heute mehrheitlich einschneidenden <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf">neuen Anti-Geldwäschegesetzen</a> zugestimmt: Anonyme Barzahlungen über 3.000 € werden im geschäftlichen Verkehr verboten. Barzahlungen über 10.000 € werden im geschäftlichen Verkehr sogar komplett verboten. Und anonyme Zahlungen in Kryptowährungen an von Anbietern betriebene Geldbörsen (hosted wallets) werden ohne Schwellenwert schon bei Minimalbeträgen untersagt.</p>



<p>Der Europaabgeordnete und digitale Freiheitskämpfer Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) erklärt seine Gegenstimme wie folgt:</p>



<p>“Anonyme Zahlungen zu verbieten, hat bestenfalls minimal senkende Effekte auf die Kriminalität, würde aber unbescholtenen Bürgern die finanzielle Freiheit nehmen. Welche Medikamente oder welches Sexspielzeug ich einkaufe, welche politischen oder sexualbezogenen Filme ich ansehe, geht niemanden etwas an. Zum Einsammeln von Spenden sind Dissidenten wie der verstorbene Alexej Navalny und seine Ehefrau weltweit heute zunehmend auf anonyme Spenden in virtuellen Währungen angewiesen. Auch Wikileaks wurde von Kreditkartenfirmen bereits der Spendenhahn zugedreht. Wo jede Zahlung erfasst und für immer gespeichert wird, drohen Hackerangriffe, unberechtigte Ermittlungen und eine abschreckende Staatsaufsicht über jeden Kauf und jede Spende.</p>



<p>Dieser EU-Krieg gegen das Bargeld wird sich noch böse rächen! Seit Tausenden von Jahren haben Gesellschaften auf der ganzen Welt mit Bargeld, das die Privatsphäre schützt, gelebt. Mit der schleichenden Abschaffung des Bargelds drohen Negativzinsen und das jederzeitige Abdrehen der Geldversorgung über Kartensperrungen. Die Abhängigkeit von Banken nimmt bedrohlich zu. Eine derartige finanzielle Entmündigung gilt es zu stoppen.</p>



<p>Wir müssen stattdessen Wege finden, die besten Eigenschaften von Bargeld in unsere digitale Zukunft mitzunehmen. Auch im Netz haben wir ein Recht darauf, in Kryptowährungen bezahlen und spenden zu können, ohne dass unser Zahlungsverhalten anlasslos und personenbezogen aufgezeichnet wird. Wenn die EU glaubt, virtuelle Währungen im Alleingang regulieren zu können, hat sie das weltweite Internet nicht verstanden.”</p>



<p>Die Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei zur Europawahl Anja Hirschel unterstreicht: „Bargeldzahlungen werden immer weiter eingeschränkt und gleichzeitig anonymes Bezahlen im Netz verboten. Dies führt zu einer immer detaillierteren Nachverfolgbarkeit unseres Konsums und Privatlebens. Wie viel ich wofür wann und wo ausgebe, lässt immer genauere Rückschlüsse auf mich als Person zu. In Zusammenhang mit den nationalen Diskussionen um Bezahlkarten für verschiedene Menschengruppen kann dies ein Baustein hin zu einer gesetzliche Grundlage zur späteren Profilbildung und Kontrolle selbst von legalen Ausgaben darstellen.“</p>



<p>Hintergrund zur Bargeldobergrenze:</p>



<p>2017 fragte die EU-Kommission schon einmal die Öffentlichkeit nach ihrer Meinung zur Begrenzung von Barzahlungen. Mehr als 90 % der antwortenden Bürger sprachen sich gegen einen solchen Schritt aus. Die Befragten hielten das anonyme Bezahlen mit Bargeld für eine “essentielle persönliche Freiheit” und waren der Meinung, dass “Beschränkungen für Bargeldzahlungen ineffektiv sind, um die möglichen Ziele (Bekämpfung von kriminellen Aktivitäten, Terrorismus, Steuerhinterziehung) zu erreichen”. Laut einer EZB-Umfrage verwenden bis zu 10% der Bürger Bargeld auch für Beträge über 10.000 € (z.B. beim Autokauf). Nach Berechnungen von Schattenwirtschaftsfachmann Friedrich Schneider von der Universität Linz hat das Verbot großer Barzahlungen „nur minimale senkende Effekte auf die Schwarzarbeit oder die Kriminalität“.</p>



<p>Hintergrund zu Kryptowährungen:</p>



<p>Im Gegensatz zu Bargeld, das völlig anonym ist, können Transaktionen mit Kryptowährungen gerade im Fall von Bitcoin über die “Blockchain” nachvollzogen werden. Wo virtuelle Vermögenswerte in der Vergangenheit für kriminelle Aktivitäten verwendet wurden, war eine strafrechtliche Verfolgung möglich, etwa indem ungewöhnliche Muster erkannt und Verdächtige identifiziert wurden. Einige Kriminelle haben sich im Laufe der Zeit selbst de-anonymisiert, und jeder Kriminelle wird irgendwann seine digitalen Gelder gegen echtes Geld eintauschen müssen. Virtuelle Guthaben sind von geringer Relevanz für das globale Finanzsystem. Es gibt keine belastbaren Nachweise dafür, dass virtuelle Währungen nennenswert zur Geldwäsche genutzt würden. EU-Vorschriften können durch Verwendung von Nicht-EU-Wallet-Diensten leicht umgangen werden. Virtuelle Vermögenswerte können auch direkt von einer Person zu einer anderen übertragen werden, ohne Zwischenhändler einzuschalten (unhosted wallets), so dass Identifizierungspflichten leerlaufen. Dennoch wird im geschäftlichen Verkehr in aller Regel an hosted wallets gezahlt werden und das Anonymitätsverbot greifen.</p>

<p>Der federführende LIBE-Ausschuss im EU-Parlament hat heute für eine verschärfte Überwachung von Flugreisenden gestimmt. Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer erklärt die Auswirkungen und seine Ablehnung:</p>



<p>„Dass außereuropäische Flüge unter Generalverdacht gestellt werden, war schon bisher so. Selbst wenn es bei innerdeutschen oder Schengenflügen gar keine Grenzkontrollen gibt, müssen die Fluggesellschaften künftig einen maschinenlesbaren Ausweis einlesen und die Passagierdaten melden. Das erleichtert die Erstellung von Bewegungsprofilen enorm.</p>



<p>Ob und welche Passagierdaten bei grenzkontrollfreien Flügen ans BKA oder ausländische Strafverfolger gemeldet werden ist geheim. Die geheime Meldung ist mitnichten auf Tatverdächtige beschränkt, sondern erfasst komplette Flugverbindungen auf Grundlage einer schwammigen ‚Risikoanalyse‘.</p>



<p>Diese Verschärfung der Flugreisendenüberwachung widerspricht der Errungenschaft der Abschaffung von Grenzkontrollen. Es ist nicht gerechtfertigt, unverdächtige Flugreisende unter Generalverdacht zu stellen. Deswegen habe ich der Reform bei der Abstimmung eine klare Absage erteilt.“</p>



<p>Die API-Reform bedarf noch einer finalen Plenarabstimmung, bevor sie in Kraft tritt.</p>



<p>Die neuen Verordnungen im Wortlaut:</p>

What doesn’t exist yet on the web that would be cool or useful? How can we preserve its openness and decentralization? How can the commons be richer for everyone? It’s ultimately an ideological endeavor: the web is great and we should keep building it in everyone’s interest, whether through protocols and extensions or through amazing public interest sites.</p><p>In the latter, you’re taking what exists and figuring out how to get the most use out of it. How can we harness this? Which web capabilities allow us to meet our goals more easily? Where are the opportunities? It’s not in any way an ideological endeavor: instead, it’s a pragmatic one. It’s business. You’re taking a resource and getting the most use out of it that you can.</p><p>Of course, it happens to be the case that the public resource continues to exist and is vibrant because of the first group of people I described. But it’s also okay to just use the web. The web is for everyone.</p>

<p>NHKの放送した番組というのは国民の財産なわけですが、過去に放映した番組がわからないと、その財産のありかもわからないことになります。そのためには、番組についてのメタデータが検索できるようになっているのが望ましいですが、その第一歩として、過去の番組表が検索できるだけでもだいぶ違います。</p>



<p>現在のNHKのメインサイト「<a href="https://www.nhk.jp/">nhk.jp</a>」ではサイトトップから<a href="https://www.nhk.jp/timetable/">番組表検索へのリンク</a>がありますが、これでは直近分しか検索することができません。これに対して<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/">NHKクロニクル</a>では過去分を検索することができます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-23.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】NHKクロニクルでは過去の番組表を検索できる（出所）<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/">https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/</a>



<p>ためしに、サイトウ・キネンと入れて検索してみましょう。すると、どさっと大量の検索結果が逆時系列で出てきます。わたしが知りたかったのは2007年に放映されたことを覚えている番組なので、そのあたりまで時系列を遡っていきます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-24.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】14ページ目で2007年に到達



<p>今回は右上のページ表示をクリックして徐々に遡っていきましたが、URLに「&amp;page=14」のように記入することによってページを飛ぶこともできるようです。こうやっていって、わたしが知りたかった番組は2007年12月29日に放映されていたことがわかりました。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-25.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】知りたかった番組は2007年12月29日のっぽい



<p>といっても、上記の画像からわかるように、このページだけではどんな番組だったかわかりません。なので、「番組詳細」を順番にクリックしていってこの番組だとわかったのでした。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-26.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】詳細をクリックしていって番組を発見 （出所）<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200712291800001301000">https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200712291800001301000</a>



<p>これ、実はサイトウ・キネン・フェスティバルでデュティユー自身も来日して「Le Temps l’Horloge」が初演された録画でとても貴重なものです。作曲者自身が拍手しているところが写っています。また、「瞬間の神秘」も録画されているのはなかなか珍しいのではないかと思います。</p>



<p>この詳細ページのURLは「<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200712291800001301000">https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200712291800001301000</a>」となっています。このcrnid というのがこのコンテンツの識別子のようです。（←ちゃんとIDネタを振った！）</p>



 放送時期がよくわからなかったらどうするか:＝＞＆検索もできる！ 



<p>上記では、放送時期をわたしが覚えていたので遡っていって検索するという技がつかえました。これだと放送時期がわからないと検索がすごく大変になります。ここで「デュティユー サイトウ・キネン」のように&amp;検索ができればぐっと対象を絞れます。なので、やってみましたらできました。半角スペースでキーワードを区切って検索すればよいようです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-27.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】＆検索も可能 （出所）<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/search/?keyword=デュティユー%E3%80%80サイトウ・キネン">https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/search/?keyword=デュティユー%E3%80%80サイトウ・キネン</a>



<p>この年2回放映されていることがわかります。わたしが実際に見たのは9月8日の生中継の方ですね。実際に演奏された直後なので。番組詳細を見てみます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-28.png?ssl=1"></a>【図表】こちらのほうが番組詳細が詳しい （出所）<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200709081900001301000">https://www.nhk.or.jp/archives/chronicle/detail/?crnid=A200709081900001301000</a>



<p>なんと、こちらのほうが番組詳細が詳しい！「瞬間の神秘」がそれだけでなく、正式タイトル「瞬間の神秘（２４の弦楽器、ツィンバロムと打楽器のための）<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/03/5642/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5642" title="妻の﨑村潤子がツィンバロムを演奏しています">1</a>」としてのっています。12月のは再放送なので内容は同じはずですが、番組情報には差があるのですね。一つ一つ見に行ったほうが良さそうです。</p>



 Google検索ではひっかからない 



<p>このように便利に検索できるNHKクロニクルですが、残念なことがひとつあります。それはGoogle検索でひっかからないということです。試しに「site:www.nhk.or.jp 瞬間の神秘（２４の弦楽器、ツィンバロムと打楽器のための）」と検索してみて下さい。2024年3月18日現在、何も返ってきません。これは、robots.txt でクローリングが禁止されているからですね。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>User-agent: * <br>Disallow: /*.cgi$ <br>Disallow: /*.cgi? <br>Disallow: /*/api/ <br>（中略）<br> Disallow: /chronicle/</p>
【図表】chronicleがrobots.txtで禁止されている （出所）<a href="https://www.nhk.or.jp/robots.txt">https://www.nhk.or.jp/robots.txt</a></blockquote>



<p>国民の利便性という観点ではちょっと残念な気がします。ここはallowしてほしいところです。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/03/5642/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5642" title="できない理由はあるのでしょうかね。今度訊いてみようかと思います。">2</a></p>

<p>Very little information on what it was actually trained on, all we know is that it was "a large amount of text data, not fine-tuned for any particular task".</p>

   Add ETag header for static responses 
 I've been procrastinating on adding better caching headers for static assets (JavaScript and CSS) served by Datasette for several years, because I've been wanting to implement the perfect solution that sets far-future cache headers on every asset and ensures the URLs change when they are updated.

<p>I've been procrastinating on adding better caching headers for static assets (JavaScript and CSS) served by Datasette for several years, because I've been wanting to implement the perfect solution that sets far-future cache headers on every asset and ensures the URLs change when they are updated.</p>

<p>Agustin Bacigalup just submitted the best kind of pull request: he observed that adding ETag support for static assets would side-step the complexity while adding much of the benefit, and implemented it along with tests.</p>

<p>It's a substantial performance improvement for any Datasette instance with a number of JavaScript plugins... like the ones we are building on Datasette Cloud. I'm just annoyed we didn't ship something like this sooner!</p>

  <p><a href="https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2024/index.html">NICAR</a> was fantastic this year. Alex and I ran <a href="https://github.com/datasette/nicar-2024-datasette">a successful workshop</a> on Datasette and Datasette Cloud, and I gave a lightning talk demonstrating two new GPT-4 powered Datasette plugins - <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-enrichments-gpt">datasette-enrichments-gpt</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-extract">datasette-extract</a>. I need to write more about the latter one: it enables populating tables from unstructured content (using a variant of <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/gpt3/openai-python-functions-data-extraction">this technique</a>) and it's really effective. I got it working just in time for the conference.</p>
<p>I also solved the conference follow-up problem! I've long suffered from poor habits in dropping the ball on following up with people I meet at conferences. This time I used a trick I first learned at a YC demo day many years ago: if someone says they'd like to follow up, get out a calendar and book a future conversation with them right there on the spot.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of exciting conversations lined up over the next few weeks thanks to that, with a variety of different sizes of newsrooms who are either using or want to use Datasette.</p>
 Action menus in the Datasette 1.0 alphas 
<p>I released two new Datasette 1.0 alphas in the run-up to NICAR: <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a12-2024-02-29">1.0a12</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#changelog">1.0a13</a>.</p>
<p>The main theme of these two releases was improvements to Datasette's "action buttons".</p>
<p>Datasette plugins have long been able to register additional menu items that should be shown on the database and table pages. These were previously hidden behind a "cog" icon in the title of the page - once clicked it would reveal a menu of extra actions.</p>
<p>The cog wasn't discoverable enough, and felt too much like mystery meat navigation. I decided to turn it into a much more clear button.</p>
<p>Here's a GIF showing that new button in action across several different pages on Datasette Cloud (which has a bunch of plugins that use it):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to 1.0a12 Datasette had plugin hooks for just the database and table actions menus. I've added four more:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#query-actions-datasette-actor-database-query-name-request-sql-params">query_actions()</a> for actions that apply to the query results page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2283">#2283</a>) 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-view-actions">view_actions()</a> for actions that can be applied to a SQL view. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2297">#2297</a>) 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-row-actions">row_actions()</a> for actions that apply to the row page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2299">#2299</a>) 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-homepage-actions">homepage_actions()</a> for actions that apply to the instance homepage. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2298">#2298</a>) 
 
<p>Menu items can now also include an optional description, which is displayed below their label in the actions menu.</p>
 It's always DNS 
<p>This site was offline for 24 hours this week due to a DNS issue. Short version: while I've been paying close attention to the management of domains I've bought in the past few years (<a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a>, <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">datasette.cloud</a> etc) I hadn't been paying attention to <code>simonwillison.net</code>.</p>
<p>... until it turned out I had it on a registrar with an old email address that I no longer had access to, and the domain was switched into "parked" mode because I had failed to pay for renewal!</p>
<p>(I haven't confirmed this yet but I think I may have paid for a ten year renewal at some point, which gives you a full decade to lose track of how it's being paid for.)</p>
<p>I'll give credit to <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/">123-reg</a> (these days a subsidiary of GoDaddy) - they have a <a href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk/support/domains/what-is-the-domain-recovery-period-and-how-can-i-restore-my-domain-names/">well documented domain recovery policy</a> and their support team got me back in control reasonably promptly - only slightly delayed by their UK-based account recovery team operating in a timezone separate from my own.</p>
<p>I registered <code>simonwillison.org</code> and configured that and <code>til.simonwillison.org</code> during the blackout, mainly because it turns out I refer back to my own written content a whole lot during my regular work! Once <code>.net</code> came back I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/cloudflare/redirect-whole-domain">set up redirects using Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully I don't usually use my domain for my personal email, or sorting this out would have been a whole lot more painful.</p>
<p>The most inconvenient impact was Mastodon: I run my own instance at <a href="https://fedi.simonwillison.net/">fedi.simonwillison.net</a> (<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/mastodon/custom-domain-mastodon">previously</a>) and losing DNS broke everything, both my ability to post but also my ability to even read posts on my timeline.</p>
 Blog entries 
<p>I published three articles since my last weeknotes:</p>
 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/8/gpt-4-barrier/">The GPT-4 barrier has finally been broken</a> 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">Prompt injection and jailbreaking are not the same thing</a> 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/3/interesting-ideas-in-observable-framework/">Interesting ideas in Observable Framework</a> 
 
 Releases 
<p>I have released so much stuff recently. A lot of this was in preparation for NICAR - I wanted to polish all sorts of corners of Datasette Cloud, which is itself a huge bundle of pre-configured Datasette plugins. A lot of those plugins got a bump!</p>
<p>A few releases deserve a special mention:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-extract">datasette-extract</a>, hinted at above, is a new plugin that enables tables in Datasette to be populated from unstructured data in pasted text or images. 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-export-database">datasette-export-database</a> provides a way to export a current snapshot of a SQLite database from Datasette - something that previously wasn't safe to do for databases that were accepting writes. It works by kicking off a background process to use <code>VACUUM INTO</code> in SQLite to create a temporary file with a transactional snapshot of the database state, then lets the user download that file. 
 
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> provides access to the new Claude 3 models from my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool. These models are really exciting: Opus feels better than GPT-4 at most things I've thrown at it, and Haiku is both slightly cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo and provides image input support at the lowest price point I've seen anywhere. 
 
<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-create-view">datasette-create-view</a> is a new plugin that helps you create a SQL view from a SQL query. I shipped the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#query-actions-datasette-actor-database-query-name-request-sql-params">query_actions()</a> plugin hook to make this possible.

<p>Unfortunately, in response to the leftpad incident a few years ago npm had introduced a policy that a package cannot be removed from the registry if there exists at least one other package that lists it as a dependency. The new "everything" package inadvertently prevented all 2.5m packages - including many that had no other dependencies - from ever being removed!</p>

<p>I love that all Mastodon servers (including my own dedicated instance) offer a CORS-enabled JSON API which directly supports building these kinds of alternative clients.</p>

<p>Building a full-featured client like this one is a huge amount of work, but building a much simpler client that just displays the user's incoming timeline could be a pretty great educational project for people who are looking to deepen their front-end development skills.</p>

<p>And now, to the notes!</p>
 Introduction 
 
 
<p>Introduced myself, first Mini Summit, six leading up to the <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/session/191">in-person
summit</a> on May 28 at PGConf.dev in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
 
 
<p>Thought I would get it things started, provide a bit of history of
extensions and context for what’s next.</p>
 
 
 Presentation 
 
 
<p>Postgres has a long history of extensibility, originally using pure SQL or
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “LOAD”">shared preload libraries</a>. Used by a few early adopters, perhaps a couple
dozen, including …</p>
 
 
<p>Explicit extension support added in Postgres 9.1 by Dimitri Fontaine, with
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “CREATE EXTENSION”"><code>CREATE EXTENSION</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pgdump.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “pg_dump”"><code>pg_dump</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/app-pgrestore.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “pg_restore”"><code>pg_restore</code></a> support.</p>
 
 
<p>Example <code>pair--1.0.0.sql</code>:</p>
  <code>-- complain if script is sourced in psql and not CREATE EXTENSION
\echo Use "CREATE EXTENSION pair" to load this file. \quit

CREATE TYPE pair AS ( k text, v text );

CREATE FUNCTION pair(text, text)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair;';

CREATE OPERATOR ~&gt; (LEFTARG = text, RIGHTARG = text, FUNCTION = pair);
</code>   
 
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iambagelkitty/">Bagel</a> makes an appearance.</p>
 
 
<p>Example <code>pair.control</code>:</p>
  <code># pair extension
comment = 'A key/value pair data type'
default_version = '1.0'
module_pathname = '$libdir/pair'
relocatable = true
</code>   
 
<p>Example <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
  <code>EXTENSION    = pair
MODULEDIR    = $(EXTENSION)
DOCS         = README.md
DATA         = sql/pair--1.0.sql
TESTS        = test/sql/base.sql
REGRESS      = base
REGRESS_OPTS = --inputdir=test
MODULES      = src/pair
PG_CONFIG   ?= pg_config

PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</code>   
 
<p>Build and Install:</p>
  <code>$ make
make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

$ make install
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/extension'
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/pair'
mkdir -p '/pgsql/share/doc/pair'
install -c -m 644 pair.control '/pgsql/share/extension/'
install -c -m 644 sql/pair--1.0.sql  '/pgsql/share/pair/'
install -c -m 644 README.md '/pgsql/share/doc/pair/'

$ make installcheck
# +++ regress install-check in  +++
# using postmaster on Unix socket, default port
ok 1         - base                                       15 ms
1..1
# All 1 tests passed.
</code>   
 
<p><code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>:</p>
  <code>$ psql -d try -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pair'
CREATE EXTENSION

$ pg_dump -d try
--
-- Name: pair; Type: EXTENSION; Schema: -; Owner: -
--
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pair WITH SCHEMA public;

--
-- Name: EXTENSION pair; Type: COMMENT; Schema: -; Owner:
--
COMMENT ON EXTENSION pair IS 'A key/value pair data type';
</code>   
 
<p>Many of us saw opportunity in this new feature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL today is not merely a database, it’s an application development
platform.</p>
<p>—&nbsp;Me, 2010</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Proposed to build <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>. Raised funds to build it in late 2010. Launched
site April 2011; <a href="https://www.varrazzo.com">Daniele Varrazzo</a> released CLI, and <a href="https://github.com/guedes">Dickson Guedes</a>
released the dev CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>Problems PGXN set out to solve:</p>
 
 Source code distribution with user registration and namespacing 
 Discovery: Search, read docs, brows tags 
 Installation: CLI to compile and install using PGXS or Configure 
 
 
 
<p>PGXN Components:</p>
 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/">Meta Spec</a> 
 <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org">Manager</a> 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/mirroring/">Root Mirror</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-api/wiki">API Server</a> 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">Site</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient">Client</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-utils">Utils CLI</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools">CI/CD Image</a> 
 
 
 
<p>Problems out of scope for PGXN:</p>
 
 Binary packaging and distribution
 
 Defer to apt/yum 
 
 
 Developer tooling (though dev utils helped) 
 Build tooling
 
 Defer to core (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>) 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>PGXN Shortcomings:</p>
 
 Little development since 2012 
 Search limitations
 
 Docs preferred 
 Most distributions have few docs 
 Some issues <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/743059495415119873/recent-work" title="PGXN Blog: “Recent PGXN Improvements”">addressed in last few weeks</a> 
 
 
 Source of Record
 
 Minority of available extensions on PGXN 
 Releases uneven or neglected 
 
 
 
<blockquote>
<p>In classic SDLC fashion, PGXN POC shipped as an MVP and was neglected.</p>
<p>— Me, Just Now</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Been peripheral to Postgres extensions for the last 10-12 years, but some
things have happened.</p>
 
 
<p>Non-Core extension counts:</p>
 
 
 
 
 <a href="https://pgxn.org/about/">PGXN</a>: 382 
 <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">joelonsql/PostgreSQL-EXTENSIONs.md</a>: 1,186 
 
 
 
<p>Daniele asks about that last source, which is just a list in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">gist</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Joe Nelson links to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47">gist</a> in Zoom chat. It is not his list, contrary to
my off-the-cuff guess</p>
 
 
<p>Why haven’t extensions taken off?</p>
 
 
<p>Lost Opportunities</p>
 
 No one canonical source to discover and install extensions 
 Difficult to find and discover extensions without canonical registry 
 Most extensions are under-documented and difficult to understand 
 They are also hard to configure and install; most people don’t want or
need a compiler 
 The maturity of extensions can be difficult to gauge, not systematized,
must each be independently researched
 
 David Christensen in Chat “attention economy/awareness, NIH, etc” 
 Jeremy S in chat: “Maybe some people don’t know they are using
extensions (I think that’s possible to some degree)” 
 
 
 There is no comprehensive binary packaging 
 Centralized source distribution is insufficient (even if it were complete)
 
 jubilee in chat: Trust aspect? 
 David Johnson in chat: To seem legit you need to touch the repo at
least annually to ensure it works on the newest major release.  Even
if you just do your compile and update the readme. 
 I mention using <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools">pgxn-utils</a> and GitHub workflows to ensure my
extensions continue working 
 
 
 There is insufficient developer tooling; pgxn-utils not well-maintained,
don’t build on recent Rubies, but <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> has a lot of Rust-oriented
tooling

<p>New Opportunities Today</p>
<p>What are the community opportunities for the extension ecosystem?</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
 
 Improved dev tools: More than pgxn-utils and <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> 
 Canonical registry: All publicly-available extensions in one pac3 
 Easy publishing: auto-discovery or CI/CD pipeline publishing 
 Continuous Delivery: CI/CD pipeline publishing 
 File-free installation: TLEs 
 Documentation: Something like Go docs or Rust docs 
 File management: Put all the files for an extension in one directory 
 Improved metadata
 
 Library Dependencies: utilities used by extensions 
 Platform Dependencies: system packages 
 Build pipelines: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>, <a href="https://www.cpan.org">cpan</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi</a>, etc. 
 Artifacts: Binaries build on release 
 Classification: Curated in addition to tags 
 Extension Types: Extensions, apps, background workers, loadable libraries 
 
 
 Derived Services
 
 Binary Packaging: Distributed binaries for many platforms 
 Ratings &amp; Reviews: Stars, thumbs, comments 
 Aggregated Stats: Repository stats, etc. 
 Smoke Testing: Matrix of multi-platform test results 
 Security Scanning: Reporting vulnerabilities 
 Badging &amp; Curation: Third-party classification, badging various statuses

 Discussion 
 
 
<p>Eric: I’m Eric Ridge, one of the developers behind pgrx, as you’re going
through this process of building a modern extension ecosystem, let us know
what we can do on the Rust side to help make your lives easier, we’re happy
to help any way we can.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are some areas of interest we noticed building Tembo</p>
<p>Binary packaging / distribution:</p>
 
 Variable installation location 
 System dependencies / uncommon system dependencies or versions 
 Chip specific instructions (e.g. vector compiled with avx512) 
 Extension-specific file types / extra data files (e.g. anonymizer .csv
data) 
 
<p>Turning on extensions automatically</p>
 
 Different ways to enable extensions 
 does it need load (shared_preload_libraries, session_… etc)? 
 Does it use create extension framework? 
 Does it require a specific schema? 
 What about turning on in multiple DBs at the same time in the same
cluster, with background worker? 
 Disabling, what data will be lost? 
 Validating safety / user feedback on upgrade? 
 
<p>In cloud / SaaS:</p>
 
 Installing + enabling extensions quickly, without restart 
 Persisting extension files 
 Extension-specific files (e.g. libraries) versus postgres’ libraries 
 Updating 
 Troubleshooting crashes / core dumps 
 
<p>Anyone else have similar problems / tips?</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: These were just things I noted during the presentation.
Curious if these are interesting to others on the call.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele in chat: “Regards binary distributions, <a href="https://pythonwheels.com">python wheels</a> might be a
useful reference.”</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: That’s good point! What do people think of idea to just
install extensions onto servers, not packages, persisted on the disk, next
to PGDATA so they go into a single persistent volume, and the rest is
managed by an immutable container.</p>
 
 
<p>Daniele: Had experience on Crunchy where we had to replace an image to get
an extension. Looked for feature to have a sidecar or a volume with the
extension.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: Didn’t have a separate directory just for extensions, it’s
just <code>pg_config --libdir</code> fore everything. Had to persist entire directory,
including those files form the base build, their internal files. Would have
been nice to have a separate directory, extra-libdr or extra-sharedir,
something like that.</p>
 
 
<p>Yurii Rashkovskii: I was working on a patch to do exactly that, but
haven’t completed it. Was going to introduce additional directories to
search for this stuff.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: That would be really awesome.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S in chat: “Advantage of that is that a single image can be shared
among systems with different needs”</p>
 
 
<p>Eric in chat: “Thoughts around “enterprise repositories” that could be
self-hosted and disconnected from the internet?”</p>
 
 Ian Stanton in chat: “I’ll touch on this in the next talk, it’s
crossed our minds when building the Trunk registry” 
 
 
 
<p>Steven Miller: I think that’s a great idea.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iambagelkitty/">Bagel</a> reappears.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> originally designed so anyone could run Manager and
their own root mirror, and maybe rsync from the community one. Don’t know
that anyone ever did, it’s a little complicated and most people don’t want
to work with Perl. [Chuckles]. Definitely think there’s space for that. If
you work with Java or Go or maybe Rust, lots of orgs like Artifactory that
provide internal registries. Could be cool use case for Postgres extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>David Christensen in chat: “something that could support extension
batches; like groups of related extensions that could be installed in bulk
or loaded in bulk (so could accommodate the shared systems with different
individual extension needs, but could be shared_preload_library configured)”</p>
 
 
<p>“Steven Miller” in chat: “Sounds familiar”</p>
 
 
<p>Greg Mullane (CrunchyData) [he/him] in chat: “All these items remind me of
CPAN. We should see what things it (and other similar systems) get right and
wrong. I’ve learned from CPAN that ratings, reviews, and badging are going
to be very difficult.”</p>
 
 David Christensen in chat: “I’d assumed at the time that it was
largely lifted (at least in philosophy/design) from CPAN. 🙂” 
 David Wheeler (he/him) in chat: “yes” 
 
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: I think this is mostly focused on developers, but I had recent
experience where multiple people in the past few months, new to Postgres,
are trying to understand extensions. They install a version and then see
there are like 15 versions installed, so confused. Goes back to the install
file. Bit of UX angle where there are sharp edges where people trying to
make sense of extensions, the flexibility makes it hard to understand. Some
might be some nice guides, some architectural things explaining PGXS, or
improvements to make to the design. Related, not main topic, but good to
keep end user UX and devs building on Postgres but not Postgres developers,
who run their businesses.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: Yeah all the files can be confusing, which is why I think
<a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a> and <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a> trying to simplify: Just run this command and then you
have it.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: “I really agree with what Jeremy is saying. Right
now PGXN and Trunk are taking and approach like “whatever an extension could
do / how it may work, it should work on this registry”. But I think more
standards / “what is a normal extension” would make the UX much easier.”</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S: Even with that the available extensions view is still there. Some
of that is just schema management, and that’s how core is doing schema
management.</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: I exactly agree about the concern about multiple
extensions within a package. Also version and name mismatches</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: And not everything is an extension, you just want to work, or
your extension is just utility like pg_top you just want to use. Extensions
I think were a tremendous contribution to Postgres itself, but a lot of it
was wrangling the existing system for building Postgres itself to make it
work for that. Could be very interesting, though quite long term — and I
know Dimitri has tried this multiple times — to build a proper package
management system within Postgres itself, to eas a lot of that pain and
burden.</p>
 
 
<p>Tobias Bussmann in chat: “Thank you for the great overview and for taking
this topic further! Unfortunately, I’ll not be able to join at pgConf.dev
but will follow whatever results this will lead to. As a package maintainer,
I am constantly looking in a easy way to allow users to use extensions
without having to package everything ;)”</p>
 
 
<p>Steven Miller in chat: “Like auto explain for example right. i.e. a LOAD
only “extension””</p>
 
 
<p>*Yurii Rashkovskii: An interesting topic, what extensions are capable of
doing and how they can be more self-contained. Like Steven was saying in
chat: how easy is it to load and unload extensions. Example: want an
extension to hook into a part of Postgres: executor, planner, etc. How do
you go about enabling them? How you unload them, introspect, list of hooks.</p>
<p>Omni extension provides a list of all hooks, and when you remove an
extension it removes the hooks that provide the extension, but still not
part of the core. Hooks one of the greatest ways to expand the functionality
of Postgres, allows us to experiment with Postgres before committing to the
full cycle of getting a patch into Postgres. Lets us get it to users today
to try. if it makes a lot of sense and people want it, time to commit to the
process of getting a patch committed. But if we don’t hve this venue, how to
get extensions in, our ability to try things is limited.</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: Hmm. It seems my audio is not working.</p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: The next session is two weeks from today: Ian Stanton is
going to talk about “Building Trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry and CLI”.
Will be interesting because a number of people have decided to build a
binary packaging system for extensions, just to air out what the challenges
were, what problems they wanted to solve, what problems remain, and where
they want to take it in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>Jeremy S* in chat: “Bagel clearly has something to say”</p>
 
 
<p>*David Wheeler: jubileee I see your audio issues, do you just want to type
your question into chat? We can also discuss things in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>
channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a></p>
 
 
<p>David Wheeler: Thank you all for coming!</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: “I had a question which is about: Does Postgres actually
support docs for extensions? Like, a lot of people don’t really WANT to
read a README. Can you get docstrings for a function in psql?”</p>
 
 
<p>Ian Stanton in chat: “Thank you David!”</p>
 
 
<p>jubilee in chat: And if not, why not?</p>
 
 
 Post Presentation Discussion 
<p><a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A/p1709762608926059">From Slack</a>:</p>
 
 David Wheeler: I see now that “jubilee” left their question in the Zoom chat. 
 David Wheeler: The closest attempt at this I’ve seen is <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pg_readme/0.6.6/README.html">pg_readme</a>, which
will generate Markdown for an extension from comments in the catalog and
write it out to a file. 
 David G. Johnson: The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-comment.html">comment on</a> command adds in database comments that psql
describe commands should display. 
 
<p>Also <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A/p1709748156307179">on Slack</a>,
Greg Sabino Mullane started a longish thread on the things we want to do and build.</p>

<p>In einem offenen Brief, der vom Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei und digitalen Freiheitskämpfer Dr. Patrick Breyer, initiiert wurde, haben 36 Mitglieder des Europäischen Parlaments Nick Clegg, <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MEPs-Letter-to-Meta-on-Pay-or-Okay.pdf">Präsidenten für globale Angelegenheiten bei Meta, das umstrittene “Pay or okay”-Programms von Meta verurteilt. </a>Die Abgeordneten äußern ihre tiefe Besorgnis darüber, dass die “Datenschutzgebühr” den Schutz der Privatsphäre untergräbt, Nutzer vor eine “falsche Wahl” stellt und “wirtschaftlichen Zwang” zur Einwilligung in eine umfassende Überwachung und Ausbeutung der Onlineaktivitäten des Nutzer ausübt. Die Regelung wird derzeit vom Europäischen Datenschutzausschuss (EDPB) und der EU-Kommission geprüft und von Verbraucherorganisationen vor Gericht beklagt.</p>



<p>Dr. Patrick Breyer kommentiert den Brief:</p>



<p>“Privatsphäre ist keine Ware – sie ist ein grundlegendes Menschenrecht, das niemals Gegenstand von kommerziellen Transaktionen sein sollte. Das von Meta angewandte ‘Pay or okay’-Modell vertieft soziale Ungleichheiten. Metas Ansatz versäumt es, eine echte Einwilligung einzuholen, wie es die Datenschutz-Grundverordnung vorschreibt, und zwingt die Nutzer zur Zustimmung, indem es Datenschutz unbezahlbar macht. Der Grund dafür, dass Meta auf einem rechtswidrigen Einwilligungsmodell besteht, ist sein auf allgegenwärtigem Tracking beruhendes Geschäftsmodell. Wir brauchen eine echte Alternative zu diesem überwachungskapitalistischen Geschäftsmodell, etwa aufbauend auf kontextbezogene und überwachungsfreie Werbung. Wir fordern Meta dringend auf, sein ‘Pay or okay’-System aufzugeben und einen neuen Ansatz zu wählen.”</p>

<p>In der <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/de/press-room/20240304IPR18765/eu-health-data-space-to-support-patients-and-research">Nacht haben sich die Mehrheit des EU-Parlaments und der EU-Regierungen auf einen Deal zur Schaffung eines „Europäischen Gesundheitsdatenraums“ geeinigt. </a>Vereinbart wurde u.a.:</p>



 
 Ein europaweiter Zwang zur elektronischen Patientenakte konnte auf Initiative u.a. des Europaabgeordneten der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer verhindert werden. Das deutsche und österreichische Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Einrichtung einer elektronischen Patientenakte ist damit gerettet. 



 Wer der elektronischen Patientenakte oder ihrer Auswertung nicht insgesamt widerspricht, ermöglicht zwangsweise auch einen grenzüberschreitenden Zugriff darauf durch ausländische Behandler, Forscher und Regierungen. Das von der Bundesregierung geplante Recht speziell grenzüberschreitenden Datenzugriffen widersprechen zu können, ermöglicht die Verordnung nicht. Breyer kritisiert diesen Punkt scharf: „Das widerspricht dem Interesse und Willen der Patienten, von <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2023-051_consumer_attitudes_to_health_data.pdf">denen laut Meinungsumfrage </a>nur eine Minderheit einen grenzüberschreitenden europaweiten Zugriff auf ihre Patientenakte wünscht. Es wird auch der Sensibilität von Gesundheitsdaten nicht annähernd gerecht, die von Suchtkrankheiten, psychischen Störungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen bis hin zu Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen reichen.“ 



 Die Mitgliedsstaaten entscheiden, ob die sensiblen Gesundheitsdaten in Europa gespeichert werden müssen oder ob auch eine außereuropäische Speicherung etwa in den USA zulässig ist. Die Bundesregierung plant bisher nicht, eine Speicherung von Gesundheitsdaten in Europa zu verlangen. 



 Die Parlamentsmehrheit hat die Forderung nach einer unabhängigen Zertifizierung der Sicherheit europäischer Gesundheitsdatensysteme aufgegeben. 



 Die EU-Verordnung fordert von Deutschland keinen stärkeren Schutz von Gesundheitsdaten als von der Bundesregierung beschlossen. Ohne Einwilligung des Patienten können behandelnde Ärzte europaweit dessen komplette Patientenakte einsehen – es sei denn er widerspricht ausdrücklich. Ohne Einwilligung des Patienten erhalten künftig europaweit auch Gesundheitsministerien und Gesundheitsbehörden, Universitäten, zur Forschung und Produktentwicklung auch Technologieunternehmen und Pharmaindustrie Zugang zu anonymisierten und personenbezogenen identifizierbaren (nur pseudonymisierten) Patientenakten – es sei denn der Patient widerspricht ausdrücklich. Kein Widerspruchsrecht gibt es gegen die Weitergabe medizinischer Registerdatensätze und von Abrechnungsdatensätzen. Um Einwilligung werden Patienten nur vor Zugriffen auf ihre genetischen Daten gefragt, nicht aber etwa bei Informationen über Psycho- und Suchttherapien, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen, Sexual- und Reproduktionsstörungen. 
 



<p>Breyers Fazit: „Informationen über unsere körperliche und geistige Gesundheit sind äußerst sensibel. Wenn wir uns nicht darauf verlassen kann, dass diese Informationen von meinen behandelnden Ärzten vertraulich behandelt werden, lassen wir uns vielleicht nicht mehr behandeln und steigt das Suizidrisiko. Die EU lässt sensibelste Patientenakten anhäufen, vernetzen und weitergeben, ohne aber die Kontrolle und Selbstbestimmung der Patienten über ihre Daten sicherzustellen. ‚Alles geht, nichts muss‘ ist kein Ansatz, dem Patienten vertrauen können. Ohne Vertrauen kann ein Europäischer Gesundheitsdatenraum nicht funktionieren. Laut <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-zu-elektronischen-patientenakten-buergerinnen-und-buerger-wollen-um-einwilligung-gefragt-werden/">Umfragen wollen mehr als 80% der EU-Bürger selbst über die Weitergabe ihrer Patientenakten entscheiden. Mehrheitlich wollen sie um Einwilligung gebeten werden.</a> Der EU-Deal ist weit davon entfernt. Er verrät die Interessen und den Willen der Patienten, um ihre Daten an Big Tech und Pharmariesen zu verkaufen. Der mit dieser Verordnung einhergehenden Entmündigung von Patienten erteilen wir Piraten eine klare Absage. Ich selbst werde dieser elektronischen Patientenakte widersprechen, um nicht die Kontrolle über meine Gesundsheitsdaten zu verlieren.“</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei für die Europawahl 2024, kommentiert: “Eine zentrale Datenspeicherung weckt Begehrlichkeiten in verschiedenste Richtungen. Wir sprechen dabei allerdings nicht nur von Hackerangriffen, sondern von der sogenannten Sekundärnutzung. Diese bezeichnet Zugriffe, die zu Forschungszwecke vollumfänglich gewährt werden sollen. Die Patientendaten sollen dann an Dritte weitergegeben werden. Aus Datenschutzsicht ist bereits das zentrale Ansammeln problematisch, bei Weitergabe wenigstens ein Opt-In Verfahren (aktive Einwilligung) richtig. Dies würde eine gewisse Entscheidungshoheit jedes Menschen über die persönlichen Daten ermöglichen. Wird allerdings nicht einmal ein Opt-Out Verfahren (aktiver Widerspruch) etabliert, so bedeutet dies letztlich die Abschaffung der Vertraulichkeit jeglicher medizinischer Information. Und das obwohl Ärzte in Deutschland gemäß § 203 StGB berufsständisch zurecht der Schweigepflicht unterliegen, wie u.a. auch Rechtsanwälte. Dieser Schutz unserer privatesten Informationen und das Recht auf vertrauliche Versorgung und Beratung stehen jetzt auf dem Spiel.”</p>



<p>Die Bundesregierung unterstützt die EU-Pläne.</p>

<p>The new standard should pull other FCC regulations up with it, which is a welcome change:</p>

<p>"With a higher speed standard, the FCC is more likely to conclude that broadband providers aren't moving toward universal deployment fast enough and to take regulatory actions in response. During the Trump era, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's Republican majority ruled that 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds should still count as "advanced telecommunications capability," and concluded that the telecom industry was doing enough to extend advanced telecom service to all Americans."  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology">#Technology</a></p>

 The best kind of scaling war story: 

 "Figma’s database stack has grown almost 100x since 2020. [...] In 2020, we were running a single Postgres database hosted on AWS’s largest physical instance, and by the end of 2022, we had built out a distributed architecture with caching, read replicas, and a dozen vertically partitioned databases."

<p>I like the concept of "colos", their internal name for sharded groups of related tables arranged such that those tables can be queried using joins.</p>

<p>Also smart: separating the migration into "logical sharding" - where queries all still run against a single database, even though they are logically routed as if the database was already sharded - followed by "physical sharding" where the data is actually copied to and served from the new database servers.</p>

<p>Logical sharding was implemented using PostgreSQL views, which can accept both reads and writes:</p>

<p>CREATE VIEW table_shard1 AS SELECT * FROM table<br>WHERE hash(shard_key) &gt;= min_shard_range AND hash(shard_key) &lt; max_shard_range)</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle was DBProxy, a custom PostgreSQL query proxy written in Go that can parse the query to an AST and use that to decide which shard the query should be sent to. Impressively it also has a scatter-gather mechanism, so "select * from table" can be sent to all shards at once and the results combined back together again.</p>

<p>マネロン規制は、金融サービス、不動産取引、ギャンブル、美術品の販売など、デジタルアイデンティティサービスを採用する可能性のあるさまざまな規制対象セクターをカバーしています。デジタルアイデンティティサービスは、マネーロンダリング防止チェックなどのマネロン規制要件を満たすために使用できますが、（英国において）認定されたデジタルアイデンティティサービスを規制要件を満たすためにどのように使用できるかについての具体的なガイダンスはありません。</p>



<p>昨年、英国科学・イノベーション・技術省<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/03/5622/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5622" title="Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology, DSIT">3</a>が開催したデジタルアイデンティティと属性の普及スプリント<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/03/5622/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5622" title="digital identity and attribute adoption sprints">4</a>では、英国のデジタルアイデンティティと属性信頼フレームワークとマネロン規制との関係が曖昧であることが、導入の障壁になっているという声が聞かれました。この関係を明確にすることで、重要なたくさんのユースケースにおいてデジタルアイデンティティの効率性と安全性の利点を活用し、経済犯罪との闘いを支援することができるでしょう。</p>

<p>"There’s a reason that some 2,900 newspapers have closed since 2005, and that reason is the ad revenues publishers were hoping for to support what were initially free websites never materialized." </p>

<p>What's left: paywalls and patronage.</p>

<p>I've become much more bullish about patronage than paywalls for journalism content, and working for two non-profit newsrooms with exactly that model has only solidified that opinion. The Guardian is an illustration of how well it can work - as are ProPublica and The 19th.</p>

<p>What the decline of programmatic ad revenue does make me wonder is: what's going to happen to the platforms that are sustained the same way?  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Media">#Media</a></p>

<p>Whatever you think of TikTok, I'm not excited about the idea that the US can force a sale of an internet service because it's under the control of another company. It seems to me that this undermines the effectiveness of the internet itself: the idea that anyone can reach anyone.</p>

<p>Subsequent conversations have convinced me <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-fediverse-for-media-organizations">that I’m right about the assertions I made about the Fediverse for media organizations</a>. There’s a huge need, a huge opportunity, and the underlying technology is there.</p><p>The thing that’s a bit missing is a first-class Fediverse platform. Mastodon itself has become a bottleneck. Its design decisions are all reasonable in its own right, but there’s a need for something that goes beyond copying existing siloed services like Twitter. (Pixelfed, similarly, apes Instagram; Lemmy apes Reddit.) What does a Fediverse service look like that’s been designed from the ground up to meet a user need rather than copy something that already exists? And what if that user need is a first-class reader experience with the ability to comment and share interesting stuff with your friends?</p><p>I’m not bullish on squeezing long-form content into a microblogging platform, whether on Mastodon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-can-write-long-form-articles-on-x-if-you-pay-for-premium-005707599.html">or X</a>. Long-form content isn’t best consumed as part of a fast-moving stream of short updates. But the fact that both have those features — and that people are syndicating full-length articles straight to the Fediverse despite the poor UX — points to an interesting deer path to pave.</p><p>What if we had a great experience that ties together both short-form discussion and re-sharing and long-form reading, in a way that better showcases both kinds of content and realizes that the way we consume both is different? What if it had a beautiful, commercial-level design? And what if it remained tied to the open social web at its core, and pushed the capabilities of the protocols forward as it released new features and discovered new user needs?</p><p>If I had a year and funding, this is what I’d be working on.</p>

<p>Heute Abend finden in Brüssel die abschließenden Verhandlungen zum Europäischen Gesundheitsdatenraum statt. Einer der Verhandler, der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei und Datenschützer Dr. Patrick Breyer, weist auf eine mögliche folgenschwere Änderung in letzter Minute hin:</p>



<p>„Auf den letzten Meter droht das Recht der Patienten gestrichen zu werden, einem Zugriff auf ihre Patientenakte aus dem Ausland widersprechen zu können (Artikel 8F Absatz 2). Wer eine elektronische Patientenakte nutzt, könnte seine nicht-anonymisierte Patientenakte damit automatisch auch für den europaweiten grenzüberschreitenden Zugriff u.a. durch ausländische Behandler, Behörden und Forscher freigeben. Das widerspricht dem Interesse und Willen der Patienten, von denen laut Meinungsumfrage nur eine Minderheit einen grenzüberschreitenden Zugriff auf ihre Patientenakte wünscht. Es wird auch der Sensibilität der Daten nicht annähernd gerecht, die von Suchtkrankheiten, psychischen Störungen, Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen bis hin zu Geschlechtskrankheiten und Reproduktionsstörungen reichen.“</p>



<p>Breyer weist auch auf weitere Knackpunkte der Verhandlungen hin:</p>



<p>„Mit großer Anstrengung ist es uns zwar gelungen, einen europaweiten Zwang zur elektronischen Patientenakte zu verhindern. Wer aber einmal im System ist, dem droht je nach Verhandlungsausgang der Ausverkauf seiner Geschlechtskrankheiten und sexuellen Störungen, Impotenz und Unfruchtbarkeit, Schwangerschaftsabbrüche, Süchte und psychischen Krankheiten an Techkonzerne und Pharmaindustrie zur ‚Produktentwicklung‘ oder zum Trainieren von KI-Produkten, an Gesundheitsministerien und Krankenkassen, an Lehrpersonal zum Vorzeigen von Patientenaufnahmen in Vorlesungen – ohne jegliche verbriefte Kontrolle der Patienten, ohne garantiertes Widerspruchsrecht oder Einwilligungserfordernis, selbst für intimste Leiden. Die unter Pseudonym zugänglichen Patientendaten bleiben identifizierbar. Letztendlich droht so das Ende der ärztlichen Schweigepflicht und der Verzicht auf dringend notwendige Behandlungen aus Sorge vor Stigmatisierung, unter Umständen sogar Suizide. Profitinteressen soll unverfroren Vorrang vor dem Patienteninteresse gegeben werden.</p>



<p>Eine unabhängige Zertifizierung der Sicherheit europäischer Gesundheitsdatensysteme ist fraglich. Und die Speicherung unserer Patientenakten droht selbst außerhalb Europas, etwa in den USA, zugelassen zu werden.</p>



<p>Insgesamt wollen EU-Regierungen und EU-Kommission sensibelste Patientenakten anhäufen, vernetzen und weitergeben lassen, ohne aber die Kontrolle und Selbstbestimmung der Patienten über ihre Daten garantieren zu wollen. ‚Alles geht, nichts muss‘ ist kein Ansatz, dem Patienten vertrauen können. Ohne Vertrauen kann ein Europäischer Gesundheitsdatenraum nicht funktionieren. Laut Umfragen wollen mehr als 80% der EU-Bürger selbst über die Weitergabe ihrer Patientenakten entscheiden. Ich werde in den finalen Verhandlungen alles geben, um für das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Bürger und das Arztgeheimnis zu kämpfen. Dafür bin ich Volksvertreter.“</p>

Eleanor Oman, Alaska, circa 1942
<p>Mom would have been 111 today. She passed in ’03 at 90, but that’s not what matters.</p>
<p>What matters is that she was a completely wonderful human being: as good a mother, sister, daughter, cousin, friend, and teacher as you’ll find.</p>
<p>There is a thread in Facebook (which seems to be down now) on the subject of Mom as a third and fourth grade teacher in the Maywood New Jersey public school system. Students who inhabited her classes more than half a century ago remember her warmly and sing her praises. Maybe I’ll quote some of those later. (I’m between flights right now, but getting ready to board.)</p>
<p>Once, sitting around a fire in the commune-like place where I lived north of Chapel Hill in the mid-’70s, discussion came around to “Who is the sanest person you know?” I said “My mother.” Others were shocked, I suppose because they had issues with their moms. But I didn’t. Couldn’t. She was too wise, good, and loving. (Also too smart, quick-witted, tough, and unswayed by bullshit.)</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m idealizing too much. She had flaws, I’m sure. But not today.</p>

<p>I'm honestly troubled by the Tiktok legislation. I think Evan has a partial solution here: decoupling platforms from curation algorithms seems important. </p>

<p>I think there's also a lot to be said for not allowing any platform to get this big, regardless of national origin. If any company is big enough for its curation algorithm to influence national security, isn't that a problem? We saw Facebook influence multiple elections in worrying ways. I'd rather see lots of smaller platforms, linked with common protocols. And I'd support legislation designed to help prevent a small number of platforms from dominating our media consumption.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology">#Technology</a></p>

<p>Heute haben die Abgeordneten des Europäischen Parlaments das Medienfreiheitsgesetz (Media Freedom Act) angenommen. Die ausgearbeiteten Regeln sollen Journalist:innen zukünftig besser vor willkürlichen Löschungen auf Plattformen wie Facebook und Twitter und vor Spyware-Angriffen, wie etwa durch die Pegasus-Software, schützen. Die Abgeordneten der Piraten befürworten das Gesetz, kritisieren aber das fehlende Verbot des Ausspionierens von Journalisten.</p>



<p>Der Europaabgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer kommentiert:</p>



<p>„Das Medienfreiheitsgesetz ist ein Meilenstein beim Schutz von Journalist:innen in Europa. Besonders Länder wie Ungarn, wo es kaum noch kritische Presse gibt, sind dringend darauf angewiesen. Dass das Ausspionieren von Journalistenhandys mit Spyware ausdrücklich möglich bleibt, ist einer Demokratie, in der die Pressefreiheit garantiert ist, unwürdig. Allerdings fehlt der EU ohnehin die Kompetenz, das Hacken von Journalistenhandys unter dem Deckmantel des Schutzes der nationalen Sicherheit zu stoppen.</p>



<p>Das geplante Europäische Gremium für Mediendienste soll bedenklicherweise ‚Maßnahmen gegen ausländische Medien‘ koordinieren. Wenn wir aber anfangen, den Zugang unserer eigenen Bürger zu ausländischen Informationsquellen abzuschneiden und Auslandsmedien zu zensieren, ist das aus meiner Sicht nicht vereinbar mit den Grundsätzen eines freien Landes und eines mündigen Bürgers. Dem EU-Medienfreiheitsgesetz fehlt zudem ein Schutz legaler Medieninhalte vor Plattformzensur. So bekommen die willkürlich festgelegten AGB der Social Media-Konzerne quasi Vorrang vor der Pressefreiheit.<br>Zusammenfassend bedeutet dieses Medienfreiheitsgesetz einen zwar unzureichenden, aber doch deutlich stärkeren Schutz der freien Medien als tragende Säule unserer Demokratie.”</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about the risks and ethical issues around AI in the following buckets:</p>  Source impacts: the ecosystem impact of generative models on the people who created the information they were trained on. 
 Truth and bias: the tendency of generative models to give the appearance of objectivity and truthfulness despite their well-documented biases and tendency to hallucinate. 
 Privacy and vendor trust: because the most-used AI models are provided as cloud services, users can end up sending copious amounts of sensitive information to service providers with unknown chain of custody or security stances. 
 Legal fallout: if an organization adopts an AI service today, what are the implications for it if some of the suits in progress against OpenAI et al succeed? 
 <p>At the same time, I’m hearing an increasing number of reports of AI being useful for various tasks, and I’ve been following <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison’s exploratory work</a> with interest.</p><p>My personal conclusions for the above buckets, such as they are, break down like this:</p>  Source impacts: AI will, undoubtedly, make it harder for lots of people across disciplines and industries to make a living. This is already in progress, and continues a trend that was started by the internet itself (ask a professional photographer). 
 Truth and bias: There is no way to force an LLM to tell the truth or declare its bias, and attempts to build less-biased AI models have been controversial at best. Our best hope is probably well-curated source materials and, most of all, really great training and awareness for end-users. I also would never let generative AI produce content that saw the light of day outside of an organization (eg to write articles or to act as a support agent); it feels a bit safer as an internal tool that helps humans do their jobs. 
 Privacy and vendor trust: I’m inclined to try and use models on local machines and cloud services that follow a well-documented and controllable trust model, particularly in an organizational context. There’s a whole set of trade-offs here, of course, and self-hosted servers are not necessarily safer. But I think the future of AI in sensitive contexts (which is most contexts) needs to be on-device or on home servers. That doesn’t mean it will be, but I do think that’s a safer approach. 
 Legal fallout: I’m not a lawyer and I don’t know. Some but not all vendors have promised users legal indemnity. I assume that the cases will impact vendors more than downstream users — and maybe (hopefully?) change the way training material is obtained and structured to be more beneficial to authors — but I also don’t know that for sure. The answer feels like “wait and see”. 
 <p>My biggest personal conclusion is, I don’t know! I’m trying not to be a blanket naysayer: I’ve been a natural early adopter my whole life, and I don’t plan to stop now. I recently wrote about <a href="https://werd.io/2024/chatgpt-as-a-writing-partner">how I’m using ChatGPT as a motivational writing partner</a>. The older I get, the more problems I see with just about every technology, and I’d like to hold onto the excitement I felt about new tech when I was younger. On the other hand, the problems I see are really big problems, and ignoring those outright doesn’t feel useful either.</p><p>So it’s about taking a nimble but nuanced approach: pay attention to both the use cases and the issues around AI, keep looking at organizational needs, the kinds of organic <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/shadow-it">“shadow IT”</a> uses that are popping up as people need them, and figure out where a comfortable line is between ethics, privacy / legal needs, and utility.</p><p>At <a href="https://propublica.org">work</a>, I’m going to need to determine an organizational stance on AI, jointly with various other stakeholders. That’s something that I’d like to share in public once we’re ready to roll it out. This post is very much not that — this space is always personal. But, as always, I wanted to share how I’m thinking about exploring.</p><p>I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.</p>

<p>Heute haben die Abgeordneten des Europäischen Parlaments das EU-Gesetz über künstliche Intelligenz (KI-Gesetz oder AI Act) verabschiedet, mit dem neue Regeln für die Nutzung künstlicher Intelligenz in der EU eingeführt werden. Der digitale Freiheitskämpfer und Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer (Piratenpartei) warnt davor, dass das Gesetz den Weg für die Einführung biometrischer Massenüberwachung in Europa freimacht, wo sich EU-Regierungen dafür entscheiden:</p>



<p>„Mit diesem KI-Gesetz will die EU China offenbar nicht nur technologisch sondern auch innenpolitisch nacheifern. Flächendeckende und permanente Echtzeit-Gesichtserkennung, einschüchternde Verhaltensüberwachung im öffentlichen Raum wie in Hamburg eingesetzt, fehleranfällige Gesichtserkennung in Videoüberwachungsbändern von Demonstrationen schon bei Bagatelldelikten, die KI-gestützte Auswertung der Herkunft von Personen, unwissenschaftliche ‚Video-Lügendetektoren‘ – keine dieser dystopischen Technologien verbietet der AI Act unseren Regierungen, zu denen auch illiberale und rechtsextreme Regierungen wie in Ungarn oder Italien zählen. Statt uns vor einem High-Tech-Überwachungsstaat zu schützen, regelt der AI Act penibel, wie man ihn einführt. So wichtig eine Regulierung von KI-Technologie ist, ist die Verteidigung unserer Demokratie gegen die Errichtung eines High-Tech-Überwachungsstaats für uns Piraten nicht verhandelbar.</p>



<p>Überwachungsexperimente in den Ländern zur ‚Gefahrenabwehr‘ wie mit Verhaltensüberwachung in Hamburg oder Mannheim laufen bereits. Die nächste Große Koalition oder gar eine Regierung mit AfD-Beteiligung kann auch die EU-Anleitung zur Einführung biometrischer Echtzeit-Gesichtsüberwachung jederzeit aufgreifen.“</p>



<p>Anja Hirschel, Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei für die Europawahl 2024, fügt hinzu: „Der AI Act ebnet den Weg für die Einführung einer nie dagewesenen Massenüberwachung in Europa. Der Aufbau einer flächendeckenden, automatisierten Überwachungsinfrastruktur inklusive biometrischer Fernerkennungssysteme wird damit ermöglicht. Eine permanente Gesichtsüberwachung in Echtzeit würde dann zu unserer neuen Realität.“</p>



<p>Breyer bekräftigt: „Einer gesucht, alle überwacht? Mit dieser gesetzlichen Anleitung zu biometrischer Massenüberwachung kann unser Gesicht in der Öffentlichkeit mit der Begründung ‚Personenfahndung‘ immer und überall flächendeckend und verdachtslos gescannt werden. Die vermeintlichen Ausnahmen sind Augenwischerei – wegen der im ‚AI Act‘ genannten Delikte sucht die Justiz per Europäischem Haftbefehl nach über 6.000 Menschen. Unter ständiger Überwachung sind wir nicht mehr frei! In der Realität wurde mit biometrischer Echtzeitüberwachung des öffentlichen Raums noch kein einziger Terrorist gefunden, kein einziger Anschlag verhindert, stattdessen führt sie zu unzähligen Festnahmen Unschuldiger und bis zu 99% Falschverdächtigungen. Das Gesetz legitimiert und normalisiert eine Kultur des Misstrauens. Es führt Europa in eine dystopische Zukunft eines misstrauischen High-Tech-Überwachungsstaats nach chinesischem Vorbild.“</p>



<p>Laut <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/umfrage-mehrheit-gegen-biometrische-massenueberwachung-im-oeffentlichen-raum/">einer repräsentativen Umfrage im Auftrag Breyers, die von YouGov in 10 EU-Ländern durchgeführt wurde, lehnt eine deutliche Mehrheit der Europäer:innen biometrische Massenüberwachung im öffentlichen Raum ab.</a></p>



<p>Der Europäische Datenschutzausschuss und der Europäische Datenschutzbeauftragte haben ein “generelles Verbot des Einsatzes von KI zur automatischen Erkennung menschlicher Merkmale in öffentlich zugänglichen Räumen” gefordert, da dies “direkte negative Auswirkungen auf die Ausübung der Meinungs-, Versammlungs- und Vereinigungsfreiheit sowie der Freizügigkeit” habe. Mehr als 200 zivilgesellschaftliche Organisationen, Aktivisten, Technikspezialisten und andere Experten auf der ganzen Welt setzen sich für ein weltweites Verbot biometrischer Erkennungstechnologien ein, die eine massenhafte und diskriminierende Überwachung ermöglichen. Sie argumentieren, dass “diese Instrumente die Fähigkeit haben, Menschen zu identifizieren, zu verfolgen, auszusondern und zu verfolgen, wo immer sie sich aufhalten, und damit unsere Menschenrechte und bürgerlichen Freiheiten untergraben”. Auch die UN-Hochkommissarin für Menschenrechte spricht sich gegen den Einsatz biometrischer Fernerkennungssysteme im öffentlichen Raum aus und verweist auf die “mangelnde Einhaltung von Datenschutzstandards”, “erhebliche Probleme mit der Genauigkeit” und “diskriminierende Auswirkungen”.</p>



<p>Das Europäische Parlament hatte sich im vergangenen Jahr noch für ein Verbot biometrischer Massenüberwachung ausgesprochen.</p>

<p>Morgen stimmen die Abgeordneten des Europäischen Parlaments über das EU-Gesetz über künstliche Intelligenz (KI-Gesetz oder AI Act) ab, mit dem neue Regeln für die Nutzung künstlicher Intelligenz in der EU eingeführt werden sollen. Heute debattieren die Abgeordneten dazu. Der digitale Freiheitskämpfer und EU-Abgeordnete der Piratenpartei Dr. Patrick Breyer, der gegen die Verordnung stimmen will, warnte in seinem Redebeitrag vor den Folgen:</p>



<p>„Stellen Sie sich ein Europa vor, in dem nach dem Motto ‚einer gesucht, alle überwacht‘ überall mit unzuverlässiger und einschüchternder Technik unser Gesicht gescannt wird und Sie jederzeit mit Festnahme aufgrund einer Verwechselung rechnen müssen. Ein Europa, in dem Sie für abweichendes und ‚auffälliges‘ Verhalten automatisch der Polizei gemeldet werden, in dem Sie bei Gesprächen mit Beamten von unwissenschaftlichen Gesichtsüberwachungsalgorithmen der Lüge bezichtigt werden können, auch wenn Sie doch die Wahrheit sagen. Keine dieser dystopischen Technologien verbietet das EU-Gesetz über künstliche Intelligenz unseren Regierungen – offenbar will die EU China nicht nur technologisch sondern auch innenpolitisch überholen.</p>



<p>Statt uns vor einem High-Tech-Überwachungsstaat zu schützen, regelt der AI Act penibel, wie man ihn einführt. Deshalb sage ich: Nein zu einem Leben unter ständiger Überwachung und einer Kultur der Angst, Nein zu einem EU-Gesetz, das biometrische Massenüberwachung ermöglicht, und Nein zu Politikern, die sie tatsächlich einführen wollen, wie Friedrich Merz. Ja zu unserem Recht auf Freiheit und Privatsphäre, zu Vielfalt, zu unserem Recht unser Glück selbst zu suchen. Für eine Zukunft in Freiheit lohnt es sich zu kämpfen – jetzt erst recht!“</p>

 AGDPR doesn’t exist, but it&nbsp;should. <p>In 2012 the Europeans released the first proposal for their General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which ran a four-year political gauntlet and evolved into its final, official version in 2016. Because of the ghastly surveillance situation we now find ourselves in America and elsewhere, perpetrated by both private industry and government, I think America also desperately needs comprehensive privacy rules, rules informed by now eight years of hindsight and infused with an American value not found in Europe’s GDPR: privacy from government.</p><p>If I could wave a magic wand, an American GDPR would improve on Europe’s GDPR in two fundamental ways:</p> 1. Eliminate the idea that data about people can be “anonymized” or “de-identified”. <p>Data about people can no longer be effectively de-identified by removing personally identifying information (PII) from the dataset. Maybe this was generally still possible in 2016, but not any&nbsp;more.</p><p>GDPR set off a wave of innovation among data scientists who, like the old game “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBco7LLAcpc">Name That Tune</a>”, took the new regulation as a challenge and developed numerous ways to re-identify people using only a few data points that aren’t considered PII, techniques they’ve since made widely available. And that was before the recent explosion of AI tools which make re-identification easy without the direct use of such tools. Unfortunately, fully GDPR-compliant “de-identified” data sets are now trivially easy to re-identify for anyone with access to a computer.</p><p>(For more details on this topic, see <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/towards-formalizing-gdpr%E2%80%99s-notion-singling-out">this Harvard paper</a> about “simple” attacks that defeat GDPR’s PSO Secure / “singling out” privacy protection provisions.)</p><p>If almost any data about a person is usable to re-identify them, then the whole concept PII is no longer relevant; any data about a person is PII. That is precisely how an AGDPR definition of “personal data” can improve upon the European one: any data about an person. It’s both simpler and more accurate.</p> 2. Include protections for privacy *from government*, in addition to privacy from the private&nbsp;sector. <p>Europe’s GDPR specifically exempts government, AGDPR should do the opposite: it should bind government’s activities in relation to obtaining, using and retaining personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>There are obviously necessary and important reasons for government to obtain, use, and retain personal data, and those reasons should be explicitly enumerated and protected. But the U.S. federal government has gone absolutely bananas when it comes to how much of our personal data they are obtaining about us and our activities, through legal but largely unchallenged means. The degree to which it’s happening is way beyond what’s reasonably needed in a free country that espouses limited government, and that has a Fourth Amendment that&nbsp;secures:</p><blockquote>“the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures”.</blockquote><p>How is data about us not our “effects”? How is government gathering our effects en masse without our explicit consent not “unreasonable”?</p><p>Journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Byron Tau</a>’s new book about U.S. government surveillance of law-abiding citizens, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Means-Control-Alliance-Government-Surveillance/dp/B0C6YL6C81/">Means of Control</a>, is outrageous. (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/02/28/government-buying-your-data-00143742">Summary article here.</a>) You cannot read it and not become deeply alarmed at the enormous, secret, ubiquitous surveillance state that already exists in the U.S. No doubt European governments are doing the same with their citizens’ data, but — and I’m generalizing here — they don’t have the same foundational distrust of government that the U.S. was born with and so may not be bothered enough to do anything about it, as evidenced by government’s total exemption from their GDPR. I hope, and believe, that once more Americans become aware of the extent of what’s happening, an American GDPR that clearly defines government’s role in privacy can become a real, politically viable possibility.</p><p>There is a model to follow. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-bramwell-26815515/">Christopher Bramwell</a>, the Chief Privacy Officer of Utah, was the driving force behind a groundbreaking new piece of <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0491.html">privacy legislation</a> just enacted in Utah that constrains how personal data must be treated by government, without saying anything about private industry. As far as I know it’s the first of its kind, anywhere, and hopefully the first of many to follow in other states and countries. This bill gained a fortunate political boon as it advanced: it became a ‘vote against privacy’ to not support it; it passed unanimously.</p><p>Of course, privacy from big tech, surveillance capitalism, and private industry in general is a big deal, but private industry doesn’t have a monopoly on violence and taxes like government does; they mostly just want to sell me stuff. Still, the European GDPR shows an example of how to constrain private industry, and an American GDPR should learn from and incorporate those&nbsp;lessons.</p><p>The ideal outcome of an AGDPR would provide privacy both from private industry and from government, and finally put a halt to all federal activities of indiscriminate obtaining, using, and retaining of our personal digital “effects”, whether or not they’re considered PII.</p>

I think in this "scared new world," renewables change the dynamics of energy flows by moving production closer to energy use.</p><p>My wife, Lynne, recently gave me a copy of Peter Zeihan's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JJ322NC/windleyofente-20">The Accidental Superpower: Ten Years On</a>. The book was originally published in 2014, but Zeihan has updated it by inserting chapters talking about what he got right in 2014, what he got wrong, and why. The focus of the book is geopolitics—how geography and demographics shapes the world order—and how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">Bretton Woods</a> changed that in significant ways. The book makes the case that so much of what made Bretton Woods useful to the US and why the US engaged with the rest of the world for the 70 years following World War II is changing. As it changes the free trade system enabled by Bretton Woods is also changing. This will have significant impact on every country in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00JJ322NC/windleyofente-20">   </a> <p>Much of what changes has to do with energy. One of the things1 Zeihan got right was his assertion that unlike much of the rest of the developed world, the US doesn't need to import energy—specifically oil—we are a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/fotw-1310-october-2-2023-united-states-has-been-positive-net-exporter#:~:text=Vehicle%20Technologies%20Office-,FOOTY%20%231310%2C%20October%202%2C%202023%3A%20The%20United%20States,of%20Primary%20Energy%20Since%202019&amp;text=Exports%20of%20primary%20energy%20have,to%2027.5%20quads%20in%202022.">net energy importer</a>. This changes the dynamic wherein the US is willing to be the protector of shipping lanes for the entire world. As a result, the future could see a US that has the luxury of ignoring events in the Middle East, Ukraine, and elsewhere, whereas Europe (to take just one example) cannot. The book is full of other interesting predictions and conclusions just like this one. I encourage you to read it if you find this as fascinating as I do.</p><p>Zeihan makes a big deal of shale oil production, which <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=847&amp;t=6">accounted for 66% of US production in 2022</a>. But as I read this, I was thinking about renewables. As I wrote in 2020, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/decarbonizing_locally.shtml">I've gone in big on solar power at my house, love my EV, and have replaced most things in the house (like the furnaces) with versions that run on electricity.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I did this because it made my life easier and saves me money. The fact that it's good for the environment is a bonus.</p><p>But, solar and wind are not just renewable, they also allow energy production to be decentralized in ways oil and natural gas can't. Oil and natural gas deposits are where they are. Some countries are blessed with them and the others have to buy from those countries. And they're often far away, requiring shipping through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/03/what-is-the-red-sea-crisis-and-what-does-it-mean-for-global-trade">potentially hostile waters</a>. But that's not true of renewables. They can usually be built and located where ever the need is2. This changes geopolitical equation in significant ways, but areas of the world that are not energy independent, like Europe, are <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/share-of-energy-consumption-from#:~:text=According%20to%20EEA%20early%20estimates,renewables%20has%20slowed%20since%202020.">moving toward renewables too slowly</a> to prevent future energy shocks. The problem with renewables is that they're long-lead items—they take years to plan and bring online.</p><p>Petroleum and Bretton Woods enabled the modern world, providing portable, storable sources of energy that could easily and safely move to where ever it was needed.3 If we are indeed at the end of the Bretton Woods era, the world is in for significant changes as it adjusts to a life where free trade, and easy access to petroleum-based energy, cannot be assumed. Moving energy production closer to the places it's used is one strategy for dealing with this world-altering disruption. Buckle up.</p>    Notes   <p>There are other things that are important to the books overall conclusion besides energy. I'm just cherry picking that because I was thinking about it. For example, the US is largely self-sufficient from an overall import/export standpoint. We don't import nearly as much as many other countries and could replace what we do import relatively easily.</p>  <p>It's not just renewables. Nuclear power can also be located closer to demand than an oil deposit. I started my career as a nuclear metallurgist, so I'm a fan. I think many countries are going to be sorry they've closed nuclear plants and made them too hard to construct profitably.</p>  <p>The feats of engineering that have enabled these energy flows is truly astounding.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/boat-ship-sunset-bridge-oil-tanker-8163905/">Oil Tanker at Sunset</a> from Terski (<a href="https://pixabay.com/service/license-summary/">Pixabay</a>)</p>

 デモビデオ 



<p>基本、これらを使って各実装者がユーザインターフェース(UI)など含めて構築するのが前提ですが、リファレンス実装としてのUIも提供されており、この<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui?tab=readme-ov-file">ページ</a>からダウンロードしてインストールして試すこともできます。ただ、OSのセキュリティを弱めたりしなければならないのでハードルが高いですね。そのような方のために、動作を画面収録したビデオも提供されています（Android版のみ)。以下では、そのビデオの内容を説明します。（以下、スクショの出所はすべて「<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui?tab=readme-ov-file">https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui?tab=readme-ov-file</a>」です）</p>



 発行 



<p>発行のデモでは国民身分証明書(National Identity Document, National ID)の発行と運転免許証の発行の模様を見せてくれます。</p>



<a href="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/129499766/310886501-9e9fb151-38ca-48f7-a0d7-669ce816513b.mp4?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MTAxMzU4MzUsIm5iZiI6MTcxMDEzNTUzNSwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMjk0OTk3NjYvMzEwODg2NTAxLTllOWZiMTUxLTM4Y2EtNDhmNy1hMGQ3LTY2OWNlODE2NTEzYi5tcDQ_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjQwMzExJTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI0MDMxMVQwNTM4NTVaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT05M2ZlZDEzNjk4M2M1NGViOWE4ZWM3NjI0ZWZiYzk4NmE0ZmZhYWYzNGU5NTM4MjRhY2ZhYzYwZGU1ODNmOTE4JlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCZhY3Rvcl9pZD0wJmtleV9pZD0wJnJlcG9faWQ9MCJ9.7U1SMkAj3hgStYEUbQZkzz-sg3XwhnL0qk7Hire2n-w"></a>



<p>デモ画面では、まずアプリの立ち上げスプラッシュスクリーンと思しきEU旗の画面が出、暫く待つと、ウォレットへのログイン画面と思しき6桁PINの入力画面になります。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-9.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>これでユーザ認証がされると、アイデンティティ文書(Identity Document, ID)の取得画面になります。ここでは、国民身分証明書の取得ができるようになっています。運転免許証はこの段階ではできないようです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-10.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで、National IDを選択すると画面が遷移して国の選択画面になります。デモではEUを選択していますがこれはあくまでデモ用途で、実際の場合には個別の国を選択するのだと思います。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-11.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>「Submit」(提出)ボタンを押すと、再び画面が遷移し、当該プロバイダーへの個人情報の入力画面になります。多分ここで当該個人を識別するということなのでしょう。氏名と生年月日の入力を求められます。実際の発行にあたってはここで何らかの身元確認・当人認証が行われると思われます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-12.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>入力して送信すると、国民身分証明書が表示されます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで「CONTINUE」（つづける）を押すと、この身分証明書(ID)がウォレットに格納されます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-14.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで「ADD DOC」（文書を追加）を押すと、今度は運転免許証(Driving License)を足すことができるようになっています。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-15.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>早速追加してみます。すると、今度は運転免許証発行者に画面が遷移します。先ほどと同じようにして個人情報を入力するとモバイル運転免許証が発行されてウォレットへ格納されます。</p>



<p>デモではこの後、証明書の削除もやってみせてくれます。</p>



<p></p>



 提示 



<p>提示においては、OpenID for Verifiable Presentation (OID4VP)+CBORでの選択提示、OID4VP+CBOR, OID4VP Customの3種類の提示フローがサポートされているようです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>フローを選ぶと、まずVerifier画面になって、どの属性をユーザに要求するかを決めることができます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-2.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>そして、NEXTをクリックすると、ぱっとユーザの画面に切り替わり、認可を求めるための画面に切り替わります。多分、この画面以降をユーザが操作するという前提だと思いますが、この辺、画面を見ているだけだと大変わかりにくい。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-3.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで認可する(AUTHORIZE)ボタンを押すと、画面が切り替わり6桁のPINを入れる「ログイン画面」になります。これは、ユーザのスマホの上にあるWalletにログインするということだと思います。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ログインすると一瞬Welcomeback Jan と表示され、</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-5.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Verifierが次のデータを求めていますと表示されます。ここで、「なぜあなたのデータを求めるのか 8Why we need your data?)」という多分リンクである太文字部分があるので、これをクリックすると理由も見ることができるのだと思います。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-6.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで少し待つと、より詳細に、誰が求めてきているのか、どのデータを求めてきているのかが出てきます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-7.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>Verification Dataのセクションを開くと、これらの属性データを証明するための付随情報として何が送られるのかが出てきます。これらはデータに対するメタデータなわけですが、この情報から国籍だとかどこに住んでいるのかなどがわかってしまう可能性があります。そのことを考えると、ユーザにはもう少しわかりやすく出してあげることが求められるのではないかと思います。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-8.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>誰が求めてきているかということに関しては、信頼できる受取者(Relying Party, RP)からの要求であるかどうかということを確認することもできるようになっているようです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>OKを押してTrusted relying partyの画面を閉じて前の画面に戻り、そこで「SHARE」を押すともう一度PINを求められ、情報が提供されます。</p>



 近接提示の場合 



<p>近接提示とは、NFCでタップしたりQRコードを読み取ったりして、ネットワークを介さずにローカルでデータを引き渡すユースケースです。</p>



<p>デモでは左側がVerifier画面、右側が提示するユーザ/Holder/Presenter画面になります。</p>



<p>まず、ユーザがウォレットにPINを入れてログインします。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-18.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ログインが成功すると、文書選択画面になります。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-19.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここで、「SHOW QR or TAP」ボタンを押すとQRコードが表示されます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-20.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>次は、Verifier側での作業です。「Scan QR code」ボタンを押し、カメラを起動し、QRコードを読みます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-21.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>ここから先の流れは先程までのリモート提示の場合とほぼ同様です。</p>



<p>すべてうまく行くと、提供された属性が左側のVerifier画面に表示されます。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-17.png?ssl=1"></a>



 注意点〜ARFの状況について 



<p>EUデジタルアイデンティティウォレットのリファレンス実装を紹介しましたが、注意点が一つあります。リファレンス実装のページに「EUDIウォレットリファレンス実装は、<a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/architecture-and-reference-framework">アーキテクチャリファレンスフレームワーク(ARF)</a>に基づいて構築され、欧州連合全体の共通規格に基づくデジタル識別、認証、電子署名のための堅牢で相互運用可能なプラットフォームを紹介する」とあるわけですが、このARFがまだ決まってないんですね。リンク先には3月7日段階のものが ver.1.3としてアップロードされていますが、広くコメントを募るために公開されたもので、eIDAS expert group の承認が得られなかったバージョンとのことです。Ver.1.2は3月1日に公開されており、かなりペースが早く変更が加えられていることがわかります。ですので、まだこれから変更がある可能性は見越しておいた方がよさそうです。</p>

<p>X (旧Twitter) がタイムラインから「いいね」や「リポスト」の回数表示を削除するようです。3月8日現在、タイムライン上のツイートには、返信数、リポスト数、いいね数、表示回数が出ていますが、これが表示回数だけになるようです。</p>



<p>Dodge Designer さんの投稿にElon Musk氏が「これは確実にそうなる」と返事をしたことで明らかになりました。</p>



 
<blockquote><p>That is definitely happening. Just view count, as proxy for the other metrics, will show on the timeline</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1765560226462486988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
 



<p>ただし、これらは個別のポストを開くことで見ることができるとのこと。イーロン・マスク氏曰く「他の指標の代替物としての表示数だけがタイムラインには出るようになる。」</p>



<p>タイムライン上に出すのは負荷も高いでしょうから分からなくもないですが、不満の声もあるようです。というか、リプライは「Horrible Idea」「terrible idea」などで埋まっています…。わたしもちょっと残念と思います。これで更にユーザ離れが進まないと良いのですが…</p>

Einer der Verhandler, der Europaabgeordnete und Bürgerrechtler Dr. Patrick Breyer von der Piratenpartei, erklärt, was in den Verhandlungen auf dem Spiel steht:</p>



<p>„Mit großer Anstrengung ist es uns zwar gelungen, einen europaweiten Zwang zur elektronischen Patientenakte zu verhindern. Wer aber einmal im System ist, dem droht je nach Verhandlungsausgang der Ausverkauf seiner Geschlechtskrankheiten und sexuellen Störungen, Impotenz und Unfruchtbarkeit, Schwangerschaftsabbrüche, Süchte und psychischen Krankheiten an Techkonzerne und Pharmaindustrie zur ‚Produktentwicklung‘ oder zum Trainieren von KI-Produkten, an Gesundheitsministerien und Krankenkassen, an Lehrpersonal zum Vorzeigen von Patientenaufnahmen in Vorlesungen – ohne jegliche verbriefte Kontrolle der Patienten, ohne garantiertes Widerspruchsrecht oder Einwilligungserfordernis, selbst für intimste Leiden. Die unter Pseudonym zugänglichen Patientendaten bleiben identifizierbar. Letztendlich droht so das Ende der ärztlichen Schweigepflicht und der Verzicht auf dringend notwendige Behandlungen aus Sorge vor Stigmatisierung, unter Umständen sogar Suizide. Profitinteressen soll unverfroren Vorrang vor dem Patienteninteresse gegeben werden.</p>



<p>Das EU-Parlament fordert ein europaweit garantiertes und vollständiges Widerspruchsrecht von Patienten gegen die Weitergabe ihrer Gesundheitsdaten an Dritte, stößt aber auf erbitterten Widerstand von EU-Regierungen und EU-Kommission. Selbst das bereits beschlossene deutsche Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Datenweitergabe für Forschungszwecke steht in den Verhandlungen auf dem Spiel und könnte eingeschränkt werden. In jedem Fall droht es mittelfristig unter Druck zu kommen, wenn in anderen EU-Staaten kein Widerspruchsrecht gilt und deshalb der deutsche ‚Pharmastandort‘ über Benachteiligung klagt.</p>



<p>Je nach Verhandlungsausgang wird es Patienten unmöglich sein, die deutsche elektronische Patientenakte zu nutzen, ohne dass gleichzeitig ihre Daten grenzüberschreitend in der gesamten EU abrufbar werden. Eine unabhängige Zertifizierung der Sicherheit europäischer Gesundheitsdatensysteme ist fraglich. Und die Speicherung unserer Patientenakten droht selbst außerhalb Europas, etwa in den USA, zugelassen zu werden.</p>



<p>Insgesamt wollen EU-Regierungen und EU-Kommission sensibelste Patientenakten anhäufen, vernetzen und weitergeben lassen, ohne aber die Kontrolle und Selbstbestimmung der Patienten über ihre Daten garantieren zu wollen. Die Bundesregierung unterstützt das leider. ‚Alles geht, nichts muss‘ ist kein Ansatz, dem Patienten vertrauen können. Ohne Vertrauen kann ein Europäischer Gesundheitsdatenraum nicht funktionieren. Laut Umfragen wollen mehr als 80% der EU-Bürger selbst über die Weitergabe ihrer Patientenakten entscheiden. Ich werde in den finalen Verhandlungen alles geben, um für das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Bürger und das Arztgeheimnis zu kämpfen. Dafür bin ich Volksvertreter.“</p>

<p>Die Piratenpartei fordert Konsequenzen aus der Affäre um eine abgehörte Videokonferenz der Bundeswehr. Der Europaabgeordnete Dr. Patrick Breyer erklärt: „Sowohl das Europaparlament als auch die Bundeswehr verwenden bisher die US-amerikanische Konferenzplattform Webex. Beim der Taurus-Abhöraffäre war das aus vielen Gründen besonders fatal: Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung war nicht aktiviert und wird von Webex kaum unterstützt. Eine analoge Telefoneinwahl aus dem Ausland ist natürlich leicht abhörbar. Offensichtlich erfolgte keine Prüfung, wer alles teilnahm; Spoofing ist einfach. US-Anbieter sind für die USA ohnehin grundsätzlich abhörbar. Jetzt oder nie: Wir brauchen eine Kommunikations-Souveränitätsoffensive, die offene, selbst betriebene, metadatensparsame und voreingestellt Ende-zu-Ende-verschlüsselte Kommunikation zur Selbstverständlichkeit macht. Herr Bundeskanzler, übernehmen Sie!“</p>



<p>Die Spitzenkandidatin der Piratenpartei zur Europawahl und Digitalexpertin Anja Hirschel: „Das Abhören einer Webexkonferenz via Telefonzugang würde ich kaum als ‚hacking‘ bezeichnen. Vielmehr wurde eine zwar übliche, in Bezug auf die notwendige hohe Vertraulichkeit allerdings nicht ideale Software verwendet und zudem scheinbar die Aktivierung vorhandener Möglichkeiten zur Sicherung gegen leichten Drittzugang versäumt. Die Lehre aus solchen Vorfällen muss die konsequente Nutzung möglichst selbst gehosteter Systeme mit bereits standardisiert aktivierten Sicherheitseinstellungen sein.“</p>

<p>This article shows how to onboard different clients or organizations in an ASP.NET Core application to use separated Azure blob containers with controlled access using security groups and RBAC applied roles. Each user in a client group can only access a single blob storage and has no access to blob containers belonging to different clients. Microsoft Entra ID is used to implement the blob storage access.</p>

 Multi client blob storage access using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication and RBAC 
 



<p></p>



 Security context diagram 



<p>The web application uses different Enterprise applications to access the different Azure APIs. One Enterprise application is used to implement the blob application contributor access which can only be used from the application. This is used when a user in the application needs to write a file to the blob through the application. A second Enterprise application is used to create the RBAC access for the blob container reader access to the files. This is used when creating a new client or new organization. A third Enterprise application is used to implement the web application OpenID Connect web client. This is created using an Azure app registration and only allows delegated permissions. The user App roles are defined in this application. The Microsoft Graph APIs can be implemented using delegated permissions or application permissions. If using Graph application permissions to create or remove the groups, a separate Enterprise application is used to create the groups. You can also used the app service managed identity and use the service principal instead of the 3 enterprise applications to assign the required permissions.</p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



 Multi client blob storage setup 



<p>The Blob account uses Microsoft Entra ID to access the blob containers. The application can write to all containers and a security group is given RBAC blob container reader access, one per security group. Users are added to the security groups per client or per organization. The setup for the client blob container is implemented in three steps:</p>



 
 Create a Microsoft Entra ID security group 



 Create an Azure storage blob container 



 Create an RBAC to give the security group Blob storage reader permissions 
 



<p></p>



 Create a Microsoft Entra ID security group 



<p>The CreateSecurityGroupAsync method creates a new security group in Microsoft Entra ID. This is created using Microsoft Graph and returns the group with the group ID. The service uses application permissions and is implemented in a separate Enterprise application.</p>


  using System.Text;
using Microsoft.Graph.Models;

namespace MultiClientBlobStorage.Providers.GroupUserServices;

public class ApplicationMsGraphService
{
    private readonly GraphApplicationClientService _graphApplicationClientService;

    public ApplicationMsGraphService(
       GraphApplicationClientService graphApplicationClientService)
    {
        _graphApplicationClientService = graphApplicationClientService;
    }

    public async Task&lt;Group?&gt; CreateSecurityGroupAsync(string group)
    {
        var graphServiceClient = _graphApplicationClientService
            .GetGraphClientWithClientSecretCredential();

        var formatted = RemoveSpecialCharacters(group);
        var groupName = $"blob-{formatted.Trim()}-{Guid.NewGuid()}".ToLower();

        var requestBody = new Group
        {
            DisplayName = groupName,
            Description = $"Security group for all users from {groupName}",
            MailEnabled = false,
            MailNickname = formatted,
            SecurityEnabled = true
        };

        var result = await graphServiceClient.Groups.PostAsync(requestBody);
        return result;
    }

    private string RemoveSpecialCharacters(string str)
    {
        var sb = new StringBuilder();
        foreach (var c in str)
        {
            if (c is &gt;= '0' and &lt;= '9' || c is &gt;= 'A' and &lt;= 'Z' 
                  || c is &gt;= 'a' and &lt;= 'z' || c == '.' || c == '_')
            {
                sb.Append(c);
            }
        }

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create an Azure storage blob container 



<p>The CreateContainer method creates a new Azure blob container using the BlobServiceClient from the Azure.Storage.Blobs nuget package.</p>


  private async Task&lt;BlobContainerClient&gt; CreateContainer(string name)
{
    try
    {
        var formatted = RemoveSpecialCharacters(name);
        string containerName = $"blob-{formatted.Trim()}-{Guid.NewGuid()}"
           .ToLower();

        var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:Storage");

        var credential = _clientSecretCredentialProvider
           .GetClientSecretCredential();

        if (storage != null &amp;&amp; credential != null)
        {
            var blobServiceClient = 
            new BlobServiceClient(new Uri(storage), credential);

            var metadata = new Dictionary&lt;string, string?&gt;
            {
                { "name", name },
            };

            // Create the root container
            var blobContainerClient = await blobServiceClient
            .CreateBlobContainerAsync(
                containerName,
                PublicAccessType.None,
                metadata);

            if (blobContainerClient.Value.Exists())
            {
                Console.WriteLine(
                   $"Created container: {name} {blobContainerClient.Value.Name}");
            }

            return blobContainerClient.Value;
        }

        throw new Exception($"Could not create container: {name}");
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("HTTP error code {0}: {1}", e.Status, e.ErrorCode);
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        throw;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Create an RBAC to give the security group Blob storage reader permissions 



<p>The ApplyReaderGroupToBlobContainer method creates an RBAC for the security group on the blob container itself. The group and the container were created in the previous steps and this takes an unknown length of time. Polly is used to repeat until the group and the container are ready and it creates the assignment.</p>


  public async Task ApplyReaderGroupToBlobContainer(
     BlobContainerClient blobContainer, string groupId)
{
    var maxRetryAttempts = 20;
    var pauseBetweenFailures = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3);

    var retryPolicy = Policy
        .Handle&lt;Exception&gt;()
        .WaitAndRetryAsync(maxRetryAttempts, i =&gt; pauseBetweenFailures);

    await retryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =&gt;
    {
        // RBAC security group Blob data read
        await _azureMgmtClientService
            .StorageBlobDataReaderRoleAssignment(groupId,
                blobContainer.AccountName,
                blobContainer.Name);

        // NOTE service principal blob write is configured on root 
    });
}
  


<p></p>



<p>Azure management REST API is used to create the RBAC. This rest API is implemented using a HttpClient and uses an Enterprise application to define the required permissions. This requires an administration Azure role and with this, you have full control of the Azure tenant.</p>

            var blobContainer = await _clientBlobContainerProvider
                .CreateBlobContainerClient(ClientName);

            if(blobContainer != null &amp;&amp; group != null &amp;&amp; group.Id != null)
            {
                await _clientBlobContainerProvider

            }
        }

        return Page();
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>This works well but requires that the application has high privileged access permissions. Most IT departments will not allow this and the creation of blob containers would have to use the IT preferred tools. This type of automation requires 2 different Azure APIs and is not well documented.</p>

<p>A note in ballpoint on the bottom of a pencil drawer in the Hans Bethe house on Bathtub Row: “A mathematician does something on a piece of paper, and then lo and behold a big explosion can occur. S Ulam – Phila. 1967.”</p>

<p>これは、いわゆるデジタル庁デジタル認証アプリの提供に伴うものです。このデジタル認証アプリは、マイナンバーカードを認証手段として使うOpenID Connectの認証サーバです。マイナンバーカードに入っている利用者証明用電子証明書と券面情報を使って、OpenID Connectでアイデンティティ連携をできるようにするものです。</p>



<p>これ自体はとても便利なものになると思いますが、一方ではプライバシー上の懸念もマスコミなども通じて表明されています。</p>

<p>この取り組みは、今後、 Trusted Web技術を活用することで、エンティティ間をまたいだ情報のトラストが検証できるようになり、KYC<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/02/5548/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5548" title="Know Your Customer. 個人の本人確認">1</a>/KYB<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/02/5548/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5548" title="Know Your Business. 法人の本人確認">2</a>に関する証明書の発行者が検証可能な証明書（VC：Verifiable Credentials）を提供できるようになれば、KYC/KYBのデータの再利用が可能となって効率化し、トラストのある取引を促進する可能性があることに鑑み、「金融機関における法人口座の開設」を例に、KYC/KYBに基づいたトラストのある取引を促進する新しい仕組みの検討と検証を行う実証事業です。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/trusted_web_background_and_purpose.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>実証では、<a href="https://www.dentsusoken.com/">電通総研</a>が金融機関等を対象としたeKYC事業で数多くの実績がある<a href="https://www.acsion.co.jp/">ACSiON社</a>と共に、KYC/KYBのVC発行サービスの検討を行い、金融機関の協力を得てプロトタイプシステムを用いた検証を行っています。また技術面はOAuth2.0とOpenID Connect（OIDC）のコア機能をAPIとして提供している<a href="https://www.authlete.com/ja/">Authlete社</a>が参加し、最新仕様を同社製品に追加実装するOID4VCI (OpenID four Verifiable Credential Issuance)をアーキテクチャに組み込む形になっています。</p>



<p>供給したコメントの主なものは以下のとおりです。</p>



 
 【法制面の示唆】実務上は十分な信頼性で技術的にもKYC/KYB情報がVC/VP<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/02/5548/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5548" title="Verifiable Presentation">3</a>として提供できることがわかったが、犯収法などの法制面からはこれによって可能とはされない可能性がある。法制の改正も含めて考えるべきであり、その点の示唆が得られたことはとても良い。 



 【技術面の示唆】VCのIssuer-Holder-Verifierモデルで、IssuerからみてVerifierが匿名になるということは、Holder（対象個人）からするとプライバシー的に意義が大きいが、VCのIssuer(発行者)からすると、誰が何のためにその情報を使うのかがわからないというのは大きなリスク要因である。この状況を改善するために、同じ目的をもつ同様の業態のVerifierをグルーピングして、そこに対するAudience Restrictionをかけることが技術的には考えられるのではないか。たとえば、VPリクエストにグループ署名をして出して、Issuerはそのグループに対してVCを発行するような形も考えられるだろう<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/02/5548/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5548" title="そうすると従前からTrusted Web推進協議会で指摘していた「動脈と静脈／情報流と金龍」問題〜情報に対する支払い問題も解決する可能性がある">4</a>。こうした点は規格作成団体にフィードバックしてほしい。

 概要
 
 決済や保険といった金融機能を金融以外のITプラットフォームに組み込む動きが加速しています。そのため、APIを通じた金融機関と第三者間の安全かつ効率的なデータ交換の重要性が高まっています。その一方で、リスクやコストを上回るメリットがないと主張し続ける金融機関もあります。本セッションでは、オープン・バンキング／ファイナンスの持続的発展のための課題と対策について、世界各国の具体的な事例を紹介しながら議論します。<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2024/02/5538/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5538" title="（英語原文）The trend of embedding financial functions such as payment and insurance into non-financial IT platforms is accelerating. So secure and efficient data exchange between financial institutions and third parties through APIs is becoming more important. On the other hand, some financial institutions continue to argue that the benefits do not outweigh the risks and costs. In this session, we will discuss the challenges and measures for the sustainable development of open banking/finance by sharing tangible case studies across the globe.">1</a>

  Thinking through the PostgreSQL extension metadata use cases and
recognizing the types of information they need.

<p>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about metadata for Postgres extensions.
Traditional use cases include <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file metadata</a>, which lives in
<code>.control</code> files used by <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> and friends, and <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN metadata</a>,
which lives in <code>META.json</code> files used by <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> to index and publish extensions.
But these two narrow use cases for SQL behavior and source code distribution
don’t provide the information necessary to enable other use cases, including
building, installing, configuration, and more.</p>
<p>So I have also been exploring other metadata formats, including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref" title="go.mod file reference">Go <code>go.mod</code></a> 
 <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html" title="The Cargo Book: The Manifest Format">Cargo Manifest File</a> 
 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json" title="npm Docs: Specifics of npm's package.json handling">npm <code>package.json</code></a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/tembo-io/trunk/tree/main/contrib"><code>trunk.toml</code></a> 
 <a href="https://docs.pgxman.com/spec/buildkit">pgxman buildkit</a> 
 
<p>These standards from neighboring communities reveal a great deal of overlap, as
one might expect (everything has a name, a version, an author, license, and so
on), but also types of metadata that had not occurred to me. As I took notes and
gathered suggestions from colleagues and coworkers, I began to recognize natural
groupings of metadata. This lead to the realization that it might be easier —
and more productive — to think about these groupings rather than individual
fields.</p>
<p>I therefore propose a typology for Postgres extension metadata.</p>
 Extension Metadata Typology 
 Essentials 
<p>Essential information about the extension itself, including its name (or unique
package name), version, list of authors, license, etc. Pretty much every
metadata format encompasses this data. Ecosystem applications use it for
indexing, installation locations, naming conventions, and display information.</p>
 Artifacts 
<p>A list of links and checksums for downloading the extension in one or more
formats, including source code, binaries, system packages, and more. Apps use
this information to determine the best option for installing an extension on a
particular system.</p>
 Resources 
<p>External information about the extension, mostly links, including source code
repository, bug reporting, documentation, badges, funding, etc. Apps use this
data for links, of course, but also full text indexing, documentation rendering,
and displaying useful information about the extension.</p>
 Contents 
<p>A description of what’s included in the extension package. Often an “extension”
consists of multiple extensions, such as <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a>, which includes <code>postgis</code>,
<code>postgis_tiger_geocoder</code>, <code>address_standardizer</code>, and more. Furthermore, some
extensions are not <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code>-type extension at all, such as <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background
workers</a>, command-line apps, libraries, etc. Each should be listed along with
documentation links where they differ from the package overall (or are simply
more specific).</p>
 Prerequisites 
<p>A list of external dependencies required to configure, build, test, install, and
run the extension. These include not only other extensions, but also external
libraries and OS-specific lists of binary package dependencies. And let’s not
forget the versions of Postgres required, as well as any OS and version
dependencies (e.g, does it work on Windows? FreeBSD? What versions?) and
architectures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64" title="Wikipedia: AArch64">arm64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amd64" title="Wikipedia: AMD64">amd64</a>, etc.)</p>
 How to Build It 
<p>Metadata that apps use to determine how to build the extension. Does it use the
PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> build pipeline? Or perhaps it needs the <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx/blob/develop/cargo-pgrx/README.md" title="pgrx: cargo-pgrx">cargo</a>-based <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a>
toolchain. Maybe a traditional <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> pattern? Perl, Ruby,
Python, Go, Rust, or NPM tooling? Whatever the pattern, this metadata needs to
be sufficient for an ecosystem app to programmatically determine how to build
an extension.</p>
 How to Install It 
<p>Usually an extension of the build metadata, the install metadata describes how
to install the extension. That could be <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx: Build Postgres Extensions with Rust!">pgrx</a> again, but could also
use other patterns — or multiple patterns! For example, perhaps an extension
can be built and installed with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a>, but it might also be <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle" title="pg_tle: Framework for building trusted language extensions for PostgreSQL">TLE</a>-safe, and
therefore provide details for handing the SQL files off to a <a href="https://github.com/aws/pg_tle/blob/main/examples/README.md" title="TLE examples/pgtle.mk README">TLE installer</a>.</p>
<p>This typology might include additional data, such as documentation files to
install (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page" title="Wikipedia: Man page">man pages</a> anyone?), or directories of dependent files or libraries,
and the like — whatever needs to be installed for the extension.</p>
 How to Run It 
<p>Not all Postgres extensions are <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> extensions. Some provide
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bgworker.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Background Worker Processes">background workers</a> to perform various tasks; others simply provide Utility
applications like <a href="https://pg_top.gitlab.io" title="Welcome to the PostgreSQL top Project Home Page">pg_top</a> and <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/" title="pg_repack --- Reorganize tables in PostgreSQL databases with minimal locks">pg_repack</a>. In fact <a href="https://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/" title="pg_repack --- Reorganize tables in PostgreSQL databases with minimal locks">pg_repack</a> provides both
a command-line application and a <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> extension in one package!</p>
<p>This metadata also provides configuration information, both <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file
parameters</a> like <code>trusted</code>, <code>superuser</code>, and <code>schema</code>, but also load
configuration information, like whether an extension needs its libraries
included in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: shared_preload_libraries"><code>shared_preload_libraries</code></a> to enable <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-load.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: LOAD"><code>LOAD</code></a> or requires a
cluster restart. (Arguably this information should be in the “install” typology
rather than “run”.)</p>
 Classification 
<p>Classification metadata lets the extension developer associate additional
information to improve discovery, such as key words. It might also allow
selections from a curated list of extension classifications, such as the
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs" title="crates.io: All Valid Category Slugs">category slugs</a> supported for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-categories-field" title="The Cargo Book: The Manifest Format --- Categories">cargo categories field</a>. Ecosystem apps use
this data to organize extensions under key words or categories, making it easier
for users to find extensions often used together or for various workloads or
tasks.</p>
 Metrics and Reports 
<p>This final typology differs from the others in that its metadata derives from
third party sources rather than the extension developer. It includes data such
as number of downloads, build and test status on various Postgres/OS/version
combinations, binary packaging distributions, test coverage, security scan
results, vulnerability detection, quality metrics and user ratings, and more.</p>
<p>In the broader ecosystem, it would be the responsibility of the root registry to
ensure such data in the canonical data for each extension comes only from
trusted sources, although applications downstream of the root registry might
extend metrics and reports metadata with their own information.</p>
 What More? 
<p>Reading through various metadata standards, I suspect this typology is fairly
comprehensive, but I’m usually mistaken about such things. What other types of
metadata do you find essential for the use cases you’re familiar with? Do they
fit one of the types here, or do they require some other typology I’ve failed to
imagine? Hit the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a> to contribute to
the discussion, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ll be refining this typology and assigning all the metadata fields
to them in the coming weeks, with an eye to proposing a community-wide metadata
standard. I hope it will benefit us all; your input will ensure it does.</p>

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core application can control the write access to an Azure blob storage container using an application app registration. Microsoft Entra ID is used to control the user access and to implement the authentication of the web application.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEntraIdBlobStorage">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreEntraIdBlobStorage</a></p>



 Blogs in this series 



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2024/02/12/using-blob-storage-from-asp-net-core-with-entra-id-authentication/">Using Blob storage from ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication</a> 



 Delegated read and application write access to blob storage using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication 



 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2024/03/04/multi-client-blob-storage-access-using-asp-net-core-with-entra-id-authentication-and-rbac/">Multi client blob storage access using ASP.NET Core with Entra ID authentication and RBAC</a> 
 



<p>The solution provides a secure upload and secure download using Microsoft Entra ID. Users are authenticated using Microsoft Entra ID. The blob storage containers use Microsoft Entra ID security groups to control the read access. The upload access uses the an Enterprise application for the contributor role. This is used from the ASP.NET Core application for file upload.</p>



<p>In Azure, only the application can upload files and the users of the groups can only read the files.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The RBAC are setup as shown:</p>







<p></p>



 Blob storage application write access 



<p>The application can upload files to Azure blob storage. Client secrets are used to acquire the access token using the client credentials OAuth flow. This can be further improved by using a certificate and using the client assertions or even a managed identity from the host service. For development, I normally use a secret for simplicity.</p>


  using Azure.Identity;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class ClientSecretCredentialProvider
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public ClientSecretCredentialProvider(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public ClientSecretCredential GetClientSecretCredential()
    {
        // Values from app registration
        var tenantId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureAd:TenantId");
        var clientId = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ApplicationClient:ClientId");
        var clientSecret = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ApplicationClient:ClientSecret");

        var options = new ClientSecretCredentialOptions
        {
            AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
        };

        // https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.clientsecretcredential
        var clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredential(
            tenantId, clientId, clientSecret, options);

        return clientSecretCredential;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The BlobApplicationUploadProvider uses the token and makes it possible to upload files to the Azure Blob storage. The provider uses the IFormFile as a parameter for the file data. Meta data is persisted in the local SQL database.</p>


  using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class BlobApplicationUploadProvider
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    private readonly ClientSecretCredentialProvider _clientSecretCredentialProvider;

    public BlobApplicationUploadProvider(ClientSecretCredentialProvider clientSecretCredentialProvider,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
        _clientSecretCredentialProvider = clientSecretCredentialProvider;
    }

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AddNewFile(BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload, IFormFile file)
    {
        try
        {
            return await PersistFileToAzureStorage(blobFileUpload, file);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
        }
    }

    private async Task&lt;string&gt; PersistFileToAzureStorage(
        BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload,
        IFormFile formFile,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:StorageAndContainerName");
        var fileFullName = $"{storage}/{blobFileUpload.Name}";
        var blobUri = new Uri(fileFullName);

        var blobUploadOptions = new BlobUploadOptions
        {
            Metadata = new Dictionary&lt;string, string?&gt;
            {
                { "uploadedBy", blobFileUpload.UploadedBy },
                { "description", blobFileUpload.Description }
            }
        };

        var blobClient = new BlobClient(blobUri, _clientSecretCredentialProvider.GetClientSecretCredential());

        var inputStream = formFile.OpenReadStream();
        await blobClient.UploadAsync(inputStream, blobUploadOptions, cancellationToken);

        return $"{blobFileUpload.Name} successfully saved to Azure Blob Storage Container";
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Blob storage delegated read access 



<p>The blob storage reader access is given to all users in the security group. This security group uses the app-role from the Azure app registration and the group can access the blob container, not the blob account. No SAS are used .</p>


  using Azure.Core;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace DelegatedReadAppWriteBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential : TokenCredential
{
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential(ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public override AccessToken GetToken(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public override async ValueTask&lt;AccessToken&gt; GetTokenAsync(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string[]? scopes = _configuration["AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken"]?.Split(' ');

        if (scopes == null)
        {
            throw new Exception("AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken configuration missing");
        }

        AuthenticationResult result = await _tokenAcquisition
            .GetAuthenticationResultForUserAsync(scopes);

        return new AccessToken(result.AccessToken, result.ExpiresOn);
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Using an application for write access to the blob storage has both advantages and disadvantages in context of security. Removing the write access to all users is positive, but when using applications or if the application has weak security, this approach can be bad. Using a managed identity for the deployed service would improve the security and would remove the need for secrets or certificates to authenticate the application. This prepares the access for the next solution which would be to implement a multi-tenant or multi-client application using the Azure blob.</p>

 Today I was fortunate to have my picture taken with Morris Lukowich during Hockey Day in Houston at Saint Arnold Brewing.  The best hockey games I have ever watched in-person were the 1977-78 Houston Aeros.  The WHA All-Star game was in Quebec City on January 17, 1978 and for the picture I believe it is Lukowich’s All-Star jersey from that game that I have borrowed.

 Fixed #2112, #2113, and #2114: Defined that client authentication is not used by default and that the default client authentication method, when used, is private_key_jwt. Specified that requests using client authentication use HTTP POST. 
 Fixed #2104: Allow trust marks in Subordinate Statements for implementation profiles that might want this. 
 Fixed #2103: Addressed ambiguities in the definition of constraints. 
 
<p>-32:</p>
 
 Tightened OpenID Connect Client Registration section. 
 Tightened appendix examples. 
 Fixed #2075: Trust Mark endpoint for the provisioning of the Trust Marks. 
 Fixed #2085: Trust Marked Entities Listing, added sub URL query parameter. 
 Made fetch issuer unambiguous by making the iss parameter REQUIRED. 
 Introduced the term “Subordinate Statement” and applied it throughout the specification. Also consistently use the term “registration Entity Statement” for Explicit Client Registration results. 
 Clarified where Entity Statement claims can and cannot occur. 
 Renamed policy_language_crit to metadata_policy_crit. 
 Fixed #2093: Numbered the list defining the order policy operators are applied in.

<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">Rich Authorization Request extension to OAuth 2</a>, or RAR, is a way to talk about access in the OAuth space beyond what scopes allow, and it is defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9396.html">RFC9396</a>. One of the key motivations behind RAR was admitting, as a community, that a lot of times you need more than a set of scope values to properly describe access to an&nbsp;API.</p> A Larger&nbsp;Scope <p>Scopes work pretty well in OAuth, but they’re ultimately just a set of strings. It’s worlds better than the all-or-nothing access that OAuth 1 or API keys give you, and if you have an API, they allow you to easily separate read and write access. But what if you want to be more specific? What if you want to, say, let someone access a specific account for certain features for a certain amount of time? Or read in one place but write to another? And what if you want to compose that set of features differently, such as any account for an unlimited time but only if the user’s online? The ways of describing API access are as varied as the APIs being accessed.</p><p>When faced with this problem, the first thing that many people realize is that because scopes are just strings, their own API can impose semantics and syntax on those strings. So people <a href="https://blue-button.github.io/blue-button-plus-pull/#scopes">add parameters</a>, or define <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-heart-fhir-oauth2-1_0.html#rfc.section.2">composition rules</a>, or even define a <a href="https://utilityapi.com/docs/greenbutton/scope">whole query language</a> embedded into the scope string. But those approaches require a lot of complex processing and lack interoperable structure that would let you easily combine protection of multiple kinds of&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>What RAR gives you, instead, is an array of JSON objects to describe your API access. So instead of trying to cram everything into a single string, you can now put together an object that defines exactly what you&nbsp;want.</p> [<br>   {<br>      "type": "payment_initiation",<br>      "actions": [<br>         "initiate",<br>         "status",<br>         "cancel"<br>      ],<br>      "locations": [<br>         "https://example.com/payments"<br>      ],<br>      "instructedAmount": {<br>         "currency": "EUR",<br>         "amount": "123.50"<br>      },<br>      "creditorName": "Merchant A",<br>      "creditorAccount": {<br>         "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"<br>      },<br>      "remittanceInformationUnstructured": "Ref Number Merchant"<br>   }<br>] <p>This object is specific to the API in question and carries with it all the detail that is needed for successful processing. Each kind of API can define its own type value, which in turn defines what’s allowed to go into the rest of the object. And if you need more than one view of things, like read access to A but write access to B, then you can pass in multiple objects in the same structure.</p><p>One important question arises out of this: who needs to know this level of&nbsp;detail?</p> Who Cares About&nbsp;RAR <p>In this regard, RAR really is built on top of the concept of a scope. In an OAuth delegation, there are four parties. The client, resource owner, authorization server (AS), and resource server&nbsp;(RS).</p>The four parties in OAuth delegation, illustration from OAuth 2 In&nbsp;Action<p>These parties have particular relationships, and each of them might care about a RAR object or a scope in a slightly different way. However, the more important question is about which relationship is in&nbsp;play.</p> Client -&gt; AS: Requesting Access <p>.When requesting an access token, the client needs to be able to describe to the AS what it wants. RAR allows the client to get VERY specific, if the client knows what details it wants ahead of time. Maybe the client has prompted the resource owner for an account identifier, or has learned through some other protocol where the target system is located, or it’s just been configured to know that it needs to ask for specific objects in order to do specific things. In all of these cases, the client can send RAR objects to the AS just like it would a scope, in the hopes of getting an access token that can do what it asks&nbsp;for.</p> AS -&gt; Client: Granting&nbsp;Access <p>When the access token is granted, the AS can tell the client which RAR objects have been applied to the token. While this information is no substitute for an API discovery protocol, this approach can let the client differentiate what an access token is good for in different dimensions. For example, a client can ask for a token for an available signing service, and then be granted a token for use at a specific signing service, indicated through the locations field in the RAR&nbsp;object.</p> AS -&gt; Resource owner: Gathering Authorization <p>During the delegation process, the AS often needs to prompt the resource owner to see if they’re OK with what’s being delegated. While this starts as the Client-&gt;AS request, RAR gives the AS an opportunity to fine-tune the access by asking the resource owner to be specific, or even filling in values that get put into the resulting RAR object. Maybe the client is asking for account access but the resource owner stipulates that it’s only good for the next five minutes. This does come at a usability cost, since it’s much easier to display a list of scope strings with checkboxes. But experience has shown that this list is not a great security measure anyway, since most users won’t change the checkboxes, and often don’t understand the differentiated access being&nbsp;granted.</p> AS -&gt; RS: Describing Access <p>The access token itself represents a certain set of rights that have been granted. These can be described in the metadata of the token, available through either a structured token field or an introspection response. In this way, the RS can learn what an access token is good for, and apply its policies appropriately. Does the token grant access for the HTTP GET command on the resource at /photo/123-fda1d? Is this token even good at this specific RS, or is it meant for somewhere else? The RAR object can be used to describe all of&nbsp;this.</p> Not Everything Has To&nbsp;Match <p>Finally, it’s important to note that the all of these different branches need not match each other in a single transaction. In one of the applications where I’ve personally deployed RAR, the client never sees the RAR objects. The client knows to ask for a specific scope, and the AS knows that when it sees that scope, the resulting token needs to apply to a whole set of things represented by the current user’s access within the system. The downstream APIs know nothing about users or accounts, but they do know the resources they&nbsp;protect.</p><p>As a consequence, the AS translates the client’s incoming scope request to a set of RAR objects that the APIs understand. The APIs never see or care about the scope, and the client never sees or cares about the RAR. In this way, internal API details stay internal and do not leak unnecessarily into the wider&nbsp;system.</p><p>However, a different client in this same ecosystem does have insight into the details of the API structure, and therefore its requests do specify RAR objects that target the APIs. These objects are processed in exactly the same way by the API servers, which gives us a powerful parallelism and profound code reuse in production.</p> GNAP Native <p>In <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-18.html">GNAP</a>, one of our main goals was to see what an OAuth-style system would look like without the constraints and history of OAuth, and one such constraint includes scopes. Consequently, GNAP’s native access rights is an array of objects that look suspiciously like RAR objects. This design is, of course, intentional, and in many ways RAR is the backport of GNAP’s access rights system to work on top of OAuth 2. While GNAP doesn’t have scopes in the same way, GNAP’s reference-based approach to its API design does allow for the use of a simple string to stand in for the objects in question, allowing a request to have both shortcut and fully specified items in the same&nbsp;request.</p> "access": [<br>    {<br>        "type": "photo-api",<br>        "actions": [<br>            "read",<br>            "write"<br>        ],<br>        "locations": [<br>            "https://server.example.net/",<br>            "https://resource.local/other"<br>        ],<br>        "datatypes": [<br>            "metadata",<br>            "images"<br>        ],<br>        "geolocation": [<br>            { lat: -32.364, lng: 153.207 },<br>            { lat: -35.364, lng: 158.207 }<br>        ]<br>    },<br>    {<br>        "type": "financial-transaction",<br>        "actions": [<br>            "withdraw"<br>        ],<br>        "identifier": "account-14-32-32-3",<br>        "currency": "USD"<br>    },<br>    "dolphin-metadata",<br>    "some other thing"<br>]  How Can I Use&nbsp;RAR? <p>RAR support is starting to show up across different vendors, though it’s not universal yet. One of the companies I work for, <a href="https://www.authlete.com/">Authlete</a>, supports RAR natively. Other products can often have RAR grafted on top, since it takes the form of an extra parameter to be processed by an extension or&nbsp;module.</p><p>The real value is that we are starting to see API access defined in terms of RAR objects, replacing the awkward and error-prone string composition practices of the past. RAR may seem complex, but when you look at how APIs are defined and scopes are used, the power of that complexity really starts to show its&nbsp;value.</p>

<p>Every software distribution system deals with versioning. Early in the design of
<a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, I decided to require <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versions</a> (SemVer), a
clearly-defined and widely-adopted version standard, even in its <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0-beta.html" title="Semantic Versioning 1.0.0-beta">pre-1.0
specification</a>. I implemented the <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/semver" title="semver: A semantic version data type / PostgreSQL Extension Network">semver data type</a> that would properly sort
semantic versions, later ported to C by <a href="http://vilain.net" title="Sam Vilain: Free Software Programmer - Wood Craftsman - Open Water Swimmer - Science Enthusiast">Sam Vilain</a> and eventually updated to
<a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semver 2.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve been thinking through the <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/pgxn-ecosystem-jobs" title="The Jobs to be Done by the Ideal Postgres Extension Ecosystem">jobs</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d#tools" title="Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools">tools</a> for the Postgres extension
ecosystem, I wanted to revisit this decision, the context in which it was made,
and survey the field for other options. Maybe a “PGXN v2” should do something
different?</p>
<p>But first that context, starting with Postgres itself.</p>
 PostgreSQL Extension Version Standard 
<p>From the introduction extensions in PostgreSQL 9.1, the project side-stepped the
need for version standardization and enforcement by requiring extension authors
to adopt a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-UPDATES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “Packaging Related Objects into an Extension —&nbsp;Extension Updates”">file naming convention</a>, instead. For example, an extension named
“pair” must have a file with its name, two dashes, then the version as listed in
its control file, like so:</p>
 <code>pair--1.1.sql
</code> <p>As long as the file name is correct and the version part byte-compatible with
the control file entry, <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> will find it. To upgrade an extension
the author must provide a second file with the extension name, the old version,
and the new version, all delimited by double dashes. For example, to upgrade our
“pair” extension to version <code>1.2</code>, the author supply all the SQL commands
necessary to upgrade it in this file:</p>
 <code>pair--1.1--1.2.sql
</code> <p>This pattern avoids the whole question of version standards, ordering for
upgrades or downgrades, and all the rest: extension authors have full
responsibility to name their files correctly.</p>
 PGXN Versions 
<p><a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a> simplified a number of issues for PGXN in ways that the PostgreSQL
extension versioning did not (without having to re-implement the core’s file
naming code). PGXN wants all metadata for an extension in its <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification"><code>META.json</code></a>
file, and not to derive it from other sources that could change over time.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/andk/pause/blob/master/doc/operating-model.md#35-factors-considering-in-the-indexing-phase" title="The PAUSE Operating Model v2: Factors considering in the indexing phase">CPAN model</a>, PGXN also required that extension releases never
decrease the version.<a>1</a> The well-defined sortability of semantic versions
made this validation trivial. PGXN <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-manager/commit/d2bd3bf" title="pgxn/pgxn-manager@d2bd3bf: Allow updates to old versions">later relaxed</a> enforcement to allow updates
to previously-released versions. SemVer’s <a href="https://semver.org/#spec-item-11" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0: Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered.">clearly specified sorting</a> made this
change possible, as the <code>major.minor.patch</code> precedence intuitively compare from
left to right.</p>
<p>In other words, if one had previously released version 1.2.2, then released
1.3.0, a follow-up 1.2.3 is allowed, increasing the <code>1.2.x</code> branch version, but
not, say, 1.2.1, which decreases the <code>1.2.x</code> branch version.</p>
<p>Overall, semantic versions have been great for clarity of versioning of PGXN
extensions. The one bit of conflict comes from extensions that use some other
other version standard in the control file, usually a two-part <code>x.y</code> version not
allowed by SemVer, which requires <code>x.y.z</code> (or, more specifically,
<code>major.minor.patch</code>).</p>
<p>But such versions are usually compatible with SemVer, and because PGXN cares
only about the contents of the <code>META.json</code>, they’re free to use their own
versions in the control file, just as long as the <code>META.json</code> file uses SemVers.</p>
<p>For example, the recent <a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/nominatim_fdw/1.0.0/" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0: Nominatim Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL / PostgreSQL Extension Network">nominatim_fdw v1.0.0</a> release, which of course lists
<code>"version": "1.0.0"</code> in <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/nominatim_fdw/nominatim_fdw-1.0.0/META.json" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0 META.json">its <code>META.json</code> file</a>, sticks to its preferred
<code>default_version = '1.0'</code> in <a href="https://api.pgxn.org/src/nominatim_fdw/nominatim_fdw-1.0.0/nominatim_fdw.control" title="nominatim_fdw 1.0.0 nominatim_fdw.control">its control file</a>. The extension author simply
appends <code>.0</code> to create a valid SemVer from their preferred version, and as long
as they never use any other patch number, it remains compatible.</p>
 Versioning Alternatives 
<p>Surveying the versioning landscape in 2024 yields a number of approaches. Might
we prefer an alternative for future extensions distribution? Let’s look at the
possibilities.</p>
 Ad Hoc Versions 
<p>As described above, the Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-UPDATES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: “Packaging Related Objects into an Extension —&nbsp;Extension Updates”">file naming convention</a> allows ad hoc
versions. As far as I can tell, so does the <a href="https://www.r-project.org" title="The R Project for Statistical Computing">R Project</a>’s <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file" title="The Comprehensive R Archive Network: Writing R Extensions">CRAN</a>. This approach
seems fine for systems that don’t need to follow version changes themselves, but
much trickier for systems that do. If I want to install the latest version of an
extension, how does the installer know what that latest version is?</p>
<p>The answer is that the extension author must always release them in the proper
order. But if someone releases 1.3.1 of an extension, and then 1.2.1, well then
1.2.1 is the latest, isn’t it? It could get confusing pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Seems better to require some system, so that download and install clients can
get the latest version — or the latest maintenance version of an earlier
release if they need it.</p>
 User Choice 
<p>Quite a few registries allow users to choose their own versioning standards, but
generally with some very specific recommendations to prevent confusion for
users.</p>
 
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/versioning/" title="Python Packaging User Guide: Versioning">Python Packaging</a> is fairly liberal in the versions it allows, but strongly
recommends <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versioning</a> or <a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">calendar versioning</a>
(more on that below). 
 <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#VERSION-NUMBERS" title="CPAN::Meta::Spec: Version Numbers">CPAN (Perl)</a> is also fairly liberal, due to its long history of module
distribution, but currently requires “Decimal versions”, which are evaluated
as floating-point numbers, or dotted integer versions, which require
three dot-separated positive integers and must begin with the letter <code>v</code>. 
 <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#semantic-versioning" title="RubyGems Patterns: Semantic Versioning">RubyGems</a> does not enforce a versioning policy, but warns that “using an
‘irrational’ policy will only be a disservice to those in the community who
use your gems.” The project therefore urges developers to follow <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a>. 
 
<p>These three venerable projects date from an earlier period of registration and
distribution, and have made concessions to times when no policies existed. Their
solutions either try to cover as many legacy examples as possible while
recommending better patterns going forward (Python, Perl), or simply make
recommendations and punt responsibility to developers.</p>
 SemVer 
<p>More recently-designed registries avoid this problem by requiring some level of
versioning standard from their inception. Nearly all use <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">SemVer</a>, including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions">Go Modules</a>, where “Each version starts with the letter v, followed by a
semantic version.” 
 <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#semver-compatibility">Cargo (Rust)</a>, which “uses SemVer for specifying version numbers. This
establishes a common convention for what is compatible between different
versions of a package.” 
 <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#version">npm</a>, where the “version must be parseable by <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver" title="semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm">node-semver</a>, which is
bundled with npm as a dependency.” 
 
 CalVer 
<p><a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">CalVer</a> eschews context-free incrementing integers in favor of
semantically-meaningful versions, at least for some subset of a version string.
In other words: make the version date-based. CalVer-versioned projects usually
include the year and sometimes the month. Some examples:</p>
 
 <a href="https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle" title="The Ubuntu lifecycle and release cadence">Ubuntu</a> uses <code>YY.0M.MICRO</code>, e.g., <code>23.04</code>, released in April 2023, and
<code>23.10.1</code>, released in October 2023 
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/#history" title="Twisted Release History">Twisted</a> uses <code>YY.MM.MICRO</code>, e.g., <code>22.4.0</code>, released in April 2022 
 
<p>Ultimately, adoption of a CalVer format is a more choice about embedding
calendar-based meaning into a version more than standardizing a specific format.
One can of course use CalVer semantics in a semantic version, as in the Twisted
example, which is fully-SemVer compliant.</p>
<p>In other words, adoption of CalVer need not necessitate rejection of SemVer.</p>
 Package Managers 
<p>What about package managers, like RPM and Apt? Some canonical examples:</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager#Package_filename_and_label" title="Wikipedia: “RPM Package Manager — Package filename and label">RPM</a> packages use the format:</p>
 <code>&lt;name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;release&gt;.&lt;architecture&gt;
</code> <p>Here <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is the upstream version, but RPM practices a reasonable (if
baroque) <a href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/07/how-yum-and-rpm-compare-versions/" title="How Yum and RPM Compare Versions">version comparison</a> of all its parts. But it does not impose a
standard on upstream packages, since they of course vary tremendously
between communities and projects.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#standards-version">Apt</a> packages use a similar format:</p>
 <code>[epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision]
</code> <p>Again, <code>upstream_version</code> is the version of the upstream package, and not
enforced by Apt.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/APKBUILD_Reference#pkgver">APK (Alpine Linux)</a> packages use the format</p>
 <code>{digit}{.digit}...{letter}{_suf{#}}...{-r#}
</code> <p>I believe that <code>{digit}{.digit}...{letter}</code> is the upstream package version.</p>
 
 
<p>This pattern makes perfect sense for registries that repackage software from
dozens of upstream sources that may or may not have their own policies. But a
system that defines the standard for a specific ecosystem, like Rust or
PostgreSQL, need not maintain that flexibility.</p>
 Recommendation 
<p>Given this survey, I’m inclined to recommend that the PostgreSQL community
follow the PGXN (and Go, and Rust, and npm) precedent and continue to rely on
and require <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning">semantic versions</a> for extension distribution. It’s not
perfect, given the contrast with the core’s lax version requirements. <a href="https://calver.org" title="CalVer: Timely Project Versioning">CalVer</a>
partisans can still use it, though with fewer formatting options (SemVer forbids
leading zeros, as in the Ubuntu <code>23.04</code> example).</p>
<p>But with its continuing adoption, and especially its requirement by more recent,
widely-used registries, and capacity to support date-based semantics for those
who desire it, I think it continues to make the most sense.</p>
 Wrong! 
<p>I’m probably wrong. I’m often mistaken in one way or another, on the details or
the conclusion. Please tell me how I’ve messed up! Find me on the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a>

<p>Why? Because every module on CPAN has one and only one entry in the
index file. <a href="https://social.semiotic.systems/@rjbs/111971794172471384" title="@rjbs@social.semiotic.systems thread reply to @theory@xoxo.zone">Ricardo Signes explains</a>.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

  The song “Ripple,” by the Grateful Dead, never fails to move me. Here’s a live performance by the Dead, in 1980, on YouTube. My favorite version, however, is this one by KPIG’s Fine Swine Orchestra, recorded by Santa Cruz musicians sheltering in place during the pandemic. That’s a screen grab, above.

<p>I am pretty sure I’ve blogged about “Ripple” before, but can’t find evidence of that right now, perhaps because I published it somewhere obscure, or perhaps because we have <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task">entered the Enshittocene</a>.

 The Solvable Problems of Mobile&nbsp;KYC <p>Remember endless hours ripping your CD collection to digital…why are we spending endless hours scanning analog ID documents over and over again? Alternatives exist. Let’s think differently about how Mobile KYC fails customers</p><p>A recent thread on a work-oriented social platform caught my attention. Some people I know to be the people they are could not verify their profiles using a mobile KYC solution. This article isn’t to bash those solutions, or the myriad improvements made, but to urge our industry to understand the complexity we’ve foisted on our users and incite action to do different.</p>Analog to Digital Conversion, anyone? “Ripping IDs” to confirm identity should go the way of Ripping&nbsp;CDs… How do I know the problems that&nbsp;exist? <p>In December 2014, before a presentation to the <a href="https://www.idesg.org/The-ID-Ecosystem/Overview.html">Identity Ecosystem Steering Group</a> about how to “Bring the trust of the Driver’s license online”, MorphoTrust USA filed a provisional application that became <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10678939">US Patent 10,678,939</a>. The front-back-selfie wave was born, admittedly without the system of record connection described in that patent text. I spent several years leading a smart team improving an identity verification product&nbsp;line.</p><p>I’ve watched thousands of people try to run these selfie-to-DL matching steps in various forms and helped debug their issues with smiles, vision acuity, phone models, and lighting. I’ve spent weekends helping <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/with-afcu-onboard-utah-plans-selfie-enrollment-for-mobile-drivers-license/">hundreds of great Utahns use mobile registration live in a credit union&nbsp;lobby</a>.</p><p>Visually impaired people cannot get over these hurdles. It takes too many hands for these solutions to be inclusive. Back-facing phone camera quality varies greatly with how much you can spend. These solutions are not inclusive by any stretch of the imagination, and the fallback is to go to a physical location.</p> The Places Within the Selfie-ID Verification Process that&nbsp;Fail   Manually taking a quality, flat, well-lit, high-res picture of a card is&nbsp;hard  Taking an <a href="https://global.itu.edu.tr/docs/librariesprovider33/default-document-library/%C4%B1cao-standarts.pdf?sfvrsn=c9eea239_0">ICAO-quality</a>, well-lit, machine-matchable portrait is difficult. Everybody wants to smile (or make duck lips&nbsp;…idk…) in a&nbsp;selfie  Webcams are very low resolution compared to phones and vary&nbsp;widely  <a href="https://freeaamvapdf417generator.com/">PDF417 Barcodes</a> from the back of DL/ID cards are easy to generate and <a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/insights/risk-intelligence/2024-will-ai-break-content-based-identity-verification">nearly every Fake ID</a> has the same information on the back and&nbsp;front  Connections to databases that would verify the authenticity and validity of a DL/ID are expensive or restricted to law enforcement (makes&nbsp;sense)  Most hard-to-forge security features of an ID card require multi-spectral light, are tactile, or require magnification. Phones capture visible&nbsp;light  Cropping the card portrait results in a small, low-res photo for machine-matching that has security lines, holograms, and indicia through&nbsp;it  Cropping a portrait from a poorly captured, low-res ID card will not give sufficient resolution to measure the facial features for&nbsp;matching  You need cloud/phone processing power to determine that a human is live and real for the probe image — called <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2020/09/15/12_buschthieme-ibpc-pad-160504.pdf">Presentation Attack Detection</a>  I have to ID myself repeatedly with each new service that wants (notice I didn’t say “needs”) ID and each KYC system differs, creating&nbsp;doubt  <p>Can I stop here? We haven’t even gotten to the accuracy of biometric matching algorithms (new entries, if used, have solved any racial/gender bias, so lighting is the major hurdle to accurate matching). People think biometrics are 100% when a human visual verificdation is only ~97% (per a 2017 Google study that I cannot&nbsp;find).</p><p>Oh, did I mention that people end up with images of their IDs in photo rolls and synchronized to every app they grant photo library permission?</p><p>Humans are humans and will do what humans do using technology.</p>You simply cannot account for the variations people and machines will cause to happen (credit Jurassic&nbsp;Park)<p>If there are this many variables to a process that seems conceptually simple, one or more of those variables will go&nbsp;wrong.</p> We are turning away good potential customers <p>There are tremendous capture, scan, photo, and biometric matching systems out there from excellent, reputable vendors. The improvements in the decade since selfie matching started are incredible and laudable. This process is significantly easier and more accurate than it ever&nbsp;was.</p><p>Still, people sitting at their desks get turned away from having “verified profiles”. Now try taking a picture of your ID with one hand, holding your phone in the other, on a sidewalk balancing your potential rental scooter against your hip in bright, vacation sunlight. Ya,&nbsp;no!</p> Let’s go&nbsp;Digital <p>Mobile Driver’s Licenses (mDL) are now available to<a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/"> greater than 17% of the US</a> cardholding population. Adoption isn’t awesome yet because people don’t know they have existed in production for nearly 2 years and <a href="https://medium.com/@dkelts.id/mobile-driver-licenses-mdl-how-to-use-iso-18013-5-5a1bbc1a37a3">in concept for four-plus years</a>. ISO/IEC 18013–5 is solid and functional. The data is digitally signed by your Issuer but you control it. It provides a level of control over data and transparency into data-storage that users haven’t experienced for decades. There are <a href="https://mobiledl.us/verify/">verifier</a> <a href="https://www.oneproof.co/mdl">apps</a> and <a href="https://credenceid.com/tap2id">equipment</a> from multiple vendors. Places <a href="https://dld.utah.gov/mdlusage/">do accept&nbsp;mDL</a>.</p><p>In the coming months of 2024, ISO/IEC 18013–7 will add consented, selective-disclosure, digitally-signed mDL sharing to apps on the same device AND to websites over the Internet. (This will be the topic of a forthcoming post of mine.) So imagine sharing just your age to be granted entry to that website you don’t want your name associated with… or accurately filing for benefits without typing into a form. During the final approval stages, the ISO/IEC 18013–7 Technical Specification will be available for implementation.</p> Let’s Go Digital to&nbsp;Digital <p>“The first bank to replace their Mobile KYC with a connection to a Mobile Driver’s License is going to garner attention from the press and obtain new customers.”</p><p>It’s time.</p><p>The mDL provides digitally signed, matchable portraits upon consent as well as only the digitally signed data relevant for the approval. ISO/IEC 18013–7 will allow app-to-app consent and retrieval of mDL data similar to the way your email launches your airline application. It will also present a subset of mDL data to a website after consent for uses like age verification.</p><p>The challenge is made: Let’s short-circuit problems 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 above. Let’s make better self-registration and selfie-KYC solutions. Let’s work together on mDL acceptance.

<a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/" title="Fundamentals of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory">jobs to be done</a> of the ideal Postgres extension ecosystem might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These challenges and the interest and energy put into exploring new solutions
make clear that the time has come to revisit the whole idea of the PostgreSQL
extension ecosystem: to work though the jobs to be done, specify the tools to
do those jobs, and outline a plan for the broader Postgres community to design
and build them.</p>
<p>Future posts will dream up the tools and make the plan; today we begin with
the jobs.</p>

<p>This article shows how to use a CSP nonce in a Blazor Web application using the InteractiveServer server render mode. Using a CSP nonce is a great way to protect web applications against XSS attacks and other such Javascript vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>The code in this example was built using the example provided by <a href="https://github.com/javiercn">Javier Calvarro Nelson</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService">https://github.com/javiercn/BlazorWebNonceService</a></p>



 Services and middleware 



<p>The Blazor Web application is implemented using the AddInteractiveServerComponents for the InteractiveServer server render mode. The nonce can be used by implementing a nonce service using the CircuitHandler. The nonce service is a scoped service.</p>


  builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
	.AddInteractiveServerComponents();

builder.Services.TryAddEnumerable(ServiceDescriptor
	.Scoped&lt;CircuitHandler, BlazorNonceService&gt;(sp =&gt;
		sp.GetRequiredService&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;()));

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;BlazorNonceService&gt;();
  


<p>The headers are implemented using the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders package. The headers are added to the Blazor nonce service using the NonceMiddleware middleware.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(
	app.Environment.IsDevelopment(),
	app.Configuration["OpenIDConnectSettings:Authority"]));

app.UseMiddleware&lt;NonceMiddleware&gt;();
  


 Setup Security headers 



<p>The security headers CSP script tag is setup as best possible for a Blazor Web application. A CSP nonce is used as well as the fallback definitions for older browsers.</p>


  .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
{
    builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
    builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
    builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
    builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
    builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
    builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
    builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

    builder.AddStyleSrc()
		.UnsafeInline()
		.Self();

    // due to Blazor
    builder.AddScriptSrc()
		.WithNonce()
		.UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
		.StrictDynamic()
		.OverHttps()
		.UnsafeInline(); // fallback for older browsers when the nonce is used 
})
  


 Setup Middleware to add the nonce to the state 



<p>The NonceMiddleware uses the nonce header created by the security headers package and sets the Blazor nonce service with the value. This is updated on every request.</p>


  namespace BlazorWebFromBlazorServerOidc;

public class NonceMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public NonceMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context,

    {
        var success = context.Items.TryGetValue(
          "NETESCAPADES_NONCE", out var nonce);

        if (success &amp;&amp; nonce != null)
        {
            blazorNonceService.SetNonce(nonce.ToString()!);
        }
        await _next.Invoke(context);
    }
}
  


 Using the nonce in the UI 



<p>The BlazorNonceService can be used from the Blazor components in the InteractiveServer render mode. The nonce is applied to all script tags. If the script does not have the correct nonce, it will not be loaded. The GetNonce method reads the nonce value from the BlazorNonceService service.</p>

 Notes 



<p>Nonces can be applied to Blazor Web using the server rendered mode and the BlazorNonceService which implements the CircuitHandler. Thanks the <a href="https://github.com/javiercn">Javier Calvarro Nelson</a> for providing a solution to this. Next would be to find a solution for the AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents setup. You should always use a CSP nonce on a server rendered application and only load scripts with the CSP nonce applied to it.</p>

<p>As a cook, <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157627459328424">my Swedish mother</a> was best known for her <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/meat-25217/">Swedish meatballs</a>, an indelicacy now familiar as the reward for completing the big-box retail <a href="https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/finance/consumer/2018/08/28/ikea-design-store-experience">maze called Ikea</a>. Second-best was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpa">limpa bread (vörtbröd)</a> she baked every Christmas. She once won an award for that one. Maybe twice.</p>
<p>But her most leveraged dish was the breakfast she made for us often when my sister and I were kids: soft-boiled eggs over toast broken into small pieces in a bowl. It’s still my basic breakfast, many decades later.</p>
<p>Mine, above, are different in three small ways:</p>
 
 I cut the toast into small squares with a big kitchen knife. (For Mom the toast was usually white bread, which was the only thing most grocery stores sold, or so it seemed, back in the 1950s. I lean toward Jewish rye, sourdough, ciabatta, anything not sweet.) 
 Mom boiled the eggs for three minutes. I poach mine. That’s a skill I learned from my wife. Much simpler. Put the eggs for a second or two into the boiling water, take them out, and then break them into the same water. (Putting them in first helps keep them intact.) Make sure the water has some salt in it, so the eggs hold their shape. Pull them out with a slotted spoon when the white gets somewhat firm and the yolk is still runny. Lay them on the toast. 
 I season them with a bit of hot sauce: sriracha, Tapatio, Cholula, whatever. That way they look like this before I chow them down— 
 
<p></p>
<p>The hot sauce also makes the coffee taste better for some reason.</p>
<p>Thus endeth the first—and perhaps last and only—recipe post on this blog.</p>

<p><br>
On April 4, 1968, when I learned with the rest of the world that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">assassinated</a>, I immediately thought that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">civil rights movement</a>, which King had led, had just been set back by fifty years. I was wrong about that. It ended right then (check that last link). Almost fifty-six years have passed since that assassination, and the cause still has a long way to go: far longer than what MLK and the rest of us had imagined before he was killed.</p>
<p>Also, since MLK was the world’s leading activist for peace and nonviolence, those movements were set back as well. (Have they moved? How much? I don’t have answers. Maybe some of you do.)</p>
<p>I was twenty years old when MLK and RFK were killed, and a junior at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_College">Guilford College</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony_of_peace">Quaker</a> institution in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina.</a> Greensboro was a hotbed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Rights_Center_and_Museum">civil rights activism</a> and strife at the time (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Greensboro_uprising">occasionally</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_massacre">since</a>). I was an activist of sorts back then as well, both for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. But being an activist, and having moral sympathies of one kind or another, are far less effective in the absence of leadership than they are when leadership is there, and strong.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny">&nbsp;Alexei Navalny</a> was one of those leaders. He moved into the past tense today: (1976-2024).&nbsp;His parentheses closed in an Arctic Russian prison. He was only 47 years old. At age 44 he was poisoned—an obvious assassination attempt—and survived, thanks to medical treatment in Germany. He was imprisoned in 2021 after he returned to Russia, and… well, you can read the rest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny#Imprisonment">here</a>. Since Navalny was the leading advocate of reform in Russia and opposed Vladimir Putin’s one-man rule of the country, Putin wanted him dead. So now Navalny is gone, and with it much hope of reform.</p>
<p>Not every assassination is motivated by those opposed to a cause. Some assassins are just nuts. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley_Jr.">John Hinkley Jr.</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_David_Chapman">Mark David Chapman</a>, for example. Hinkley failed to kill Ronald Reagan, and history moved right along. But Chapman succeeded in killing John Lennon, and silence from that grave has persisted ever since.</p>
<p>My point is that assassination works. For causes a leader personifies, the setbacks can be enormous, and in some cases total, or close enough, for a long time.</p>
<p>I hope Alexei Navalny’s causes will still have effects in his absence. Martyrdom in some ways works too. But I expect those effects to take much longer to come about than they would if Navalny were still alive. And I would love to be wrong about that.</p>

    &nbsp;“Life

Michael Bassey Johnson,&nbsp;The
Oneironaut’s Diary 
 As
many of you already know, SAP has made public its plans on how SAP

 <p>&nbsp;“Life
begins like a dream, becomes a little real, and ends like a dream.”&nbsp;―
Michael Bassey Johnson,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/96258745">The
Oneironaut’s Diary</a></p>
<p>As
many of you already know, SAP has made public its plans on how SAP
IDM will be retired as a supported offering. I’ve been stewing on
this for a bit as I try to figure out exactly how I feel about this
and what needs to happen next.</p>
<p>To
be fair, I haven’t worked with the product much for just over four
years, and even then, I was working more with Version 7 than with
Version 8. My opinions are completely my own and do not represent my
current employer, any previous employer, or SAP.</p>
<p>While
IDM is certainly showing its age, there are some very good things
about it that I would love to see as an open-source offering. First
is the Batch Processing capabilities of IDM, based on the old MaXware
Data Synchronization Engine/MetaCenter solutions. It features some
powerful functionality to synchronize and cleanse data. It sets up
fairly easily and is quite easy to configure. I’m sure the
open-source community could do well with maintaining the UI (It
definitely should be JAVA-based rather than the old Windows MMC) that
will fit better in today’s Enterprise setting. Also, easy
integration with SaaS services is a needed upgrade.</p>
<p>The
other thing that should be released into the wild is the Virtual
Directory. It also provides powerful functionality for several use
cases, from pass-through authentication to assisting in M&amp;A use
cases. It’s the perfect example of a “Black Box” offering that
just works. It also makes it much easier to synchronize and cleanse
data by representing many different back ends via the easy-to-consume
LDAP standard.</p>
<p>It
saddens me that SAP is choosing to move away from IDM, as one of the
key selling points of SAP IDM is its ability to integrate seamlessly
with the SAP ecosystem. I hope SAP will help all LCM/IGA vendors
connect more easily with systems. SaaS integration should be easy or
standards-based, but we still need to be concerned for organizations
still using on-premises SAP tools.</p>
<p>SAP
has indicated that Microsoft’s Entra ID will be the main partner in
the future, but I hope they make this information open to all vendors
and that there will be continuing support of standard protocols.
This&nbsp;<a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101#:~:text=Maintenance%20for%20SAP%20Identity%20Management,a%20well-considered%20migration%20strategy.">article</a>&nbsp;gives
me some hope, but actions speak louder than words. I do have some
concerns that SAP, known as a vast software ecosystem that supports
itself and tends to ignore the enterprise, is handing off to another
large software provider whose management tools tend to support their
software ecosystem first and consider the enterprise second. Let’s
face it: most of Microsoft’s Identity and Access Management efforts
have been about supporting the Office 365 family of products. Don’t
get me wrong; it’s better than SAP in this regard, but it’s not
that high of a level to meet. For what it’s worth, I am guardedly
optimistic, but I always try to remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Finally,
I think it’s important to thank the IDM team in Sofia for all their
hard work over the years, which, of course, would not have been
possible without the vision and effort of the original MaXware team
based in Trondheim, Norway, and associated teams in the UK,
Australia, and the US. The production from these small teams helped
define what Identity Management is to this day.</p>
<p>Will
this be my last blog entry on the topic of SAP IDM? I don’t know.
Part of it will depend on if there are any moves towards the Open
Source world. There have been at least three times in my life when I
thought I was done with this tool, and deep down, I’m pretty sure
there is a little more in my future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In
the meantime, I hope to resume blogging more regarding the Identity
and Access Management field in the near future. Time will tell.</p>

Chris Locke found this on the Web in early 1999, and it became the main image on the Cluetrain Manifesto homepage. We’ve never found its source.
<p><a href="https://cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> will turn 25 in two months.</p>
<p>I am one of its four authors, and speak here only for myself. The others are <a href="https://weinberger.org/">David Weinberger</a>, <a href="https://cluetrain.com/rick.html">Rick Levine</a>, and <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2021/12/21/rage-in-peace/">Chris Locke</a>. David and Rick may have something to say. Chris, alas, demonstrates the first words in <a href="https://cluetrain.com/book/apocalypso.html">Chapter One</a> of <a href="https://cluetrain.com/book/index.html">The Cluetrain Manifesto in its book form</a>. Try not to be haunted by Chris’s ghost when you read it.</p>
<p>Cluetrain is a word that did not exist before we made it up in 1999. It is still tweeted almost daily <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=cluetrain&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">on X (née Twitter)</a>, and often <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=cluetrain">on BlueSky</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/search/?q=cluetrain">Threads</a>, the Twitter wannabes. And, of course, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=cluetrain">on Facebook</a>. Searching <a href="https://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> no longer says how many results it finds, but the last time I was able to check, the number of<a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=cluetrain"> books containing the word&nbsp;cluetrain</a> was way past 10,000.</p>
<p>So by now cluetrain&nbsp;belongs in the <a href="https://www.oed.com/">OED</a>, though nobody is lobbying for that. In fact, none of the authors lobbied for Cluetrain much in the first place. Chris and <a href="https://www.hyperorg.com/backissues/">David</a> wrote about it in their newsletters, and I said some stuff in Linux Journal.&nbsp; But that was about it. Email was the most social online medium back then, so we did our best with that. We also decided not to make Cluetrain a Thing apart from its website. That meant no t-shirts, bumper stickers, or well-meaning .orgs. We thought what it said should succeed or fail on its own.</p>
<p>Among other things, it succeeded in grabbing the interest of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB84487048080236000">Tom Petzinger</a>, who devoted a column in The Wall Street Journal to the manifesto.* And thus a meme was born. In short order, we were approached with a book proposal, decided a book would be a good way to expand on the website, and had it finished by the end of August. The first edition came out in January 2000—just in time to help burst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">the dot-com bubble</a>. It also quickly became a bestseller, even though (or perhaps in part because) the whole book was also<a href="https://cluetrain.com/book/index.html"> published for free on the Cluetrain website</a>—and is still there.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cluetrain"></a></p>
<p>You can’t tell from the image of the cover on the right, but that orange was as da-glo as a road cone, and the gray at the bottom was silver. You couldn’t miss seeing it on the displays and shelves of bookstores, which were still thick on the ground back then.</p>
<p>A quarter century after we started working on Cluetrain, I think its story has hardly begun—because most of what it foresaw, or called for, has not come true. Yet.</p>
<p>So I’m going to visit some of Cluetrain’s history and main points in a series of posts here. This is the first one.</p>
 
<p>*A search for that column on the WSJ.com website brings up nothing: an example of <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2023/08/18/we-need-deep-news/">deep news</a>‘ absence. But I do have the text, and may share it with you later.)</p>

Once you get the hang of writing these tests, it’s mostly boilerplate, so I figured my team of assistants could help. I recruited Cody, GitHub Copilot, and Unblocked — with varying degrees of success. Then I realized I hadn’t yet tried creating a GPT. As OpenAI describes them, “GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that users can tailor for specific tasks or topics by combining instructions, knowledge, and capabilities.”

  <p>In 2024, the <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-urges-nations-to-develop-sovereign-ai-infrastructure/">utility of words</a> yielding philosophical clarity that becomes embedded into the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/world-governments-summit/">design</a> of systems being deployed globally, and Nationally, yields methods that must be structured accurately in order to abide by the Sovereign systems they serve.</p><p>In America, people own root authority, or the Sovereign infrastructure does not confer accuracy for, of, by human use. Data is the life blood of AI systems. Data structure yields Sovereign results, and across our fast advancing world, inaccuracy deconstructs faster than accuracy builds accurately. The time has come for open transparent accuracy in the data structure of Soveriegnty itself to be laid bare, enabling the development of "Sovereign AI" upon foundations that serve people.</p><p>Many moons ago, this structural conversation began in the world of identity management. Professionally-deployed systems were challenged to confront inaccuracies in their modeling of human identity. Ubiquitously, people were no longer being conveyed structural constraints ensuring the structural accuracy of their root administrative authority over data systems of ultimate importance to their Sovereign participation and administration under well-founded laws that were crafted pre-tcp/ip, pre-digital data.</p><p>Identity systems have been challenged now for over 20 years to align their practices to the people they service. The work is not done. Self-Sovereign ID principles that emerged here on this blog, led to decentralized identity methods and practices advancing for developer use, and into general awareness by a population that is intensely interested in digital frontiers where their lives meet opportunity, security, and civil system integrity. The fire walls of Sovereign integrity, having been breached many times in consequential ways, started exposing their own structural deficiencies.</p><p>Enter AI: human identity that primarily exists in a database-driven system, and is founded on an old-era of physical presence, is now the domain of AI. Human beings can not compete structurally here, as AI derives utility that people provide, and far too often, provide ignorantly, without much personal insight or accountability for the structural choices conveyed upon them. Laws, as dependencies function, evolve at a much slower pace, and seem to lack insight into the structural underpinnings of identity silos that tcp/ip was advanced to break down and add utility too. Unfortunately, protections were not advanced with the same insight, and civil society is finding itself in a reactive mode, reacting to change like a surfer riding a wave, rather than a break wall securing civil participation in an AI-enabled society.</p><p>This is the moment. AI Sovereignty has a basic and tremendously important dependency in American civil society: people own root.&nbsp;</p><p>If the data structure of human participation in America does not convey this basic structural reality, then people do not exist in a civil society, as defined by founding documents, intent, and Constitutional reach. Work is underway on this vector, and as always, the resulting choices and structures advanced will yield the results being pursued. The question on the table being asked is simple: do innovators understand what it means in structural Terms to ensure that people own root authority?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/The_AI_Investor/status/1756949748752539731">"Own Your Own AI"</a></p>

<p>This article shows how to implement a secure upload and a secure download in ASP.NET Core using Azure blob storage. The application uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and also for access to the Azure Blob storage container. </p>

 Security architecture 



<p>The application is setup to store the file uploads to an Azure Blob storage container. The authentication uses delegated only flows. A user can authenticate into the application using Microsoft Entra ID. The Azure App registration defines App roles to use for access authorization. The roles are used in the enterprise application. Security groups link the users to the roles. The security groups are used in the Azure Blob container where the RBAC is applied using the groups. A SQL database is used to persist the meta data and integrate into the other parts of the application.</p>







<p></p>



 Setting up Azure Blob storage 



<p>Two roles were created in the Azure App registration. The roles are assigned to groups in the Enterprise application. The users allowed to used to Azure Blob storage are assigned to the groups. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The groups are then used to apply the RBAC roles in the Azure Blob container. The Storage Blob Data Contributor and the Storage Blob Data Reader roles are used.</p>







<p></p>



 Authentication 



<p>Microsoft Entra ID is used for authentication and implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget packages. The is a standard implementation. Two policies were created to validate the two different roles used in this solution. </p>


  string[]? initialScopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;
   ("AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken")?.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("blob-one-read-policy", policyBlobOneRead =&gt;
    {
        policyBlobOneRead.RequireClaim("roles", ["blobonereadrole", "blobonewriterole"]);
    });
    options.AddPolicy("blob-one-write-policy", policyBlobOneRead =&gt;
    {
        policyBlobOneRead.RequireClaim("roles", ["blobonewriterole"]);
    });
});

services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
    var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
        .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
        .Build();
    options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
}).AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p></p>



 Upload 



<p>The application uses the IFormFile interface with the file payload and uploads the file to Azure Blob storage. The BlobClient is setup to use Microsoft Entra ID and the meta data is added to the blob. </p>


  public BlobDelegatedUploadProvider(DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential,
    IConfiguration configuration)
{
    _tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential = tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential;
    _configuration = configuration;
}

[AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = ["https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation"])]
public async Task&lt;string&gt; AddNewFile(BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload, IFormFile file)
{
    try
    {
        return await PersistFileToAzureStorage(blobFileUpload, file);
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        throw new ApplicationException($"Exception {e}");
    }
}

private async Task&lt;string&gt; PersistFileToAzureStorage(
    BlobFileUploadModel blobFileUpload,
    IFormFile formFile,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:StorageAndContainerName");
    var fileFullName = $"{storage}/{blobFileUpload.Name}";
    var blobUri = new Uri(fileFullName);

    var blobUploadOptions = new BlobUploadOptions
    {
        Metadata = new Dictionary&lt;string, string?&gt;
        {
            { "uploadedBy", blobFileUpload.UploadedBy },
            { "description", blobFileUpload.Description }
        }
    };

    var blobClient = new BlobClient(blobUri, _tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential);

    var inputStream = formFile.OpenReadStream();
    await blobClient.UploadAsync(inputStream, blobUploadOptions, cancellationToken);

    return $"{blobFileUpload.Name} successfully saved to Azure Blob Storage Container";
}
  


<p>The DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential class is used to get access tokens for the blob upload or download. This uses the existing user delegated session and creates a new access token for the blob storage access.</p>


  using Azure.Core;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace DelegatedEntraIDBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential : TokenCredential
{
    private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquisition;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential(ITokenAcquisition tokenAcquisition,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _tokenAcquisition = tokenAcquisition;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    public override AccessToken GetToken(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public override async ValueTask&lt;AccessToken&gt; GetTokenAsync(TokenRequestContext requestContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        string[]? scopes = _configuration["AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken"]?.Split(' ');

        if (scopes == null)
        {
            throw new Exception("AzureStorage:ScopeForAccessToken configuration missing");
        }

        AuthenticationResult result = await _tokenAcquisition
            .GetAuthenticationResultForUserAsync(scopes);

        return new AccessToken(result.AccessToken, result.ExpiresOn);
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Download 



<p>The download creates a BlobClient using the user delegated existing session. The file is downloaded directly.</p>


  using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;
using Microsoft.Identity.Web;

namespace DelegatedEntraIDBlobStorage.FilesProvider.AzureStorageAccess;

public class BlobDelegatedDownloadProvider
{
    private readonly DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential _tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential;
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;

    public BlobDelegatedDownloadProvider(DelegatedTokenAcquisitionTokenCredential tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential,
        IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential = tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential;
        _configuration = configuration;
    }

    [AuthorizeForScopes(Scopes = ["https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation"])]
    public async Task&lt;Azure.Response&lt;BlobDownloadInfo&gt;&gt; DownloadFile(string fileName)
    {
        var storage = _configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("AzureStorage:StorageAndContainerName");
        var fileFullName = $"{storage}/{fileName}";
        var blobUri = new Uri(fileFullName);
        var blobClient = new BlobClient(blobUri, _tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential);
        return await blobClient.DownloadAsync();
    }
}
  


 Notes 



<p>The architecture is simple and has the base features required for a secure solution. Data protection and virus scanning needs to be applied to the files and this can be configured in the Azure Blob storage. The access is controlled to the users in the group. If this needs to be controlled more, the write access can be removed from the users and switched to a service principal. This can have both security advantages and disadvantages. Multiple clients might also need access to files in this solution and the security needs to be enforced. This requires further architecture changes. </p>

  <p>When a person is already logged into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">mastodon</a> instance, if they visit some pages on their instance associated with a user from another server, they are not redirected to the remote server because it is easier to interact with the remote user with their existing local session.  However, if a person without an account is just visiting or they have an account but are logged out, mastodon redirects them to the remote server presumably because mastodon doesn’t know whether they have a local account and visiting the remote server will have the complete and authoritative data for that remote user.</p>

<p>A welcome update to <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a> (included in 4.3.0-nightly) is a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/111908524315478487">warning</a> presented to visitors or logged out users before mastodon redirects them to a remote server for the original page.  The <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/b19ae521b7d28a76e8e1d8da8157e051e9d8de6c">code</a> for <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/27792">Add confirmation when redirecting logged-out requests to permalink</a> is particularly relevant to mastodon.social compared to other fediverse instances as mastodon.social has become a relatively big target for phishing.  It’s a good bet that if someone is navigating the fediverse that their account is on mastodon.social.  So, if an arbitrary victim is logged out of their mastodon.social account and visits a mastodon.social page belonging to the attacker, prior to this mitigation, mastodon.social would automatically redirect the victim to the attacker’s page which might be a fake login form to trick the victim into submitting their login credentials to the attacker’s site.  Unfortunately, a significant percentage of people will submit the form.</p>

<p>One could imagine mastodon.social maintaining a list of trusted servers for automatic redirects but that would be an undesirable hornet’s nest and it’s not a bad thing when web surfers are conscious of the trust boundaries on the web.</p>

This approach mandates continuous verification, strict access controls, and micro-segmentation, ensuring that every user and device proves their legitimacy before gaining access to sensitive resources. If we assume breach, then the only strategy that can protect the corporate network, infrastructure, applications, and people is to authorize every access.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">Zero Trust</a><br>Referenced 2024-02-09T08:25:55-0500</p></blockquote><p>The real world is full of zero trust examples. When we're controlling access to something in the physical world—beer, a movie, a boarding gate, points in a loyalty program, prescriptions, and so on—we almost invariably use a zero trust model. We authorize every access. This isn't surprising, the physical world is remarkably decentralized and there aren't many natural boundaries to exploit and artificial boundaries are expensive and inconvenient.</p><p>The other thing that's interesting about zero trust in the physical world is that authorization is also usually done using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml">Zero Data</a>. Zero data is a name <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">StJohn Deakin gave</a> to the concept of using data gathered just in time to make authorization and other decisions rather than relying on great stores of data. There are obvious security benefits from storing less data, but zero data also offers significantly greater convenience for people and organizations alike. To top all that off, it can save money by reducing the number of partner integrations (i.e., far fewer federations) and enable applications that have far greater scale.</p><p>Let's examine these benefits in the scenario I opened with. Imagine that instead of using a credential (e.g., driver's license) to prove your age when buying beer, we ran convenience stores like a web site. Before you could shop, you'd have to register an account. And if you wanted to buy beer, the company would have to <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">proof the identity of the person</a> to ensure they're over 21. Now when you buy beer at the store, you'd log in so the system could use your stored attributes to ensure you were allowed to buy beer.</p><p>This scenario is still zero trust, but not zero data. And it's ludicrous to imagine anyone would put up with it, but we do it everyday online. I don't know about you, but I'm comforted to know that every convenience store I visit doesn't have a store of all kinds of information about me in an account somewhere. Zero data stores less data that can be exploited by hackers (or the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">companies we trust with it</a>).</p><p>The benefit of scale is obvious as well. In a zero data, zero trust scenario we don't have to have long-term transactional relationships with every store, movie, restaurant, and barber shop we visit. They don't have to maintain federation relationships with numerous identity providers. There are places where the ability to scale zero trust really matters. For example, it's impossible for every hospital to have a relationship with every other hospital for purposes of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/building_an_ssi_ecosystem_digital_staff_passports_at_the_nhs.shtml">authorizing access for medical personal who move or need temporary access</a>. Similarly, airline personal move between numerous airports and need access to various facilities at airports.</p><p>How do we build zero data, zero trust systems? By using <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/06/ssi_interaction_patterns.shtml">verifiable credentials</a> to transfer attributes about their subject in a way that is decentralized and yet trustworthy. Zero data aligns our online existence more closely with our real-world interactions, fostering new methods of communication while decreasing the challenges and risks associated with amassing, storing, and utilizing vast amounts of data.</p><p>Just-in-time, zero data, attribute transfer can make many zero trust scenarios more realizable because it's more flexible. Zero trust with zero data, facilitated by verifiable credentials, represents a pivotal transition in how digital identity is used in authorization decisions. By minimizing centralized data storage and emphasizing cryptographic verifiability, this approach aims to address the prevalent challenges in data management, security, and user trust. By allowing online interactions to more faithfully follow established patterns of transferring trust from the physical world, zero trust with zero data promotes better security with increased convenience and lower cost. What's not to like?</p><p>You can get more detail on many of the concepts in this post like verifiable credentials in my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a> from O'Reilly Media.</p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">   </a>    <p>Photo Credit: We ID Everyone from DALL-E (Public Domain) DALL-E apparently thinks a six-pack has 8 bottles but this was the best of several attempts.</p>

<p>This article shows how to implement an ASP.NET Core Blazor Web application using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. <a href="https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-identity-web">Microsoft.Identity.Web</a> is used to implement the Microsoft Entra ID OpenID Connect client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8MeID">https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8MeID</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>Note: I based this implementation on the <a href="https://github.com/CrahunGit/Auth0BlazorWebAppSample/tree/master/BlazorApp4">example</a> provided by Tomás López Rodríguez and adapted it.</p>



 Setup 



<p>The Blazor Web application is an OpenID Connect confidential client (code flow, PKCE) which uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication. An Azure App registration (Web configuration) is used to create the client and only delegated scopes are used. A secret is used to authenticate the application in development. Client assertions can be used in production deployments. NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders is used to implement the security headers as best possible for Blazor Web. No identity management or user passwords are handled in the application.</p>



<p>The client part of the Blazor Web application can use the PersistentAuthenticationStateProvider class to read the user profile data.</p>



<p>This uses data from the server part implemented in the PersistingRevalidatingAuthenticationStateProvider class. See the code in the github repo.</p>



<p></p>



 OpenID Connect confidential client 



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication method is used to implement the client authentication using the Microsoft.Identity.Web packages. I use a downstream API to force that the client uses code flow with PKCE instead of the implicit flow. Microsoft Graph is only requesting delegated user profile data.</p>


  // Add authentication services
var scopes = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", scopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



<p>The client automatically reads from the AzureAd configuration. This can be changed if you would like to update the product name. The client uses the standard Microsoft Entra ID setup. You need to add the permissions in the Azure App registration created for this application.</p>


    "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
    "Domain": "[Enter the domain of your tenant, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com]",
    "TenantId": "[Enter 'common', or 'organizations' or the Tenant Id (Obtained from the Azure portal. Select 'Endpoints' from the 'App registrations' blade and use the GUID in any of the URLs), e.g. da41245a5-11b3-996c-00a8-4d99re19f292]",
    "ClientId": "[Enter the Client Id (Application ID obtained from the Azure portal), e.g. ba74781c2-53c2-442a-97c2-3d60re42f403]",
    "ClientSecret": "[Copy the client secret added to the app from the Azure portal]",
    "ClientCertificates": [
    ],
    // the following is required to handle Continuous Access Evaluation challenges
    "ClientCapabilities": [ "cp1" ],
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
  },
  "DownstreamApi": {
    "Scopes": "User.ReadBasic.All user.read"
  },
  


<p></p>



 Login and Logout 



<p>An AuthenticationExtensions class was used to implement the login and the logout for the application. The Login method is an HTTP GET request which redirects to the OpenID Connect server. The Logout method is an authentication HTTP POST request which requires CSRF protection and accepts no parameters. The return URL to the unauthenticated signed out page is fixed and so no open redirect attacks are possible. The login cleans up the local cookies as well as a redirect to the identity provider to logout on Microsoft Entra ID.</p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
namespace BlazorWebMeID;

public static class AuthenticationExtensions
{
    public static WebApplication SetupEndpoints(this WebApplication app)
    {
        app.MapGet("/Account/Login", async (HttpContext httpContext, string returnUrl = "/") =&gt;
        {
            await httpContext.ChallengeAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                new AuthenticationProperties
                {
                    RedirectUri = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(returnUrl) ? returnUrl : "/"
                });
        });

        app.MapPost("/Account/Logout", async (HttpContext httpContext) =&gt;
        {
            var authenticationProperties = new AuthenticationProperties
            {
                RedirectUri = "/SignedOut"
            };  

            await httpContext.SignOutAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, 
                authenticationProperties);

            await httpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        }).RequireAuthorization();

        return app;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Security headers 



<p>The security headers are used to protect the session. When using AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents mode, the script CSP header is really weak and adds little protection leaving the application open to numerous XSS, Javascript attacks. It is not possible to use CSP nonces with Blazor Web using the InteractiveWebAssemblyComponents mode, or I have not found a way to do this, as the Blazor Web components cannot read the HTTP headers in the response. A Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application can use CSP nonces and is a more secure application.</p>


  namespace HostedBlazorMeID.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(idpHost);

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");

                // due to Blazor Web, nonces cannot be used with AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents mode.
                // weak script CSP....
                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .Self() // self required
                    .UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
                    .UnsafeInline(); // only a fallback for older browsers when the nonce is used 
            
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();

                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains();
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>I am starting to understand how Blazor Web works and have difficultly with the session state and sharing this between different components. Some basic browser security cannot be used, i.e. CSP nonces. The mixed mode has strange UI effects which I could not clean up.</p>



<p>There are now four types of Blazor applications.</p>



 
 Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application 



 Blazor Server 



 Blazor Web 



 Blazor WASM standalone 
 



<p>Blazor WASM hosted in an ASP.NET Core application and Blazor Server can be secured in a good way using the recommended security best practices (OpenID Connect confidential client). Blazor Web can implement a confidential client but is missing the recommend script session protection. Blazor WASM standalone cannot implement the recommended authentication as it is a public application and should no longer be used in secure environments.</p>

thought it worthwhile to put together a brief presentation on the fundamental

of the <a href="https://justatheory.com/2024/01/tembonaut/" title="I'm a Postgres Extensions Tembonaut">new job</a>, I wanted to understand how <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a>
works. In this post I work it out, and think through how we might do something
similar for Postgres extension publishing. It covers the
<a>Go architecture</a>, <a>namespacing challenges</a>,
and <a>PGXS abuse</a>; then experiments with
<a>URL-based namespacing</a> and ponders
<a>reorganizing installed extension files</a>;
and closes with a <a>high-level design</a> for
making it work now and in the future.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a lot, mainly written for my own edification and for the
information of my fellow extension-releasing travelers.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating and learned a ton. Maybe you will too! But feel free to
skip this post if you’re less interested in the details of the journey and want
to wait for more decisive posts once I’ve reached the destination.</p>
 Introduction 
<p>Most language registries require developers to take some step to make releases.
Many automate the process in CI/CD pipelines, but it requires some amount of
effort on the developer’s part:</p>
 
 Register for an account 
 Learn how to format things to publish a release 
 Remember to publish again for every new version 
 Create a pipeline to automate publishing (e.g., a GitHub workflow) 
 
 Decentralized Publishing 
<p><a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/developing#decentralized" title="go.dev: Developing and publishing modules">Go decentralized publishing</a> has revised this pattern: it does not require user
registration or authentication to to publish a module to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Rather,
Go developers simply tag the source repository, and the first time someone
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/about#adding-a-package" title="pkg.go.dev: Adding a package">refers to the tag in Go tools</a>, the <a href="https://index.golang.org">Go module index</a> will include it.</p>
<p>For example, publishing <code>v1.2.1</code> of a module in the <code>github.com/golang/example</code>
repository takes just three commands:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
go list -m github.com/golang/example@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>After a few minutes, the module will show up in <a href="https://index.golang.org/index" title="Go module index feed">the index</a> and then on
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a>. Anyone can run <code>go get -u github.com/golang/example</code> to get the
latest version. Go developers rest easy in the knowledge that they’re getting
the exact module they need thanks to the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database" title="Go Modules Reference: Checksum database">global checksum database</a>, which Go
uses “in many situations to detect misbehavior by proxies or origin servers”.</p>
<p>This design requires <code>go get</code> to understand multiple source code management
systems: it supports Git, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, and Fossil.<a>1</a>
It also needs the <code>go.mod</code> metadata file to live in the project defining the
package.</p>
<p>But that’s really it. From the developer’s perspective it could not be easier to
publish a module, because it’s a natural extension of the module development
tooling and workflow of committing, tagging, and fetching code.</p>
 Decentralized Extension Publishing 
<p>Could we publish Postgres extensions in such a decentralized pattern? It might
look something like this:</p>
 
 The developer places a metadata file in the proper location (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a>,
<code>META.json</code>, <code>Cargo.toml</code>, whatever — standard TBD) 
 To publish a release, the developer tags the repository and calls some sort
of indexing service hook (perhaps from a tag-triggered release workflow) 
 The indexing service validates the extension and adds it to the index 
 
<p>Note that there is no registration required. It simply trusts the source code
repository. It also avoids name collision: <code>github.com/bob/hash</code>
is distinct from <code>github.com/carol/hash</code>.</p>
<p>This design does raise challenges for clients, whether they’re compiling
extensions on a production system or building binary packages for distribution:
they have to support various version control systems to pull the code (though
starting with Git is a decent 90% solution).</p>
 Namespacing 
<p>Then there’s name conflicts. Perhaps <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> and
<code>github.com/carol/hash</code> both create an extension named <code>hash</code>. By the current
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-FILES" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Extension Files">control file</a> format, the script directory and module path can use any name,
but in all likelihood the use these defaults:</p>
  <code>directory = 'extension'
module_pathname = '$libdir/hash'
</code>  <p>Meaning <code>.sql</code> files will be installed in the Postgres <code>share/extension</code>
subdirectory — along with all the other installed extensions — and library
files will be installed in the library directory along with all other libraries.
Something like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── hash.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── hash.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── hash--1.0.0.sql
    └── doc
        └── hash.md
</code> <p>If both projects include, say, <code>hash.control</code>, <code>hash--1.0.0.sql</code>, and <code>hash.so</code>,
the files from one will stomp all over the files of the other.</p>
 Installer Abuse 
<p>Go avoids this issue by using the domain and path from each package’s repository
in its directory structure. For example, here’s a list of modules from
<code>google.golang.org</code> repositories:</p>
  <code>$ ls -1 ~/go/pkg/mod/google.golang.org
api@v0.134.0
api@v0.152.0
appengine@v1.6.7
genproto
genproto@v0.0.0-20230731193218-e0aa005b6bdf
grpc@v1.57.0
grpc@v1.59.0
protobuf@v1.30.0
protobuf@v1.31.0
protobuf@v1.32.0
</code>  <p>The <code>~/go/pkg/mod</code> directory has subdirectories for each VCS host name, and each
then subdirectories for package paths. For the <code>github.com/bob/hash</code> example,
the files would all live in <code>~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/bob/hash</code>.</p>
<p>Could a Postgres extension build tool follow a similar distributed pattern by
renaming the control file and installation files and directories to something
specific for each, say <code>github.com+bob+hash</code> and <code>github.com+carol+hash</code>? That
is, using the repository host name and path, but replacing the slashes in the
path with some other character that wouldn’t create subdirectories — because
PostgreSQL won’t find control files in subdirectories. The control file entries
for <code>github.com/carol/hash</code> would look like this:</p>
  <code>directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Since PostgreSQL expects the control file to have the same name as the
extension, and for SQL scripts to start with that name, the files would have to
be named like so:</p>
 <code>hash
├── Makefile
├── github.com+carol+hash.control
└── sql
    └── github.com+carol+hash--1.0.0.sql
</code> <p>And the <code>Makefile</code> contents:</p>
  <code>EXTENSION  = github.com+carol+hash
MODULEDIR  = $(EXTENSION)
DATA       = sql/$(EXTENSION)--1.0.0.sql
PG_CONFIG ?= pg_config

PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</code>  <p>In other words, the extension name is the full repository host name and path and
the Makefile <code>MODULEDIR</code> variable tells <code>pg_config</code> to put all the SQL and
documentation files into a directories named <code>github.com+carol+hash</code> —
preventing them from conflicting with any other extension.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>github.com+carol+hash.control</code> file — so named becaus it must
have the same name as the extension — contains:</p>
  <code>default_version = '1.0.0'
relocatable = true
directory = 'github.com+carol+hash'
module_pathname = '$libdir/github.com+carol+hash'
</code>  <p>Note the <code>directory</code> parameter, which must match <code>MODULEDIR</code> from the
<code>Makefile</code>, so that <code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> can find the SQL files. Meanwhile,
<code>module_pathname</code> ensures that the library file has a unique name — the same
as the long extension name — again to avoid conflicts with other projects.</p>
<p>That unsightly naming extends to SQL: using the URL format could get to be a
mouthful:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Which is do-able, but some new SQL syntax might be useful, perhaps something
like:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com+carol+hash";
</code>  <p>Or, if we’re gonna really go for it, use slashes after all!</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash";
</code>  <p>Want to use both extensions but they have conflicting objects (e.g., both create
a “hash” data type)? Put them into separatre schemas (assuming
<code>relocatable = true</code> in the control file):</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/carol/hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION hash FROM "github.com/bob/hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
);
</code>  <p>Of course it would be nice if PostgreSQL added support for something like
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/LNPLS/packages.htm" title="Oracle Docs: PL/SQL Packages">Oracle packages</a>, but using schemas in the meantime may be sufficient.</p>
<p>Clearly we’re getting into changes to the PostgreSQL core, so put that aside and
we can just use long names for creating, modifying, and dropping extensions, but
not necessarily otherwise:</p>
  <code>CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+carol+hash" WITH SCHEMA carol;
CREATE EXTENSION "github.com+bob+hash" WITH SCHEMA bob;
CREATE EXTENSION "gitlab.com+barack+kicker_type";
CREATE TABLE try (
    h1 carol.hash,
    h2 bob.hash
    kt kicker
);
</code>   Namespacing Experiment 
<p>To confirm that this approach might work, I committed <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/commit/24134fd" title="pg-semver@24134fd: Use domain-qualified name for extension">24134fd</a> and pushed it in
the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/tree/namespace-experiment" title="pg_semver@namespace-experiment: Experimental branch to try naming an extension with a source code repository URL similar to Go packages">namespace-experiment</a> branch of <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">the semver extension</a>. This commit changes
the extension name from <code>semver</code> to <code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, and follows
the above steps to ensure that its files are installed with that name.</p>
<p>Abusing the Postgres extension installation infrastructure like this does
work, but suffers from a number of drawbacks, including:</p>
 
 The extension name is super long, as before, but now so too are the files in
the repository (as opposed to the installer renaming them on install). The
shared library file has to have the long name, so therefore does the <code>.c</code>
source file. The SQL files must all start with
<code>github.com+theory+pg-semver</code>, although I skipped that bit in this commit;
instead the <code>Makefile</code> generates just one from <code>sql/semver.sql</code>. 
 Any previous installation of the <code>semver</code> type would remain unchanged, with
no upgrade path. Changing an extension’s name isn’t a great idea. 
 
<p>I could probably script renaming and modifying file contents like this and make
it part of the build process, but it starts to get complicated. We could also
modify installers to make the changes, but there are a bunch of moving parts
they would have to compensate for, and given how dynamic this can be (e.g., the
semver <code>Makefile</code> reads the extension name from <code>META.json</code>), we would rapidly
enter the territory of edge case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole" title="Wikipedia: “Whac-A-Mole”">whac-a-mole</a>. I suspect it’s simply too
error-prone.</p>
 Proposal: Update Postgres Extension Packaging 
<p>Perhaps the Go directory pattern could inspire a similar model in Postgres,
eliminating the namespace issue by teaching the Postgres extension
infrastructure to include all but one of the files for an extension in a
single directory. In other words, rather than files distributed like so for
semver:</p>
 <code>pgsql
├── lib
│   └── semver.so
└── share
    └── extension
    │   └── semver.control
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.1.sql
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
    └── doc
        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Make it more like this:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── lib
                    │   └── semver.so
                    └── sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    │   └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── doc
                        └── semver.md
</code> <p>Or perhaps:</p>
 <code>pgsql
└── share
    └── extension
        └── github.com
            └── theory
                └── pg-semver
                    └── extension.control
                    └── semver.so
                    └── semver--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver--0.32.0--0.32.1.sql
                    └── semver.md
</code> <p>The idea is to copy the files exactly as they’re stored in or compiled in the
repository. Meanwhile, the new <code>semver.name</code> file — the only relevant file
stored outside the extension module directory — simply points to that path:</p>
  <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver
</code>  <p>Then for <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver</code>, Postgres reads <code>semver.name</code> and knows where
to find all the files to load the extension.</p>
<p>This configuration would require updates to the control file, now named
<code>extension.control</code>, to record the full package name and appropriate locations.
Add:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/theory/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>This pattern could also allow aliasing. Say we try to install a different
<code>semver</code> extension from <code>github.com/example/semver</code>. This is in its
<code>extension.control</code> file:</p>
  <code>name = 'semver'
package = 'github.com/example/pg-semver'
</code>  <p>The installer detects that <code>semver.name</code> already exists for a different package
and raises an error. The user could then give it a different name by running
something like:</p>
  <code>make install ALIAS_EXTENSION_NAME=semver2
</code>  <p>This would add <code>semver2.name</code> right next to <code>semver.name</code>, and its contents
would contain <code>github.com/example/semver</code>, where all of its files are installed.
This would allow <code>CREATE EXTENSION semver2</code> to load the it without issue
(assuming no object conflicts, hopefully resolved by relocate-ability).</p>
<p>I realize a lot of extensions with libraries could wreak some havoc on the
library resolver having to search so many library directories, but perhaps
there’s some way around that as well? Curious what techniques experienced C
developers might have adopted.</p>
 Back to Decentralized Publishing 
<p>An updated installed extension file structure would be nice, and is surely worth
a discussion, but even if it shipped in Postgres 20, we need an updated
extension ecosystem today, to work well with all supported versions of Postgres.
So let’s return to the idea of decentralized publishing without such changes.</p>
<p>I can think of two pieces that’d be required to get Go-style decentralized
extension publishing to work with the current infrastructure.</p>
 Module Uniqueness 
<p>The first is to specify a new metadata field to be unique for the entire index,
and which would contain the repository path. Call it <code>module</code>, after Go (a
single Git repository can have multiple modules). In <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/" title="PGXN Meta Spec - The PGXN distribution metadata specification">PGXN Meta Spec</a>-style JSON
it’d look something like this:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/theory/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Switch from the PGXN-style uniqueness on the distribution name (usually the name
of the extension) and let the module be globally unique. This would allow
another party to release an extension with the same name. Even a fork where only
the <code>module</code> is changed:</p>
  <code>{
    "module": "github.com/example/pg-semver",
    "version": "0.32.1",
    "provides": {
      "semver": {
         "abstract": "A semantic version data type",
      }
    }
}
</code>  <p>Both would be indexed and appear under the module name, and both would be
find-able by the provided extension name, <code>semver</code>.</p>
<p>Where that name must still be unique is in a given install. In other words,
while <code>github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> and <code>github.com/example/pg-semver</code> both
exist in the index, the <code>semver</code> extension can be installed from only one of
them in a given Postgres system, where the extension name <code>semver</code> defines its
uniqueness.</p>
<p>This pattern would allow for much more duplication of ideas while preserving the
existing per-cluster namespacing. It also allows for a future Postgres release
that supports something like the flexible per-cluster packaging as described
above.<a>2</a></p>
 Extension Toolchain App 
<p>The second piece is an extension management application that understands all
this stuff and makes it possible. It would empower both extension development
workflows — including testing, metadata management, and releasing — and
extension user workflows — finding, downloading, building, and installing.</p>
<p>Stealing from Go, imagine a developer making a release with something like this:</p>
  <code>git tag v1.2.1 -sm 'Tag v1.2.1'
git push --tags
pgmod list -m github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1
</code>  <p>The creatively named <code>pgmod</code> tells the registry to index the new version
directly from its Git repository. Thereafter anyone can find it and install it
with:</p>
 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver@v1.2.1</code> — installs the specified version 
 <code>pgmod get github.com/theory/pg-semver</code> — installs the latest version 
 <code>pgmod get semver</code> — installs the latest version or shows a list of
matching modules to select from 
 
<p>Any of these would fail if the cluster already has an extension named <code>semver</code>
with a different module name. But with something like the updated extension
installation locations in a future version of Postgres, that limitation could be
loosened.</p>
 Challenges 
<p>Every new idea comes with challenges, and this little thought experiment is no
exception. Some that immediately occur to me:</p>
 
 Not every extension can be installed directly from its repository. Perhaps
the metadata could include a download link for a tarball with the results of
any pre-release execution? 
 Adoption of a new CLI could be tricky. It would be useful to include the
functionality in existing tools people already use, like <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx" title="pgrx is a framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions in Rust and strives to be as idiomatic and safe as possible">pgrx</a>. 
 Updating the uniqueness constraint in existing systems like <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> might be
a challenge. Most record the repository info in the <a href="https://pgxn.org/spec/#resources">resources META.json
object</a>, so it would be do-able to adapt into a new META format, either
on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> itself or in a new registry, should we choose to build one. 
 Getting everyone to standardize on standardized versioning tags might take
some effort. Go had the benefit of controlling its entire toolchain, while
Postgres extension versioning and release management has been all over the
place. However <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PGXN — PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> long ago standardized on <a href="https://semver.org" title="Semantic Versioning 2.0.0">semantic versioning</a> and
those who have released extensions on PGXN have had few issues (one can
still use other version formats in the control file, for better or worse). 
 Some PGXN distributions have shipped different versions of extensions in a
single release, or the same version as in other releases. The release
version of the overall package (repository, really) would have to become
canonical. 
 
<p>I’m sure there are more, I just thought of these offhand. What have you thought
of? Post ’em if you got ’em   in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres
Slack</a>, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> or via email.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Or does it? Yes, it does. Although the Go CLI downloads most
public modules from a <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol" title="Go Modules Reference: GOPROXY protocol">module proxy server</a> like <code>proxy.golang.org</code>, it
still must know how to <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#vcs" title="Go Modules Reference: Version control systems">download modules from a version control system</a> when
a proxy is not available.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Assuming, of course, that if and when the Postgres core
adopts more bundled packaging that they’d use the same naming convention as
we have in the broader ecosystem. Not a perfectly safe assumption, but given
the Go precedent and wide adoption of host/path-based projects, it seems
sound.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Over on the <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/">PGXN Blog</a> I’ve <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/741049567045468160/pgxn-tools-v4" title="PGXN Blog: “PGXN Tools Docker Image Updated”">posted a brief update</a> on recent bug fixes and
improvements to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn-tools Docker image</a>, which is used fairly widely these
days to test, bundle, and release Postgres extensions to <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>. This fix is
especially important for Git repositories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>v1.4.1 fixes an issue where <code>git archive</code> was never actually used to build a
release zip archive. This changed at some point without noticing due to the
introduction of the <code>safe.directory</code> configuration in recent versions of Git.
Inside the container the directory was never trusted, and the <code>pgxn-bundle</code>
command caught the error, decided it wasn’t working with a Git repository, and
used the <code>zip</code> command, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also posted a <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/93c93571200aad02e93170c6d2c93cbe" title="PGXN distributions that contain a .git directory">gist listing PGXN distributions with a <code>.git</code> directory</a>.</p>

<p>I woke up with piles of boxes filling one end of my living room. They’d been there since last weekend when I hauled them up from the basement and down from the third floor. Given our recent investigations into fascia, the psyche, and computation, perhaps the physicality of my cardboard wrangling was a subconscious tactic to help me process the loss. Contained within an assemblage of Playmobil, YA fantasy novels, vintage ephemera, and yellowed diplomas were the remaining belongings of two-thirds of my tiny nuclear family. At 8:30am movers were scheduled to arrive to whisk everything to storage, so I made sure to be up and out of the house early. Everything was organized and labelled with notes for my husband on what was to go, and which items were to be relocated in the house. It’s what moms do, right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The night before I tucked away “Piggy,” my child’s beloved stuff animal companion, threadbare again after one flesh-colored terry cloth “chest” transplant. I gave him one last big hug and placed him gently next to “Brown Wolf,” both of them atop a quilt of wild 70s prints made by my grandmother in the summer camp trunk covered with Dolly’s Dairy Bar stickers, a Brevard, NC staple. It is the end of an era. I wept softly and alone in the chill of the sewing room.</p>
<p>After I had a few years of parenting under my belt, I would proffer parents of infants this insight – no matter how terrible or how wonderful life is at any given moment, the one constant is change. Cherish the sweet moments and know that the miserable ones will pass eventually. It may seem like forever, but it isn’t. I still think it’s solid advice, though bittersweet all the same. I’ve come to accept the situation and scrabble for scraps of grace to get through another day until the house sells and I can start to start over. We are still human, right? Feeling all of the big feelings is part of the job description, and yes, I’m here for it.</p>
<p>While packing up some lovely textiles woven by my husband’s late mother, I came across a few concert t-shirts from back in the day when he wore army jackets and his hair longish and was a DJ for late night hardcore shows that aired on college radio stations. Me? I was pretty square, naive, knew very little of the world. We met during a study abroad semester in Venice. On foggy fall nights we would walk holding hands to the tip of Dorsoduro, past the Salute plague church, to “the point,” Punta Della Dogana – young love. There we would sit watching the lights edging St. Mark’s Square where the Canale Grande met La Giudecca, the deep channel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back then I had no conception of water memory, Neptune, &nbsp;psi, or waves of consciousness. Unseen from street level, Atlas and Fortuna kept watch over the point, the latter holding a rudder aloft showing the direction of the wind, and our fate. I can look back and see my course was set when I was just a callow child off on a big adventure that would eventually sweep me to the City of Brotherly Love nestled between the Delaware and the Schuylkill, and then on, apparently, to the very different burbling 4,000-year-old waters of the Ozarks.</p>
<p>A few years back, my friend Dru shared with me the Chinese parable of the man who lost his horse. The gist was that when something happens in our lives that is apparently good or apparently bad, it is best to keep a neutral outlook, because the good might lead to the bad, or the bad to the good. Life cycles up and down. That our lives together started out under the globe of the heavens held by two atlas figures topped by a seventeenth century statue of Fortune charting human weather, commerce, navigation, bureaucratic systems…it’s quite a perfect summation of the tapestry I’ve been weaving without quite being aware of it until now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Good? Bad? I guess I shall stay the course and see what comes next and try to hold onto my sense of wonder and playfulness as the trickster energy bubbles up around me.</p>
<p>I texted my soon-to-be-ex-husband a picture of “Misfits: Legacy of Brutality,” saying it seems the tables have turned. Now he’s an institutional administrator while I’ve gradually slid over into the outlier spot. Earlier in the process of letting go I spent a few days sifting through drawers of old cards and letters and report cards and crayon drawings, the fleeting realms of moms. Back then I was still a beloved wife and mother and daughter. The cards said so, at least. Now, I am an out-of-tune, dissonant dissident in a world rushing obliviously forward. Only a handful of people seem to be able to see and comprehend the layers of logic protocols and invisible sensors bathing us in invisible harmonic frequencies and smart cybernetic governance to tap into our soulful connection to the divine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the world my child will navigate. Capably, I have no doubt. </p>
<p>And me? I will watch the phase shift coalesce from the sidelines. If I’m lucky I will view the etheric confluence barefoot peeking over a bed of glorious rainbow zinnias with a tomato sandwich in hand, juice running down my forearm, and when the sandwich is done, I will put a kayak on my aging Subaru and point it towards the crystal clear waters of Lake Ouachita.</p>
<p>I have a memory of being in a circle of families. Our children were part of a semester school in the Pisgah Forest south of Asheville. We were about to entrust our precious ones to four months of expeditionary learning, which in retrospect wasn’t my best parenting choice but you do the best with the information you have at the time. One of the teachers read Khalil Gibran’s poem “On Children.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>Your children are not your children.</p>
<p>They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.</p>
<p>They come through you but not from you,</p>
<p>And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p>
<p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p>
<p>For they have their own thoughts.</p>
<p>You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p>
<p>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p>
<p>You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you.</p>
<p>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>
<p>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p>
<p>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with</p>
<p>His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p>
<p>Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness.</p>
<p>For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember being nonplussed and unsettled. I wasn’t ready, but we never are. I understand more about information fields and the divine creation and energy than I did then. My child did come through me, and settled so far, so far away, launched from breast milk, home cooked dinners from our CSA farm box, hand sewn Halloween costumes, art classes, bedtime stories, family trips, walks to the library, and kisses on the brow, even after adopting the habit of pushing me away in annoyance.</p>
<p>With everything in order, I headed out to get a leisurely breakfast at a restaurant that was about a twenty-minute walk from home just off the Ben Franklin Parkway, Mr. Electric himself. There was a steady rain washing away last week’s snow leaving craggy miniature mountains of ice chips languishing on the soggy drifts of leaves that didn’t manage to get bagged up during the fall – crystalline phase shift. It was a mild, drizzly rain, the kind that has a hint of the spring that is to come. There wasn’t much wind, and the misty droplets coated all the edges, plants and buildings with sparkly beads of water – billions of miniscule lenses abstracting and expanding the limits of the ordinary material world. It was magical.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ironically the umbrella I’d grabbed wasn’t my regular rainbow one, or even the boring black one, but another that was emblazoned with the UPenn Arts and Sciences logo on it. The past week or so I’ve spent some time learning about Mark Johnson, a philosopher from the University of Oregon who spent his career talking about the ways we use our body to make meaning in the world. You see, our intelligence isn’t just in our brains and the nervous system that keeps it jumping, it’s also in our body and the liquid crystal fascia is an amazing part of that system. Art, culture, creativity, sports, dance are all gifts we toss back and forth with the quantum field of our collective consciousness.</p>
<p>These goofballs really want to meld all of that with natural philosophy, STEM we call it now, to create a unified computational system. This goal of melding social and natural sciences extends back at least to Leibniz who sought to create a universal computer where the grace of the human soul might be leveraged to shine a light on the secrets of the cosmos. I don’t think it’s likely to work, at least not how they think, but I chuckled all the same that the umbrella I’d unthinkingly grabbed on the way out the door had a special message for me. I was walking away from the life represented by that UPenn logo and soon heading south into the unknown, and the water was there as my witness.</p>
<p>In his “Stalking the Wild Pendulum” Itzhak Bentov wrote of our lives as embodied information organizers, pattern seekers, and meaning makers. Bentov felt that as we make sense of the material world through our experiences, our epiphanies, heartbreaks, and joy, there are invisible tapestries woven on the warp and weft of psyche and biology. These complex works of art, infinitely varied, are gradually gifted to the universal mind upon the passing of our bodies. That vision really resonates with me, particularly in combination with Johnson’s theories about non-linguistic communication and the importance of art and culture and the movement of the body in carrying out that important work on both and individual and social level.</p>
<p>Stephers shared with me a fascinating paper about social systems and how we use artefacts to leave traces of ourselves on our environments and those traces then influence the behaviors of others. Our use of cultural artefacts to imprint our consciousness on the energetic fields of the universe that vibrates around us is similar to the concept of pheromones that coordinate the collective efforts of eusocial creatures like ants or termites. My sense is that Web3 hopes to make cultural artefacts calculable at scale, converting them into universal coordinating signals to coax digital harmonies from the remaining wild corners that are slowly being overtaken by silicon. I <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/dc9b79f81e2bb35bc4fce22d59dde62b#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1iU0kxa29DZA%3D%3D">mapped out some notes</a> on this in my Dallas Mythos map below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What follows are images from my walk to breakfast and back, with a slight extension of the route to the former GlaxoSmithKline US headquarters that has since been turned into a String Theory charter school. This embodied meaning making exhorts us to go out into the world, the real world and see what’s out there to be seen! For me, since everything turned upside down, I’ve felt inclined to stay close to home and disconnect. Maybe it’s not a healthy way to be, but for right now cocooning feels right. Still, when I go out with intention and my eyes open, the universe tells me stories and leaves me clues. No, not like I’m “hearing” things or “getting downloads,” more like I’m just aligned with the symbolic language of the universe and open to exploring in a wondering, wandering way.</p>
<p>First, I encountered&nbsp; a large puddle at an intersection. I paused for a few minutes watch the ripples of the raindrops and all of the rings that danced across the surface of the water. Bentov’s book spoke of information being stored in interference patterns. He described a three-pebble experiment where the ripples where flash frozen into a holographic information storage system in the water. In my case there weren’t pebbles, but dancing drops that captivated me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then just a half block down I had to stop again and take a picture of this surprising gift – a fish ornamented with spirals swimming through a colorful mosaic sea, as if to remind me that we don’t get to choose our river. We can, however, pay attention and find the best way to work with the flow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And after I finished my mushroom toast, all the better to get in touch with the mycelial elements, I came out of the restaurant and saw that in the chainlink fence surrounding the empty lot across the street someone had created an impromptu party cup installation, mashing the plastic into the gaps to spell out the word “HOPE” in crude, but very legible letters. I smiled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At this point I decided to go a bit further afield rather than head straight back to the house. I passed the Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which stands about a block and a half from the Catholic Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And between the two on a sidewalk above the I-676 crosstown highway was a pretty lame art installation of Ben Franklin with his lightening bolts and keys, all electrical potential and trusted cryptography and Metaverse portals. It’s all right there if you have the eyes to see it. In the background is the former GlaxoSmithKline building.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I knew I wanted to take a photo of the Zenos Frudakis 2000 bronze sculpture “Freedom.” Zenos is the name of an Old Testament prophet featured in the Book of Mormon, which is interesting since you can see the temple from the piece. The composition was inspired by Rodin’s “Gates of Hell,” in turn inspired by Dante, which can be found a few blocks further along the Parkway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’d seen the piece a few times before in passing, but I’d never stopped to look at it very closely. I was kind of shocked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The image conveys a person escaping the confines of the background block. For me, however, knowing the multiverse phase shift that is underway this “freedom,” especially one sponsored by a company working with Google Alphabet’s Verily on electroceutical development, feels a bit off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Could it be the animal skull at the base?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or the smirking cat staring out?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or an incongruous jester, which is totally out of keeping wit the rest of the piece?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The texture of the figures spoke to me of fascia – movement, communication through embodiment, fractal tissues, today glistening with water.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bodies at different scales embedded in their environment, a miniature twin tucked in one corner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt drawn to reach out and put my hand on the outstretched hand. It reminded me of my dad, whose hands were so big and the way his fingers would curl down over mine and give them a firm squeeze. I miss that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I headed west to go home there was a colorfully odd sticker on a metal plate. A ghost with rainbow balloons – the souls are with us in all of their photonic playfulness.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tucked up next to the retaining was of the highway was a clutch of pine trees with an abundance of small cones scattered on the pavers below, which I took as a sign that I should fill my pockets and proceed to Sister Cities Park.</p>
<p>It’s an uptight pocket park, managed within an inch of its life in that Disneyesque, public-private partnership, “don’t walk on the grass”, “we have the rights to all pictures taken of you here,” and “yes, you need a permit authorization to do anything fun,” neutered nature tamed and contained vibe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh, and this is the first time I noticed a wayside elucidating the fact that the site was formerly a pauper’s burial ground and execution site. Not sure how our Sister Cities, Tel Aviv among them, would feel if they knew. St. Peter in his alcove with his keys overlooks the <a href="https://crystalfountains.com/our-story/">crystal fountain</a> (based in Toronto). At the corner where the park met the sidewalk was Robert Indiana’s Latin take on his iconic Love statue. “Amor” commissioned in 2015 for the papal visit and World Meeting of Families.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course I wanted to leave a heart on the LED light fountain. Today’s kids don’t get swimming pools, just interactive splash pads. Who knows how that’s going to fit into stigmergic social computational artefacts once we’re all hydrosapiens. As I was laying down the pine cones the security guard hustled over. Now, it’s January and raining and no one but me is in the park, so she must have been inside watching me on some closed circuit cameras. She asked what I was doing and I replied what does it look like I’m doing? She said are those acorns? I said they were pine cones and just kept doing what I was doing. She turned and left saying I had to “clean it up.” I encircled the heart with needles from a few pine branches than had dropped in the storm and set an intention. Then I crossed over to the Cathedral. As soon as I stepped away she swooped in with a broom and dustpan to rid the park of my dissonant heart. But she didn’t pick up the actual litter under the bench even after I pointed it out. Then she and the other guard went and hid inside the closed cafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So I decided to make another heart. This one at the base of the Shakepeare statue outside the library – all the world’s a stage. I used rock salt left over on the sidewalks for the outline and filled it in with small magnolia pods and a few springs of yarrow that were unbelievably still a very cheery yarrow. I guess I should cut the security guard some slack. It is a spectacle after all, and she was simply playing her assigned archetypal role.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I went inside the library thinking that I would take a photo of the computer terminals in the children’s department that annoyed me so much when we made visits when my child was so little. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the beeping, jarring computer game terminals for toddlers were gone. Yay. I did see a display in the lobby that the public transit division wanted your daydreams, which is pretty creepy. I also had a long and rewarding conversation with the social worker who was manning the services desk in the lobby. I explained to her about social impact bonds and pay for success and blockchaining unhoused people (MyPass in Austin) and offered my theory that it was about biohybrid computing. She looked up Michael Levin on her phone and seemed genuinely interested, which gave some meaning to a morning that would otherwise have been rather bleak.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Three is such a nice number, so I decided to make a final heart on the fountain outside the Barnes Foundation – talk about the power of curated artifacts! I remember back to the lockdown days when a few of us did an esoteric tour of the Parkway and left some lovely crystals in the water. The water was turned off for the season, but there was a bit in one corner from the rain. This one was simple – not too much material around – twigs, sycamore ball fluff, an auburn oak leaf, and a smidge of pine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The rest of the way home was pretty uneventful. I stopped to dip my hand in the water of the PeCO electrical manhole cover – liquid portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I saw an acupuncture&nbsp;storefront with the sign for Still Waters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And a window with artwork that looked like a black and white concept game – the Niantic Pokemon Go version of digital “Playful Cities” in abstracted, quantifiable reality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And as I got to my house I saw my tree, that I will miss very much. In the city you only have room for at most one tree in the front. Ours was a thornless honey locust and we put it in when we bought our house in 1998. The past year or so the bark started peeling back and I noticed some larvae under it and I was worried for it. We had an injection put into the roots to stop the sucking bugs. A big hunk of bark fell off last year and I was very upset. But now six months later it’s healing up with new bark. You can still see the scarred place, but I want to believe it will bounce back, even in spite of all the incessant geoengineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am a Sagitarrius and we are rather mercurial, but as spring arrives I will try to remember the parable of the man who lost his horse. Good-bad, bad-good – we just need to practice swimming in the flow in which we’ve found ourselves. I hope you’ve enjoyed coming with me on this damp stroll through the city that I loved and that I’m leaving. I’m sure I will find new stories in new places to share.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Ideally, tools like GeoGebra and Metabase provide interfaces so intuitive that you rarely need to read the docs, and you can learn the software just by poking around in it. In reality, of course, we need those docs — and they still need to be excellent. But now, we’ll extract a new benefit from them. When we can partner with machines that have read the docs, and can look over our shoulders as we try to do the things described in the docs, we’ll turbocharge our ability to dive into unfamiliar software tools and quickly learn how to use them.

<p>Thoughts on Self-Sovereign Identity: A Systematic Review, Mapping and&nbsp;Taxonomy</p><p>I ran across a paper named <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5641">Self-Sovereign Identity: A Systematic Review, Mapping and Taxonomy</a>. It was published mid-2022 so it is not the most up to date for the topic but it is very interesting and still of high value. It’s a meta-study of four research questions about self-sovereign identity.</p>  RQ-1: What Practical Problems Have Been Introduced and&nbsp;Solved?  RQ-2: What Properties, Formal Definitions and Cryptographic Tools Have Been&nbsp;Used?  RQ-3: What Conceptual Ideas Have Been Introduced or&nbsp;Refuted?  RQ-4: When, Where, and by Whom Were SSI Studies Published?  <p>It spends a lot of text before the research questions on how it built the study objectively, criteria for the data, and criteria for the inclusion of the other research papers. Though interesting, it was not what compelled me in the paper. As you might imagine, it was the red meat of the paper, the research questions, that I really found most interesting.</p><p>You’ll find in the research question sections that it does a nice inventory of various papers and a description of what they cover. I found RQ-1 to be the most interesting as it covers a lot of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentation topics.</p><p>Of RQ-1 I found section 6.2 to be of special interest. It&nbsp;covers:</p> The operational facet is divided into two facets: VC and VP.<br>They are a collection of concepts related to the functional aspects<br>of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations. <p>And includes:</p>  Revocation  Decentralized Identifiers  Issuer Authorization  Delegation  Backup and&nbsp;Recovery  <p>RQ-3 is a short section and starts with an interesting statement that is probably less true today than when written but still holds a lot of&nbsp;truth.</p> ...that there is currently no agreement on a definition of SSI... <br>Our third research question is answered by an examination of <br>the literature’s debates on the SSI definition. <p>Though I appreciate RQ-4 and it makes sense in the context of the paper, I found the least value in its presentation. It did remind me of a relationship graph I created a number of years back except that my graph was on the relationship of the specifications at the time. The header image of this post is a small rendering of that graph. You can find the useful version at <a href="https://www.kumu.io/michaelruminer/vc-spec-map">Verifiable Credentials Specification Map</a>. Reader beware that the specification map I list was last updated late May of 2021 so it is not an accurate source of the state of specifications for today though many of the relationships it does show are likely valid. This is really a topic for a different day.</p><p>All in all, despite the relative age of the paper, the other papers it refers to are often still valid today in their intent and basic questions, agreements, and refutations. I think it is well worth your time to look at the research questions portions if interested in self-sovereign identity (a phrase that seems to be moving more so out of popular use) and verifiable credentials.</p>

<p>
I’ve happily used MS Paint as my basic bitmap editor since Windows 3, almost 25 years ago. Mostly I’ve used it to create images from screenshots, but that has suddenly become way harder. Formerly, when I’d cut a region, the now-empty region would display using the default white background. Now it displays a checkered background like so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Here is the procedure to refill the white background: </p>
 
 Switch the foreground color to white
  Use the Fill tool to fill the checkered region
  Then switch the foreground back to black.
  
<p>
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p>
Nope. It’s evidently an unintended consequence of a pair of new feature: layers and transparency.</p>
<blockquote><p>
To get started, click on the new Layers button in the toolbar, which will open a panel on the side of the canvas.”</p>
<p>
Microsoft also revealed today that an upcoming Paint feature is support for image transparency, which will add the ability to open and save transparent PNG files.</p>
<p>
During editing, users will notice a prominent checkerboard pattern displayed on the canvas, serving as a visual indicator and highlighting the transparent regions within the image.</p>
<p>
This ensures that when content is erased from the canvas, it is completely removed, eliminating the need to cover unwanted regions of an image with white fill.  </p>
<p> – <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-paint-finally-gets-support-for-layers-and-transparency">bleepingcomputer.com</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I never asked for these “long-awaited” new features, Paint is (or was) useful to me precisely because it only does the kind of basic bitmap editing I need when compositing screenshots. But I can opt out, right?</p>
<p>
Nope. </p>
<p>
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</p>
<p>
Nope. </p>
<blockquote><p>
This feature (layers and image transparency) seems to be introduced in September 2023 and doesn’t actually allow to be turned off.</p>
<p>
Doing what vengy proposes for each and every image being edited is a natural madness and will drive even the most sane person crazy.</p>
<p>
What worked for me was to uninstall Paint and replace it with a classic version:</p>
 
 Uninstalling can be done by simply right-clicking Paint icon in Start Menu and selecting Uninstall from context menu.
  
Classic Paint can be get from here or here.<p></p>
  
Download and install it.<p></p>
  
Go to Settings → Apps → Apps &amp; Features → More settings → App execution aliases.<p></p>
  
Toggle the switch to Off for mspaint.exe and pbrush.exe items.
  
<p>– <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1813858/microsoft-paint-selection-delete-gives-checkered-background">superuser.com</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Evidently people are willing to hack their systems in order to revert to a now-unsupported version that they prefer. As insane as it would be, I’m considering whether to become one of those people. Sigh. I guess 25 years was a pretty good run. </p>

<p>Last week, I informally shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/theory/898c8802937ad8361ccbcc313054c29d">Extension Ecosystem: Jobs and Tools</a> with
colleagues in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres Slack</a>. The document
surveys the <a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/">jobs to be done</a> by the ideal Postgres extension ecosystem and the
suggests the tools and services required to do those jobs — without reference
to existing extension registries and packaging systems.</p>
<p>The last section enumerates some questions we need to ponder and answer. The
first one on the list is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What will <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>’s role be in this ideal extension ecosystem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PostgreSQL Extension Network, or <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, is the original extension
distribution system, created 2010–11. It has been a moderate success, but as we
in the Postgres community imagine the ideal extension distribution future, it’s
worthwhile to also critically examine existing tools like PGXN, both to inform
the project and to realistically determine their roles in that future.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I here jot down some thoughts on the challenges with PGXN.</p>
 PGXN Challenges 
<p>PGXN sets a lot of precedents, particularly in its decoupling of the registry
from the APIs and services that depend on it. It’s not an all-in-one thing, and
designed for maximum distributed dissemination via rsync and static JSON files.</p>
<p>But there are a number of challenges with PGXN as it currently stands; a
sampling:</p>
 
 
<p>PGXN has not comprehensively indexed all public PostgreSQL extensions. While
it indexes more extensions than any other registry, it falls far short of
all <a href="https://gist.github.com/joelonsql/e5aa27f8cc9bd22b8999b7de8aee9d47" title="GitHub Gist: 🗺🐘 1000+ PostgreSQL EXTENSIONs">known extensions</a>. To be a truly canonical registry, we need to make it
as simple as possible for developers to register their extensions. (More
thoughts on that topic in a forthcoming post.)</p>
 
 
<p>In that vein, releasing extensions is largely a manual process. The
<a href="https://github.com/pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools" title="pgxn/docker-pgxn-tools: Test image for PostgreSQL &amp; PGXN extensions">pgxn-tools</a> Docker image has improved the situation, allowing developers to
create relatively simple GitHub workflows to automatically <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml" title="kv-pair extension CI workflow">test</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml" title="kv-pair extension release workflow">release</a> extensions. Still, it requires intention and work by extension
developers. The more seamless we can make publishing extensions the better.
(More thoughts on that topic in a forthcoming post.)</p>
 
 
<p>It’s written in <a href="https://www.perl.org" title="Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 36 years of development.">Perl</a>, and therefore doesn’t feel modern or easily
accessible to other developers. It’s also a challenge to build and
distribute the Perl services, though Docker images could mitigate this
issue. Adopting a modern compiled language like <a href="https://go.dev" title="Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go">Go</a> or <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software">Rust</a> might
increase community credibility and attract more contributions.</p>
 
 
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/" title="PGXN Client’s documentation">pgxnclient</a> is written in <a href="https://www.python.org" title="Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively">Python</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/guedes/pgxn-utils" title="PGXN extension development and release utilities">pgxn-utils</a>
developer tools in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.">Ruby</a>, increasing the universe of knowledge and skill
required for developers to maintain all the tools. They’re also more
difficult to distribute than compiled tools would be. Modern
cross-compilable languages like <a href="https://go.dev" title="Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go">Go</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" title="A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software">Rust</a> once again simplify
distribution and are well-suited to building both web services and CLIs (but
not, perhaps native UX applications —  but then neither are dynamic
languages like Ruby and Python).</p>
 
 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxn-api/wiki/search-api">PGXN Search API</a> uses the <a href="https://lucy.apache.org" title="A “loose C” port of the Apache Lucene™ search engine library for Java.">Apache Lucy</a> search engine library, a
project that <a href="https://attic.apache.org/projects/lucy.html" title="Apache Lucy moved into the Attic in June 2018">retired</a> in 2018. Moreover, the feature never worked very
well, thanks to the decision to expose separate search indexes for different
objects — and requiring the user to select which to search. People often
can’t find what they need because the selected index doesn’t contain it.
Worse, the default index on <a href="https://pgxn.org" title="The postgreSQL Extension Network">the site</a> is “Documentation”, on the
surface a good choice. But most extensions include no documentation other
than the README, which appears in the “Distribution” index, not
“Documentation”. Fundamentally the search API and UX needs to be completely
re-architected and -implemented.</p>
 
 
<p>PGXN uses its own very simple identity management and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication" title="Wikipedia: “Basic access authentication”">basic
authentication</a>. It would be better to have tighter community identity,
perhaps through the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/account/" title="Your PostgreSQL community account">PostgreSQL community account</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Given these issues, should we continue building on PGXN, rewrite some or all of
its components, or abandon it for new services. The answer may come as a natural
result of designing the overall extension ecosystem architecture or from the
motivations of community consensus. But perhaps not. In the end, we’ll need a
clear answer to the question.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Hit us up in the <a href="https://postgresteam.slack.com/archives/C056ZA93H1A" title="Postgres Slack/#extensions: Extensions and extension-related accessories">#extensions</a> channel on the <a href="https://pgtreats.info/slack-invite" title="Join the Postgres Slack">Postgres
Slack</a>, or give me a holler <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@theory" title="@theory@xoxo.zone">on Mastodon</a> or via email. We expect to start
building in earnest in February, so now’s the time!</p>

Prompt: “A panopticon in which thousands of companies are spying on one woman alone in the center with nothing around her.” Via Microsoft Bing Image Creator
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/patreon-attacks-law-that-keeps-platforms-from-sharing-your-video-views/">her latest</a>&nbsp;Ars Technica story, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/ashleybelanger/">Ashley Belanger</a>&nbsp;reports that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon">Patreon</a>, the widely used and much-trusted monetization platform for creative folk, opposes the minimal personal privacy protections provided by a law you probably haven’t heard of until now: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Privacy_Protection_Act">Video Privacy Protection Act, or VPPA</a>. Patreon, she writes, wants a judge to declare that law (which dates from the videotape rental age) unconstitutional because it inconveniences Patreon’s ability to share the personal data of its users with other parties.† Naturally, the EFF, the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, the ACLU of Northern California, and the ACLU itself all stand opposed to Patreon on this and have filed <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Stark-v-Patreon-Amicus-Curiae-Brief-12-20-2023.pdf">an amicus brief</a> explaining why.</p>
<p>But I’m not here to talk about that. I’m here to bring up the inconvenient fact that&nbsp;Ars Technica&nbsp;is also in the surveillance business. A PageXray of Ashley’s story finds this—</p>
 
 360 adserver requests 
 259 tracking requests

<p>—which it visualizes <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/arstechnica.com%2Ftech-policy%2F2024%2F01%2Fpatreon-attacks-law-that-keeps-platforms-from-sharing-your-video-views%2F?f=">with this</a>:</p>

<p>And that’s just one small part of it.</p>
<p>But will Ashley, or any reporter, grab the third rail of their employer’s participation in the tracking-based advertising business? Or visit that business’s responsibility for what was already <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the biggest boycott in human history</a> way back in 2015? The odds are against it. I’ve challenged many reporters to grab that third rail, just like I’m challenging Ashley here. In every case, nothing happened.</p>
<p>I never challenged Farhad Manjoo, but he did come through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html">exposing</a> The New York Times&nbsp;(his employer’s) own participation in the privacy-opposed tracking-based adtech business, back in 2019. <a href="https://pagexray.fouanalytics.com/q/www.nytimes.com%2Finteractive%2F2019%2F08%2F23%2Fopinion%2Fdata-internet-privacy-tracking.html?f=">Here’s a PageXray of tracking via that piece today</a>:</p>

<p>Better, but not ideal.</p>
<p>Five years ago this month, I wrote <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-your-privacy-hands-others-alone-you-dont-have-any">a column about privacy in Linux Journal with the same title as this post</a>. Here it is again, with just a few tiny edits. Amazing how little things have changed since then—and how much worse they have become. But I do see hope. Read on.</p>
 
<p>If you think regulations are going to protect your privacy, you’re wrong. In fact, they can make things worse, especially if they start with the assumption that your privacy is provided only by other parties, most of whom are incentivized to violate it.</p>
<p>Exhibit A&nbsp;for how much worse things can get is the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</a>. As soon as the GDPR went into full effect in May 2018, damn near every corporate entity on the Web put up a “cookie notice” requiring acceptance of terms and privacy policies that allow them to continue violating your privacy by harvesting, sharing, auctioning off and otherwise using your data, and data about you.</p>
<p>For websites and services in that harvesting business (a population that rounds to the whole commercial web), these notices provide a one-click way to adhere to the letter of the GDPR while violating its spirit.</p>
<p>There’s also big business in the friction that it produces. To see how big, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance">look up&nbsp;GDPR+compliance&nbsp;on Google</a>. You’ll get 232 million results (give or take a few dozen million).</p>
<p>None of those results are for you, even though&nbsp;you are who the GDPR is supposed to protect. See, to the GDPR, you are a mere “data subject” and not an independent and fully functional participant in the technical, social, and economic ecosystem the Internet supports by design. All privacy protections around your data are the burden of other parties.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s the interpretation that nearly every lawmaker, regulatory bureaucrat, lawyer, and service provider goes by. (One exception is <a href="https://hackylawyer.com/">Elizabeth Renieris</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hackylawyer">@hackylawyer</a>. Her&nbsp;<a href="https://hackylawyer.com/writing">collection of postings</a> is required reading on the GDPR and much else.) The same goes for those selling GDPR compliance services, comprising most of those 190 million GDPR+compliance search results.</p>
<p>The clients of those services include nearly every website and service on Earth that harvests personal data. These entities have no economic incentive to stop harvesting, sharing, and selling personal data the usual ways, beyond fear that the GDPR might actually be enforced, which so far (with <a href="https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/gdpr-six-months-and-counting/">few</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=57355d0d-5d3a-40aa-8665-8366dcc9bd5a">exceptions</a>), it hasn’t been. (See&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/07/03/without-enforcement-the-gdpr-is-a-fail/">Without enforcement, the GDPR is a fail</a>.)</p>
<p>Worse, the tools for “managing” your exposure to data harvesters are provided entirely by the&nbsp;websites you visit and the services you engage. The “choices” they provide (if they provide any at all)&nbsp;are between 1) acquiescence to them doing what they please and 2) a maze of menus full of checkboxes and toggle switches “controlling” your exposure to unknown threats from parties you’ve never heard of, with no way to record your choices or monitor effects.</p>
<p>So let’s explore just one site’s presentation, and then get down to what it means and why it matters.</p>
<p>Our example is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">https://www.mirror.co.uk</a>. If you haven’t clicked on that site already, you’ll see a cookie notice that says,</p>
<blockquote><p>We use cookies to help our site work, to understand how it is used, and to tailor the adverts presented on our site. By clicking “Accept” below, you agree to us doing so. You can read more in our cookie notice. Or, if you do not agree, you can click Manage below to access other choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don’t mention that “tailor the adverts” really means something like this:</p>
<p>We open your browser to infestation by tracking beacons from countless parties in the online advertising business, plus who-knows-what-else that might be working with those parties (there is no way to tell, and if there was we wouldn’t provide it), so those parties and their “partners” can use those beacons to follow you like a marked animal everywhere you go and report your activities back to a vast marketplace where personal data about you is shared, bought and sold, much of it in real time, supposedly so your eyeballs can be hit with “relevant” or “interest-based” advertising as you travel from site to site and service to service. While we are sure there are bad collateral effects (fraud and malware, for example), we don’t care about those because it’s our business to get paid just for clicks or “impressions,” whether you’re impressed or not—and the odds that you won’t be impressed average to certain.</p>
<p>Okay, so now click on the “Manage” button.</p>
<p>Up will pop a rectangle where it says “Here you can control cookies, including those for advertising, using the buttons below. Even if you turn off the advertising-related cookies, you will still see adverts on our site, because they help us to fund it. However, those adverts will simply be less relevant to you. You can learn more about cookies in our Cookie Notice on the site.”</p>
<p>Under that text, in the left column, are six “Purposes of data collection”, all defaulted with little check marks to ON (though only five of them show, giving the impression that there are only those five). The right column is called “Our partners”, and it shows the first five of what turn out to be 259 companies, nearly all of which are not brands known to the world&nbsp;or to anybody outside the business (and probably not known widely&nbsp;within&nbsp;the business as well). All are marked ON by that little check mark. Here’s that list, just through the letter A:</p>

<p>I’m a somewhat technical guy, and at least half of that stuff means nothing to me.</p>
<p>As for “managing” those,&nbsp; my only choice on that page is to “Remove All”. Does that mean Remove everything on that page alone or Remove all cookies everywhere? And how can I remember what I’ve had removed?</p>
<p>Obviously, there is no way for anybody to “manage” this, in any meaningful sense of the word.</p>
<p>We also can’t fix it on the sites and&nbsp;services side, no matter how much those sites and services care (which most don’t) about the “customer journey”, the “customer experience” or any of the other bullshit they’re buying from marketers this week.</p>
<p>Even within the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management">CRM (customer relationship management)</a>&nbsp;world, the B2B customers of CRM companies use one cloud and one set of tools to create as many different “experiences” for users and customers as there are companies deploying those tools to manage customer relationships from their side.&nbsp; There are no corresponding tools on our side.&nbsp;(Though there is work going on.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="http://projectvrm.org/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So the digital world remains one where we have no common or standard way to scale our privacy and data usage tools, choices, or experiences across all sites and services. And that’s what we’ll need if we want real privacy online.</p>
<p>The simple place where we need to start is this:&nbsp;p<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/11/privacy-is-personal/">rivacy is personal</a>, meaning something we create for ourselves (which in the natural world we do with clothing and shelter, both of which lack equivalents in the digital world).</p>
<p>And we need to be clear that privacy is not a grace of privacy policies and terms of service that differ with every company&nbsp;and over which none of us have true control—especially when there is an entire industry devoted to making those companies untrustworthy, even if they are in full compliance with privacy laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/">Devon Loffreto</a>&nbsp;(who coined the term&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22self-sovereign+identity">self-sovereign identity</a>&nbsp;and whose good work we’ll be visiting in an upcoming issue of&nbsp;Linux Journal)&nbsp;puts the issue in simple geek terms:&nbsp;we need&nbsp;root authority&nbsp;over our lives. Hashtag:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OwnRoot">#OwnRoot</a>.</p>
<p>It is only by owning root that we can crank up agency on the individual’s side. We have a perfect base for that in the standards and protocols that gave us the Internet, the Web, email, and too little else. And we need it here too. Soon.</p>
<p>We (a few colleagues and I) created&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/">Customer Commons</a>&nbsp;as a place for&nbsp;<a href="http://customercommons.org/home/tools/terms/">terms</a>&nbsp;that individuals can proffer as first parties, just by pointing at them, much as licenses at&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Common</a>s can be pointed at. Sites and services can agree to&nbsp;those terms, and both can keep records and follow audit trails.</p>
<p>And there are some good signs that this will happen. For example, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a> approached Customer Commons last year with the suggestion that we stand up a working group for machine-readable personal privacy terms. It’s called&nbsp;<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012</a>. If you’d like to join, please do.</p>
<p>Unless we #OwnRoot for our own lives online, privacy will remain an empty promise by a legion of violators.</p>
<p>One more thing. We&nbsp;can&nbsp;put the GDPR to our use if we like.&nbsp;That’s because&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng">Article 4 of the GDPR</a>&nbsp;defines a data controller as “the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data…” This means&nbsp;each of us can be our own data controller. Most lawyers dealing with the GDPR don’t agree with that. They think the individual data subject will always need a fiduciary or an intermediary of some kind: an agent of the individual, but not an individual with agency.&nbsp;Yet the simple fact is that we should have root authority over&nbsp;our lives online, and that means we should have&nbsp;some degree of control over our data exposures, and how our data, and data about us, is used—much as we do over how we control or moderate our privacy in the physical world.&nbsp;More about all that in upcoming posts.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/12/if-your-privacy-is-the-hands-of-others-alone-you-dont-have-any/">original version of this post</a>&nbsp;was published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/">Private Internet Access blog</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Linux Journal at the time were both holdings of <a href="https://londontrustmedia.com/">London Trust Media</a>. </p>
<p>Also, check out the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Privacy_Manifesto">Privacy Manifesto</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/">ProjectVRM wiki</a>. I maintain it and welcome bug fixes.</p>
<p>† This is an example of what <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> calls “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>” and Wikipedia (at that link) more politely calls “platform decay.” It’s a big trade-away of goodwill by Patreon. Says to me they must be making an enshitload of money in the adtech fecosystem.</p>

Despite the fact that the merchant has never met me before and has no knowledge of my bank, she blithely allows me to walk out of the store with hundreds of dollars of merchandise, confident that she will receive payment. I emphasized the word confident in the last sentence because it's core to understanding what's happened. In the past, these kinds of transactions required that the merchant trust me or my bank. But in the modern world, trust has been replaced by confidence.</p><p>We often mix these concepts up and I'm as guilty as anyone. But trust always involves an element of risk, whereas confidence does not. These are not binary, but rather represent a spectrum. In the scenario I paint above, the merchant is still taking some risk, but it's very small. Technology, processes, and legal agreements have come together to squeeze out risk. The result is a financial system where the risk is so small that banks, merchants, and consumers alike have confidence that they will not be cheated. There's a name in the financial services industry for the network that reduces risk so that trust can be replaced with confidence: an acceptance network.</p> Acceptance Networks <p>An acceptance network is the network of merchants or service providers that accept a particular form of payment, usually credit or debit cards, from a particular issuer or payment network. The term refers to a broad ecosystem that facilitates these transactions, including point-of-sale terminals, online payment gateways, and other infrastructure. Each component of the acceptance network plays a crucial role in ensuring that transactions are processed efficiently, securely, and accurately. This drives out risk and increases confidence. Acceptance networks are foundational components of modern payment ecosystems and are essential to the seamless functioning of digital financial transactions. Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover are all examples of acceptance networks.</p><p>Before the advent of acceptance networks, credit was a spotty thing with each large merchant issuing it's own proprietary credit card—good only at that merchant. My mom and dad had wallets full of cards for JC Penney, Sears, Chevron, Texaco, and so on. Sears trusted its card. Chevron trusted its card. But it was impossible to use a Chevron card at Sears. They had limited means to verify if it was real and no way to clear the funds so that Chevron could pay Sears for the transaction.</p><p>That scenario is similar to the state of digital identity today. We have identity providers (IdPs) like Google and Apple who control a closed ecosystem of relying parties (with a lot of overlap). These relying parties trust these large IdPs to authenticate the people who use their services. They limit their risk by only using IdPs they're familiar with and only accepting the (usually) self-asserted attributes from the IdP that don't involve much risk. Beyond that they must verify everything themselves.</p><p>Fixing this requires the equivalent of an acceptance network for digital identity. When we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">launched Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin network</a>1 in 2016, we were building an acceptance network for digital identity, even though we didn't use that term to describe it. Our goal was to create a system of protocols, processes, technology and governance that would reduce the risk of self-sovereign identity and increase confidence in an identity system that let the subjects present verifiable credentials that carried reliable attributes from many sources.</p><p>I've written previously about <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystems</a> that provide a framework for how identity transactions happen. Individual identity systems are built according to the architecture and protocols of the metasystem. Acceptance networks are an instantiation of the metasystem for a particular set of users and types of transactions. A metasystem for self-sovereign identity might have several acceptance networks operating in it to facilitate the operation of specific identity systems.</p> Problems an Acceptance Network Can Solve <p>To understand why an acceptance network is necessary to reduce risk and increase confidence in identity transactions, let's explore the gaps that exist without it. The following diagram shows the now familiar triangle of verifiable credential exchange. In this figure, issuers issue credentials to holders who may or may not be the subject of the credentials. The holder presents cryptographic proofs that assert the value of relevant attributes using one of more of the credentials that they hold. The verifier verifies the proof and uses the attributes.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d6a862b-3ed7-49da-872a-2d0bd818faab.heic">    </a>Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>Let's explore what it means for the verifier to verify the proof. The verifier wants to know a number of things about the credential presentation:</p>  <p>Were the credentials issued to the entity making the presentation?</p>  <p>Have any of the credentials been tampered with?</p>  <p>Have any of the credentials been revoked?</p>  <p>What are the schema for the credentials (to understand the data in them)?</p>  <p>Who issued the credentials in the proof?</p>  <p>The first four of these can be done cryptographically to provide confidence in the attestation. The technology behind the credential presentation is all that's necessary. They can be automated as part of the exchange. For example, the proof can contain pointers (e.g., DIDs) to the credential definitions. These could contain public keys for the credential and references to schema.</p><p>The last one—who issued the credential—is not a technical matter. To see why, imagine that Alice (as holder and subject) has been issued a credential from her university (the issuer) giving information about her educational experiences there. She's applying for a job and wants to present the credential to a prospective employer (the verifier). How does the employer know that Alice didn't just make the credential herself or buy it from a diploma mill?</p><p>Knowing who issued the credential is not something that can be done solely with technology (although it can help). The employer in this scenario wants more than an identifier for the issuer. And they want to know that the public key really does belong to the university. In short, the employer wants to resolve the identifier to other information that tells them something about the university and the credential. There are lots of ways to do that—people have been doing this sort of thing for centuries: states keep registries of businesses (universities are businesses), accreditation organizations keep registries of schools they've accredited, the Department of Education has registries of various institutions of higher education in the US, and so on.</p><p>The employer could make use of these by building its own database of university identifiers it trusts. And every time a new one shows up, they could investigate and add it to their registry (or not)2. But going back to the magic of the credit card scenario that I opened this article with, if every merchant had to keep their own registry of banks, the experience wouldn't be magical for me or the merchant. The financial acceptance network makes it easy for the merchant to have confidence that they'll be paid because they have not only technology, but processes, protocols, governance, and legal agreements that make the verification process automatable.</p> Acceptance Networks for Digital Identity <p>For some use cases, keeping your own registry of the issuers you trust works. But for many, it's just too much work and makes it difficult to make use of a variety of credentials. This kind of "localized trust" is unwieldy in an identity system that might involve millions of issuers and identifiers and credentials for billions or even trillions of subjects. I've written <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/metasystem">extensively about identity metasystems</a> and what they provide to help bridge the gap. This one, on <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">how metasystems help provide life-like identity for digital systems</a> is perhaps the most comprehensive. Acceptance networks implement metasystems.</p><p>An acceptance network for digital identity must have a number of important properties, including the following:</p>  <p>Credentials are decentralized and contextual—There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, a holder (identity owner), or a verifier. Verifiable credentials can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, or any set of trust relationships.</p>  <p>Credential issuers decide on what data is contained in their credentials—Anyone can create a credential schema for their use case. Anyone can create a credential definition based on any of these schemas.</p>  <p>Verifiers make their own trust decisions about which credentials to accept—There's no central authority who determines what credentials are important or which are used for what purpose. The acceptance network supplies the technical underpinnings for credential exchange and support protocols for automating the verification of credential issuers.</p>  <p>Credential verifiers don't need to have any specific technical, contractual, or commercial relationship with credential issuers—Verifiers do not need to contact issuers to perform verification.</p>  <p>Credential holders are free to choose which credentials to carry and what information to disclose—People and organizations are in control of the credentials they hold (just as they are with physical credentials) and determine what to share with whom.</p>  <p>You may be thinking "but these are mostly about decentralized decision making." While it would be easier to imagine the acceptance network as a big directory, that solution can't possible support all the different ways people and organizations might want to use credentials. That doesn't mean an acceptance network couldn't be run by a single organization, like some financial services networks. Just that it has to support a variety of credential ecosystems running common protocols. I also think that there will be more than one and most issuers and verifiers will be part of several (again, like in financial services).</p> Structure of an Acceptance Network <p>One of the things we can take away from the architecture of financial services acceptance networks is that they are built in layers. No one has thought more about how this can work than Drummond Reed and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Evolution-of-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-14.pdf">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> (ToIP).3 This figure, from ToIP, shows how such a stack works.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a05ffdb-511c-468a-a73a-edf99d54299c.heic">    </a>Trust Over IP Stack <p>The layers build on each other to provide something the lower level didn't. Layer 1 is the foundational functionality, like DID methods. Layer 2 builds on that to support creating digital relationships with anyone. Layer 3 uses those relationships to effect credential exchange. Layer 4 is the ecosystems that say things about the issuers for different use cases. The dual stack emphasizes the need for governance at every layer.</p><p>The acceptance network specifies the accepted protocols and technologies. The acceptance network also supports ecosystems, providing governance models and technology. The acceptance network is involved at each layer. Here are some examples of things an acceptance network might do at each layer:</p>  <p>Layer 1—limit the allowed DID methods and certify them.</p>  <p>Layer 2—require that wallets and agents using the network support specific versions of the DIDComm protocol. Provide a certification framework for wallet and agent vendors for security and interoperability.</p>  <p>Layer 3—require specific versions of the exchange protocols. Participate in protocol development. Provide a certification framework for specific implementations to aid with security and interoperability.</p>  <p>Layer 4—support the formation, certification, and discovery of credential ecosystem providers. Govern what is required to be a certified ecosystem provider and provide models for acceptable ecosystem governance.</p>  <p>As part of it's overall governance of the ecosystem, the acceptance network also provides model legal agreements for and between the various participants, trust mark rights (think of the Visa logo), and drives a uniform user experience.</p><p>The following diagram shows the credential exchange from the preceding figure with an acceptance network providing support to the verifier so that it can have confidence in the data the issuer has supplied through the holder.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f2b61c7-1e3c-4194-8354-49e5b9f84587.heic">    </a>Acceptance Network in Operation <p>Credential issuers who know their credential might be widely used would join one or more acceptance networks. They agree to follow the rules and regulations in the governance framework of the acceptance network. The acceptance network issues a credential to them that they can use to prove they are a member.4 The acceptance network maintains a registry—likely a registry of registries—that verifiers can use to discover information about the issuer of a credential that has been presented to them.</p> Using an Acceptance Network <p>Returning to our previous scenario, Alice holds a credential issued by her university. She presents it to a prospective employer who wants to know that the credential is from an accredited university. Alice's university has been accredited by an accreditation organization5. They have followed their process for accrediting Alice's university and issued it a credential. They have also added the university to their registry. The university and the accrediting organization are members of an acceptance network. The employer's systems know to automatically query the acceptance network when it received a credential proof from a issuer it does not know. Doing so provides the assurance that the issuer is legitimate. It could also provide information about the accreditation status of the university. This information reduces the risk that the employer would otherwise bear.</p><p>In this scenario, the employer is trusting the processes and structure of the acceptance network. The employer must decide which acceptance networks to use. This is much more scalable than having to make these determinations for every credential issuer. The acceptance network has allowed the verification process to scale and made the overall use of verifiable credentials easier and less risky.</p> A Note on Implementation <p>This discussion of acceptance networks has undoubtedly brought images to your mind about how it is structured or how to build one. The comparison to financial services acceptance networks points to a network run by an organization. And the term registrybrings to mind a database of some kind. Why these are certainly possibilities, I think it's also possible to imagine more decentralized solutions. For example, the registry could be a distributed ledger or blockchain. The governance is likely most easily done by an organization, but there are other options like a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The scenario I described above illustrates a federated system where certifying authorities for specific ecosystems determine their own methods, processes, and requirements, but link their registry to that of the acceptance network.</p> Conclusion <p>As I mentioned above, we've been solving the problem of how to know which institutions to trust for centuries. We have ways of knowing whether a university is accredited, whether a bank is real, whether a company is actually registered and what its reputation is. What is missing is an easy way to make use of this information digitally so that processes for reducing risk can be automated. Acceptance networks rationalize the process and provide the needed tooling to automate these checks. They reduce the many-to-many problem that exists when each verifier has to determine whether to trust each issuer with a more scalable many-to-several system. Acceptance networks allow credential presentation to scale by providing the needed infrastructure for giving verifiers confidence in the facts that holders present to them.</p>    Notes   <p>You can see in the linked post how we used trust to describe what we were building, even as we were reducing risk and inspiring confidence.</p>  <p>Note that this investigation could make use of technology. Knowing the universities name, they could look up a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615">well known location</a> on the universities web site to find the identifier. They could use PKI (digital certificates) to be sure they're talking to the right place. They could look up the university in an online registry of accredited universities.</p>  <p>Trust over IP isn't the only one working on this. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/demystifying-decentralized-identity-marie-wallace/?trackingId=dmcHrAqMST2EC8g%2F8F177w%3D%3D">Marie Wallace of Accenture</a> and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/DVP/">Stephen Wilson of Lockstep Partners</a> have been writing about this idea.</p>  <p>Note that there could be different levels or types of members who perform different roles in the ecosystem and make different agreements.</p>  <p>An example is the <a href="https://nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: Data flowing over networks from DALL-e</p>

<p>I am sharing the following exchange by text upon the request of the other party involved. This is someone I became acquainted with on education issues and over the past year around how their state fits into the topics I research. I did a livestream following this exchange, relating aspects of my experience to recent findings from Michael Levin’s lab around group information fields and communication blocking.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what human weather is and how linguistic concepts manipulate it, check out this short link:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’d like to check out the clips from the Levin lab on embryology and information fields I have a playlist of clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ">here</a>. Each one is super important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO4Ho9XMq9W_-84JW4C4hVQJ"></a></p>
<p>Now in case you haven’t been following me for awhile, and you imagine I am excited about the prospect of using electrically engineered trachea cells to build swishy buildings in outer space, I’m not. In fact, I don’t support any of the work coming out of Levin’s lab or other biotechnology labs. My position at this time is that I seek to understand the concepts that are shaping the world around us, and the future, and demand that we have open, candid public conversations about the ethics of all of these things and how we should or should not proceed. Fair enough?</p>
<p>I don’t think I have to spend paragraphs or many minutes dramatizing my anger / fear / frustration over where we have landed as a culture. As far as I’m concerned, for me at least, that is a waste of valuable time. That said, if you feel directing your energy to that end is helpful, but all means don’t let me stop you. You do you, and I will do me, and if you are not into me or the insights I offer by all means move along to some other content creator. There’s something for everyone out there.</p>
<p>Below is a stream I did this week reflecting on our fraught exchange. At the time, I chose not to share the person’s name or the contents of our private exchange, because that wouldn’t have been proper. However, this person seems to believe that I misrepresented the conversation and requested I share the text exchange. So, in the spirit of openness I am honoring that request. Cheers to human weather, but I could use a little less turbulence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These were two comments left on my livestream. I want to point out that I do not expect this person will share my perspective. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That said, I was also within my rights to remove myself from that emotional, energetic whirlwind. The commentary was very personally directed at me, and it was unkind. </p>
<p>My inclination, having researched the mechanics of the system, is that the words above are an example of how our inner worlds can be shaped by collective thought forms, Levin’s information fields. This is not to discount in any way the trauma we have all been through, the profound losses in all their myriad permutations. It is my opinion, that for me, staying in a negative energy state only serves the system’s goals. Therefore I am choosing for myself to continue with my research in a calm, level-headed way. If there are people out there who want to imagine that by stepping back from the outrage machine I am somehow agreeing to the plan, there’s nothing I can do about that. I am not about to transform myself to fit someone else’s idea of who they think I should be or what I should be doing. I will work hard not to try and force others to be who I might imagine they should be. Fair is fair.</p>
<p>We each have our own ways of being in the world. May we work towards fulfillment in ways that do not drag other people down. I have done that in the past myself. I recognize it, and I am trying to do better. We are all human. We are all learning. We all stumble. We all have grace. </p>
<p>Human weather can get ugly. Let us enjoy the clear, calm days when we have them.</p>
<p>In the exchange below, my comments are on the blue background. The other person’s comments are on the light gray background.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I will pause here and note I have NEVER said “some new medical paradigm will be better than the old.” NEVER. This is attributing opinions to me that are not mine, but something imagined in the head of the person texting. This is human weather.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a check-in when I was discussing piezoelectricity and radium and the Curies’ ties to the Society for Psychical Research.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Ok, so the above statement to me implied that the work I am doing is a luxury – “quite a few people don’t have the luxury to worry about metaphysical research.” In my mind I do this work knowing that people in precarity are likely unable to do it and that since I am able, I have a responsibility to do it and put the conversation out into the public sphere for discussion.</p>

Looking into the windows of a living room in an Amsterdam houseboat floating on a canal.
<p>Eight years ago I was <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-societal-justification-for-privacy">asked on Quora</a> to answer the question “What is the social justification for privacy?” <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-societal-justification-for-privacy/answer/Doc-Searls">This was my answer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Society is comprised of individuals, thick with practices and customs that respect individual needs. Privacy is one of those. Only people who live naked outdoors without clothing and shelter can do without privacy. The rest of us all have ways of expressing and guarding spaces we call “private” — and that others respect as well.</p>
<p>Private spaces are virtual as well as physical. Society would not exist without well-established norms for expressing and respecting each other’s boundaries. “Good fences make good neighbors,” says Robert Frost.</p>
<p>One would hardly ask to justify the need for privacy before the Internet came along; but it is a question now because the virtual world, like nature in the physical one, doesn’t come with privacy. By nature, we are naked in both. The difference is that we’ve had many millennia to work out privacy in the physical world, and approximately two decades to do the same in the virtual one. That’s not enough time.</p>
<p>In the physical world, we get privacy from clothing and shelter, plus respect for each others’ boundaries, which are established by mutual understandings of what’s private and what’s not. All of these are both complex and subtle. Clothing, for example, customarily covers what we (in English vernacular at least) call our “privates,” but also allows us selectively to expose parts of our bodies, in various ways and degrees, depending on social setting, weather and other conditions. Privacy in our sheltered spaces is also modulated by windows, doors, shutters, locks, blinds, and curtains. How these signal intentions differ by culture and setting, but within each the signals are well understood, and boundaries are respected. Some of these are expressed in law as well as custom. In sum, they comprise civilized life.</p>
<p>Yet life online is not yet civilized. We still lack sufficient means for expressing and guarding private spaces, for putting up boundaries, for signaling intentions to each other, and for signaling back respect for those signals. In the absence of those we also lack sufficient custom and law. Worse, laws created in the physical world do not all comprehend a virtual one in which all of us, everywhere in the world, are by design zero distance apart — and at costs that yearn toward zero as well. This is still very new to human experience.</p>
<p>In the absence of restricting customs and laws it is easy for those with the power to&nbsp;penetrate our private spaces (such as our browsers and email clients) to do so. This is why our private spaces online today are infected with tracking files that report our activities back to others we have never met and don’t know. These practices would never be sanctioned in the physical world, but in the uncivilized virtual world they are easy to rationalize: Hey, it’s easy to do, everybody does it, it’s normative now, transparency is a Good Thing, it helps fund “free” sites and services, nobody is really harmed, and so on.</p>
<p>But it’s not okay. Just because something can be done doesn’t mean it should be done, or that it’s the right thing to do. Nor is it right because it is, for now, normative, or because everybody seems to put up with it.&nbsp;The only reason people continue to put up with it is because they have little choice — so far.</p>
<p>Study after study shows that people are highly concerned about their privacy online, and vexed by their limited ability to do anything about its absence. For example —</p>
 
 <a title="www.pewinternet.org" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/">Pew reports</a>&nbsp;that “93% of adults say that being in control of&nbsp;who&nbsp;can get information about them is important,” that “90% say that controlling&nbsp;what&nbsp;information is collected about them is important,” that 93% “also value having the ability to share confidential matters with another trusted person,” that “88% say it is important that they not have someone watch or listen to them without their permission,” and that 63% “feel it is important to be able to “go around in public without always being identified.” 
 <a title="www.truste.com" href="https://www.truste.com/resources/privacy-research/us-consumer-confidence-index-2015/">Ipsos, on behalf of TRUSTe, reports</a>&nbsp;that “92% of U.S. Internet users worry about their privacy online,” that “91% of U.S. Internet users say they avoid companies that do not protect their privacy,” “22% don’t trust anyone to protect their online privacy,” that “45% think online privacy is more important than national security,” that 91% “avoid doing business with companies who I do not believe protect my privacy online,” that “77% have moderated their online activity in the last year due to privacy concerns,” and that, in sum, “Consumers want transparency, notice and choice in exchange for trust.” 
 <a title="customercommons.org" href="http://customercommons.org/2013/05/08/lying-and-hiding-in-the-name-of-privacy/">Customer Commons reports</a>&nbsp;that “A large percentage of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;employ artful dodges to&nbsp;avoid giving&nbsp;out&nbsp;requested&nbsp;personal information&nbsp;online&nbsp;when they believe at least some of that information is not&nbsp;required.” Specifically, “Only&nbsp;8.45% of respondents reported that they always accurately disclose&nbsp;personal&nbsp;information that is requested of them.&nbsp;The remaining 91.55%&nbsp;reported that they&nbsp;are&nbsp;less than fully disclosing.” 
 <a title="www.asc.upenn.edu" href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/americans-resigned-giving-their-data-new-asc-findings-suggest">The Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania reports</a>&nbsp;that “a majority of Americans are resigned to giving up their data—and that is why many appear to be engaging in tradeoffs.” Specifically, “91% disagree (77% of them strongly) that ‘If companies give me a&nbsp;discount, it is a fair exchange for&nbsp;them to collect information about me without my knowing.'” And “71% disagree (53% of them strongly)&nbsp;that ‘It’s fair for an online or&nbsp;physical store to monitor what I’m&nbsp;doing online when I’m there, in exchange for letting me use the store’s wireless internet, or Wi-Fi,&nbsp;without charge.'” 
 
<p>There are both policy and market responses to these findings. On the policy side, Europe has laws protecting personal data that go back to the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive">Data Protection Directive</a>&nbsp;of 1995. Australia has&nbsp;<a title="www.comlaw.gov.au" href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/F2013L02126">similar</a>&nbsp;laws going&nbsp;<a title="www.oaic.gov.au" href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/">back to 1988</a>.&nbsp;On the market side, Apple now has a strong pro-privacy stance, posted&nbsp;<a title="www.apple.com" href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">Privacy – Apple</a>, taking the form of an open letter to the world from CEO Tim Cook. One excerpt:</p>
<p>“Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products. We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you. Our software and services are designed to make our devices better. Plain and simple.”</p>
<p>But we also need tools that serve us as personally as do our own clothes. And we’ll get them. The collection of&nbsp;<a title="cyber.law.harvard.edu" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">developers listed here</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a title="projectvrm.org" href="http://projectvrm.org/">ProjectVRM</a>&nbsp;are all working on tools that give individuals ways of operating privately in the networked world. The most successful of those today are the ad and tracking blockers&nbsp;<a title="cyber.law.harvard.edu" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Privacy_Protection">listed under Privacy Protection</a>. According to&nbsp;<a title="blog.pagefair.com" href="https://blog.pagefair.com/2015/ad-blocking-report/">the latest PageFair/Adobe study</a>, the population of persons blocking ads online passed 200 million in June of 2015, with a 42% annual increase in the U.S. and an 82% rate in the U.K. alone.</p>
<p>These tools create and guard private spaces in our online lives by&nbsp;<a title="www.technologyreview.com" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/review/544371/the-end-of-internet-advertising-as-weve-known-it/">giving us ways to set boundaries and exclude unwanted intrusions</a>. These are primitive systems, so far, but they do work and are sure to evolve. As they do, expect the online world to become as civilized as the offline one — eventually.</p>

the PostgreSQL extension ecosystem full time.

<p>New year, new job.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to announce that I started a new job on January 2 at <a href="https://tembo.io/" title="Tembo: Goodbye Database Sprawl, Hello Postgres">Tembo</a>, a
fully-managed <a href="https://www.postgresql.org" title="PostgreSQL: The world's most advanced open source database">PostgreSQL</a> developer platform. Tembo <a href="https://tembo.io/blog/welcoming-david-wheeler" title="PGXN Creator David Wheeler Joins Tembo to Strengthen the Postgres Extension Ecosystem">blogged the news</a>, too.</p>
<p>I first heard from Tembo CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samay-sharma-b6465122" title="Samay Sharma - Chief Technology Officer - Tembo | LinkedIn">Samay Sharma</a> last summer, when he inquired about
the status of <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>, the PostgreSQL Extension Network, which I built in
2010–11. Tembo bundles extensions into Postgres <a href="https://tembo.io/docs/category/tembo-stacks/" title="Tembo Docs: Tembo Stacks">stacks</a>, which let developers
quickly spin up Postgres clusters with tools and features optimized for specific
use cases and workloads. The company therefore needs to provide a wide variety
of easy-to-install and well-documented extensions to power those use cases.
Could PGXN play a role?</p>
<p>I’ve tended to PGXN’s maintenance for the last fourteen years, and thanks in no
small part to hosting provided by <a href="https://www.depesz.com" title="select * from depesz;">depesz</a>. As of today’s <a href="https://pgxn.org/about/" title="About PGXN">stats</a> it distributes
376 extensions on behalf of 419 developers. PGXN has been a moderate success,
but Samay asked how we could collaborate to build on its precedent to improve
the extensions ecosystem overall.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that we share a vision for what that ecosystem could
become, including:</p>
 
 Establishing the canonical Postgres community index of extensions, something
PGXN has yet to achieve 
 Improving metadata standards to enable new patterns, such as automated binary
packaging 
 Working with the Postgres community to establish documentation standards
that encourage developers to provide comprehensive extension docs 
 Designing and building developer tools that empower more developers to
build, test, distribute, and maintain extensions 
 
<p>Over the the past decade I’ve have many ideas and discussion on these topics,
but seldom had the bandwidth to work on them. In the last couple years I’ve
<a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/651216661677064192/a-few-belated-pgxn-updates" title="PGXN Blog: “A Few Belated PGXN Updates”">enabled TLS and improved the site display</a>, <a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/655912318549606400/password-storage-update" title="PGXN Blog: “Password Storage Update”">increased password security</a>, and
<a href="https://blog.pgxn.org/post/709635160523620352/hello-mastodon" title="PGXN Blog: “Hello Mastodon 🐘”">added a notification queue</a> with hooks that post to both Twitter (RIP <a href="https://twitter.com/pgxn/" title="PGXN on Twitter">@pgxn</a>)
and Mastodon (<a href="https://botsin.space/@pgxn" title="PGXN on Mastodon">@pgxn@botsin.space</a>). Otherwise, aside from keeping the site
going, periodically improving new accounts, and eyeing the latest releases, I’ve
had little bandwidth for PGXN or the broader extension ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the vision and strategy of Samay and Tembo CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rywalker" title="Ry Walker - Tembo, Inc. |
    LinkedIn">Ry Walker</a>, I
will focus on these projects full time. The Tembo team have already helped me
enumerate the extension ecosystem <a href="https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/jobs-to-be-done-theory/" title="Fundamentals of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory">jobs to be done</a> and the tools required to do
them. This week I’ll submit it to collaborators from across the Postgres
community<a>1</a> to fill in the missing parts, make adjustments and
improvements, and work up a project plan.</p>
<p>The work also entails determining the degree to which PGXN and other extension
registries (e.g., <a href="https://database.dev" title="The Database Package Manager">dbdev</a>, <a href="https://pgt.dev" title="Trunk — A Postgres Extension Registry">trunk</a>, <a href="https://pgxman.com/" title="npm for PostgreSQL">pgxman</a>, <a href="http://www.postgres.pm">pgpm</a> (WIP), etc.) will play a
role or provide inspiration, what bits should be adopted, rewritten, or
discarded.<a>2</a> Our goal is to build the foundations for a community-owned
extensions ecosystem that people care about and will happily adopt and
contribute to.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled to return to this problem space, re-up my participation in the
PostgreSQL community, and work with great people to build out the extensions
ecosystem for future.</p>

<p>Tembo was not the only company whose representatives have reached
out in the past year to talk about PGXN and improving extensions. I’ve also
had conversations with <a href="https://supabase.com" title="Supabase | The Open Source Firebase Alternative">Supabase</a>, <a href="https://omnigres.com" title="Omnigres: Postgres as a Platform">Omnigres</a>, <a href="https://www.hydra.so" title="Hydra - Fast Postgres Analytics ++">Hydra</a>, and others.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>We held the first of <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2468">three planned tenth anniversary celebrations</a> for the completion of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> at the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2024</a>.  The four panelists were <a href="https://twitter.com/nov">Nov Matake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ritou">Ryo Ito</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat">Nat Sakimura</a>, and myself.  We shared our perspectives on what led to OpenID Connect, why it succeeded, and what lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<p>The most common refrain throughout our descriptions was the design philosophy to “Keep simple things simple”.  I believe that three of the four of us cited it.</p>
<p>I recounted that we even had a thought experiment used to make the “Keep simple things simple” principle actionable in real time: the “Nov Matake Test”.  As we considered new features, we’d ask ourselves “Would Nov want to add it to his implementation?”  And “Is it simple enough that he could build it in a few hours?”</p>
<p>The other common thread was the criticality of interop testing and certification.  We held five rounds of interop testing before finishing the specifications, with the specs being refined after each round based on the feedback received.  The early developer feedback was priceless – much of it from Japan!</p>
<p>Our OpenID Connect 10th anniversary presentations were:</p>

<p>Thanks to those of you who elected me to a two-year term on the OpenID Foundation board of directors.  This is an incredibly exciting time for the OpenID Foundation and for digital identity, and I’m thrilled to be able to contribute via the OpenID board.  Thanks for placing your trust in me!</p>
<p>I’d like to also take this opportunity to congratulate my fellow board members who were also elected:  George Fletcher, Atul Tulshibagwale, and Mark Verstege.  See the <a href="https://openid.net/2024-board-election-results/">OpenID Foundation’s announcement of the 2024 election results</a>.</p>
<p>My candidate statement was:</p>
 
<p>I am on a mission to build the Internet’s missing identity layer. OpenID specifications and initiatives are key to realizing that vision.</p>
<p>Widespread deployment of OpenID specifications has the potential to make people’s online interactions more seamless, secure, and valuable. I have been actively working since 2007 to make that an everyday reality.</p>
<p>2024 has huge potential for advances in digital identity. People are starting to have identity wallets holding digital credentials that they control. National and international federations are being established. Open Banking and Open Finance deployments are ongoing. Adoption of OpenID Connect (which we created a decade ago!) continues going strong. We’re on track to have OpenID Connect be published as ISO standards. OpenID specifications and programs are essential to all these outcomes.</p>
<p>While many of you know me and my work, here’s a few highlights of my contributions to the digital identity space and the OpenID community:</p>
<p>– I was primary editor of OpenID Connect, primary editor of the OAuth 2.0 bearer token specification [RFC 6750], and primary editor of the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification [RFC 7519] and the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) specifications [RFCs 7515-7518], which are used by OpenID Connect. I was an editor of the Security Event Token specification [RFC 8417], which is used by Shared Signals and OpenID Connect. I’m an editor of the SIOPv2 specification and a contributor to the other OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. I’m an editor of the OpenID Federation specification. The OAuth DPoP specification [RFC 9449] was my latest RFC. I’m an author of 32 RFCs and 17 final OpenID specifications, with more of each in the pipeline.</p>
<p>– I spearheaded creation of the successful OpenID Connect certification program and continue actively contributing to its success. Over 2,800 certifications have been performed and the pace keeps increasing! Certification furthers the Foundation’s goals of promoting interoperation and increasing the quality of implementations. It’s also become an important revenue stream for the Foundation.</p>
<p>– My contributions to the Foundation have included serving on the board since 2008, serving as board secretary during most of my tenure. I’ve helped organize numerous OpenID summits and working group meetings and regularly present there. I chaired the election committee that developed the Foundation’s election procedures and software. I co-chaired the local chapters committee that developed the policies governing the relationships with local OpenID chapters around the world. I serve on the liaison committee, facilitating our cooperation with other organizations. And way back in 2007, I worked with the community to create the legal framework for the OpenID Foundation, enabling both individuals and corporations to be full participants in developing OpenID specifications and ensuring that they can be freely used by all.</p>
<p>I’d like to continue serving on the OpenID board, because while the OpenID community is having notable successes, our work is far from done. Taking it to the next level will involve both additional specifications work and strategic initiatives by the Foundation. We need to continue building a broad base of supporters and deployers of OpenID specifications around the world. We need to continue fostering close working relationships with partner organizations. And we need to continue safeguarding OpenID’s intellectual property and trademarks, so they remain freely available for all to use.</p>
<p>I have a demonstrated track record of energetically serving the OpenID community and producing results that people actually use. I plan to continue taking an active role in making open identity solutions even more successful and ubiquitous. That’s why I’m running for a community board seat in 2024.</p>

<p>I came to Silicon Valley in the mid-90’s, just in time to see the dot-com boom unfold.
Lots happened very quickly in that time. There were a few more such periods of rapid
change since, like when centralized social media got going, and when phones turned into
real computers. But for many years now, not much has happened: we got used to the idea
that there’s a very small number of ever-larger tech giants, which largely release
incremental products and that’s just that. Nothing much happens.</p>
<p>But over the last year or so, suddenly things are happening again. I think not only are
the spaces for innovation and entrepreneurship now more open than they have been for at
least a decade or more; it’s possible they have never been as open as they are now.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
 
 
<p>Everybody’s favorite subject: machine learning and AI. I don’t believe in much of
what most people seem to believe about AI these days. I’m not part of the hype train.
However, I do believe that machine learning is a fundamental innovation that allows us
to program computers in a radically different way than we have in the past 50 and more
years: instead of telling the computer what to do, we let it observe how it’s done and
have it copy what it saw. Most of what today’s AI companies use machine learning for,
in my view, is likely not going to stand the test of time. However, I do believe that
this fundamentally different way of programming a computer is going to find absolutely
astounding and beneficial applications at some point. It could be today: the space for
invention, innovation and entrepreneurship is wide open.</p>
 
 
<p>The end of ever-larger economies of scale and network effects in tech. The
dominant tech companies are very close to having pretty much all humans on the planet as
customers. The number of their users is not going to double again. So the cost structure
of their businesses is not going to get reduced any more simply by selling the same
product to more customers, nor is the benefit of their product going to grow through
growing network effects as much as in the past. It’s like they are running into a physical
limit to the size of many things they can do. This opens space for innovation and successful
competition.</p>
<p>Most interesting, it allows the creation of bespoke products again; products that are
optimized for particular markets, customer groups and use cases. Ever noticed that
Facebook is the same product for everybody, whether you are rich or poor, whether you
have lots of time, or none, whether you are CEO or a kid, whether you like in one place
or another, whether you are interested in sports or not and so forth? It’s the same
for products of the other big platform vendors. That is a side effect of the focus on
economies of scale. All of a sudden, increased utility for the user will need to
come from serving their specific needs, not insisting that all cars need to be black.
For targeted products, large platforms have no competitive advantages over small
organizations; in fact, they may be at a real disadvantage. Entrepreneurs, what are
you waiting for?</p>
 
 
<p>The regulators suddenly have found their spine and aren’t kidding around, starting
with the EU.</p>
 
 
<p>The Apple App Store got in the way of your business? They are about to force the App
Store open and allow side loading and alternate app stores (although Apple is trying
hard to impede this as much as possible; a fight is brewing; my money is on the
regulators).</p>
 
 
<p>The big platforms hold all your data hostage? Well, in many jurisdictions around the
world you now have the right to get all copy of all your data. Even better, the
“continuous, real-time access” provision of the EU’s Digital Markets Act is about to
come into force.</p>
 
 
<p>The platforms don’t let you interoperate or connect? Well, in the EU, a legal
requirement for interoperability of messaging apps is already on the books, and more
are probably coming. Meta’s embrace of ActivityPub as part of Threads is a sign of it.</p>
 
 
<p>Imagine what you can do, as an entrepreneur, if you can distribute outside of app stores,
use the same data on the customer that the platforms have, and you can interoperate with
them? The mind boggles … many product categories that previous were impossible to
compete with suddenly are in play again.</p>
 
 
<p>Social networking is becoming an open network through the embrace of ActivityPub
by Meta’s Threads. While nobody outside of Meta completely understands why they are
doing this, they undoubtedly are progressing towards interoperability with the Fediverse.
Whatever the reasons, chances are that they also apply to other social media products,
by Meta and others. All of a sudden competing with compelling social media application
is possible again because you have a fully built-out network with its network effects
from day one.</p>
 
 
<p>Consumers know tech has a problem. They are more willing to listen to alternatives
to what they know than they have in a long time.</p>
 
 
<p>And finally, 3D / Spatial Computing a la Apple. (I’m not listing Meta here because
clearly, they don’t have a compelling vision for it. Tens of billions spent and I still
don’t know what they are trying to do.)</p>
<p>Apple is creating an an entirely new interaction model for how humans can interact with
technology. It used to be punch cards and line printers. Then we got interactive
green-screen terminals. And then graphics displays, and mice. That was in the
1980’s. Over the next 40 years, basically nothing happened (except adding voice for some
very narrow applications). By using the space around us as a canvas, Apple is making it
possible to interact with computing in a radically different way. Admittedly, nobody
knows so far how to really take advantage of the new medium, but once somebody does, I
am certain amazing things will happen.</p>
<p>Again, an opportunity ripe for the taking. If it works, it will have the same effects
on established vendors as the arrival of the web had on established vendors: some
managed to migrate, or the arrival graphical user interfaces on the vendors of
software for character terminals; most failed to make the switch. So this is another
ideal entrepreneurial territory.</p>
 
 
<p>But here’s the kicker: what if you combined all of the above? What can you build if your
primary interaction model is 3D overlayed over the real world, with bespoke experiences
for your specific needs, assisted by (some) intelligence that goes beyond what computers
typically do today, accomplished by some form of machine learning, all fed by personal
data collected by the platforms, and distributed outside of the straightjacket and business
strategies of app stores?</p>
<p>We have not seen as much opportunity as this in a long time; maybe ever.</p>

<p>This article shows how to migrate a Blazor server application to a Blazor Web application. The migration used the ASP.NET Core migration <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/70-80#convert-a-blazor-server-app-into-a-blazor-web-app">documentation</a>, but this was not complete and a few extra steps were required. The starting point was a Blazor Server application secured using OpenID Connect for authentication. The target system is a Blazor Web application using the “InteractiveServer” rendermode.</p>



 History 



<p>2024-02-12 Updated to support CSP nonces</p>



<p>Code:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 Migration 



<p>The following Blazor Server application was used as a starting point:</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc/tree/main/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc/tree/main/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>



<p>This is a simple application using .NET 8 and OpenID Connect to implement the authentication flow. Security headers are applied and the user can login or logout using OpenIddict as the identity provider.</p>



<p>As in the migration guide, steps 1-3, the Routes.razor was created and the imports were extended.  Migrating the contents of the Pages/_Host.cshtml to the App.razor was more complicated. I have a Layout in the original application and this needed migration into the App file as well.  </p>



<p>This completed Blazor Web App.razor file looked like this:</p>


  @inject IHostEnvironment Env

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;base href="/" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/site.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;link href="BlazorWebFromBlazorServerOidc.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
    &lt;HeadOutlet @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;Routes @rendermode="InteractiveServer" /&gt;

    &lt;script nonce="@BlazorNonceService.Nonce"  src="_framework/blazor.web.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

  


<p></p>



<p>The App.razor uses the routes component. Inside the routes component, the CascadingAuthenticationState is used and a new component for the layout called the MainLayout.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(Layout.MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    @{
                        var returnUrl = NavigationManager.ToBaseRelativePath(NavigationManager.Uri);
                        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"api/account/login?redirectUri={returnUrl}", forceLoad: true);
                    }
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    Wait...
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(Layout.MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The MainLayout component uses two more new razor components, one for the nav menu and one for the login, logout component.</p>


  @inherits LayoutComponentBase

&lt;div class="page"&gt;
    &lt;div class="sidebar"&gt;
        &lt;NavMenu /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;div class="top-row px-4"&gt;
            &lt;LogInOrOut /&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;article class="content px-4"&gt;
            @Body
        &lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;/main&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="blazor-error-ui"&gt;
    An unhandled error has occurred.
    &lt;a href="" class="reload"&gt;Reload&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a class="dismiss"&gt;🗙&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The login, logout component uses the original account controller and improved the logout.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;@context.User.Identity?.Name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;form action="api/account/logout" method="post"&gt;
                &lt;AntiforgeryToken /&gt;
                &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;
                    Logout
                &lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;div class="nav-item"&gt;
            &lt;a href="api/account/login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;          
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>The program file was updated like in the migration docs. Blazor Web does not support reading the HTTP headers from inside a Blazor component and so the security headers were weakened which is a very bad idea. CSP nonces are not supported and so a super web security feature is lost if updating to Blazor Web. I believe moving forward, the application should be improved.</p>

<p></p>



<p>With the weakened security headers the application works and the authentication flow works.</p>







<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Blazor Web in the InteractiveServer mode can use CSP nonces and it is possible to implement a secure web application.</p>

<p>Getting immersed in a new subject is a great experience. ISO SC 37 wrapped up a week-long series of meetings yesterday in Okayama Japan. Here are some things I learned along the way:</p>



<p>SC 37 is smaller than the other ISO committees I’m in – about 60 in-person plus about 20 online this week across 6 work groups. It makes for a tight-knit group and provides lots of time to build relationships. It also means that the workload is sane – on other committees I have to ignore all but the 2 or 3 projects I’m directly involved in.</p>



<p>The main work of the committee is extensible data exchange formats, APIs, evaluation of biometric technologies, performance testing and societal aspects. </p>



<p>SC 37 was started in the early 2000s to meet the needs of ICAO to add biometric information to passports – face, finger and iris formats were the first. Since then, work has been done to cover other biometric modalities such as voice, skeletal structure, vein pattern and others. </p>



<p>Participants are primarily from Government border control, immigration, public safety, law enforcement departments. I’m one of a very small number focused on consumer-provided sensors and devices for use in commercial scenarios. </p>



<p>Biometrics is all about statistical analysis – I never really thought much about it – using the lazy term “probabilistic” – but it really is about estimation and weighting of data samples. So I might have to break open a textbook or two to relearn by sum-overs, means, medians, and standard deviations – not looking forward that that part!</p>



<p>“Convoluted Neural Networks” appear to be broadly used to look for patterns and help to draw conclusions. Another area I must learn about quickly.</p>



<p>There is a significant desire to apply biometric binding of people to data records – for example during ID Proofing and Verification. But it was clear that SC 37 is not the best place to do that work. SC 17 for mDoc credentials or SC 27/WG 5 for identity management seem better suited for this work.</p>



<p>I realized by the end of the week that being an “identity management” guy in the “biometrics” world is a very good thing – the latter can be applied to operations of the former and I get to work on both sides.</p>



<p>So I’m looking forward to working with the committee members and digging deep into the material. Hopefully I can bring useful opinions from the consumer world to drive discussions and improve the body of work.</p>

  <p>I moved my account from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@herestomwiththeweather">@herestomwiththeweather@mastodon.social</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com">@tom@herestomwiththeweather.com</a> on January 2nd.  In the spirit of learning from <a href="https://github.com/danluu/post-mortems/">post-mortems</a>, I am documenting a few mistakes I made.</p>

<p>One of the main motivations for the move was that <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/herestomwiththeweather.github.io/commit/16a5882581d2bfb044a6537a629033698adc80a7">over a year ago</a>, I had configured webfinger on this site to point to the account I had on <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>. But once someone has found me on mastodon, I would from then on be known by my mastodon identifier rather than the identifier with my personal domain.  If I lost access to that particular mastodon account for whatever reason, I would be unreachable by that mastodon identifier.  However, as I described in <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/09/22/webfinger-expectations/">Webfinger Expectations</a>, if my webfinger configuration points me to a server that will allow me to participate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">fediverse</a> with my own personal identifier using my own domain, then in theory, if I lose access to the account on that server, I can swap it out with another similar server and be reachable again with my personal identifier.  So, last week <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">I moved</a> to <a href="https://otisburg.social">Otisburg.social</a> which is running what I consider a minimum viable activitypub server called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin">Irwin</a>.  As it is experimental, I am the only user on the server.</p>

<p>So what did I screw up?  I didn’t plan for two things.  Both are related to the diversity of software and configurations on the Fediverse.</p>

<p>First, although I was vaguely aware of the optional <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/config/#authorized_fetch">Authorized Fetch</a> mastodon feature, I didn’t anticipate that it would prevent me from re-following some of my followers.  Prior to the migration, I assumed this feature would not be enabled on any of the servers the people I followed were using.  I quickly realized that I could not re-follow people on 3 servers which had this feature enabled.  So, I lost contact with the people on those servers for a few days until I <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/irwin/commit/ba5bd101a5870c50fef8c0312118ae792e85f20e">fixed it</a> by also signing GET requests in addition to POST requests.</p>

<p>Second, I didn’t adequately prepare for the possibility that some of my followers would not automatically move to the new server.  Of 96 followers, I had about 15 that did not successfully re-follow.  It seems that some of these failed because they were not on a Mastodon server and their server did not adequately handle the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#Move">Move</a> activity sent by mastodon.social.  Unfortunately, although mastodon allowed me to download a csv file of the people I followed, it did not provide a link to download a file of followers so I don’t know everyone I lost during the move.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the move went well and it is a great feature and I’m glad to see <a href="https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/data-portability-report.html">an effort underway to standardize it</a>.</p>

<p>One unresolved issue is that when someone visits my profile on a mastodon site, selecting “open original page” will fetch https://otisburg.social/actor/tom@herestomwiththeweather.com and the user would expect to see my status updates or toots or whatever you call them.  However, currently that url redirects to this website and activitypub status updates are not available here.</p>

 <p><br></p><p></p><p>Hierarchy appears to be the only option to pull a large group of individuals together toward a common goal. Many insects did it well before humans, but over the last 10,0000 years, humans have moved from decentralised clans into centralised nation-states consisting of hundreds of millions of people.&nbsp; From the pharaohs to Max Weber’s 20th bureaucratic management structure, we can now exist only in such a system because as a society or organisation grows beyond a few dozen people, the hierarchical pyramid is seen as the only option for the organisation.&nbsp; The justification is that it is nature and natural.&nbsp;</p><p>The “ideal organisation” was defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber">Max Weber</a> as a clear and strong hierarchy underpinned by the division of tasks based on specialisation. A fundamental assumption was that each unit takes care of one piece of the chain and the division of tasks within the unit is clearly defined, work can be executed much more efficiently. Weber envisioned this as a “superior structure” because it focused on rationality and equal treatment of all - assuming everyone was happy with their 1984 dystopian jobs and oversight. By formalising processes within organisations, but especially in government, favouritism and abuse of power could be prevented - as he assumed that those in charge and specialised workers remained. A really poor underlying assumption was that people act rationally, efficiently, and professionally.&nbsp; He also ignored the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_primacy">shareholder primacy</a> that would emerge.&nbsp; However, so strong is the argument that it remains the leading business philosophy today, and we still teach that hierarchy, administration and bureaucracy driven by efficiency and effective thinking underpinned by a better division of tasks and responsibilities to drive organisational performance measurable objective is still best practice. The justification is that it represents nature and is natural.&nbsp;</p><p>Different models emerged from the internet, web, and digital thinking allowing us to ponder if something better is possible. Small iterations, such as matrix management, never really changed the fundamentals and whilst embracing all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_theory">stakeholders </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance">ESG</a> has added complexity to the decisions and models - hierarchy remains. However, it is possible to sense in the noise signals that “Data” is finally about to disrupt and dislodge a love/ hate affair with hierarchy, power, and control.&nbsp;</p><p>Counter to this and according to both scientists, individuals, including leaders, do not make their decisions after a thorough analysis, but first decide, unconsciously and intuitively, and then rationalise their decision. We have become experts in seeking out framed and biased data to justify and provide a rational argument for a decision we have already made.</p><p>-----</p><p>Endless inches have been written about structure, who and how to lead and what a digital organisation looks like. However, right now, we are likely to be in the death phase for a pure CDO (chief data/ digital officer) role as it becomes clear that the CTO, CIO and CDO roles have very similar mandates and are now actually competing for power, resources and a clear value to the organisation. The ridged ideals of separation and specialism models driving structures, management, incentives, KPI’s and hierarchy cannot work with the emergence of highly complex interdependency in a digital age - are we witnessing that the division of labour falls apart at scale because of complexity and speed?&nbsp;</p><p>For a complicated task, the separation of that task into modules, and components to create the scale of efficiency and effectiveness works, and it works really well. For any task where the output directly and immediately, because of close feedback loops, changes the inputs for the next unit of creation and consumption - the hierarchy fails.&nbsp; The ridged division of labour into separate tasks, modules, parts or components does not work - because it fundamentally needs repeatability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When operating at speed and scale - but there is a high level of repeatability, hierarchy delivers, and we know its problems.&nbsp; However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>However, data is enabling us to operate at speed, scale and uniqueness (non-repeatability) - this is different.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>We have recognised for a while that leadership/ chief roles are actually a representation of the ontology of an organisation (structure), the question has never been if you need a CEO, CFO, CMO, CTO as these were clearly delineated roles and specialisms.&nbsp; We understand the roles, mandates, powers and delegated authority the experts and leaders bring and have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a digital business, we have created four roles CTO, CIO, CDO and CISO. But the reality is that the CMO and CDO need the CFO’s data. The CFO wants the COO and CMO’s data. The CIO has lots of data but no direct path to showing value. The CISO needs other data from outside the organisation and the CTO needs data the CMO has not yet imagined. Organisations opted to create new roles such as Chief Data or Digital Officer to address the emerging complexity and to avoid too much power being vested in the CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Breaking the axis of old - the CEO/ CFO</p><p>The CEO/CFO axis has this framing; we’ll do more things that are cheaper in the short term and less of those that are more expensive in the long term as our incentive and remuneration guide us.&nbsp; In a company with unified incentives, there is a uniciation of framing which means it is difficult for new ideas to emerge.&nbsp; This incentive friction or incentive dependency means we always face the same decisions in the same way.</p><p>Many leaders are realising that data is forging changes, and this change is not about tech, data or analysis, but it is about whether we, the leadership, exec or board, are making the right decisions.&nbsp; Decisions of the past were framed by the ideal hierarchy underpinned by efficiency and effectiveness at scale driven by the demands for specialisation. However, to know we are making the right decision going forward, we need to understand we have the right choices today, which means we need all “data” and our data can no longer be about isolation, separation or specialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect that we are about to see a new axis of power arrive with the emergence of a new chief role as we realise, we need a new power dynamic structure.&nbsp; A two-way axis (CEO/CFO) becomes a three-way stool.&nbsp; The emergence of the CEO/ CFO/ CxO. The CEO/ CFO will maintain the remits of controlling and understanding the speed and scale at which the hierarchy operates,&nbsp; with the new role focussing on uniqueness - how data breaks the old hierarchy. &nbsp; It does not matter what you call the X, the point is what is their mandate.&nbsp; They have to own:&nbsp;</p>  <p>the data philosophy</p>  <p>all data emerging from the company and its ecosystem&nbsp;</p>  <p>data governance and security</p>  <p>direct the current and future platform's abilities, functionality and performance</p>  <p>The point here is that this role is not about the analysis of the data but about ensuring the quality, attestation, providence, provenance, function, form, taxonomy, ontology and pedagogy of the data needed for decision and that we will continue to access to and enjoy the data we need to make better decisions.</p><p>The critical point is that once the CEO/CFO could know if they were making the right decisions as the framing they needed was about efficiency and effectiveness within a specialism model, however going forward, this axis is not only insufficient, it is damaging. This new third member is needed to provide modern-day stabilisation and governance to ensure that as an expanded team, “we know we are making the right decisions”, as we must regularly ask efficacy questions that were not needed under the old repeatability model, as the mission was sufficient as the guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first victim will be the CDO, as it exists in a specialisation-driven hierarchy that has no choice but to change - not its structure and how it thinks.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

<p>This article shows how to secure a Blazor Server application. The application implements an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE using .NET 8 and configures the security headers as best possible for the Blazor Server application. OpenIddict is used to implement the identity provider and the OpenID Connect server.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc">https://github.com/damienbod/BlazorServerOidc</a></p>







<p></p>



 OpenID Connect flow 



<p>In the first step, the authentication can be solved using OpenID Connect. With this, the process of user authentication is removed from the client application and delegated to an identity provider. In this demo, <a href="https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core">OpenIddict </a>is used. The <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/">OpenID Connect</a> code flow with PKCE is used and the application uses a client secret to authenticate. This can be further improved by using a certificate and client assertions when using the  code from the OpenID Connect flow to request the tokens. The flow can also be improved to use OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">PAR</a>, if the identity provider supports this. </p>



<p>In ASP.NET Core or Blazor, this can be implemented using the Microsoft ASP.NET Core OpenIdConnect package.</p>



 
 Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect 
 



<p>The authentication flow requires some service setup as well as middleware changes in the pipelines. The solution uses the OpenID Connect scheme to take care of the user authentication and saves this in a cookie. The name claim is set to use the “name” claim. This is different with every identity provider and also depending how the ASP.NET Core application maps this. All razor page requests must be authenticated unless otherwise specified.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
  options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOpenIdConnect(options =&gt;
{
  builder.Configuration.GetSection("OpenIDConnectSettings").Bind(options);

  options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
  options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;

  options.SaveTokens = true;
  options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
  options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
  {
	  NameClaimType = "name"
  };
});

builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options =&gt;
{
  var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
	  .RequireAuthenticatedUser()
	  .Build();
  options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
});

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(options =&gt;
    options.Filters.Add(new AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute()));
  


<p>The application pipeline is setup after the services are built. ASP.NET Core adds some automatic claim mapping and renames some claims per default. This can be reset to use the exact claims sent back from the identity provider. </p>


  var app = builder.Build();

JsonWebTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

<p>The CascadingAuthenticationState is used to force and share the authentication requirements in the UI and the Blazor Server components. If the application and the user are not authenticated and authorized, the user is redirected to the identity provider.</p>


  @inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
    &lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(App).Assembly"&gt;
        &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
            &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
                    @{
                        var returnUrl = NavigationManager.ToBaseRelativePath(NavigationManager.Uri);
                        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"api/account/login?redirectUri={returnUrl}", forceLoad: true);
                    }
                &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
                &lt;Authorizing&gt;
                    Wait...
                &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
        &lt;/Found&gt;
        &lt;NotFound&gt;
            &lt;LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/LayoutView&gt;
        &lt;/NotFound&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
&lt;/CascadingAuthenticationState&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Authentication flow UI Pages 



<p>The menu needs to display the login or the logout buttons depends on the state of the application. Blazor provides an AuthorizeView component for this. This can be used in the UI to hide or show elements depending on the authenticate state.</p>


  &lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;@context.User.Identity?.Name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;form action="api/account/logout" method="post"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark"&gt;
                 Logout 
            &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="api/account/login?redirectUri=/"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
  


<p>I added a log in, log out in an account controller and signed out Razor page to handle the authentication requests from the UI. The application automatically authenticates so the login is only used in the signed out page. The login removes the authenticated user from both schemes; the cookie and the OpenID Connect scheme. To remove the authenticated user from the identity provider, the application needs to redirect. This cannot be implemented in an ajax request.</p>


  [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] // need to apply this to the form post request
[Authorize]
[HttpPost("Logout")]
public IActionResult Logout()
{
    return SignOut(
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/SignedOut" },
        CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
  


<p>The SignedOut is the only unauthorized page, component in the application. The AllowAnonymous is used for this. </p>


  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace BlazorServerOidc.Pages;

[AllowAnonymous]
public class SignedOutModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet() { }
}
  


<p></p>



 Security headers 



<p>The user is authenticated. The application need to protect the session as well. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders for this. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p>Blazor Server is a severed rendered application with UI components. The application can implement nonce based CSP. All the typical security headers are added as best possible for this technology.</p>


  namespace BlazorServerOidc;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(idpHost);

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()

            });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains();
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }

<p>The CSP nonces are added to all scripts in the UI.</p>

  I've joined the Standards Council of Canada's mirror committee for ISO SC 37 (Biometrics). My focus is on proving liveness and biometric matching for face and consumer-operated sensors. Excited to explore international interest at the upcoming January 2024 SC 37 plenary in Okayama.

<p>Another year, another ISO committee!  </p>



<p>I have joined the Standards Council of Canada mirror committee for SC 37 (Biometrics) and will be attending the international meetings. The hard work has begun learning the committee culture, personalities and flow of projects.</p>



<p>Getting started in an ISO committee involves applying for accreditation as a national standards body expert in the domain; connecting up to the wikis and email lists; attaching to the document management system; and locating the ‘active coal face’<a>1</a> – the precise status of each interesting project. Not trivial. It’s the same pattern for every standards body – getting caught up takes effort.</p>



<p>There are six work groups within SC 37. I’ll be spending most of my time in WG 5 (Biometric Testing and Reporting) and WG 4 (Technical Implementation of Biometric Systems). WG 1 (Harmonized Biometric Vocabulary), WG 2 (Biometric Technical Interfaces), WG 3 (Biometric Data Interchange Formats) and WG 6 (Cross-Jurisdictional and Societal Aspects of Biometrics) will receive attention as and when needed.</p>



<p>Here are some of the projects that look immediately interesting to me. My opinion will certainly change as I get into the work </p>



 
 ISO/IEC 30107-3 — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reporting 



 ISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 — Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC TS 19795-9:2019 — Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices 



 ISO/IEC 20059 — Vulnerability of Biometric Recognition Systems with Respect to Morphing Attacks 



 ISO/IEC 9868 — Remote biometric identification systems — Design, development, and audit 



 ISO/IEC 29794-5 — Face image quality assessment 



 ISO/IEC TR 22116:2021 — A study of the differential impact of demographic factors in biometric recognition system performance 



 ISO/IEC 19795-10 — Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups 



 ISO/IEC 39794-5:2019 — Information technology — Extensible biometric data interchange formats — Part 5: Face image data 
 



<p>One observation that I must confirm: SC 37 appears to be oriented to controlled-environment biometric systems: where the operator of the system controls the sensors, hardware and software. </p>



<p>I believe, for now, that there are additional design requirements for the exponential-growth bring-your-own biometric sensor (on your mobile device). And this aspect is very interesting to me. My company’s product does remote ID Proofing and Verification using biometric evaluation for linking, and biometric re-verification (aka “returning user authentication”). We construct 3D face models for proof of liveness and matching. We are concerned with proven liveness and end to end device/sensor security (for mobile devices cameras and webcams). </p>



<p>Performance testing, presentation attack detection/performance, mobile-first and face-first topics are hot now.</p>



<p>I’m about to find out the level of international interest and state of standardization in these areas during the SC 37 plenary at Okayama in January 2024 – wish me luck!. </p>



 


  Realizing that ‘active coal face’ is a dying idiom — but what is the climate-friendly replacement? Maybe the ‘code repo pull requests page’? I invite you to respond! <a>︎</a>

<p>December 22, 2023 was my last day at <a href="https://nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>. My tenure was just
under two and a half years.</p>
<p>My first 19 months at the company were pretty much everything <a href="https://justatheory.com/2021/08/sign-o-the-times/" title="Sign O' The Times">I had hoped</a>, as
I collaborated with Design and Product to design a distributed platform and
conceived, designed, and implemented <a href="https://justatheory.com/2023/10/cipherdoc/" title="CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">CipherDoc</a>, a service for encrypted data
management. I’m incredibly proud of that work!</p>
<p>But alas, plans change. After the company mothballed the project, I refocused my
time on <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue" title="Tanya Reilly: “Being Glue”">glue work</a>: re-platforming services, upgrading runtimes and
dependencies, improving logging and observability, and documenting code,
architectures, and playbooks. It felt good to reduce the onboarding,
maintenance, and on-call overhead for my teams; I hope it helps them to be more
productive and fulfilled in their work.</p>
<p>I treasure the terrific people I met at The Times, just super thoughtful,
empathetic, and creative co-workers, partners, and colleagues. It’s no wonder
they had the energy to form a union, <a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/">The Times Tech Guild</a>, for which I’m
gratified to have helped organize and steward members. The Guild connected me
with a far broader range of talented and committed people than I would have
otherwise. I will miss them all, and continue to cheer for and support the
movement from the outside.</p>
<p>And now, as 2023 winds down, I’ve decided to try something new. More news
in the new year!</p>

  In 2019, I transitioned from independent consulting to IDEMIA, contributing to the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License. In 2021, I joined Ping Identity, focusing on government-issued digital credentials and inter-company implementations. I also continued my involvement with Kantara Initiative. As of 2023, I'm at Facetec, working on liveness-proven biometric verification and collaborating wi

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In 2019 I decided to leave independent consulting and join a large corporation – IDEMIA – you might notice their logos at airport security stations. My job was to be embedded in the ISO subcommittee for Mobile Driving License, a.k.a. the ISO 18013-5 mDL standard and to support IDEMIA’s mobile eID/mDL product team. This was a great extension of my existing work on digital credentials in other ISO subcommittees and W3C groups. Being tied to a product team was a new experience for me!</p>



<p>In 2021 I moved to Ping Identity to support the product team for PingOne Neo – ID Verify and Digital Credentials. My focus remained on government-issued digital credentials via ISO mDL and to establish implementations of inter-company digital credentials . I had the privilege of working beside incredibly experienced and generous standards experts who continue to be deeply embedded in OpenID Foundation, IETF, FIDO, Open Wallet Foundation core work. The novelty of Ping was to see how a new product can be engineered to fit into an overarching suite of enterprise products. The interplay of product and corporate priorities on the one hand and the long time scale of standardization on the other led to some “interesting” discussions over my time at Ping.</p>



<p>One constant throughout has been my involvement with <a href="http://KantaraInitiative.org">Kantara Initiative</a>. This non-profit corporation continues to be a bright light in the world of trustworthy use identity and personal information. I’m currently Chair of the Identity Assurance Work Group and since 2023, Chair of the Board of Directors. Kantara has had great fortune in our Executive Directors over the years – from Joni Brennan to Colin Wallis and now Kay Chopard. The Board is working hard to strengthen our program offerings (as a conformance body for NIST 800-63 and the UK DIATF), expand into new geographies, and sustain innovation in our community work groups – while fiscally prudent and in line with our fiduciary duty to the organization and its members.</p>



<p>At the end of 2023, I have decided to pivot my attention to a big missing piece in the digital credentials story – how to ensure that the recipient of a digital credential is a real human (and the intended one), and that the presenter of a digital credential is in fact authorized to do so. I have joined <a href="http://www.facetec.com">Facetec</a> to dive deep into the world of liveness-proven biometric verification. Their tech is impressive. The SDK uses the mobile device camera to construct a 3D face model of the person from which it determines whether there’s a real living human present, whether the session is a spoof attempt (using physical artifacts or video playbacks), and whether images are being injected bypassing the camera subsystem. The server SDK completes the liveness analysis and performs highly-accurate matching against a known-good reference. My job? Same-same. Working with international standards bodies (such as ISO SC 37) and testing labs to develop or extend standards for performance evaluation of this new 3D face biometric mode. I’m ingesting big stacks of documents and trying to work out where standardization of user-supplied biometric-enabled devices stands today – in comparison with the well-established border security/public safety modes of operation. This is exciting new ground and appears to be mostly greenfield – and it all ties back to the IDM and digital credentials industry. </p>

<p>
I’m lucky to have two hands, let’s be clear, and the minor struggles I’ve had with them over the years don’t qualify as any kind of real hardship. Yet there have been a lot of small injuries — an ongoing annoyance made worse by being mostly my fault.</p>
<p>
Consider the most recent incident. To relieve strain on my left hand, I switched a few months ago from a steel-string to a nylon-string guitar. I knew I wanted the lesser force required to press nylon strings, and the vacation from steel strings has really helped. The wider spacing between the strings is also better for my hands, I realized as I settled in. I’d started on a classical guitar, then hadn’t owned one in decades, it feels good to have one again and I’ve been playing it a lot.</p>
<p>
Being the guy who wrote a blog post about an early warning system for RSI <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/07/23/is-there-an-early-warning-system-for-rsi/">not even six months</a> ago, I see the absurdity of my situation. Back in July I was rehabbing an overextended little finger. Now I’m rehabbing a thumb and related muscles insulted by my failure to properly adapt to the new instrument. </p>
<p>
You can wrap your thumb around the narrower neck of a steel-string guitar in order to grab the lowest string. You can do that with the wider neck of classical guitar too. But as I probably learned the first time and then forgot, you really shouldn’t. A D major chord with F# in the bass is too much of a stretch for the thumb, at least for my thumb, on a classical guitar. You won’t see classical guitarists do that. Instead they’ll make a tripod with the index, middle, and ring fingers. </p>
<p>
So once again I get to rewire my hand posture. Which, again, is a minor hardship, not remotely comparable to the guy I mentioned last time who had to switch sides and learn to fret with his right hand. As I also mentioned there, he found an upside. Now he’s a switch-hitter who can use both halves of his brain directly. In my case, I’m trying to embrace the rewiring as a way to break a habit and form new neural pathways. It’d be nice, though, if that weren’t always a response to self-inflicted injury!</p>
<p>
But like I said, it’s a minor hardship. My hands could have been mangled in my dad’s car engine that one time, or in the anchor chain of Ben Smith’s boat that other time: two escapes from disaster that still provoke the occasional nightmare. I’m lucky to have these two hands, and again vow to take better care of them.</p>
<p>
Why is it so hard (for me, at least) to detect and avoid injurious hand postures? I guess it’s because whatever you’re projecting — when you write sentences or lines of code, or play notes and chords — has to flow through your hands with minimal conscious attention to your hands. Note to self: pay more attention.</p>

<p>
The use of the phrase “critical mass” in this NYTimes story about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/opinion/goodreads-books-reviews.html">the enshittification of Goodreads</a> stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Give all of Goodreads’s issues, it might seem easy enough to encourage writers and readers simply to flock to another forum. Sites like The Storygraph and Italic Type have sprung up as promising alternatives, but they’re still far from reaching a critical mass of users.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Nuclear physicists know they are dancing with the devil when they bring fissile material to criticality. They also know that the reaction can be controlled, that it must be, and that the means of control obey well-understood principles. </p>
<p>
Social sites typically push toward supercriticality with no such understanding. If Goodreads enshittifies at 125 million users, why would another service expect a different outcome at similar scale? </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We can learn from a natural experiment. Not mentioned in the story is a long-running service, <a href="https://librarything.com">LibraryThing</a>, that’s been going strong since 2005. I interviewed its founder and lead developer, Tim Spalding, back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729204047id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3595.html">2008</a>. Listening to that interview again today reminded me that everything I loved about LibraryThing remains important and matters even more now. </p>
<p>
LibraryThing was, and remains, a place where you make and share lists of books in order to connect with other people and with books — not primarily via friend relationships but rather book relationships. It’s a small business that’s kept Tim and his crew happily engaged in serving a few million bibliophiles, some of whom pay a membership fee to be super-cataloguers. </p>
<p>
I’m not in LibraryThing’s core demographic. Books aren’t as central to my life as they are to members of the service who carefully curate their own lists, tag books and authors, contribute to a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/commonknowledge/">common knowledge wiki</a>, and write reviews. But I appreciate their work when I visit the site.</p>
<p>
Today I added Ed Yong’s remarkable <a href="https://www.librarything.com/catalog/Jon.Udell&amp;bookid=254714845">An Immense World</a> to my list. Among the book’s dozens of reviews on the site, I found a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/27607715/reviews/219586107">2000-word essay</a> that usefully highlights many of the strange (to humans) powers of animal perception that Yong describes. </p>
<p>
I guess LibraryThing isn’t on the Times’ radar because it hasn’t reached a critical mass of … what, exactly? Tens of millions of people? Hundreds of millions? I’m glad it hasn’t! That’s a recipe for meltdown. LibraryThing has been going strong, for almost two decades, in the Goldilocks zone: neither too little activity nor too much, just the right amount for meaningful experiences at human scale. </p>
<p>
I feel the same way about Mastodon. Conventional wisdom says it’s dead in the water: “nobody” goes there, no Mastodon apps <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/app_store_rankings_as_a_proxy_for_social_network_momentum">rank highly</a> in the app stores. But if critical mass means operating at the scale of Twitter or Facebook, then who wants that? Who benefits from the inevitable enshittification? Not me, and probably not you.</p>
<p>
LibraryThing shows that a controlled reaction, at smaller scale, is sustainable over time. Mastodon so far has been successful in the same way, and I see no reason why that can’t continue. Although Mastodon is young, my connections there date back to social networking’s roots in the early blogosphere. It feels like the right amount of critical mass. For me, a billion people on Mastodon is an anti-goal. I would much rather see hundreds or maybe thousands of healthy communities emerge, each operating in its own Goldilocks zone. Many small and safe critical masses, instead of a few huge and dangerous ones, powering small businesses whose proprietors are — like Tim Spalding and his crew — able to maintain real relationships with their customers. </p>
<p>
That global conversation we thought we were having on Twitter? We don’t know how to control that reaction and I’m not sure it makes sense to try. </p>

<p>As I have come to see it, the world consists of mounds of information, much of it digital. Our days are spent encountering, reacting, and sifting through it. Our conscious genius pulls together threads from which are crafted uplifting, foreboding, humorous, and tragic stories. We live inside these stories alone or with like-minded people. Most of the time our minds simply tweak and update unfolding dramas of consensus reality or a particular flavor of alternate reality; it’s an efficient, largely automatic process.</p>
<p>Rarely do we toss out whole plot lines and start from scratch. Why? Well, there would be so many subplots left hanging and so many question marks around our relational identities that the uncertainty of getting everything sorted out means it’s generally easier to keep on the established path. Jettisoning a comfortably broken-in outlook is a very messy business; and how often, really, do we feel the need to, or empowered to, rip apart the boxes we inhabit?</p>
<p>Each of us has the ability to craft amazing stories out of fascinating facts and extend invitations to loved ones and complete strangers to come inside and look around, sit a spell, and make themselves at home. There is, however, no way to compel another person to hang out in the story you made. You can’t even force them to cross your threshold. Exhort and cajole all you want, the stories we inhabit remain a personal choice, as they should be. Just as you wouldn’t want to have to live inside someone else’s ill-fitting story, the same goes for everyone else. It’s a hard truth. It can hurt.</p>
<p>Our acceptance of the primacy of the digital world has meant that the velocity and intensity of social physics has changed. My experience of these changes have been dramatic and potentially catastrophic, at least in the short run. The web3 protocol layer system seems intent on launching us all into a digital-twin simulation cloudmind whether we’ve elected to participate or not. Left in the wake of this century-long noetic campaign is the wreckage of once deeply-held relationships, relationships with those who are (or were) close to us in heart – actual physical hearts, not emojis, up-votes, and clicks.</p>
<p>There are too many digital stories, too many doors, too much unease with the masses either searching for answers or working really hard to avoid seeing the holes being torn in the fabric of what we once understood as “reality.” Our story rooms may now be filled with people from far flung corners of the globe. These are people whose heart fields we’ll probably never have the opportunity to feel directly – no mingled auras from warm embraces, conversations over cups of tea, shared meals, card games, porch sitting, bonfires, jam sessions.</p>
<p>In some cases, those whose heart fields we shared in the actual world have wandered off to the digital rooms of sirens, forsaking old connections for greener pastures. The transformation, turbo-charged by the lockdowns, happened with ferocious speed and offered little chance for redress, remedy, or reconciliation. We didn’t know what hit us. Then it was over, and everything had changed.</p>
<p>This is the first Christmas I’ve ever spent alone, totally alone. I was cancelled for breaking out of my box, looking around, asking questions, and imploring people to start having conversations about emerging technology and cybernetics and finance and consciousness and gaming before we go the way of the Lotus Eaters. Maybe I was cancelled for my intensity. I don’t know, the only thing I was told is that it was about “my research.” </p>
<p>I’ve made it through a tearful week. Lots of tears shed during my Christmas Eve read aloud finishing “Momo.” I apologize for the five-month gap, but I know in my heart I was supposed to read it last night. I keep saying time is not what we think it is. In the end of Ende’s story, the hour-lily wielding Momo and the tortoise Cassiopeia save the day and defeat the time bankers. The children return to the amphitheater for free play, grown-ups shelve their Taylorist tendencies, the town’s humanity is restored, and Momo doesn’t have to be alone anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The “Momo” read-aloud playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO459LMtWwG0z4jKbv92moN5">here</a>.</p>
<p>I feel we are on Earth, sparks of God’s divine creation, to experience, falter, learn, and feel in the depths of our souls. The holidays are a season of big feelings – even more so when you’ve lost a loved one to the great beyond and other loved ones to the pit-traps of sinister social physics. The afternoon was mild here in Philadelphia, and I took the opportunity to fill my basket with gatherings and head out to the Kelpius Cave in the Wissahickon- alchemy of the soul. What better balm could there be than to lay out a heart-felt intention to close a rocky year?</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I thought that I was going to decamp to Seattle in the summer I took all of my precious nature materials with a friend to Valley Forge and created a magnificent spiral between Mount Misery and Mount Joy. Since I returned, I’ve accumulated a few more items – feathers and quartz from Arkansas, acorns from Laurel Hill cemetery, dried flowers from birthday carnations I bought myself, and gifts from friends across the country. I took them with a candle to the park and lit up the darkness and asked God for guidance to do the next right thing. </p>
<p>Once you’ve ripped up the boxes you really need a divine compass.</p>
<p>The coming year should bring new opportunities in Hot Springs, Arkansas after we sell the family home in the spring – fingers crossed someone wants to pay a good price for a well-loved 1880s row house with many original features. I’m hoping 2024 will be gentler than the clear-the-decks tsunami of the past six months. I met my husband when I was twenty. We grew up together. This divorce is my first break-up. I know that sounds ridiculous, and yet it’s true. I am my own person, and I know my own mind. That said, I’m going to have to craft my own new traditions and ways of doing things as a single person and doing that feels overwhelming right now. Will I ever celebrate Christmas again? It’s hard to say. It’s also been two years since my child has spoken to me. Prayers for reconciliation would be welcome. I still love my family. I am fine with them living in the story of their choice. I think we could create a shared space that bridges our separate boxes.</p>
<p>Despite the waves of difficultly I’ve been navigating since 2019, I know I would die a dysfunctional person had I elected to live the rest of my life inside stories I knew to be fundamentally flawed in their incompleteness and injurious to my spirit. So, I’m just going to put one foot in front of the other and try not to be afraid of a future with a lone heart-field. </p>
<p>I’m Jerry Hawver’s daughter, and Hawvers “git er done.”</p>
<p>Merry Christmas everyone. Thanks for stopping by my story, even if we can’t mingle our actual auras. May the new year bring blessings to you and your loved ones. Our power is in the heart – hugs all around. Hug your people as much as you can while you have them near you. It’s a sad day when you have no one to hug.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A light in the darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stones and brick, rubble from the floor of the “cave,” outline the heart.&nbsp; A ring of soft pine needles mingled with dried purple carnations and white Alstroemeria sprinkled with green leaves gifted from California and the last of my creosote gifted to me last year by Dru in Tucson for my birthday – it smells like the desert in the rain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next ring was an outline of pinecones gathered in the park with ferns and white pine sprigs and gifted dandelion seed heads that lit up the dark like stars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used a large stone as a centerpiece to hold many assorted lovely things lit by a candle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A soft, leathery buckeye casing holding a spiral shell and manzanita berries with some Arkansas quartz below it.</p>
<p></p>

I do a lot more cycling in Sonoma County, California than was possible in Cheshire County, New Hampshire. The Mediterranean climate here, which enables me to ride year-round, is a blessing for my mental and physical well-being. And because the topography is even more rugged, I’m doing more climbing that ever. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, Luann dropped me at the Coleman Overlook on the coast and I cycled home from there. I’m not a fast climber, I can’t keep up with younger friends when we cycle together, and <a href="https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/5857726231">my rides</a> aren’t extreme by local standards. But my cumulative elevation gain over the course of a year far exceeds what it ever was back east, and I’ve had plenty of time to reflect on climbing strategy.</p>
<p>
A better gear ratio would help, but my older road bike won’t accommodate that. So on the steepest pitches I switch to a weaving ascent that eases the grade, which I’ve decided is OK. For a while I resisted shoes with cleats that lock into pedals, but now I use them to gain extra leverage which really helps. </p>
<p>
It’s never mainly about the equipment, though, the real challenge is always mental. How do you think about reaching the top of the big hill you’re climbing? One piece of conventional wisdom: don’t look ahead. If you look down at the road you aren’t forced to think about the grade, or your slow progress up it. Instead you see pavement moving beneath you, and feel steady progress.</p>
<p>
Of course that defeats the purpose of cycling through spectacular Sonoma County landscapes. Recently a friend suggested a different strategy: look to the side. Of course! There’s little or no traffic on many of these routes, so it’s safe to do that. And the effect is mesmerizing.</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/03/06/the-3d-splendor-of-the-sonoma-county-landscape/">described</a> it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So, don’t look ahead to the top of the hill, and don’t look down at the road. Look left and right to see sliding panels of majestic scenery. It really helps!</p>

<p>Ten years ago today the drafts that would be approved as the final OpenID Connect specifications were published, as announced in my post <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1154">Fourth and possibly last Release Candidates for final OpenID Connect specifications and Notice of 24 hour review period</a>.</p>
<p>The adoption of OpenID Connect has exceeded our wildest expectations.  The vast majority of federated signins to sites and applications today use OpenID Connect.  Android, AOL, Apple, AT&amp;T, Auth0, Deutsche Telekom, ForgeRock, Google, GrabTaxi, GSMA Mobile Connect, IBM, KDDI, Microsoft, NEC, NRI, NTT, Okta, Oracle, Orange, Ping Identity, Red Hat, Salesforce, Softbank, Symantec, T-Mobile, Telefónica, Verizon, Yahoo, and Yahoo! Japan, all use OpenID Connect, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  While OpenID Connect is “plumbing” and not a consumer brand, it’s filling a need and doing it well.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that the second set of errata corrections to the OpenID Connect specifications were just approved, as described in the post <a href="https://openid.net/second-errata-set-for-openid-connect-specifications-approved/">Second Errata Set for OpenID Connect Specifications Approved</a>.  While we are proud of the quality of the final specifications, with 9 3/4 years of thousands of developers using and deploying the specifications, it’s unsurprising that issues would be found that needed clarification and correction.</p>
<p>The updated OpenID Connect specifications have just been submitted to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for Publicly Available Submission (PAS) status.  Approved PAS submissions are published as ISO specifications.  This will foster adoption in jurisdictions that require using standards that are published by organizations with international treaty status.</p>
<p>Celebrations of the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=1191">tenth anniversary of the approval of OpenID Connect</a> will occur worldwide in 2024.  The first will be in Asia at the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2024/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo</a> in January.  The second will be in the Americas at <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> in May.  The third will be in Europe at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> in June.  Join us at these events for the celebrations!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to see what the next decade brings for <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>!</p>

<p>This article shows how to setup and sign git commits on Windows for Github. Most of this is already documented on the Github docs, but I ran into trouble when using this with git Extensions on a windows host. My commits could not be signed until I set the home system variable on the windows host.</p>



 Install gpg on Windows 



<p>To sign git commits, you can download the windows <a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/">gpg4win</a> and install it. Git should already be installed. No extra features are required.</p>



 Generate a key on Windows 



<p>The Windows cmd line is used to generate a new gpg key. I have a safe host PC and do not require a passphrase. Other than this, I just used the default settings to generate a new gpg key. </p>



<p>Note: The requested email needs to match the email used on your Github account.</p>


  gpg --full-generate-key
  


<p>Github docs: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key</a></p>







<p>The pub key can be used to export the pub key and upload it to the Github account.</p>



 Use Git Extensions and apply the signing per repo 



<p>I would like to use this key for a single repository. I have multiple user accounts for multiple systems and each have different git requirements. For one Github repository, I would like to sign all commits. I generated the key  in the global user profile but only use the key on this repository.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In the git bash window from the repository, if you want to sign the commits, the following commands can be executed. I open the bash through git extensions. If you already have the key id from the creating of it, you can skip step 3.</p>


  git config commit.gpgsign true

git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"

gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

git config user.signingkey &lt;your key&gt;
  


 Signing key not found 



<p>If the signing key is not found on windows, it is probably because the application is looking in the wrong location for the gpg key. To validate this, open the git bash from the repository and find the Home: value. This must match the value in the windows command line. </p>


  gpg --version
  


<p>Find the value for Home:</p>



<p>Now open and the value in the windows cmd and check that it matches the git bash console. If it does not match, take the window cmd Home: value and add this to the system variables.</p>



<p>Add an environment variable called <code>GNUPGHOME</code> with the value found in the <code>gpg --version</code> cmd</p>







<p></p>



<p>Now the commit should be signed. Next step is to setup Github to use this key.</p>



 Add the gpg key to your Github account 



<p>The gpg key can be attached to the Github account. The docs explain this good.</p>



<p>Github docs: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account</a></p>


  gpg --list-secret-keys

gpg -a --export &lt;your-pub-key&gt;
  


<p></p>



<p>Display the verified commits on Github: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>When you commit and push, Github should display a verified status</p>







<p></p>



<p>You can now require that all commits are verified for a repository</p>

<p>Recently I made a post on <a href="https://medium.com/@m-ruminer/veramo-and-verifiable-credentials-6e860b3035be">Veramo and Verified Credentials</a> where I discussed a little bit about Veramo and my findings in trying to use it. This post is about <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit">DIDKit</a> from SpruceID. DIDKit is another set of packages for creating DIDs, verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, etc. I only used the command line interface (CLI) tool in my experimentation with it and was entirely focused on DID creation. This is how it&nbsp;went.</p><p>First off, let me say that I tried DIDKit not only because I wanted to see how another tool worked but because when using Veramo there is no way via the CLI to get the private key for a DID I created. I suspect with enough magic it could be retrieved via JavaScript, but maybe not. It’s locked away in a key management system&nbsp;(KMS).</p><p>Secondly, I found <a href="https://mhrsntrk.com/blog/create-and-publish-your-own-did-web">Create and Post Your Own did:web</a> post to be easier to navigate than the directions on the SpruceID site. I did find somewhere in the DIDKit docs how to create a did:web from their did:key generation command but can’t find it again which only goes to show how difficult it is to find some information in their documentation. (Since initially writing this I looked harder and did find it at “<a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-examples/did-web-in-minutes">did-web in minutes</a>”)Although SpruceID says it supports did:web it seems that it can resolve did:web but it doesn’t create a did:web fully. You must create a did:key and make some edits on it to make it into a did:web. The edits are minor, but I consider this a weird limitation. I read somewhere along the way that it only supports the ED25519 curve in creating did:key/did:web, but I am not sure if that limitation referred only to creation or resolving as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Once I created a JSON Web Key (JWK) using one of their key generation functions, built the did:key from the key, edited it to be a did:web, and published it to <a href="http://manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json">manicprogrammer.github.io/.well-known/did.json</a> it resolved fine with their “didkit did-resolve” command.</p><p>Unlike the Veramo tool, I found no way through the CLI to add services so I just manually added a DIDComm service to the DID. As with my Veramo post let me say — don’t message me on that DIDComm service as I don’t have nor have I found a mobile device agent/wallet to which I can add an existing DID and mediator endpoints for DIDComm much less the DIDComm v2 endpoint I gave it. So I can’t get the messages. Even <a href="https://blocktrust.dev/">blocktrust.dev</a> which has the mediator doesn’t have such a thing. Perhaps I’ll setup a browser based DIDComm messaging app to test it out if I can find a DIDComm V2 set of libraries for the browser. (I’ll have to get proficient with JavaScript though, which I have never found the time to do.) Why do I have the endpoint in the DID then? Just for fun to see that I could add one and it properly resolve. Obviously, I have not been able to test&nbsp;it.</p><p>What else did I find in my experience with DIDKit? In the <a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/didkit/didkit-packages/command-line-interface">documentation</a>, I couldn’t find what the below ‘key” parameter did. But, following the directions to create a did:key the below command&nbsp;worked:</p> didkit key-to-did key -k issuer_key.jwk <p>I also found that on its Github it doesn’t have a discussion section.</p><p>All in all, the toolkit did a good job from the CLI. I am likely to try out the creation of a VC with it. It has packages for Rust (in which DIDKit is written), C, Java/Android, Python, and Javascript.</p>

It’s not ready for prime time nor is it professed to be, but it does get some things done. I focused on DIDs. I was entirely using the CLI as javascript is not a “native” language for me but I may decide to get into that space to mess with this project some. The deficiencies I ran into may be CLI specific and not present when using the APIs directly.</p><p>I did get a well-formed DID out of it that I published at:</p> did:web:manicprogrammer.github.io <p>Don’t send me a didcomm message via it despite it having a service for that defined as I don’t currently have a personal agent setup to communicate via that service. I know, why publish the service then? For fun. Maybe I’ll remove&nbsp;it.</p><p>One issue I hit with the CLI that was especially off-putting to me is that I found no way to get the private key via the CLI for the created DID, even with the did export function (perhaps I am wrong, but I didn’t see it and thus wonder what the value of the export is). If someone finds me wrong let me know. &lt;EDIT&gt;: since writing this I have prompted a question about it and confirmed what I found. See <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/discussions/1303">here</a>.&lt;/EDIT&gt; It uses by default a local KMS. This means I can only create and send credentials created by Veramo as I don’t have the private key for signing via another method. I suppose I can get to it via some javascript magic and I may try to do that or else I’ll likely create a different did with keys I have generated in other&nbsp;ways.</p><p>All in all. It was worthwhile to play with from the CLI. No doubt, the real value is in the Javascript APIs. What’s it good for? I don’t really know yet. It’s good for messing around and becoming more familiar with verifiable credential structure, verifiable presentation structure, DID structure etc.</p><p>#decentralizedidentity #verifiablecredentials</p>

<p>There is some major positive good news for the KERI &amp; ACDC ecosystem. The European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7141124705410818048/">announced on LinkedIn</a> the EBA Pillar 3 data hub which is built on KERI &amp; ACDC. The Pillar 3 data hub uses the vLEI system developed by <a href="https://gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation.</p>



 vLEI System Architecture Diagram: 


 
 


 What this means 



<p>This means that around 6000 financial institutions in the EU will now be required to use the EBA Pillar 3 data hub, and by extension KERI &amp; ACDC, for their financial reporting. You can read more in their <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">website announcement</a> and the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">linked report PDF</a>.<br><br>The important parts include pages 50-52, specifically the Garner analysis in section 6.3.128: </p>



 
 EBA had Gartner analyze KERI &amp; ACDC 



 found ” that there are no comparably efficient alternative solutions globally” 
 



<p>And section 6.4.130 Conclusion: </p>



 
 “vLEI effectively meets…Pillar 3 reporting requirements…perceived as a low-risk project overall…significant opportunity to enhance integrity of reporting processes” 
 



<p>A number of advantages and risks were identified with the paper saying </p>



<blockquote>
<p>The automation of identity verification and related processes through the vLEI could also offer numerous potential advantages for both Financial Institutions and other Regulators in the EU financial market<br></p>
<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf</a></blockquote>



<p>Potential Advantages:</p>



 
 For Financial Institutions
 
 Non-repudiable identification 
 
 This means once you say something with KERI you can’t un-say it, as in you can’t change your story without getting caught 
 
 



 Operational efficiency: unified digital format 



 Enhanced products and services: trusted information enables risk management, customer service, and enhanced online experience 
 
 



 For Supervisors/Regulators
 
 Enhanced Trust: simplify both validation of regulatory reports and authorized sign off 



 Comprehensive Entity Overview: transparent, aggregated view of legal entities and hierarchies 



 Standardization of Data Processes: smarter, more cost-effective, reliable data workflows 
 
 
 



<p>Risks:</p>



 
 Development of ecosystem
 
 Due to ecosystem novelty there is only one QVI right now (Provenant), 
 
 Support is needed from GLEIF to grow the population of QVIs, incentive structure, and ecosystem orchestration 
 
 



 Ensure adequate support to institutions
 
 End-user applications bank wallet 



 Wallet for reporting institutions 



 Compatibility with eIDAS 2.0 framework 



 User-friendly applications for digital signatures, key management, and logging services 
 
 



 Market’s recognition of benefits offered by vLEI
 
 Pillar 3 reporting requirement could trigger a “snowball effect” to catalyze market recognition of vLEI benefits. 
 
 
 
 
 



<p>This is an exciting development in the KERI space that this blog will continue to track.</p>

<p>Interoperability is a grand goal, and a tough problem to crack. After all, what is interoperability other than independent things just working out of the box? In the standards and specifications world, we have to be precise about a lot of things, but none more precise than what we expect to be interoperable with, and how we get to the interop&nbsp;point.</p><p>In my experience, there are a few common ways to get&nbsp;there.</p> Conformance <p>The easiest way to achieve interoperability is for there to be no choice from the implementations. If there’s only one option, and implementations are motivated to follow that option, then interoperability is much easier to count on. If a specification has a MUST, and means it, you can realistically rely on that being followed by well-meaning developers.</p><p>This zero-level interoperability is not without its confusion, though. In any specification, there are a lot of assumptions that lead up to a MUST being placed. Changes in this context could make that MUST behave differently in between implementations. For example, taking the byte value of a data structure, even a simple one like a string or number, assumes an encoding and order for that data structure. What’s most dangerous about this kind of problem is that it’s easy for multiple developers to make the same assumptions and therefore assure themselves that the MUST as written is sufficient, until someone else comes along with different assumptions and everything breaks in spite of seeming to be conformant.</p><p>To give a concrete example, try asking anyone for a USB cable and chances are you’ll get a few different varieties back, from type A, to type C, to micro-B, to power-only varieties. All of them are USB and conform to all aspects of the cabling standard, but “USB” is not sufficient to ensure compatibility on a physical&nbsp;level.</p><p>Even with its limitations, it’s still a good idea for specifications to be specific as much as possible. But the world can’t always make a single choice and stick to it. Things start to get more interesting when there’s choice between options, though, so how do we handle&nbsp;that?</p> Discovery <p>If my system can ask your system which options it supports ahead of time, then ostensibly I should be able to pick one of those options and expect it to work. Many standard internet APIs are based around this concept, with an initial discovery phase that sets the parameters of interoperability for future connections.</p><p>This pattern works fairly well, at least for common options and happy paths. If your system supports some or all of what my system wants, then I can probably figure out how to connect to you successfully. If your system doesn’t support what I need, then at least I know I can’t start the process. OpenID Connect usually works from a discovery-based process, where the RP fetches the IdP’s discovery document prior to connecting.</p><p>The discovery pattern is predicated on an agreement of how to do discovery in the first place. I need to at least know how to make an initial call in order to figure out what the options are for all future calls. This is expected to be out of band for the rest of the protocol, but is often built on the same underlying assumptions. Does the protocol assume HTTP as a transport? Then discovery can use that,&nbsp;also.</p><p>Discovery is generally done without context, though. The existence of something in a discovery step does not guarantee that it will be usable in the context of a real request. A server might support seven different cryptographic algorithms, but might only allow some of them to specific clients or request types. That kind of detail is hard to capture through discovery.</p><p>For a physical example, let’s say that before you ask for a USB cable, you can check a list of all the available types that the person you’re asking has available. That way when you ask for a specific cable, you’ll at least know that they had it as an option. But maybe they only had one and already lent it out to someone else, or they only hand out power-only cables to people they haven’t met before, in case the cable goes walkabout.</p> Negotiation <p>If we can instead bake the discovery process into the protocol itself, we can end up with a negotiation pattern. One party makes a request that includes the options that they’re capable of, and the other party responds with their own set of options, or chooses from the first set. From there, both parties now know the parameters the need to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>This kind of option works well with connection-focused protocols, and it has the distinct advantage of avoiding an additional round trip to do discovery. There’s also no longer a need to specify a separate process for discovery, since it’s baked in to the protocol itself. Content negotiation in HTTP, algorithm selection in TLS, and grant negotiation in GNAP all follow this&nbsp;pattern.</p><p>Negotiation falls short when decisions have to be made about the initial connection, much like when there’s a separate discovery call. The protocol can be built to robustly account for those failures, such as a content type being unavailable in HTTP, but the ability to negotiate does not guarantee satisfactory results. Negotiation can also end up with less than ideal results when there’s not a clear preference order, but in such cases it’s possible for a negotiation to continue over several round&nbsp;trips.</p><p>If you need a USB cable, you can walk up to someone and say “Hi, can I borrow a USB cable? I need it to be USB-A or USB-C and I need it for a data connection.” The person you’re asking can then see if they have anything that fits your criteria, and choose appropriately from their supply. If they hand you something that’s less than ideal, you can clarify “I’d really prefer USB-C if you have it, but this will work if&nbsp;not”.</p> Configuration <p>On a simpler level, many developers simply want to choose an option and run with it, and if the other side makes a compatible choice, this can short-circuit any kind of discovery or negotiation process in a positive way. This might seem magical, but it happens way more often than many software architects and standards authors like to admit. It’s not uncommon for two developers to make similar assumptions, or for libraries to influence each others’ implementations such that they end up doing the same thing even without any external agreement to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>If a developer codes up something based on an example, and it works, that developer is not likely to look beyond the example. Why would they? The goal is to get something to connect, and if it does, then that job is done and they can move on to more interesting problems. And if it doesn’t work? Chance are they’ll tweak the piece that doesn’t work until it does&nbsp;work.</p><p>JSON works this way in practice, with well-formed JSON being the interoperability expectation and anything else being, effectively, schema-by-fiat. While there are schema languages on top of JSON, the practical truth is that applications apply their own internal schema-like expectations to the JSON by looking for a field with a certain name in a certain place with a data value that parses how they expect it to. Anything that runs afoul of that is an error not of JSON but for the application to deal with. This is a far cry from the days of XML, which expected processing of namespaces and schemas to make sense of tags at the parsing level. Was it more robust? Arguably, yes. But it was also far too heavy for an average developer to care about. JSON’s approach lets us get to data exchange simply by letting us get it right by accident most of the time, and ignoring things that don’t make&nbsp;sense.</p><p>If you want a USB-C cable but just ask someone for a USB cable, and they hand you a USB-C cable, everyone’s happy. You may have been accidentally interoperable with your request and response, but there’s power in that kind of accident and the frequency with which it&nbsp;happens.</p> Practicality <p>All of these interoperability methods have merit, and most systems are built out of a combination of all of them in one way or another. When we’re defining what interoperability means, we always need to take in the context of what is interoperable, for whom, and when.At the end of the day, practical interoperability means that things connect well enough to get stuff done. We should endeavor to build our standards and systems to allow for robust discovery and negotiation, but always keep in mind that developers will find the best path for them to&nbsp;connect.</p><p>Interoperability is a grand goal indeed, and while a lot of the time we stumble backwards into it, there are well-trodden paths for getting&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>This article shows how a Blazor application can be implemented in a secure way using MudBlazor UI components and Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider. The MudBlazor UI components adds some inline styles and requires a specific CSP setup due to this and the Blazor WASM script requirements. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor">https://github.com/damienbod/MicrosoftEntraIDMudBlazor</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The application is setup using a Blazor WASM UI hosted in an ASP.NET Core application. The MudBlazor Nuget package was added to client project. Some MudBlazor components were added to the UI using MudBlazor <a href="https://mudblazor.com/docs/overview">documentation</a>.</p>







<p></p>



 Security Headers 



<p>The security headers need to be added to protect the session of the web application. I use NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders to implement the headers. We can protect the UI using CSP nonces and so the NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers Nuget package is also used. The following packages are added to the server project. </p>



 
 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders 



 NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers 
 



<p></p>



<p>The SecurityHeadersDefinitions class adds the security headers as best possible for this technical setup. A nonce is used in the CSP for the scripts tag. The ‘unsafe-eval’ value is added to the script CSP definition due to the Blazor WASM technical setup. This reduces the security protections. The unsafe inline is added as a fallback for older browsers. The style CSP definition allows unsafe inline due to the MudBlazor UI components.</p>


  namespace MicrosoftEntraIdMudBlazor.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        if(idpHost == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(idpHost));
        }

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp()) // remove for dev if using hot reload
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();        
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                builder.AddStyleSrc()
                    .UnsafeInline() // due to Mudblazor
                    .Self();

                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .WithNonce()
                    .UnsafeEval() // due to Blazor WASM
                    .UnsafeInline();

                // disable script and style CSP protection if using Blazor hot reload
                // if using hot reload, DO NOT deploy with an insecure CSP
            })
            .RemoveServerHeader()
            .AddPermissionsPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddAccelerometer().None();
                builder.AddAutoplay().None();
                builder.AddCamera().None();
                builder.AddEncryptedMedia().None();
                builder.AddFullscreen().All();
                builder.AddGeolocation().None();
                builder.AddGyroscope().None();
                builder.AddMagnetometer().None();
                builder.AddMicrophone().None();
                builder.AddMidi().None();
                builder.AddPayment().None();
                builder.AddPictureInPicture().None();
                builder.AddSyncXHR().None();
                builder.AddUsb().None();
            });

        if (!isDev)
        {
            // maxage = one year in seconds
            policy.AddStrictTransportSecurityMaxAgeIncludeSubDomains(
        maxAgeInSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);
        }

        policy.ApplyDocumentHeadersToAllResponses();

        return policy;
    }
}
  


<p></p>



<p>The UseSecurityHeaders adds the security headers middleware.</p>


  app.UseSecurityHeaders(SecurityHeadersDefinitions
    .GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(), 
         configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));
  


<p></p>



<p>A nonce is used to protect the UI application and the tag helpers are used for this.</p>


  @addTagHelper *, NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders.TagHelpers
  


<p>The asp-add-nonce adds the nonce to the scripts for all the HTTP responses.</p>


      &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="_content/MudBlazor/MudBlazor.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script asp-add-nonce src="antiForgeryToken.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  


<p></p>



 Microsoft Entra ID 



<p>Microsoft Entra ID is used to protect the Blazor application. The Microsoft.Identity.Web packages are used to implement the OpenID Connect client. The application authentication security is implemented using backend for frontend (BFF) security architecture. The UI part, is a view belonging to the server backend. All security is implemented using the trusted backend and the session is persisted using a secure HTTP only cookie. The WASM uses this cookie for the secure data requests.</p>



 
 Microsoft.Identity.Web 



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI 



 Microsoft.Identity.Web.GraphServiceClient 
 



<p></p>



<p>The AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication implements the UI OpenID Connect client.</p>


  var scopes = configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("DownstreamApi:Scopes");
string[] initialScopes = scopes!.Split(' ');

services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(configuration)
    .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(initialScopes)
    .AddMicrosoftGraph("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0", initialScopes)
    .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
  


<p>Note: if using in-memory cache, the cache gets reset after every application restart, but not the cookie. You need to use a persistent cache or reset the cookie when the tokens are missing.</p>

  <p>How do you survive in a world that is no longer optimized for making
your own clothing when you suddenly find that modern conveniences no
longer accommodate you?  As a textile historian, Morgan has been
ruminating for years about women’s contributions to the domestic
economy, the massive time investment of producing clothing for a
family, and the comparative properties of different textile
fibers. These research interests were informed by a lifetime of sewing
and other fiber crafts. None of this experience, however, properly
prepared her to face the reality of needing to rely on her own hands
to provide large portions of her own wardrobe.</p><p>Guest co-host Juliana Sims sits down with Morgan to talk about how,
in the wake of a recently developed allergy to synthetic fabrics, she
now finds herself putting that knowledge of historical textile
production to use to produce clothing that she can wear.</p><p>Links and other notes:</p>  Morgan presented this as a (much shorter) talk at the <a href="https://dressconference.org/">Dress Conference 2023</a>  <a>Slides from the presentation</a>  <a href="https://mlemmer.org/dissertation/">Morgan's Dissertation</a>, which we <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/34-women-and-wool-working-part1.html">also</a> <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/35-women-and-wool-working-part2.html">covered</a>  <a href="https://mlemmer.org/blog/RSIgloves/">RSI Glove Pattern</a>  <p>The quote that Morgan somewhat misremembered about a woman preparing
wool before the winter:</p><blockquote><p>"A thrifty countrywoman had a small croft, she and her sturdy spouse. He tilled his own land, whether the work called for the plough, or the curved sickle, or the hoe. She would now sweep the cottage, supported on props; now she would set the eggs to be hatched under the plumage of the brooding hen; or she gathered green mallows or white mushrooms, or warmed the low hearth with welcome fire. And yet she diligently employed her hands at the loom, and armed herself against the threats of winter." -- Ovid, Fasti 4.687-714</p></blockquote>

  <p>I participated in a meeting titled “Meta’s Threads Interoperating in the Fediverse Data Dialogue”
at Meta in San Francisco yesterday. It brought together a good number of Meta/Threads
people (across engineering, product, policy), some Fediverse entrepreneurs like myself,
some people who have been involved in ActivityPub standardization, a good number of
industry observers / commentators, at least one journalist, and people from independent
organizations whose objective is to improve the state of the net. Altogether about 30 people.</p>
<p>It was conducted under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_rule">Chatham House rule</a>, so I am only
posting my impressions, and I don’t identify people and what specific people said.
(Although most attendees volunteered for a public group photo at the end; I will post a
link when I get one. Photo added at the bottom of this post.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, I’m not going to comment about larger questions such as
whether Meta is good or bad, should be FediBlock’ed immediately or not; I’m simply
writing down some notes about this meeting.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team has been doing a number of meetings like this, in various geographies
(London was mentioned), and with various stakeholders including the types of people that
came to this meeting, as well as Fediverse instance operators, regulators and civil society.</p>
 
 
<p>Apparently many (most?) invitees to these meetings were invited because other
invitees had been recommending them. I don’t know whether or what kind of future meetings
like this they are planning, but I’d be happy to pass along names if we know each other
and you get in touch. Thanks to – you know who you are – who passed along my name.</p>
 
 
<p>The Threads team comes across as quite competent and thoughtful at what they do.</p>
 
 
<p>On some subjects that are “obvious” to those of use who have hung around open federated
systems long enough like myself, many attendees seemed strangely underinformed. I didn’t get the
impression that they don’t want to know, but simply that integrating with the
“there-is-nobody-in-charge” Fediverse is so different from other types of projects they
have done in the past, they are still finding their bearings. I heard several:
“A year ago, I did not know what the Fediverse was.”</p>
 
 
<p>Rolling out a large node – like Threads will be – in a complex, distributed system that’s
as decentralized and
heterogeneous as the Fediverse is not something anybody really has done before. It’s
unclear what can go wrong, so the right approach appears to be to go step-by-step,
feature by feature: try it, see how it works in practice, fix what needs fixing,
and only then move on to the next feature.</p>
 
 
<p>That gradual approach opens them up to suspicions their implementation is one-sided
and entirely self-serving. I guess that can’t be avoided until everything is deployed
they publicly said they will deploy.</p>
 
 
<p>While there are many challenges, I did get the impression the project is proceeding
more or less as planned, and there are no major obstacles.</p>
 
 
<p>Everybody knows and is aware Meta brings a “trust deficit” to the Fediverse. The best
mitigation mentioned was to be as transparent as possible about all aspects of what
they plan and do.</p>
<p>I think that’s a good approach, but also that they can do far more on transparency than
they have so far. For example, they could publicly share a roadmap and the engineering
rationale for why the steps they identified need to be in this sequence.</p>
 
 
<p>There are many, many questions on many aspects of the Fediverse, from technical
details, to operational best practices, to regulatory constraints and how they apply
to a federated system. The group generally did not know, by and large, how to get them
answered, but agreed that meetings like this serve as a means to connect with people
who might know.</p>
<p>I think this is a problem all across the Fediverse, not specific to Meta. We – the
Fediverse – need to figure out a way to make that easier for new developers;
certainly my own learning curve to catch up was steeper than I would have liked, too.</p>
 
 
<p>Many people did not know about <a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a>, our Fediverse
unconference, and I suspect a bunch of the meeting attendees will come to the
next one (likely in March; we are currently working on picking a date). Many of
the discussions at this meeting would have been right at home as FediForum sessions,
and while I am clearly biased as FediForum organizer, I would argue that doing
meetings like this in an open forum like FediForum could help substantially with
the trust deficit mentioned above.</p>
 
 
<p>There’s significant interest in the Fediverse Test Suite we just
<a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/FediverseTestsuite/">got funding approval</a>
for from the EU’s NGI Zero program. There’s general agreement that the Fediverse
could work “better”, be more reliable, and more be comprehensible to mainstream users,
if we had better the test coverage than the Fediverse has today. This is of interest
to all new (and existing) developers.</p>
 
 
<p>There was a very interesting side discussion on whether it would be helpful for Fediverse
instances (including Threads) to share reputation information with other instances that
each instance might maintain on individual ActivityPub actors for its own purposes already.
Block lists as they are shared today are
a (very primitive) version of this; a more multi-faceted version might be quite
helpful across the Fediverse. This came up in a breakout group discussion, and
was part of brainstorming; I didn’t hear that anybody actually worked on this.</p>
 
 
<p>When we think of privacy risks when Meta connects to the Fediverse, we usually think of
what happens to data that moves from today’s Fediverse into Meta. I didn’t realize the
opposite is also quite a challenge (personal data posted to Threads, making its
way into the Fediverse) for an organization as heavily monitored by regulators around
the world as is Meta.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little talk (not none, but little) about the impact on regulation, such as
the “continuous and real-time access” provision in the EU’s Digital Markets Act and
whether that was a / the driver for Fediverse integration.</p>
 
 
<p>There was very little discussion on business models for Threads, and where exactly
ads would go. For example, would ads just stay within the Threads app, or would they
inject them into ActivityPub feeds, like some companies did with RSS back in the days?
Of course, should that happen, as a non-Threads Fediverse user, one can always unfollow;
there is no way for them to plaster non-Threads users with ads if they
don’t interact with Threads accounts.</p>
 
 
<p>I came away convinced that the team working on Threads indeed genuinely wants to make
federation happen, and have it happen in a “good” way. I did not get any sense whatsoever
that any of the people I interacted were executing any secret agenda, whether
embrace-and-extend, favoring Threads in some fashion or anything like that. (Of course,
that is a limited data point, but I thought I convey it anyway.)</p>
 
 
<p>However, the meeting did not produce a clear answer to the elephant-in-the-room question that was
raised repeatedly by several attendees in several versions, which is some version of:
“All the openness with Threads, namely integration with the Fediverse, supporting account
migration out from Threads etc, is the opposite
of what Facebook/Meta has done over its history. What has fundamentally changed so
that you now believe openness is the better strategy?” And: “In the past Facebook was
a far more open system than it is today, you gradually locked it down. What guarantee
is there that your bosses won’t follow the same playbook this time, even if you
think they won’t?”</p>
<p>Personally I believe this question needs a better answer than has been given publicly
so far, and the answer needs to come from the very top of Meta. The statement must have
staying power beyond what any one executive can deliver.</p>
 
 
<p>I left the meeting with far more questions than I could get answered; but nobody wanted
to stay all night :-)</p>
<p>My gut feel is that it is safe to assume they will do a reasonably fair, responsible job with a gradual
rollout of federation for at least the next year or two or such. Beyond that, and in particular if
it turns out creators with large follower groups indeed move off Threads at a significant
rate (one of the stated reasons why they are implementing Fediverse support as
creators have asked for this), I don’t think we know at all what will happen. (I’m not
sure that anybody knows at this point.) And of course, none of this addresses the
larger issues that Meta has as an organization.</p>
<p>In the hope this summary was useful …</p>

<p>This open letter and touching memoir was written by my friend Washington Sean after listening to my recent ramblings about Trichotomy and anticipated territorial skirmishes over an imagined inter-dimensional bridge where piles of soul bound tokens might be held in the future, inert digital golems awaiting the spirits of inbound travelers. My birthday is later this week and this offering feels like a special gift. It was a delight to picture myself a bit in that magical place beyond the looming gate of St. Thomas Aquinas. And I didn’t have to carry 40 pounds of gear up a mountain! </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about multiverses and portals and one’s life work. After I finished the trichotomy stream, Washington Sean and I exchanged a few emails about consciousness and shipping companies – waves, you know. I brought up W.R. Grace and J. Peter Grace Jr. of the Grace Line, devout Catholics with ties to the Trappist Abbey in Spencer, MA outside Worcester. RFK Jr.’s dad Joseph was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curaT-RXUlA">fellow-Catholic colleague with the Maritime Commission.</a> I sense that standardized contemplative prayer is a key element in the B-Corp social impact “moral economy,” a game where focused spiritualized attention will be used to fuel the Web3 global brain platform. </p>
<p>Below is the stream, I’ll put a screenshot of that map with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpiZ3_P7B_I">link</a> in case you wish to explore where the Grace empire intersects with the Vatican and Zen Buddhist brownie bakeries staffed by former-felons. My friend is a talented photographer. Enjoy his windows into a time before the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>Ok — so I am having a hard time with this last email you sent me. &nbsp;In the email you addressed the concept of a trichotomy as a means of explaining the differences between the mind/spirit, the body and the soul. And you also mentioned Thomas Aquinas and pointed to J Peter Grace and his role as a past Governor (Board of Directors) for a school called Thomas Aquinas College.</p>
<p>Peter Grace, “whose wife was a key player in Vatican II” was also mentioned in your email. This wasn’t unexpected as we had been discussing shipping magnates Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis and their connection to the Negroponte brothers (another typical conversation with Alison, right?) and somehow Peter Grace was mixed in, someone I’d never heard of before. And so, with all of these topics thrown into an email is nothing too out of the ordinary, as our correspondences are often filled with different threads and rabbit holes. But unknowingly on your part, you had sent something else that was embedded in your email — something else that caused a peculiar epiphany – a sort of unsettling realization about our research endeavors that led to an interesting reevaluation of my own past – my own lived experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Specifically, it was your mention of how Thomas Aquinas College was fitting into this mix. I know I’ve mentioned I grew up in Ventura County, but I’ve never told you about the significance of the College in my own life. Nor would I have ever had a reason to until now… So, this is another ‘bizarre’ coincidence — or perhaps more evidence of our ability to tap into the magical realism of our lived experiences – perhaps sharing a mutual ‘frequency’ or a least being signaled to look at certain topics, certain ideas, within a common bandwidth, listening for concepts and symbols that resonate with me, with us, right now.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College now has two locations – and they did not open the Massachusetts location until 2019. But — and here is why this is weird and personal — the California campus is in Ventura County where I grew up. But not just that — the campus sits at the entrance of a popular trail head where I literally ‘grew up’ — as in — where I slowly turned into a man; and where I formed a relationship with God and nature; where I battled my place in the world and contemplated my existence in the future.</p>
<p>The CA campus is located in Santa Paula canyon along state Highway 150 between the communities of Santa Paula and Ojai. It was near the campus that the ‘Thomas Fire’ of 2017 started. The Thomas Fire was, for a brief period, California’s largest wildfire in total burned acreage, scorching over 280,000 acres, but it’s place at the top of the charts was quickly usurped by another raging firestorm in the following season. Several of my close friends lost their homes in that fire including my two best friends. A great effort was made by the local fire department to protect the college a few days after the east winds event was over and when the winds changed, and the fire began to burn back the way it had come. The college experienced only minor physical damage, but the traumatic impact of the fire still lives on in that part of Ventura County.</p>
<p>Ironically, even though I have called the Pacific Northwest home for many years, I was visiting a friend for his birthday in 2017 (on November 30th — surely just another coincidence that November 30th is the same day you sent this perplexing email) who was battling cancer for the 3rd bout.&nbsp; A couple days later his sister’s home in the Ventura foothills, where the birthday party was hosted, was completely obliterated.&nbsp; I looked online at the drone shots that were available and I could pick their house out – a pile of ashes with only a gun safe standing in what used to be the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in town for only two nights, so the day after the birthday party in Ventura I visited my best friend’s home in upper Santa Paula whose house was very close to the origin of the fire that would erupt two days later, and it was among the first to burn down. Of the few things they had time to grab before they left, was the wedding plaque that we had commissioned to be carved in leather commemorating the year of their union (2012). My friend’s wife tells a great story of how she ran back into the house and had to use a stick to knock it off the wall since she could not reach it.</p>
<p>Their home was not far as the crow flies from the campus grounds, and it is odd in fact, that I can still remember driving down Highway 150 after my visit with them as I was on my way back home to my parents’ house where I’d soon bum a ride from my father and get dropped at the Burbank airport and catch the last flight back to Portland. But on that drive home that night I passed by the campus, and I can recall how raw and powerful the winds were already blowing. Call it a premonition, or a hunch, but the thought of fire entered my mind that night, right as I drove by the Thomas Aquinas College campus. Two days later, the winds would grow even more ferocious and would knock down an electrical wire, sparking the fire. By that Tuesday I had learned what had happened. And it was on a Wednesday morning that I would be delivering opening remarks for the small non-profit I was president of at the time. It was our annual awards breakfast and while I kept a cheery face for our sponsors and guests, inside I was solemn and grieving, and I couldn’t help but feel a tad guilty for having a premonition, not having the knowledge or intuitive sense of how to act on it, and then learning how many of my friends were now burned out of their homes, their lives forever altered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Thomas Aquinas College campus sits above the Santa Paula creek on a small bluff nestled between hilly terrain at the mouth of Santa Paula canyon. This is not a ‘mighty river’ or a mountain river that one might see or think of as imagined in one of the more pristine national parks of the Sierra Nevada. The Santa Paula creek is a typical river of the Los Padres National Forest. Much of the time, rivers in southern California run at a low flow rate and often they can barely muster a trickle or even dry up completely, running ephemerally for long stretches before entering the myriad of pathways into the greater water table. However, during periods of heavy rain, these same little creeks can turn into flood channels of immense power and geological change – deluges capable of swallowing huge swaths of land and altering the landscape in a matter of days or hours. The clay soils have poor drainage and cannot absorb the water fast enough. And after intense fires, the sage, manzanita, and scrub brush of the chapparal can leave a layer of plant derived oil that coats the surface with a thin, impermeable layer, further exacerbating the drainage issues. Thus, the Los Padres National Forest, and the terrain around the Santa Paula canyon are areas that have been experiencing rapid geological transformation – occurring in faster cycles than more stout or solid mountain ranges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a sulphur spring near the mouth of the Santa Paula canyon. The smell is thick, and the pronounced stench of rotten eggs is hard to miss on the highway, as it just before the main trailhead parking areas. Up until very recently, by grant of an old easement with the Thomas Aquinas College, the National Forest Service, and the other ranch and property owners, the first mile of the trail actually cut through the campus property, ascending a few hundred feet in elevation along an asphalt road. The road crests by the Ferndale Ranch (home to a meandering flock of peacocks for many years) then drops down and heads around a bend. The last point on private property was just past the oil wells where the road ended, and a dirt trail formally began. It was only a few years ago that the campus was finally successful in obtaining new easement rights along the creek directly to the parking lots so that the official trail no longer goes through the campus property at all. But from the time I was a child and even through my 20’s and late 30’s the trail always involved that long, winding road.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My first trip into Santa Paula canyon was in 4th grade – as part of a day long field trip through my public elementary school. In fact, now that I think of it, lots of the public school kids in took day trips to the Ferndale Ranch (located just beyond the College campus) and hiked in to Punch Bowls — about 2 1/2 miles of hiking with a fairly steep and laborious slug up a hill at the end to climb for nine and ten year olds. The cliffs near the punch bowls were really dangerous — and the water could easily kill drown a child or adult during the non-drought years – as a series of cascading pools with increasingly large cliff jumps was more the stuff of adventurers and high school kids, not elementary or middle schoolers. I did not do the jumps until in my early twenties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year after I did the ‘outdoor education’ through my public elementary school, it would have been 1992 or 1993, the district discontinued the program as a tragic drowning occurred with another school — a 12-year-old boy passed away when he got sucked over the falls. But even though the schools stopped taking kids there, the popularity of the spot has only grown and my mother kept taking us there through our adolescence. In fact, she used to call it ‘church’ and on more than one occasion she called in sick for us and took us hiking so that we could “go to church.” Raised catholic, but never practicing, my mom considered it more important to be in nature than in a giant building when it came to praising God and his creation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it was later in my life that the East Fork trail and Santa Paula Canyon became even more important. One of my best friends, the one who would later lose his home near the origin of the Thomas Fire, was the one who introduced me and another friend to the camp. He had been there as a boy with his father, and he had sort of rediscovered it. Through the Thomas Aquinas college campus, up the Santa Paula Canyon trail and then past the popular ‘Punch Bowls’ (we always called them the moon rocks) hiking spot, was the old and in some spots, quite non-existent trail that went up the East Fork that led to the secret camp. Truth be told, it wasn’t really ‘secret’, and it was more like ‘rediscovered’. The camp, that we endearingly called ‘the land of one hundred waters’, was shown on some older maps, not on newer ones. But Santa Paula Peak, situated prominently above the valley where the camp was located, was listed on the Sierra Clubs’ Top 50 Peaks in California. And other prominent hikers knew of the camp and old trails. So, while it was sort of hard to get to and somewhat forgotten, the idea of it being a true secret was more romanticized than reality. The camp actually use to have a wagon trail to it (supposedly) in the late 19th century, where pioneer families would take extended vacations, but our ascent was always along the worn and mostly faded away and long neglected trail.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the 2004-2005 floods, most of even the old trail washed away and it became more like boulder scrambling until the very last bit. Despite the technical difficulty and the lack of stable ground, the destination made it worth it. The camp was ‘a secret camp’ partly because it had some improvements that were added by a generation of hikers and campers that came before us. My friend’s father was a member of these hikers, part of a group of friends comprising an informal fraternity of sorts. The camp they built for themselves in the late 70’s and early 80’s included improvements that most camps do not have – especially those that are a full day’s hard walk through arduous terrain. The camp featured a twenty-foot long picnic table built out of a large fir tree that had been cut down and milled on site. There was also an asadero style bbq grill and an assortment of cast iron pots, skillets and other cookware. Nearby springs flowed year-round amidst a flat parcel of ground submerged beneath the deep shade of canyon live oaks that were hundreds of years old. Chumash griding bowls and mortars have been found in the area while exploring off the trails. About another thousand feet in elevation, above the camp, and along another worn and overgrown trail, there was located another camp sitting in huge boulders and cliffs comprised of sandstone and siltstone. The cliffs had this reddish tinge or hue to them that when hit with the last rays of sunlight, they’d turn the most amazing color before our eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we first started our hikes, the trail began by going through the large green cast iron gates at the entrance to the campus by the highway. On the weekends, the gates were locked and hikers were instructed by a sign to use the non-vehicle entrance. Strict instructions marked on signs all along the part of the road through the campus were hard to miss and the security guard was largely dedicated to making sure the hikers never wandered off the route. It almost felt intentional – the way the trailhead made the route so much longer. Surely, as we had tried on more than one occasion, there was a quicker, more efficient way through the campus.&nbsp; But on the weekends, hundreds, sometimes even over a thousand people on a real hot spell, would use the trailhead in search of the reliable swimming holes further up the canyon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All in all, I have spent over a year of my life sleeping in this place. Starting at nineteen and through a lot of my twenties, I needed to be there, up the East Fork, at the secret camp, at the headwaters, near the eternal springs, nestled amidst the oaks and old growth firs, above the dominion of the Thomas Aquinas Campus. I wasn’t the only one. I shared this experience with my best friends. Even my wife has spent a few weeks camping up in this place and would know the college if mentioned. I could tell stories for hours of this place.</p>
<p>Five nights here, three or four days there – the days turned into weeks and the weeks piled into months. I soon realized that I was spending much of my free time going to this place. When I wasn’t working or on another adventure, I made my best effort to get my bag packed and get up the mountain. When I was faced with either getting a new roommate or moving into my van to save money, I chose my van. I was already spending so much time at camp – it was an easy choice and it helped me save money even quicker for the big trip to New Zealand I had been planning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quickly however, it became apparent that Thomas Aquinas College with its big cast iron gates and zealous security guards was a barrier to our adventures up the mountain. Eventually, even parking on the highway at the trailhead would become too risky as more than one of us had our windows smashed. So, finding a cut-through, or a quicker path to the get to camp was a matter of circumstance, not choice. The impedance of the college and its long and winding road became cumbersome and annoying. For most people, the hike ended at around the 3 ½ mile mark – when they got to moon rocks. But for us, that was only about a quarter of the way, and the biggest nuisance was always going through the gates and walking up the long and winding road around the campus water reclamation pond (fancy for on-site sewage treatment). It took at least thirty or forty-five minutes to walk that first section – getting past the oil wells and onto the rock and dirt track always offered a sigh of relief. A mile is not that far, but it is a noticeable distance that was hard to ignore with 40-50lbs of rations and gear stuffed in a backpack. Clearly, we were hindered and greatly bothered with what seemed extra or unnecessary labor put in front of us by the College.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, we got bikes. We would use our bikes and ride up the hill along the asphalt path in extra low gear. Still physically difficult, but much quicker. And even better – on the way back we would really shave off the drag and droll of finishing a weekend of backpacking by plopping relentlessly along a hot, stinky asphalt path back to civilization. What better way than to whizz through the campus and down the hill in a mere instant – or about 25 mph. The security guard actually scolded us one time when we were riding our bikes too fast as even the cars were expected to observe a 15 mph speed limit.</p>
<p>Truth be told – there was actually another way to get to our secret camp – from an entirely different direction. So, in a sense, we could escape the dominion and the gates of Thomas Aquinas if we absolutely wanted to. We had found a way to our paradise that circumnavigated the more obvious and conventional path. But the other route featured its own drawbacks. First, it required an access code through a locked gate – so only certain people knew how to acquire the code (another easement battle from a forlorn era). But with the code, we could travel up the mouth of Timber canyon and ascend up the face of Santa Paula Peak. Like the Santa Paula Canyon trail, part of this felt redundant as there was, feasibly, a dirt road that would allow us to start closer to the actual forest (reserved public lands) lands. But we did not have permission to drive on the dirt roads. And this trail, being on an exposed and very sunny south face of a prominent 5,000 foot peak (the peak used to house a fire lookout tower and it was confirmed that a double-wide trail suitable for dirt bike travel used to exist all the way to the summit), was hard to climb during the day, and even in the winter months depending on the weather. We’d typically hike up the peak trail when cooler weather was around. On more than a few occasions we hiked up the peak at night. While better maintained and easier to navigate (up until 2021 washouts on the backside) this trail required more climbing and had a long descent into camp.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Weigh points along the peak trail last comprised of the following spots: ‘the house’ (burned in Thomas Fire but was the old trailhead start), the gate, the oaks (now known as ‘cow shit camp’, Kenny’s hill, the switchbacks, lunch rock, orange peel, soda pop, the peak spur, the saddle, the grassy spot, the last turn.</p>
<p>Weigh points along the canyon trail and the East Fork were last comprised of the following spots: The Gates (start of trail at highway), Ferndale, Noel’s place, the Oil well, the washout (aka ‘hell hill’), big cone, moon rocks, first crossing, log jam, poison oak camp, land of the milky white rocks, the witches portal, the flats, the spring trail, the meadow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I already mentioned, most hikers going up the canyon stopped just past big cone or the moon rocks (popularly known as the Punch Bowls), but our journey was always much longer. During the summer months we’d stash extra beers in the creek near the moon rocks for the last stop on our return hike home. Before retrieving our bikes (also stashed nearby) we would drink, swim and eat whatever last rations we had managed to save. Our adventures ended with riding the rest of the trail in a slightly altered state of consciousness, gleefully blowing past the other hikers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually we learned the cycle of the big weekend hikers and campers could occasionally yield substantial gleanings of food, clothes and an assortment of abandoned camping gear. Descending the trail after a big summer weekend filled with tourists came with the feeling of returning to civilization in phases – the moon rocks and surrounding camping areas functioned as a sort of open-air dumpster or secondhand store. Any valuable gear we found we would stash for our next hike up. But discarded food stuffs such as ultra-processed and flavor enhanced cheese chips or a bag (opened or not it wouldn’t matter) of fortified and enriched chocolate chip cookies was always a welcome addition to our favorite end of hike snack – the ‘tuna boat’ – a green bell pepper stuffed with chunk tuna and chopped onions, cilantro and jalapeno or serrano, and finished with a few dallops of hot sauce from a fast food condiment packet.</p>
<p>Groups of people would come to the moon rocks from the nearby towns of Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo and Port Hueneme for day hikes. Sometimes even people from Los Angeles County would hike in the canyon near the popular swimming spots. In my lifetime, the canyon acquired great popularity and many young people found it a particularly cool place to ‘camp out and party’. The drinking and revelry often combined with a lack of experience in many of the camping basics –concepts that we took for granted like what to bring and how to stay nourished and hydrated were not taught in the limited curriculum of field trips and ‘outdoor education’ available in elementary school. This resulted in a great number of hang overs and many of the inexperienced campers simply abandoning leftover food, dirty clothes, and even perfectly good gear that just looked too heavy to carry to a nineteen-year-old with a throbbing headache. Their discarded leftovers were always our miraculous discoveries.</p>
<p>So much of my life, my energy field, the imprint of who I am (and who I am still to become) is in relation to that magical place. I have hundreds (probably thousands) of photos of my time in the East Fork canyon and Los Padres National Forest. I hope you can appreciate the significance of the coincidence and the elements of magical realism that present here.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College was always a gatekeeper – not just a ‘way’ point, on our trail, but also, a ‘weigh’ point, a spot on the trail that weighed both our packs and our worthiness as we traveled through its dominion. After passing through the gates, it taxed us appropriately on our travels into higher realms.</p>
<p>The important work that I would do up in the camps and bluffs above the dominion of the college, beyond the realm of the material world, was spiritual work. True, our materialist trappings of fine cuts of meat, malted ales and other liquors, legumes, potatoes and assorted vegetables, they always traveled with us, as they served to literally weigh us down all along the chosen route. But the majority of the work done at camp was always spiritual work. In fact, one of my best friends, (not the one who lived right next to the fire, but who also lost his home(s) to the fire), worked for several years to construct his very own cabin, hidden away from camp up in the bluffs, nestled in its own little nook. It was a beautiful little forest cabin before it burned down in the Thomas Fire. It was comprised of a variety of native stone and hand-hewn lumber, and also some building materials he had carried in. It had taken him months of accumulated time to build it, almost all by his own hand. Before it burned down, he used to refer to it as ‘his life’s work.’</p>
<p></p>
<p>What is this notion of our ‘life’s work’? The time that I craved to be there – and the amount of time I spent there – for some it was perceived as escaping from work or escaping from responsibility – from existence in the material realm. But it never felt like that for me.&nbsp; It was a place of great importance, and learning. Of experiments and mysteries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I didn’t understand it in this way then – but the important barrier (or bridge) that Thomas Aquinas College served in my travels isn’t just an inconvenience. It was a physical burden to have to pass through the gates of Thomas Aquinas College and walk the extra mile. But now, now I see that it was also a spiritual bridge that they controlled – or, more precisely, closely monitored.</p>
<p>At first, I used to believe that the college was not receptive of the hikers, and that they’d rather not have us there. The stern nature of the signs and security guards keeping everyone on the right path seemed bothersome to the pristine and peaceful environment that was cultivated on the campus grounds. But now, re-thinking the role not as an inconvenience to the college, but instead, as a chosen duty, or a higher calling, a sort of self-endowed guardianship over a gateway and control of the bridge, or the portal, from one dimension to the next. The college watched over my travels as I left material world and prepared to ascend into the spiritual world. They were monitoring my travel into and out of Gods splendor – now I see that it was not an accident that the college situated itself in this manner. The perceived hacks and different techniques my friends and I learned to get around the expectation and presumed relationship with the College as gate keeper and pathway enforcer were beneficial to us, but that did not diminish the college’s dominion over the bridge or the majority of other hikers. In fact, it was only because of our desire to return to the higher realms over and over again that the important role the college served became noticeable. Had I only hiked into the canyon on occasion, it would be easy to overlook. But having made this special place my literal second home, the college was always the first weigh point on the longer journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas College is not far from several other notable institutions of learning and foundations of spiritual significance. The Ojai Valley has been a center of new thought for well over a century now (and quite longer if considering indigenous cosmology). Just over four miles from the college campus as the crow flies, there is the Ojai Valley School, an alternative education school for children founded in 1911. And not far off, perhaps another mile or so further west is the Thacher School, established even earlier in 1887. Situated close to the Thacher school is the Krishnamurti Foundation for America, another well-known institution. It was in 1922, in Ojai, where Jiddu Krishnamurti is said to have had a “life changing experience.” Directly to the west of Thomas Aquinas College, about five miles away and sitting atop the summit of Sulphur Mountain is Meher Mount – a spiritual retreat center first established in 1946 and dedicated to the Avatar Baba Meher. A little further west and centrally located in the small town of Ojai is the Krotona Theosopical Society – first founded in Hollywood in 1912, and later relocated in Ojai in 1922. Yogi Paramahansa Yogananda was known to visit the area and helped found his spiritual sanctuary in 1950 as part of his self-realization fellowship. No doubt there are more places of spiritual and cultural significance in and around Thomas Aquinas College. The reputation of the area precedes itself.</p>
<p>However, in taking a step back and thinking about the college’s place differently, and in general contemplating what it is about this area that has drawn so many to the area in search of enlightenment, I could not help but wonder – where the energy is coming from? Is it inherent in the land, as if by a magical grid or ley lines? Or is this energy coming in from somewhere else?</p>
<p>Just south of the campus and the sulphur springs, about two miles away, is another site of importance that has reemerged as important – perhaps the most significant and important site of all – that suggests broadening my horizons even further – and asking, or perhaps, doing the work to begin to formulate new questions, better questions, that stretch my understanding of the intelligent forces at work in our world.</p>
<p>COMSAT, a global satellite communications company, established its teleport site in Santa Paula in 1975. The site is shown on the COMSAT webpage under its ‘commercial’ heading. But, as of November 1, 2023, COMSAT, and SatCom Direct, are now part of Goonhilly. The technical components at the site and the capabilities of the site far exceed mere commercial endeavors.</p>
<p>For many years I just assumed that the satellite dishes and arrays that are visible from the highway, just south of the gates at Thomas Aquinas, were nothing special – just more telecommunications equipment for the burgeoning cellular telephone industry. Now I understand that the array there is unique – and possesses capabilities to look farther into space – into a cosmic void where one day we might discover the true meaning of intelligence.</p>
<p>Goonhilly “is one of the world’s premier space communication gateways providing control and uplinks for satellites and deep space missions.” With the recent acquisition of COMSAT Teleports, including the Santa Paula site, Goonhilly is expanding “all communication service offerings from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) right through commercial GEO to lunar and deep space.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goonhilly’s first site was located at Goonhilly Downs, near Helston on the Lizard Pennisula in Cornwall, England. Under a 999-year lease from British Telecom (BT Inc.) it was one of the largest stations in the world at its inception and still possesses some of the most advanced capabilities on the planet. Its parabolic dish, nicknamed ‘Arthur,’ was one of the first of its kind. Its current largest dish, called ‘Merlin’ is equally impressive in the modern era.</p>
<p>Now, connected to the Santa Paula site next to the Thomas Aquinas College (and others around the earth), Goonhilly has positioned itself in many ways as its own kind of keeper, or guardian, of our ability to move from one dimension to the next. Goonhilly maintains the flow of information as it is transformed from the physical experience into digitized atoms and bits that are parceled and scattered into the heavens. As the information slowly coalesces and comes back together again, it is Goonhilly that is now positioned to monitor and carefully watch over our access to intelligence and information as we pursue our rightful place in existence and amongst the higher realms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Space signaling, and earth-based radar as a form of communication and wayfinding from one dimension to the next, is a technologically complex subject that I don’t ever think I will fully understand. Nor should I have to. As long as I am alive, I will keep my eyes (and my heart) open to discovering new ways around the barriers or tolled bridges or locked gates that slow me down and impede my journey. As long as I am alive, I will look for ways to lighten my pack and quicken my journey as I pass by the weigh points.</p>

<p>It was 11am at the Fort Lauderdale airport, an hour after my non-stop flight to Portland was supposed to have boarded. As I had been watching our estimated departure get pushed back in 15 minute increments, I finally received the dreaded news over the loudspeaker - the flight was cancelled entirely. As hordes of people started lining up to rebook their flights with the gate agent, I found a quiet spot in the corner and opened up my laptop to look at my options.</p>

<p>The other Alaska Airlines flight options were pretty terrible. There was a Fort Lauderdale to Seattle to Portland option that would have me landing at midnight. A flight on a partner airline had a 1-hour connection through Dallas, and there were only middle seats available on both legs. So I started to get creative, and searched for flights from Orlando, about 200 miles north. There was a non-stop on Alaska Airlines at 7pm, with plenty of available seats, so I called up customer service and asked them to change my booking. Since the delay was their fault, there were no change fees even though the flight was leaving from a different airport.</p>

<p>So now it was my responsibility to get myself from Miami to Orlando by 7pm. I could have booked a flight on a budget airline for $150, but it wouldn't have been a very nice experience, and I'd have a lot of time to kill in the Orlando airport. Then I remembered the Brightline train recently opened new service from Miami to Orlando, supposedly taking less time than driving there.</p>

 Brightline Station Fort Lauderdale 

<p></p>

<p>Never having tried to take that train before, I didn't realize they run a shuttle service from the Fort Lauderdale airport to the train station, so I jumped in an Uber headed to the station. On the way there, I booked a ticket on my phone. The price from Miami to Orlando was $144 for Coach, or $229 for Premium class. Since this will probably be the only time I take this train for the foreseeable future, I splurged for the Premium class ticket to see what that experience is like.</p>

<p>Astute readers will have noticed that I mentioned I booked a ticket from Miami rather than Fort Lauderdale. We'll come back to that in a bit. Once I arrived at the station, I began my Brightline experience.</p>

<p>Walking in to the station felt like something between an airport and a car rental center.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a small ticket counter in the lobby, but I already had a ticket on my phone so I went up the escalators.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the top of the escalators was an electronic gate where you scan your QR code to go through. Mine didn't work (again, more on that later), but it was relatively empty and a staff member was able to look at my ticket on my phone and let me through anyway. There was a small X-Ray machine, I tossed my roller bag and backpack onto the belt, but kept my phone and wallet in my pocket, and walked through the security checkpoint.</p>

<p>Once through the minimal security checkpoint, I was up in the waiting area above the platform with a variety of different sections. There was a small bar with drinks and snacks, a couple large seating areas, an automated mini mart, some tall tables...</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>... and the entrance to the Premium lounge.</p>

 Brightline Station Premium Lounge 

<p></p>

<p>The Premium Lounge entrance had another electronic gate with a QR code scanner. I tried getting in but it also rejected my boarding pass. My first thought was I booked my ticket just 10 minutes earlier so it hadn't synced up yet, so I went back to the the security checkpoint and asked what was wrong. They looked at my boarding pass and had no idea what was wrong, and let me in to the lounge via the back employee-only entrance instead.</p>

<p>Once inside the lounge, I did a quick loop to see what kind of food and drink options there were. The lounge was entirely un-attended, the only staff I saw were at the security checkpoint, and someone occasionally coming through to take out dirty dishes.</p>

<p>The first thing you're presented with after entering the lounge is the beverage station. There are 6 taps with beer and wine, and you use a touch screen to make your selection and pour what you want.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the other side of the wall is the food. I arrived at the tail end of the breakfast service, so there were pretty slim pickings by the end.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were yogurts, granola, a bowl of bacon and egg mix, several kinds of pastries, and a bowl of fruit that nobody seemed to have touched. I don't know if this was just because this was the end of the morning, but if you were vegan or gluten free there was really nothing you could eat there.</p>

<p>There was also a coffee and tea station with some minimal options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I arrived, it rolled over to lunch time, so the staff came out to swap out the food at the food station. The lunch options were also minimal, but there was a bit more selection.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a good size meat and cheese spread. I'm not a big fan of when they mix the meat and cheese on the same plate, but there was enough of a cheese island in the middle I was reasonably confident I wasn't eating meat juice off the side of the cheeses. The pasta dish also had meat so I didn't investigate further. Two of the three wraps had meat and I wasn't confident about which were which so I skipped those. There was a pretty good spinach and feta salad, and some hummus as well as artichoke dip, and a variety of crackers. If you like desserts, there was an even better selection of small desserts as well.</p>

<p>At this point I was starting to listen for my train's boarding announcement. There was really barely any staff visible anywhere, but the few people I saw had made it clear they would clearly announce the train over the loudspeakers when it was time. There was also a sign at the escalators to the platform that said boarding opens 10 minutes before the train departs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The trains run northbound and southbound every 1-2 hours, so it's likely that you'll only hear one announcement for a train other than yours the entire time you're there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The one train announcement I heard was a good demonstration of how quickly the whole process actually is once the train shows up. The train pulls up, they call everyone down to the platform, and you have ten minutes to get onto the train. Ten minutes isn't much, but you're sitting literally right on top of the train platform so it takes no time to get down there.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once your train is called, it's time to head down the escalator to the train platform!</p>

 Boarding the Train 

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>But wait, I mentioned my barcode had failed to be scanned a couple times at this point. Let me explain. Apparently, in my haste in the back of the Uber, I had actually booked a ticket from Miami to Orlando, but since I was already at the Fort Lauderdale airport, I had gone to the Fort Lauderdale Brightline station since it was the closest. So the departure time I saw on my ticket didn't match the time the train arrived at Fort Lauderdale, and the ticket gates refused to let me in because the ticket didn't depart from that station. I don't know why none of the employees who looked at my ticket mentioned this ever. It didn't end up being a big deal because thankfully Miami was earlier in the route, so I essentially just got on my scheduled train 2 stops late.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So anyway, I made my way down to the platform to board the train. I should also mention at this point that I was on a conference call from my phone. I had previously connected my phone to the free wifi at the station, and it was plenty good enough for the call. As I went down the escalator to the platform, it broke up a bit in the middle of the escalator, but picked back up once I was on the platform outside.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There were some signs on the platform to indicate "Coach 1", "Coach 2" and "Coach 3" cars. However my ticket was a "Premium" ticket, so I walked to where I assumed the front of the train would be when it pulled up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I got on the train on the front car marked "SMART" and "3", seats 9-17. It wasn't clear what "SMART" was since I didn't see that option when booking online. My seat was seat 9A, so I wasn't entirely sure I was in the right spot, but I figured better to be on the train than on the platform, so I just went in. We started moving shortly after. As soon as I walked in, I had to walk past the train attendant pushing a beverage cart through the aisles. I made it to seat 9, but it was occupied. I asked the attendant where my seat was, and she said it was in car 1 at the "front", and motioned to the back of the train. I don't know why their cars are in the opposite order you'd expect. So I took my bags back to car 1 where I was finally greeted with the "Premium" sign I was looking for.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was quickly able to find my seat, which was not in fact occupied. The Premium car was configured with 2 seats on one side and 1 seat on the other side.</p>

 The Brightline Premium Car 

<p></p>

<p>Some of the seats are configured to face each other, so there is a nice variety of seating options. You could all be sitting around a table if you booked a ticket for 4 people, or you could book 2 tickets and sit either next to each other or across from each other.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since I had booked my ticket so last minute, I had basically the last available seat in the car so I was sitting next to someone. As soon as I sat down, the beverage cart came by with drinks. The cart looked like the same type you'd find on an airplane, and even had some identical warning stickers on it such as the "must be secured for takeoff and landing" sign. The drink options were also similar to what you'd get on a Premium Economy flight service. I opted for a glass of prosecco, and made myself comfortable.</p>

<p>The tray table at the seat had two configurations. You could either drop down a small flap or the whole tray.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The small tray was big enough to hold a drink or an iPad or phone, but not much else. The large tray was big enough for my laptop with a drink next to it as well as an empty glass or bottle behind it.</p>

<p>Under the seat there was a single power outlet for the 2 seats with 120v power as well as two USB-C ports.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shortly after I had settled in, the crew came back with a snack tray and handed me these four snacks without really giving me the option of refusing any of them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point I wasn't really hungry since I had just eaten at the airport, so I stuffed the snacks in my bag, except for the prosciutto, which I offered to my seat mate but he refused.</p>

<p>By this point we were well on our way to the Boca Raton stop. A few people got off and on there, and we continued on. I should add here that I always feel a bit unsettled when there is that much movement of people getting on and off all the time. These stops were about 20-30 minutes away from each other, which meant the beginning of the ride I never really felt completely settled in. This is the same reason I prefer a 6 hour flight over two 3 hour flights. I like to be able to settle in and just not think about anything until we arrive.</p>

<p>We finally left the last of the South Florida stops, West Palm Beach, and started the rest of the trip to Orlando. A bunch of people got off at West Palm Beach, enough that the Premium cabin was nearly empty at that point. I was able to move to the seat across the aisle which was a window/aisle seat all to myself!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally I could settle in for the long haul. Shortly before 3, the crew came by with the lunch cart. The options were either a vegetarian or non-vegetarian option, so that made the choice easy for me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The vegetarian option was a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich, a side of fruit salad, and some vegetables with hummus. The hummus was surprisingly good, not like the little plastic tubs you get at the airport. The sandwich was okay, but did have a nice pesto spread on it.</p>

<p>After lunch, I opened up my computer to start writing this post and worked on it for most of the rest of the trip.</p>

<p>As the train started making a left turn to head west, the conductor came on the loudspeaker and made an announcement along the lines of "we're about to head west onto the newest tracks that have been built in the US in 100 years. We'll be reaching 120 miles per hour, so feel free to feel smug as we whiz by the cars on the highway." And sure enough, we really picked up the speed on that stretch! While we had reached 100-120mph briefly during the trip north, that last stretch was a solid 120mph sustained for about 20 minutes!</p>

 Orlando Station 

<p></p>

<p>We finally slowed down and pulled into the Orlando station at the airport.</p>

<p>Disembarking the train was simple enough. This was the last stop of the train so there wasn't quite as much of a rush to get off before the train started again. There's no need to mind the gap as you get off since there's a little platform that extends from the train car.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the Orlando station there was a short escalator up and then you exit through the automated gates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I assumed I would have to scan my ticket when exiting but that ended up not being the case. Which actually meant that the only time my ticket was ever checked was when entering the station. I never saw anyone come through to check tickets on the train.</p>

<p>At this point I was already in the airport, and it was a short walk around the corner to the tram that goes directly to the airport security checkpoint.</p>

<p>The whole trip took 176 minutes for 210 miles, which is an average speed of 71 miles per hour. When moving, we were typically moving at anywhere from 80-120 miles per hour.</p>

 Summary 

 
 The whole experience was way nicer than an airplane, I would take this over a short flight from Miami to Orlando any day. 
 It felt similar to a European train, but with service closer to an airline. 
 The service needs to be better timed with the stops when people are boarding. 
 The only ticket check was when entering the station, nobody came to check my ticket or seat on the train, or even when I left the destination station. 
 While the Premium car food and drinks were free, I'm not sure it was worth the $85 extra ticket price over just buying the food you want. 
 Unfortunately the ticket cost was similar to that of budget airlines, I would have preferred the cost to be slightly lower. But even still, I would definitely take this train over a budget airline at the same cost. 
 

<p>We need more high speed trains in the US! I go from Portland to Seattle often enough that a train running every 90 minutes that was faster than a car and easier and more comfortable than an airplane would be so nice!</p>

  Just before Thanksgiving, NPR‘s All Things Considered radio program had a short item on DMARC, a protocol that attempts to control fraudulent use of internet domains by email spammers by asserting that messages coming from those domains are authenticated using DKIM or SPF.

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, <a href="https://www.npr.org/">NPR</a>‘s <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/">All Things Considered</a> radio program had a <a href="https://www-cf.npr.org/2023/11/21/1214529474/how-to-keep-an-eye-out-for-cyber-scams-during-this-holiday-shopping-season">short item</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>, a protocol that attempts to control fraudulent use of internet domains by email spammers by asserting that messages coming from those domains are authenticated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework">SPF</a>. Since I have been working in that area, a colleague alerted me to the coverage and I listened to it online.</p>



<p>A couple of people asked me about my opinion of the article, which I thought might be of interest to others as well.</p>



 



<p>From the introduction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Cybercriminals love the holiday season. The internet is flooded with ads clamoring for shoppers’ attention, and that makes it easier to slip in a scam. At this point, you probably know to watch out for phishing emails, but it might surprise you to know that there’s a tool that’s been around a long time that could help solve this problem. It’s called DMARC – or the Domain Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance Protocol – whew. It’s actually pretty simple. It basically helps prove the sender is who they say they are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course it doesn’t help prove the sender is who they say they are at all, it expresses a request for what to do when the sender doesn’t. But I’ll forgive this one since it’s the interviewer’s misunderstanding.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ROBERT HOLMES: DMARC seeks to bring trust and confidence to the visible from address of an email so that when you receive an email from an address at wellsfargo.com or bestbuy.com, you can say with absolute certainty it definitely came from them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(1) There is no “visible from address”. Most mail user agents (webmail, and programs like Apple Mail) these days leave out the actual email address and only display the “friendly name”, which isn’t verified at all. I get lots of junk email with addresses like:</p>



 From: Delta Airlines &lt;win-Eyiuum8@Eyiuum8-DeltaAirlines.com&gt; 



<p>This of course isn’t going to be affected by Delta’s DMARC policy (which only applies to email with a From address of @delta.com), but a lot of recipients are going to only see “Delta Airlines.” Even if the domain was visible, it’s not clear how much attention the public pays to the domain, compounded by the fact that this one is deceptively constructed.</p>



<p>(2) There is no absolute certainty. Even with a DKIM signature in many cases a bogus <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8601">Authentication-Results</a> header field could be added, or the selector record in DNS could be spoofed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing">cache poisoning</a>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: So the thing about good security – it should be invisible to Joe Public.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This seems to imply that the public doesn’t need to be vigilant as long as the companies implement DMARC. Not a good message to send. And of course p=none, which for many domains is the only safe policy to use, isn’t going to change things at all, other than to improve deliverability to Yahoo and Gmail.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>HOLMES: I think the consequences of getting this wrong are severe. Legitimate email gets blocked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Inappropriate DMARC policies cause a lot of legitimate email blockage as well.</p>



<p>When we embarked on this authentication policy thing (back when we were doing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5617/">ADSP</a>), I hoped that it would cause domains to separate their transactional and advertising mail, use different domains or subdomains for those, and publish appropriate policies for those domains. It’s still not perfect, since some receive-side forwarders (e.g., alumni addresses) break DKIM signatures. But what has happened instead is a lot of blanket requirements to publish restrictive DMARC policies regardless of the usage of the domain, such as the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-18-01-enhance-email-and-web-security">CISA requirement on federal agencies</a>. And of course there has been a big marketing push from DMARC proponents that, in my opinion, encourages domains to publish policies that are in conflict with how their domains are used.</p>



<p>Going back to my earlier comment, I really wonder if domain-based policy mechanisms like DMARC provide significant benefit when the domain isn’t visible. On the other hand, DMARC does cause definite breakage, notably to mailing lists.</p>

  <p>Some riddles are so complex that people just stop contemplating, and concede. Here on the VRM dev list, over many years, the struggle to explain structural concepts in motion has fought for words in a social context that disavows progress by design. There is only one place where "self-induced Sovereignty" is approachable in accurate human terms, and conversing the methods elsewhere, like Canada, Europe, China, or via the modern Administrative State, etc... is a failure at inception, and the process of grabbing the word to apply policy obfuscations on accurate use is intentional. As has been discussed plenty of times, the State-defined "Sovereign citizen movement" is the most dangerous ideology&nbsp;in existence, and the people who live under its definition are the most dangerous people in existence. I mean, have you seen them all out there doing what they do, acting all Sovereign unto themselves? Scary stuff, right?</p> "Human Rights" is another great example, used pervasively in Government administration, and by identity entrepreneurs in aggressively collating the un-identified/&nbsp;un-banked/&nbsp;un-civilized. Powerful words and concepts are always open to perversion by intent, and require courageous stewardship to hold accountable to the actual meaning conferred by utterance. Most western societies operate under the belief that human rights exist, and their society protects them. Yet, in defining the human rights for and unto the human population being administered, the order of operations is strictly accurate, where words documenting process fall well-short.&nbsp;  <br>  In the US, human rights are administered rights. Prior to administration, there is no&nbsp;functional concept of human rights, thats why the UN applies its language to the most vulnerable, children, as it does... an administered right to administration of Nationality and Identity sets the stage for data existence. You, the Individual person, like all the rest of us, have no existence until you are legally administered, despite an ability to observe human existence prior to administration. "Civil Society", like math once did, exists in a state that denies the existence of zero - the unadministered pre-citizen, pre-customer, pre-Righted, pre-identified with actual existence as a human with Rights. Sorry, but you are going to need an administered ID for that.  <br>  If human rights existed, then human migration would be a matter of free expression, and access to Sovereign jurisdictions proclaiming support for "Human Rights" would need to quibble less about process of admittance. Simple in theory, but get ready for the administrative use of fear to induce human behavior in compliance to expected procedures.... "Terrorist Migrants Are Coming!!!!" ... ie, no actual, structural human rights here, move along. Only cult-politics can confront this with policy, as structural human rights have no meaningful expression in structural terms... just linguistics.  <br>  Now in China, who cares... human&nbsp;rights don't exist. The default commie-state of the newborn baby, dependent on others for survival, is extended throughout life. Little commie-baby-brains are the most compliant, most enforceable population on the planet, and structural considerations of participation are not to be found - bring on the social credit score. At home, or in the hospital, newborn families are not inherently tuned to the structural considerations of a new born&nbsp;life, they are tired, exhausted, hopefully in glee at the newly arriving human they have custody for. This is where the heist occurs. Systems love compliant people, they can do anything with them as their fodder.&nbsp;  <br>  Data collection starts immediately; afterall, that new baby needs administered existence in order to exist with rights. Right?&nbsp;  <br>  Data plantations running on endless databases, storing administered credentials in State Trusts, set the stage for the participation of living beings that will one day wake in a world that they themselves will have custody for,&nbsp;in theory. But in that moment, those little commie-baby-brains need to be administered by the State, need to be defined by State identification processes, in order to exist legally, and as a function of the future, those theories will yield to administered practices.  <br>  Structure yields results...&nbsp;  <br>  How many people care? As "we" look around and communicate on this list, W2 employees with pensions become pervasive in all of these conversations. These structural participants, one-level removed from their Righted structure as citizens, even within "more perfect Sovereign unions", form sub-unions protecting their continuity as structural outcomes. What outcomes? What is the structural outcome they achieve? Like little commie-baby-brains, these adult participants cede their self-Sovereign integrity and representation, to induce group-action via group-think and group-coordination. It works really well, and makes these people "feel" really powerful in their time and place, inducing actions that try to scale their structural considerations for all people who remain out-of-step.  <br>  Thats where "You" come in, and by example, where a more perfect union comes in, to protect the greatest minority, and default sub-unit of the human organism, the Individual. Here, the commie-baby-brain must stand accountable to the inherent structural integrity of an Individual human life with direct, personal living authority. Personal authority, the kind that really makes little adult-commie-brains upset as "people"&nbsp;who can't/don't/won't be able to express such authority with any confidence, and without any guidance from a group-administrator. You see it all the time, as the administrative system routs&nbsp;one attention to channel 4 for programming, and channel 5 for another. Cult-capture is structurally assured by design, a coup by actual intent.&nbsp;  <br>  This sets the backdrop of work and conversation here. There are too many people on this list that will NEVER materialize an accurate understanding of the structural accuracy of human rights, and the Sovereign structure of human liberty and accountability, the kind that builds real "civil" societies. Instead, they will pervert words, quibble&nbsp;against words, use fear to harm dialogue, and insist on centralized authority to secure people from themselves, and the most scary people on the planet... people who think and act for themselves to stand up Sovereign jurisdictions as self-represented participants and sources of Sovereign authority.&nbsp;  <br>  Too hard? Too old? Too young? Too compliant? Too accurate?&nbsp;  <br>  Prior to any administrative act, actual human rights exist. (<a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2023/10/zero-party-doctrine.html">Zero Party Doctrine</a>) Good people, with functionally literate adult minds, and the persistent choice to preserve human health, wealth, wisdom, liberty, and personal pursuits of happiness in time serve as the actual foundation of a dominant world-view with no equal. Own your own life, own your own work, own your own future, own your own administration as righted people in civil societies. The alternative is not civil, and not humane to Individuals, all people. Structure yields superior results....  <br>  As builders of AI systems serving such people, structural considerations trump hype. I will stop short of discussing technical methods ensuring such outcomes, but suffice it to say it is a choice to induce unending focus on such outcomes. It requires no marketing, it requires no venture capital, and it wins because it is supported by winners. People, Individuals&nbsp;all, who give accountability personally to the freedoms they express incrementally in the face of far too ample losers who are always one comma away from proclaiming your adult minds a threat to the existence of their little commie-baby-brains while begging for access to the world built by self-Sovereign efforts of leaders, the real kind.  <br>  AI is about raising the bottom up to the statistical mean in present form. Protecting leading edge human thought, and output, is going to require a new approach to human identity. Databases are the domain of AI, and humanity will not be able to compete as artifacts living on a databased plantation.&nbsp;  <br>  A great civil society reset is required (Not the "Build Back Better" commie-baby-brain variety), and it is just a matter of time before it becomes essential for any person now participating in the masses as little commie-baby-brains despite believing "they" exist in some other way as a result of linguistics or flag flying. Watch the administration process devolve, as people, the bleeding kind, are conflated with "people", the linguistic variety, and have their "Rights" administered as "permissions" due to some fear-inducing event. Well documented on this list by pseudo-leaders.  <br>  Open source AI, local AI, rooted human authority... all in the crosshairs. Remember who you are up against. Universal derivation and sharing no longer exist in the same place at the same time. Declare your structural reality.. human Individual leader, or statistical mean on a data-driven plantation. It is still not optional. People, Indiviiduals all, must own root authority.

  I've been trying to be intentional about using generative AI for more and more tasks in my life. For example, the image above is generated by DALL-E. I think generative AI is going to upend almost everything we do online, and I'm not alone. One of the places it will have the greatest impact is its uses in personal agents whether or not these agents enable people to lead effective online lives.

For example, the image above is generated by DALL-E. I think generative AI is going to upend almost everything we do online, and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">I'm not alone</a>. One of the places it will have the greatest impact is its uses in personal agents whether or not these agents enable people to lead effective online lives.</p><p>Jamie Smith recently wrote a <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/customerfutures/p/digital-agents-bill-gates-vs-customer">great article in Customer Futures about the </a><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/customerfutures/p/digital-agents-bill-gates-vs-customer">kind of AI-enabled personal agents</a> we should be building. As Jamie points out: "Digital identity [is how we] prove who we are to others"​​. This statement is particularly resonant as we consider not just the role of digital identities in enhancing personal agents, but also their crucial function in asserting ownership of our creations in an AI-dominated landscape.</p><p>Personal agents, empowered by AI, will be integral to our digital interactions, managing tasks and providing personalized experiences. As Bill Gates says, <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">AI is about to completely change how you use computers</a>. The key to the effectiveness of these personal agents lies in the robust digital identities they leverage. These identities are not just tools for authentication; they're pivotal in distinguishing our human-generated creations from those produced by AI.</p><p>In creative fields, for instance, the ability to prove ownership of one's work becomes increasingly vital as AI-generated content proliferates. A strong digital identity enables creators to unequivocally claim their work, ensuring that the nuances of human creativity are not lost in the tide of AI efficiency. Moreover, in sectors like healthcare and finance, where personal agents are entrusted with sensitive tasks, a trustworthy, robust, self-sovereign identity ensures that these agents act in harmony with our real-world selves, maintaining the integrity and privacy of our personal data.</p><p>In this AI-centric era, proving authorship through digital identity becomes not just a matter of pride but a shield against the rising tide of AI-generated fakes. As artificial intelligence becomes more adept at creating content—from written articles to artwork—the line between human-generated and AI-generated creations blurs. A robust, owner-controlled digital identity acts as a bastion, enabling creators to assert their authorship and differentiate their genuine work from AI-generated counterparts. This is crucial in combating the proliferation of deepfakes and other AI-generated misinformation, ensuring the authenticity of content and safeguarding the integrity of our digital interactions. In essence, our digital identity becomes a critical tool in maintaining the authenticity and trustworthiness of the digital ecosystem, protecting not just our intellectual property but the very fabric of truth in our digital world.</p><p>As we embrace this new digital frontier, the focus must not only be on the convenience and capabilities of AI-driven agents but also on fortifying our digital identities so that your personal agent is controlled by you. Jamie ends his post with five key questions about personal agents that we shouldn't lose sight of:</p>  <p>Who does the digital assistant belong to?</p>  <p>How will our personal agents be funded?</p>  <p>What will personal agents do tomorrow, that we can’t already do today?</p>  <p>Will my personal agent do things WITH me and FOR me, or TO me?</p>  <p>Which brands will be trusted to offer personal agents?</p>  <p>Your digital identity is your anchor in the digital realm, asserting our ownership, preserving our uniqueness, and fostering trust in an increasingly automated world, helping you <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">operationalize your digital relationships</a>. The future beckons with the promise of AI, but it's our digital identity that will define our place in it.</p>

<p>Tomorrow (well today, since I’m ten minutes late in getting this posted) is Thanksgiving in the United States. I’ve had mixed feelings about it since the February 2017 raid on Standing Rock where Regina Brave made her treaty stand. After watching MRAPs coming down a muddy, snowy hill to confront a Lakota grandmother and Navy veteran on Unicorn Riot’s livestream, it was hard to go back to being a parade bystander. It didn’t feel right watching the Major Drumstick float go by as we took in drum corps performances and waited for Santa to make his appearance on the Ben Franklin Parkway, officially opening the season of holiday excess. To be honest, I was kind of a downer.</p>
<p>Six years later, I have more life experience and clarity around cognitive domain management, identity politics, prediction modeling, and the strategic use of drama and trauma. I sense now that Standing Rock was likely part of an unfolding spectacle that was intended to set the stage for the use of indigenous identity as cover for faux green sustainability markets linked to web3 natural capital – the rights of nature literally tethered to digital ledgers in the name of equity and acknowledgement of past harms. </p>
<p>That is not to say protester concerns around the threats of pipelines to water systems weren’t valid. They were. It is not to dismiss the injustice of broken treaties, to diminish the horror of violence waged against native bodies, to undermine authentic efforts towards being in right relationship with the Earth and one another. No, the reasons people came to Standing Rock mattered. They did, but I expect few who participated would have ever realized the community that arose on that icy riverbank was viewed by myriad analysts as an emergent complex system, an extremely valuable case study at a time when we were on the cusp of AI swarm intelligence and cognitive warfare.</p>
<p>I’d come to know a man through my education activism who was there on the day of the raid, a person I considered a friend and mentor. We’ve drifted apart since the lockdowns. Such digital entanglements now seem pervasive and ephemeral. Were we really friends? Was it an act? In some extended reality play? Part of some larger campaign meant to position us where we were supposed to be years hence? I don’t think we’re meant to know. Perhaps like “degrees of freedom,” “degrees of uncertainty” are baked into the “many-worlds” equations humming within the data center infrastructure spewing out today’s digital twin multiverses. In any event, his research opened the door of my mind to the quiet, devastating treachery of social impact finance as well as the vital importance of indigenous spiritual practice and sovereignty. His ties to Utah’s complex and troubled history, a place that birthed virtual worlds of encrypted teapots under craggy mountains soaked in radioactive star dust on the shores of crystalline salt lakes sitting atop vast stores of transmitting copper ore, spun me into the space where I am now.</p>
<p>Looking back I held a simmering anger that hurt my family in ways I did not realize. It was probably an energetic frequency. We didn’t talk about it. We didn’t argue. Everything was fine, until lockdowns happened and suddenly it wasn’t. I felt betrayed having been what I considered a “good citizen” doing all the right things for so many decades and then abruptly having the scales fall from my eyes. This culture to which I had been habituated wasn’t at all what I thought it was. Nonetheless we were supposed to continue to perform our assigned roles as if nothing had changed. As long as we kept saying the assigned lines, things in middle-class progressive America would be ok. I was expected to paper over the rifts that were opening up in reality as I had known it, tuck away my disenchantment, my questions. Once one domino fell, they would all go, and that would be incredibly painful to everyone around me. And anyway, I didn’t have an answer that would reconcile the inconsistencies ready in my back pocket. There was a sad logic in it. If there was no easy fix, why wreck the status quo? Surely that wasn’t doing anyone any favors, right?</p>
<p>Nothing turned out like I thought it would. Suddenly, I was a planner without a plan. Today I have lots more information, and if anything, I recognize that I know less than I need to – that is than my mind needs to. In a world of information you can never pin it all down, organize it, make sense of it from an intellectual standpoint. But maybe it’s time to lead with the heart, at least that’s what all the techno-bros are saying. Maybe I should just shrug and let Sophia the robot guide me into some transformative meditation? Well, probably not. And I’ll pass on the Deepak Chopra wellness app, too. I foresee a future where rocks and water and trees are my partners in biophotonic exchange. At least that is what feels right for now. Patience.</p>
<p>For the moment I am on my own. I still love my small family with all my heart, and I really miss my dad every day. I have his watch with the scent of his Polo cologne on the band. It makes me tear up, a mix of poignant loss, and remembering hugs in his strong arms. It’s funny since I seem to have fallen outside of “civilized” time now. The days all run into one another and mostly I’m just aware of the contours of the seasons as I wait for the next phase of my life to start in the spring. Oh, that watch – there is a sense of irony in the universe for sure, a trickster energy I have to learn to appreciate more.</p>
<p>I have a small turkey brining in the fridge. I’ll be eating alone, but that’s ok. I don’t feel pressured to make all the fixings – sweet potatoes and broccoli will be fine. Maybe this weekend I’ll make an apple pie, my dad’s favorite. I’m downsizing. I’m leaning into less is more. I’m going to work on seeing playfulness in the world and practicing ways to embody the type of consciousness that might bring more of it in. I have a new friend, we’ll just say my Snake Medicine Show buddy who has been practicing this art for many years in a quest to move into right relationship and, well maybe vanquish is too strong a word, but at least neutralize what she calls the McKracken consciousness. She’s the kind of fun friend you want to have around to riff off of one another. I’m fortunate to have a small group of people in my life who despite my oddities manage to vibe with far-out concepts that stretch well beyond not only the norm, but a lot of the alternative modes of thinking. We are learning, together.</p>
<p>So for tomorrow I will concentrate on being grateful. Indigenous worldviews center gratitude. In spite of all of the disruptions to my year, I still have many blessings. Those who read my blog and watch my long videos, I count you among them. Thank you. Below is the stream we ran last night. It is the first in what will probably be an ongoing series about our trip from Colorado to Arkansas and back. My relocation plans are centered around Hot Springs now, so if you are in the area or have insight, do send them my way. I will include a map I made that weaves together photos from the trip and historical materials. You can access the interactive version <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/c28972043bfe148908d02e9a298ce271#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS0xeW51TjRpNQ%3D%3D">here</a>. Underneath I’m sharing a write up I did of insights gifted to me by my Snake Medicine Show friend. I love new tools for my toolbox. Maybe you will find it helpful on your journey.</p>
<p>Much love to you all; we are a wonderous work in progress, each and every one.</p>

<p>My summary of insights from Snake Medicine Show who gifted me with a guest post last December. You can read her lively linguistic offering, Emotional Emancipation – A Prayer of Proclamation, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/13/labyrinthian-reflections-healing-verses-from-moab-utah/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been conditioned to perceive the world from a perspective that prioritizes matter. Such a view reduces our lived experience to leaderboards where our value is measured by the things we acquire objects, stuff, credentials, prestige. And yet an open invitation has been extended. We can try on different lens. What if we shift our worldview to center the dynamic potential of energy in motion. Rather than getting entangled by inconsequential nodes popping up here and there within the universe’s vast current, we can join as partners in a cosmic dance of fluid motion and unlimited possibility.</p>
<p>As authentic beings, grounded in truth, attuned to nature and the wonders of cosmic creation, we have the opportunity to dip into that current and reflect imaginative constructs into our shared reality. We are prisms of abundance.</p>
<p>The sea of shared consciousness is mutable, playful, and emergent. We can invite ideas into this dimension. However, once we do so, we have the responsibility to nurture them by giving them focused attention. Through creative partnerships, we can bring more energy to the process than we can acting on our own. As dancers in the current we hold space together, wombs to sustain modes of being beyond our conditioned expectations. We can choose to be patient and await what unfolds.</p>
<p>With proper tuning we will encounter guidance, grace, that directs us towards actions furthering a larger purpose. We many not even be fully aware of what that purpose is. As playful co-creators we should have faith and hold space for circuits to connect, activating the generative feedback that can begin to heal zero-sum consciousness. Mingle our unique bioenergetic frequencies with the understanding that resonant harmonies will guide sacred signals to the right receptor(s). It doesn’t take much to activate healing, just the right amount.</p>
<p>Show up with right relationship and the current will meet us there. We don’t need to know the right time or place; we just need to embody the right tune.</p>

<p>It was really nice of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgarber/">Elizabeth Garber</a> to acknowledge me in the whitepaper that she co-authored with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-haine/">Mark Haine</a> titled “<a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Human-Centric_Digital_Identity_Final-v1.1.pdf">Human-Centric Digital Identity: for Government Officials</a>”. I recommend everyone read it, even if you aren’t in government, as it is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic. It reminded me that I was overdue to publish the talk I gave at <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361547/">Identiverse 2023</a>, since it was her being in the audience that led us to have some nice conversations about our shared viewpoint on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. So, below is a re-recording of my talk, “Collision Course: Ethics vs Human-Centered Design in the New Perimeter”.</p>



 

 



<p>This talk was a challenging one for me to put together, because the subject matter is something I’ve been struggling to come to grips with. With digital identity becoming a critical component of a more digital-centric world, it seems clear that success and sustainability hinges on placing people and their societal values at the center of the architecture. But in doing so as part of my day-to-day work, I sometimes find the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics coming into conflict with each other. How are we, as identity practitioners, supposed to resolve these conflicts, navigating the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, and not the one we wished they lived in? I increasingly found that there was no blueprint, no guide, already existing that I could tap into.</p>



<p>Well, I’ve often found that nothing brings things into better focus than being forced to develop a talk around it, so that’s what I set out to do. Can’t say I have the answers, but I did try to lay out some approaches and ideas that I found helpful when faced with these questions in the global projects I’m involved in. As always, I would love to hear people’s thoughts and experiences as they relate to this topic.</p>

<p>This article shows how an ASP.NET Core application can be authenticated using OpenID Connect and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) RFC 9126</a>. The OpenID Connect server is implemented using Duende IdentityServer. The Razor Page ASP.NET Core application authenticates using an OpenID Connect confidential client with PKCE and using the OAuth PAR extension.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende">https://github.com/damienbod/oidc-par-aspnetcore-duende</a></p>



<p>Note: The code in this example was created using the Duende example found here: <a href="https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer">https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer</a></p>







<p></p>



<p>By using Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR), the authentication flow security is improved. In ASP.NET Core using PAR, the application is authenticated on the trusted backchannel before sending any authentication request. The parameters are no longer sent in the URL reducing the risk by not sharing the parameters or prevent parameter pollution with redirect_uri injection. No parameters are shared in the front channel.  The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9101/">RFC 9101</a> can also be used together with this to further improve the authentication security.</p>



 Overview 



<p>The OAuth PAR extension adds an extra step to the two step OpenID Connect client authentication code flow. OAuth Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) extended flow has three steps:</p>



 
 Client sends a HTTP request in the back channel with the authorization parameters and the client is authenticated first. The body of the request has the OpenID Connect code flow parameters. The server responds with the request_uri. 



 The client uses the request_uri from the first step and authenticates. The server uses the flow parameters from the first request. As code flow with PKCE is used, the code is returned in the front channel. 



 The client completes the authentication using the code flow in the back channel, standard OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE. 
 



 Duende IdentityServer setup 



<p>I used Duende IdentityServer to implement the standard. Any OpenID Connect server which supports the OAuth PAR standard can be used. It is very simple to support this using Duende IdentityServer. The RequirePushedAuthorization is set to true and PAR is active for this client. The rest of the client configuration is a standard OIDC confidential client using code flow with PKCE.</p>


  new Client[]
{
  new Client
  {
	ClientId = "web-par",
	ClientSecrets = 
	{ 
		new Secret("--your-secret--".Sha256()) 
	},

	RequirePushedAuthorization = true,

	AllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.CodeAndClientCredentials,

	RedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signin-oidc" 
	},
	FrontChannelLogoutUri = 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-oidc",
	PostLogoutRedirectUris = 
	{ 
		"https://localhost:5007/signout-callback-oidc" 
	},

	AllowOfflineAccess = true,
	AllowedScopes = { "openid", "profile" }
  }
};
  


<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core OpenID Connect client 



<p>The ASP.NET Core client requests extra changes. An extra back channel PAR request is sent in the OpenID Connect events. The OIDC events needs to be changed compared to the standard core OIDC setup. I used the Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package to implement this and updated the OIDC events using the ParOidcEvents class from the Duende examples. The setup uses the PAR events in the AddOpenIdConnect configuration which requires a HttpClient and the IDiscoveryCache interface from Duende.</p>


  services.AddTransient&lt;ParOidcEvents&gt;();

// Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package
services.AddSingleton&lt;IDiscoveryCache&gt;(_ =&gt; 
    new DiscoveryCache(configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"]!));

services.AddHttpClient();

services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromHours(8);
    options.SlidingExpiration = false;
    options.Events.OnSigningOut = async e =&gt;
    {
        // automatically revoke refresh token at signout time
        await e.HttpContext.RevokeRefreshTokenAsync();
    };
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =&gt;
{
    options.Authority = configuration["OidcDuende:Authority"];
    options.ClientId = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientId"];
    options.ClientSecret = configuration["OidcDuende:ClientSecret"];
    options.ResponseType = "code";
    options.ResponseMode = "query";
    options.UsePkce = true;

    options.Scope.Clear();
    options.Scope.Add("openid");
    options.Scope.Add("profile");
    options.Scope.Add("offline_access");
    options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
    options.SaveTokens = true;
    options.MapInboundClaims = false;

    // needed to add PAR support
    options.EventsType = typeof(ParOidcEvents);

    options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        NameClaimType = "name",
        RoleClaimType = "role"
    };
});

// Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect nuget package
// add automatic token management
services.AddOpenIdConnectAccessTokenManagement();
  


<p></p>



<p>The ParOidcEvents class is used to implement the events required by the OAuth PAR standard. This can be used with any token server which supports the standard.</p>

 Notes 



<p>It is simple to use PAR and the it adds an improved authentication security with one extra request in the authentication flow. This should be used if possible. The standard can be used together with the OAuth JAR standard and even extended with the OAuth RAR. </p>

<p>Towards the end of 2019, I was invited to deliver a keynote at the OpenID Foundation Summit in Japan. At a very personal level, the January 2020 Summit was an opportunity to spend time with dear friends from around the world. It would be the last time I saw Kim Cameron in person. It would include a dinner with the late Vittorio Bertocci. And it was my last “big” trip before the COVID lock down.</p>



<p>At the Summit, I was asked to talk about the “<a href="https://www.tuesdaynight.org/2020/11/24/the-future-of-digital-identity-2020-2030/">Future of Identity</a>.” It was a bit of a daunting topic since I am no real futurist and haven’t been an industry analyst for a long time. So I set about writing what I thought the next 10 years would look like from the view of a practitioner. You can read what I wrote as well as see a version of me presenting this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A concept I put forward in that talk was one of “counselors”: software agents that act on one’s behalf to make introductions of the individual to a service and vice versa, perform recognition of these services and associated credentials, and prevent or at least inhibit risky behavior, such as dodgy data sharing. I provide an overview of these concepts in my&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/4ZPvWC4Kcbw?t=1217">Future of Identity talk at approximately minute 20</a>.</p>



 Why even talk about counselors 



<p>That’s a reasonable question. I have noticed that there is a tendency in the digital identity space (and I am sure in others too) to marvel at problems. Too many pages spent talking about how something is a fantastically hard problem to solve and why we must do so… with scant pages of follow up on&nbsp;how&nbsp;we do so. Additionally, there’s another tendency to marvel at very technical products and services that “solve the problem.” Except they don’t. They solve a part of the problem or they are one of many tools needed to solve the problem. The challenges of digital identity management are legion and they manifest themselves in different ways to different industry sectors in different geographies. One can argue that while we have used magnificent tools to solve account management problems, we really haven’t begun to solve identity management ones. Counselors are a way to both humanize online interactions and make meaningful (as in meaningful and valuable to the individual) progress on solving the challenges of digital identity management.</p>







 Counselors in the Modern Era 



<p>Sitting through the sessions at&nbsp;<a href="https://authenticatecon.com/event/authenticate-2023/">Authenticate 2023</a>, and being surrounded by a ton of super smart people, I realized that the tools to make counselors real are very much within our grasp. Among these tools, 4 are the keys to success:</p>



 
 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



 Bilateral recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



 Potentially verifiable data powered by Verified Credentials 



 Safe browsing hints 
 



 Interface layer powered by generative AI and LLMs 



<p>At their core, counselors are active clients that run on a person’s device. Today we can think of these akin to personal digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. What is missing is a user interface layer that is more than a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Ruxpin">Teddy Ruxpin</a>&nbsp;clone that only knows a few key phrases and actions accompanied by zero contextual awareness. What is needed is a meaningful conversational interface that is contextually aware. Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) are showing promise that they can power that layer. And these models are now running on form factors that could easily be mobile, wearable, and eventually implantable. This would enable the counselor to understand requests such as “Find me the best price for 2 premium economy seats to Tokyo for these dates in January” and “know” that I’ll be flying out of D.C. and am a Star Alliance flier.&nbsp;</p>



 Recognition tokens powered by passkeys 



<p>We have got to get out of the authentication business. It fails dramatically and spectacularly and seemingly on a daily basis. We have to move to the business of enabling service providers and consumers to recognise each other. Both the original talk and my more recent&nbsp;<a href="https://weaveidentity.com/blog/2023/07/19/ceremonies/">Ceremonies</a>&nbsp;talk speak to this need. A crucial puzzle piece for recognition is the use of cryptography. Right now the easiest way a normal human being can use cryptography to “prove” who they are is WebAuthn and, more generally,&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>. Armed with passkeys, a counselor can ensure that a service recognizes the person and that the counselor recognizes the service. To be clear, today, passkeys and the ceremonies and experiences surrounding them are in the early stages of&nbsp; global adoption… but it is amazing to see the progress that happened in the prior year and it bodes well for the future.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that passkeys as they work today provide a form of cryptographic proof that the thing interacting with a service is the same one you saw the day before, and notional there is the same human associated with the thing. There is no real reason why, in theory, this couldn’t be flipped around such that the service has to provide a form of cryptographic proof that the service is the same one with which the thing interacted the day before. A counselor could broker these kinds of flows to ensure that the service recognizes the person that the counselor is working on behalf of and the counselor can recognize the service.</p>



 Potentially verifiable data powered by verifiable credentials 



<p>One thing a counselor needs to do is to share data, on behalf of the individual, with a service. This data could be credit card information, home address, passport number, etc. Some of the data they would need to share are pieces of information about the individual from 3rd party authorities such as a local department of motor vehicles or employer. Ideally, the service would like a means to verify such information, and the individual, in some cases, would like the issuer of the information not to know where the information is shared. Here verified credentials (VCs) could play a role. Additionally, the service may want information about an individual that the individual provides and acts as the authority/issuer. Here too verified credentials could play a role. Standardized request and presentation patterns and technologies are crucially important and my hope is the VCs will provide them.</p>



<p>So why include the word “potentially” in the title of this section? There are many scenarios in which the service neither needs nor cares to&nbsp; verify information provided by the individual. Said differently, not every use case is a high assurance use case (nor should it be) and not every use case is rooted in a regulated sector. Hopefully VCs will provide a standardized (or at least standardizable) means for data presentation that can span both use cases that require verification and those that do not. If not, we’ll always have&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/0NFanER0g8w?t=322">CSV</a>.</p>



 Safe interaction hints 



<p>While one’s street sense might warn you that walking down that dark alley or getting money from that shifty looking ATM isn’t a good idea, an online version of that same street sense isn’t as easily cultivated. Here we need to turn to outside sources. Signals such as suspect certificates, questionable privacy policies, and known malware drop sites can all be combined to inform the individual everything from “This isn’t the site you actually are looking for” to “I suggest you do not sign up on this service… here are 3 alternatives” to “I’ll generate a one-time credit card number for you here.” One can imagine multiple sources for such hints and services. From browser makers to government entities to privacy-oriented product companies and well beyond. This is where real differentiation and competition can and should occur. And this is where counselors move from being reasonably inert cold storage layers for secrets and data to real valuable tools for an online world.</p>



 The missing something: privacy&nbsp; 



<p>At this point, I felt like I had identified the critical ingredients for a counselor: interface layer, recognition tokens, potentially verifiable data, and safe browsing hints… and then I mentioned this to Nat Sakimura. Nat has a way of appearing at the critical moment, say 10 words, and disrupt your way of thinking. I joke that he’s from the future here to tell us what not to do in order to avoid catastrophe. And I have been lucky and privileged enough to have Nat appear from time to time.</p>



<p>This time he appeared to tell me that the four things I had identified were insufficient. There was something missing. Having safe browsing hints is not enough… what is missing are clear, processable and actionable statements about privacy and data use. A counselor can “read” these statements from a site or service, interpret them into something understandable for the individual, better informing them on how the service will behave, or at least how it ought to behave. Couple this with things like consent receipts, which the counselor can manage, and the individual has records of what the service provider said they would do and to what the individual agreed to. There is an opportunity here for counselors to focus the individual’s attention on what is material for the individual and learn their preferences, such as knowing the individual will not accept tracking cookies.</p>



 From where will these counselors come 



<p>One can easily imagine a variety of sources of counselors. The mobile operating system vendors are best-placed to extend their existing so-called smart assistants to become counselors by leveraging their existing abilities to manage passwords, passkeys, debit and credit cards, and along with other forms of credentials. 3rd parties also could build counselors much like we see with digital assistants, password managers, and digital wallets. I expect that there is a marketplace for services, especially safe browsing hints. Here, organizations from government entities to civil society organizations to privacy-oriented product companies could build modules, for lack of a better word, that would be leveraged by the counselor to enhance its value to the individual.</p>



<p>Regardless of where counselors originate, observability and auditability is key. An individual needs a means to examine the actions the automated counselor took and the reasons for the actions. They need a way to revoke past data sharing decisions and consents granted. And they need a means to “fire” their counselor and switch to a new one whilst retaining access, control, and history.</p>



 In conclusion 



<p>We, as an industry, have been working on identity management for quite some time. But, from some perspectives, we haven’t made progress. Pam Dingle once said something to me to the effect of, “We’ve built a lot of tools but we haven’t solved the problems. We are just at the point where we have the tools we need to do so.” We have solved many of the problems of user account management, but we have yet to solve the problems of identity management to the same extent. The magical future where I can put the supercomputer on my wrist to work in a way that delivers real value and not just interesting insights and alerts feels both disappointingly far away yet tantalizingly within our grasp. I believe that counselors are what is needed to extend our reach to that magical, and very achievable, future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do this I believe there are five things required:</p>



 
 Ubiquitous devices, available to all regardless of geography and socio economic condition, in all manner of form factors, which can run privacy-preserving LLMs and thus the interface layer for counselors 



 Maturation of passkey patterns including recovery use cases such that the era of shared secrets can be enshrined in history 



 Standardization of request and presentation processes of potentially verifiable data, along with standardized data structures 



 Trustable sources of safe interaction signals with known rules and standardized data formats 



 Machine-readable and interpretable privacy and data use notices coupled with consent receipts 
 



<p>The tools we need to unlock the magical future are real… or certainly real enough for proof of concept purposes. Combining those five ingredients makes the magical future and much more magical present… and this is the present in which I want to be.</p>

<p>It is a testament to his enduring spirit that we all continue to find ways to cope with the absence of Vittorio from our identity community and from our lives. On the day that I learnt of the news, I poured out my immediate feelings <a href="https://blog.talkingidentity.com/2023/10/and-just-like-that-hes-gone.html">in words</a>. But as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iglazer/">Ian</a> put it so eloquently (like only he can), we continued to look for ways to operationalize our sadness. In his case, he and Allan Foster set out to honor Vittorio’s legacy by setting up <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/awards-and-grants/vittorio/">the Vittorio Bertocci Award</a> under the auspices of <a href="https://digitalidadvancement.org/">the Digital Identity Advancement Foundation</a>, which hopefully will succeed in becoming a lasting tribute to the intellect and compassion that Vittorio shared with the identity community. My personal attempt was to try and remember the (often twisted yet somehow endearingly innocent) sense of humor that Vittorio imbued into our personal interactions. And so, prodded by the inquiries from many about the fun (and funny) t-shirt I had designed just to get a good laugh from him at Identiverse, I created <a href="https://www.customink.com/fundraising/in-memory-of-vittorio-our-identity-fabio">a fundraiser</a> for the <a href="https://pancan.org/">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> in his honor.</p>



 



<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-14-at-9.46.29-AM.png"></a>



 



<p>Thanks to all of you Vittorio stans and your incredible generosity, we raised $3,867.38 through t-shirt orders ($917.63) and donations ($2,949.75). I am obviously gratified by the support you gave my little attempt at operationalizing my sadness. But the bonus I wasn’t expecting was the messages people left on the fundraiser site – remembering Vittorio, what he meant to them, and in some cases how cancer affected their lives personally. In these troubling times, it was heartwarming to read these small signals of our shared humanity.</p>



<p>Thank you all once again. And love you Vittorio, always.</p>

<blockquote><p>
The join was failing because the two network_interfaces columns contained JSONB objects with differing shapes; Postgres’ JSONB containment operator, @&gt;, couldn’t match them. Since the JSONB objects are arrays, and since the desired match was a key/value pair common to both arrays, it made sense to explode the array and iterate through its elements looking to match that key/value pair.</p>
<p>Initial solutions from ChatGPT, Copilot Chat, and newcomer Unblocked implemented that strategy using various flavors of cross joins involving Postgres’ jsonb_array_elements function.

Blockchains are an implementation choice and there are other ways to solve the problem. That said, if you're looking to create a dApp with a smart contract, then Igor's article is a nice place to start.</p><p>Let's start with the goal and work backwards from there. The goal of a dApp is to give people control over their apps and the data in them. This is not how the internet works today. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a>, the web and mobile apps are almost exclusively built on a model of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#administrative">intervening administrative authorities</a>. As the operators of hosted apps and controllers of the identity systems upon which they're founded,  the administrators can, for any reason whatsoever, revoke your rights to the application and any data it contains. Worse, most use your data for their own purposes, often in ways that are not in your best interest.</p><p>dApps, in contrast, give you control of the data and merely operate against it. Since they don't host the data, they can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/11/cloudless_computing_at_the_edge.shtml">run locally, at the edge</a>. Using smart contracts on a blockchain is one way to do this, but there are others, including peer-to-peer networks and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The point is, to achieve their goal, dApps need a way to store data that the application can reliably and securely reference, but that a person, rather than the app provider, controls. The core requirement for achieving control is that the data service be run by a provider who is not an intermediary and that the data model be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>. Control requires meaningful choice among a group of interoperable providers who are substitutable and compete for the trust of their customers.</p><p>I started writing about this idea back in 2012 and called it <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/pcaa">Personal Cloud Application Architecture</a>. At the time the idea of personal clouds had a lot of traction and a number of supporters. We built a demonstration app called <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/forever/forever.shtml">Forever</a> and later, I based the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/10/fuse_connecting_your_car_-_our_new_kickstarter_campaign.shtml">Fuse connected car application</a> on this idea: let people control and use the data from their cars without an intermediary. Fuse's technical success showed the efficacy of the idea at scale. Fuse had a mobile app and felt like any other connected car application, but underneath the covers, the architecture gave control of the data to the car's owner. Dave Winer has also <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/nodestorage_and_the_personal_cloud_application_architecture.shtml">developed applications that use a substitutable backend storage based on Node</a>.</p><p>Regular readers will wonder how I made it this far without mentioning <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/07/the_most_inventive_thing_ive_done.shtml">picos</a>. Forever and Fuse were both based on picos. Picos are designed to be self-hosted or hosted by providers who are substitutable. I've got a couple of projects tee'd up for two groups of students this winter that will further extend the suitability for picos as backends for dApps:</p>  <p>Support for Hosting Picos—the root pico in any instance of the pico engine is the ancestor of all picos in that engine and thus has ultimate control over them. To date, we've used the ability to stand up a new engine and control access to it as the means of providing control for the owner. This project will allow a hosting provider to easily stand up new instance of the engine and its root pico. For this to be viable, we'll use the support for peer DIDs my students built into the engine last year to give owners a peer DID connection to their root pico on their instance of the engine and thus give them control over the root pico and all its decedents.</p>  <p>Support for Solid Pods—at IIW this past October, we had a few sessions on how picos could be linked to <a href="https://solidproject.org//users/get-a-pod">Solid pods</a>. This project will marry a pod to each pico that gets created and link their lifecycles. This, combined with their support for peer DIDs, makes the pico and its data movable between engines, supporting substitutability.</p>  <p>If I thought I had the bandwidth to support a third group, I'd have them work on building dApps and an App Store to run on top of this. Making that work has a few other fun technical challenges. We've done this before. As I said Forever and Fuse were both essentially dApps. <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/#/login">Manifold</a>, a re-creation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/sqtag/">SquareTag</a> is a large dApp for the Internet of Things that supports dApplets (is that a thing?) for each thing you store in it. What makes it a dApp is that the data is all in picos that could be hosted anywhere...at least in theory. Making that less theoretical is the next big step. Bruce Conrad has some ideas around that he calls the <a href="https://picolab.github.io/PLAN/">Pico Labs Affiliate Network</a>.</p><p>I think the work of supporting dApps and personal control of our data is vitally important. As I wrote in 2014:</p><blockquote><p>On the Net today we face a choice between freedom and captivity, independence and dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has far-reaching consequences for the humans who will use—or be used by—it. Will we push forward, connecting things using forests of silos that are reminiscent the online services of the 1980’s, or will we learn the lessons of the Internet and build a true Internet of Things?</p><p>From <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">The CompuServe of Things</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-12T17:15:48-0500</p></blockquote><p>The choice is ours. We can build the world we want to live in.</p>

Photo credit: Brian Campbell from this <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/post/vittorio-bertocci-identity-community-contributions.html">article</a> on the Ping Identity&nbsp;blog<p>Vittorio Bertocci, much like many others in the identity space, had an important impact on my professional life. You can imagine how I felt when, a month following his tragic passing, I saw another <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">blog post</a> produced by the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/g-o-a-t/">GOAT</a> of creating understandable technical content about identity. Further, the subject of the post is my deepest area of knowledge: verifiable credential adoption (which was the topic of conversation for almost all my time spent with Vittorio).</p><p>Vittorio’s sage perspective on verifiable credentials is important for the IDtech community to understand. In this post, I want to outline how Vittorio influenced our direction at Trinsic and highlight a few important points from the recent&nbsp;post.</p><p>In 2017 I was a fresh face in the identity industry, pumped full of slogans and claims from the infinitely optimistic self-sovereign identity (SSI) evangelists who I surrounded myself with at the time. Having only seen one perspective, I fully believed that consumers could “own” their identity, that “data breaches would be a thing of the past”, and that verifiable credentials would usher in a new era of privacy maximalism.</p><p>The world needs idealists — but it also needs pragmatists. Vittorio became an archetype of the pragmatic energy that eventually worked its way into the culture and products at the company I cofounded in 2019, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>. His directed questions and healthy skepticism of marvelous SSI claims came not from a Luddite spirit, but from deep experience. In a <a href="https://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2022/01/11/remembering-kim-cameron/">blog post</a> about his involvement in the CardSpace project at Microsoft, he said, “When the user centric identity effort substantially failed to gain traction in actual products, with the identity industry incorporating some important innovations (hello, claims) but generally rejecting many of the key tenets I held so dear, something broke inside me. I became disillusioned with pure principled views, and moved toward a stricter Job to be done, user cases driven&nbsp;stance.”</p><p>For the last four years as a reusable identity infrastructure company, our developer tools for integrating verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and policy/governance tools have become quite popular. Thousands of developers have created dozens of applications that have acquired hundreds of thousands of end-users and issued close to a million credentials in production. This experience has given us a unique vantage point on patterns and methods for successfully deploying verifiable credentials in production. We’ve also spoken to many of these customers and other partners on our <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a> and in private to understand these patterns more&nbsp;deeply.</p><p>I state all of this so that I can say the following with some credibility: Vitorrio’s perspectives (and by extension Auth0’s) are a must-read for anyone working on user-centric identity. I’ll double click on a few of what I view to be the most important points&nbsp;below.</p><blockquote>What do we need to do to make a classic OpenID Connect flow behave more like the drivers license for buying wine scenario in offline&nbsp;life?</blockquote><blockquote>The two main discrepancies we identified were: Ability to use the token with multiple RPs and Ability to transact with an RP without IdP knowing anything about time and parties involved in the transaction</blockquote><p>The first point I want to highlight is that Vittorio introduces verifiable credentials (VCs) by relating them to something his audience is familiar with — OIDC. This is not only a helpful practice for pitching products in general, but it embeds an important point for IDtech people: VCs are not a fundamental transformation of identity. VCs are an incremental improvement on previous generations of identity technology. (But one that I believe can enable exponentially better product experiences when done&nbsp;right.)</p><p>VCs will be adopted when they are applied to use cases that existing solutions fail to accommodate. It’s key for VC-powered products to demonstrate how VCs enable a problem to be solved in a new way — otherwise, buyers will opt for the safer federated solutions over&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>A classic example to illustrate my point is “passwordless login”. I’ve been hearing about it for 6 years, and yet never actually seen verifiable credentials be adopted for passwordless authentication. I believe the reason for this is that the two points above (ability to use the token with multiple RPs, IdP not knowing about the transaction) aren’t important enough for this use case, and that other, lighter-weight solutions can do it&nbsp;better.</p><blockquote>We might say that there are too many cooks in the kitchen… I dare say this space is overspecified… A lot of work will need to happen in the marketplace, as production implementations with working use cases feel the pain points from these specs and run into a few walls for some of VCs to fully come to&nbsp;life.</blockquote><p>Vittorio taught me about the history of OAuth, OpenID, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. I learned about early, nonstandard iterations of “login with” buttons that had millions of active users. I learned about the market forces that led these divergent applications to eventually standardize.</p><p>Standardization is essential for adoption. But adoption is essential for knowing what to standardize (there’s nothing worse than standardizing the wrong thing)! Prematurely standardizing before adoption is a classic “cart before the horse” scenario. My conversations with Vittorio led me to write <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/the-catch-22-of-interoperability-fea4dc5ef582">this catch-22 of interoperability post</a>.</p><p>IDtech builders need to focus on building a good, adoptable product first. Then make it interoperable/compatible with other products second. This is a key design principle baked into Trinsic’s platform (e.g. whatever you build will inherit interoperability when it’s needed, but you won’t waste time figuring it out in the meantime).</p><blockquote>[A misconception:] Centralized DBs will disappear… and in turn this would prevent some of the massive data leaks that we have seen in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites">recent history</a>. It’s unclear how that would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><p>Vittorio correctly identified this as a misconception. Centralized databases indeed won’t disappear anytime soon. The notion that companies “won’t need to hold my data”, if it ever happens, will be far in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The near-term disruption that will happen, however, is something I pointed out in a <a href="https://x.com/rileyphughes/status/1663745376372023298?s=20">conversation</a> with Vittorio that started on Twitter and moved offline. Service providers who don’t originate data themselves, but aggregate or intermediate between parties in a transaction, are at risk of disruption from verifiable credentials.</p><p>The example I use in the post linked above is <a href="https://theworknumber.com/">Work Number</a>. Employers give Work Number information about their employees to avoid fielding background screening calls. If employers gave that information directly to employees in a verifiable credential, however, Work Number’s role would need to change dramatically. Because of this threat, identity verification, student attestations, background screening, and other of these kinds of companies are among the first to adopt verifiable credentials.</p><blockquote>Unless users decide to not present more data than necessary for particular operations, it is possible that they will end up disclosing more/all credential data just for usability sake.</blockquote><p>This dynamic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a> applied to identity — VCs counterintuitively risk creating worse privacy conditions, even with things like data minimization, because of the frequency of use. Nobody has a crystal ball, so it’s impossible to know whether this risk will materialize. Governance is the best tool at our disposal to reduce this risk and enable better privacy for people. I talk about this a fair bit in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/ssi-adoption-what-will-it-take-riley-hughes-webinar-67/">this webinar</a> and plan to write a blog post about it in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Users will typically already have credentials in their wallets and verifiers will simply need to verify them, in a (mostly) stateless fashion… However, we do have a multi-parties cold start problem. To have viable VCs we need effective, dependable and ubiquitous wallets. To have good wallets, we need relying parties implementing flows that require them, and creating real, concrete requirements for actual use. To incentivize RPs to implement and explore new flows, we need high value, ubiquitous credentials that make good business sense to leverage. But to get natural IdPs to create the infrastructure to issue such credentials, you need all of the above… plus a business&nbsp;case.</blockquote><p>The chicken-and-egg problem (or, “cold start” problem) is a trick for almost all IDtech products. While there will always be exceptions to the rule, I have seen enough failure and success to feel confident in a somewhat concrete recipe for overcoming this obstacle.</p>  Remove the wallet as a dependency. If a user needs to be redirected to an app store, download an app, step through onboarding steps, see an empty app, go scan QR codes to get credentials, all before it can actually be used… it’s extremely unlikely to be adopted. Instead, give users invisible “wallets” for their credentials. This is the #1 unlock that led to several of Trinsic’s customers scaling to hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;users.  If your entity can play the role of issuer (or IdP) then you’re in a great position. If you’re not, obtain your own data so that you can be. Dig in with one or more companies and partner closely to build something very specific first with existing&nbsp;data.  Sell to use cases that aren’t well-served by existing OIDC or similar technologies. Expand the markets you’re selling to by going into the long tail. Focus on either low-frequency, high-value use cases or high-frequency, low-value applications. Make it easy to integrate.  <p>Shamefully, it took me 5 years of pattern matching to land at the conclusions that Vittorio and others saw much sooner. These are the same points that led to adoption of OAuth/OIDC. And frankly, when you look at it, are pretty&nbsp;obvious.</p><blockquote>The main one is being able to disclose our identity/claims without issuers knowing. It is a civil liberty; it is a right. As more of our life moves online, we should be able to express our identity like we do it&nbsp;offline.</blockquote><p>Privacy is an important point. This requirement, in particular, is a requirement for most governments to be involved. It’s also a biggie for any sensitive/”vice” industry (gambling, adult content, controlled substances, etc.) which historically is a driver of new technology due to having broad appeal and high frequency.</p><blockquote>Once [the adoption flywheel] happens, it will likely happen all of a sudden… which is why it is really a good idea to stay up-to-date and experiment with VCs&nbsp;TODAY</blockquote><p>This “slow… then all at once” dynamic is a critical insight, and very true. We’ve seen this over the last year in the identity verification segment. My first conversations with identity verification companies were at Sovrin in 2018. Despite consistently following along, there was no movement from anybody for years. Suddenly, after <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/onfido-acquires-airside/">Onfido acquired Airside</a> in May, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/one-click-verification-plaid-idv/">Plaid</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/persona-introduces-industry-first-reusable-identity-solution-with-dynamic-risk-signals-301964490.html">Persona</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2023/10/05/clear-acquires-sora-id">ClearMe</a>, <a href="https://www.instnt.org/ourpress/instnt-launches-multipass">Instnt</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/au10tix-id-document-biometric-verification-platform-and-reusable-id-solution-now-available-in-the-microsoft-azure-marketplace-1032758864?op=1">Au10tix</a>, and more have jumped into the fray with their own “Reusable ID” solutions.</p><p>Auth0 posits that governments will be the critical unlock for verifiable credentials. While I don’t think that’s wrong, we are seeing increased bottoms-up adoption from the private sector, both from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=78c115cb3a88">IDtech</a> companies and verification providers of all kinds. Governments will play an important role, ideally anchoring wallets with high-assurance legal identity credentials and leading with standards that will produce to interoperable solutions.</p><p>If you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the whole <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/our-take-on-verifiable-credentials/">post</a>.

<p>OpenID Federation draft 31 has been published at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html</a>.  It’s the result of concerted efforts to make the specification straightforward to read, understand, and implement for developers.  Many sections have been rewritten and simplified.  Some content has been reorganized to make its structure and relationships more approachable.  Many inconsistencies were addressed.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies fixed resulted in a small number of breaking changes.  For instance, the name “<code>trust_mark_owners</code>” is now consistently used throughout, whereas an alternate spelling was formerly also used.  The editors tried to make all known such changes in this version, so hopefully this will be the last set of breaking changes.  We published draft 31 now in part to get these changes out to implementers.  See the history entries at <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history">https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0-31.html#name-document-history</a> for a detailed description of the changes made.</p>
<p>A comprehensive review of the specification is still ongoing.  Expect more improvements in the exposition in draft 32.  With any luck, -32 will be the basis of the next proposed Implementer’s Draft.</p>
<p>We’re definitely grateful for all the useful feedback we’re receiving from developers.  Developer feedback is gold!</p>

Thinking out loud always helps. Ideally, you get to do that with a human partner. A rubber duck, though a poor substitute, is far better than nothing.</p>
<p>Conversing with LLMs isn’t like either of these options, it’s something else entirely; and we’re all in the midst of figuring out how it can work. Asking an LLM to write code, and having it magically appear? That’s an obvious life-changer. Talking with an LLM about the code you’re partnering with it to write? I think that’s a less obvious but equally profound life-changer.

Clive is focusing on how the cassette tape unlocked creativity, but in doing so he describes its properties in a way that is helpful to discussions about online relationships in general.</p><p>Clive doesn't speak about cassette tapes being decentralized. In fact, I chuckle as I write that down. Instead he's focused on some core properties. Two I found the most interesting were that cassette tapes allowed one-to-one exchange of music and that they were permissionless. He says:</p><blockquote><p>If you wanted to record a cassette, you didn’t need anyone’s permission.</p><p>This was a quietly radical thing, back when cassette recorders first emerged. Many other forms of audio or moving-image media required a lot of capital infrastructure: If you wanted to broadcast a TV show, you needed a studio and broadcasting equipment; the same goes for a radio show or film, or producing and distributing an album. And your audience needed an entirely different set of technologies (televisions, radios, projectors, record players) to receive your messages.</p><p>From <a href="https://clivethompson.medium.com/the-empowering-style-of-cassette-tapes-e3a620590d42">The Empowering Style of Cassette Tapes</a><br>Referenced 2023-11-02T08:01:46-0400</p></blockquote><p>The thing that struck me on reading this was the idea that symmetric technology democratizes speech. The web is based on assymetric technology: client-server. In theory everyone can have a server, but they don't for a lot of reasons including cost, difficulty, and friction. Consequently, the web is dominated by a few large players who act as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic">intervening administrative authorities</a>. They decide what happens online and who can participate. The web is not one-to-one and it is decidedly not permissionless.</p><p>In contrast, the DIDComm protocol is symmetric and so it <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">fosters one-to-one interactions</a> that provide <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">meaningful, life-like online relationships</a>. DIDComm supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identity systems</a> that provide a foundation for one-to-one, permissionless interactons.

<p>The new “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-rha-jose-hpke-encrypt-01.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)</a>” specification has been published.  Its abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This specification defines Hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for use with Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE). HPKE offers a variant of public-key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key.</p>
<p>HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) function. Authentication for HPKE in JOSE is provided by JOSE-native security mechanisms or by one of the authenticated variants of HPKE.</p>
<p>This document defines the use of the HPKE with JOSE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html">RFC 9180</a>.  There’s a whole new generation of specifications using it for encryption.  The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol [<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html">RFC 9420</a>] uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-17.html">TLS Encrypted Client Hello</a> uses it.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-cose-hpke-07.html">Use of Hybrid Public-Key Encryption (HPKE) with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)</a> brings it to COSE.  And this specification brings it to JOSE.</p>
<p>One of our goals for the JOSE HPKE specification is to keep it closely aligned with the COSE HPKE specification.  That should be facilitated by having multiple authors in common, with Hannes Tschofenig and Orie Steele being authors of both, and me being a COSE co-chair.</p>
<p>Aritra Banerjee will be presenting the draft to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JOSE working group</a> at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/118/">IETF 118 in Prague</a>.  I’m hoping to see many of you there!</p>

<p>The initial <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications became final on February 25, 2014.  While the working group is rightfully proud of the quality of the work and the widespread adoption it has attained, specification writing is a human endeavor and mistakes will inevitably be made.  That’s why the OpenID Foundation has a process for publishing Errata corrections to specifications.</p>
<p>Eight issues were identified and corrected that year, with the first set of errata corrections being published on November 8, 2014.  Since that time, suggestions for improvements have continued to trickle in, but with a 9+ year trickle, a total of 95 errata issues have been filed!  They range from the nearly trivial, such as an instance of <code>http</code> that should have been <code>https</code>, to the more consequential, such as language that could be interpreted in different ways.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to report that, with a substantial investment by <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">the working group</a>, I’ve managed to work through all the 87 additional errata issues filed since the first errata set and incorporate corrections for them into published specification drafts.  They are currently undergoing <a href="https://openid.net/review-second-proposed-errata-openid-connect-specifications/">OpenID Foundation-wide review</a> in preparation for a vote to approve the second set of errata corrections.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the OpenID Foundation plans to submit the newly minted corrected drafts for publication by ISO as <a href="https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html#PAS">Publicly Available Specifications</a>.  This should foster even broader adoption of OpenID Connect by enabling deployments in some jurisdictions around the world that have legal requirements to use specifications from standards bodies recognized by international treaties, of which ISO is one.  Just in time for OpenID Connect’s <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2448">10th anniversary</a>!</p>

<p></p>
<p>This builds on the successes of past summits organized by the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/">OpenID Foundation Japan</a>.  For instance, I found the <a href="https://www.openid.or.jp/summit/2020/en/">OpenID Summit Tokyo 2020</a> and associated activities and discussions both very useful and very enjoyable.</p>
<p>A special feature of the 2024 summit will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of the <a href="https://openid.net/connect">OpenID Connect</a> specifications, which were approved on February 25, 2014.  Speakers who were there for its creation, interop testing, and early deployments will share their experiences and lessons learned, including several key participants from Japan.  As I recounted at EIC 2023, <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">building ecosystems is hard</a>.  And yet we achieved that for OpenID Connect!  We are working to create new identity ecosystems as we speak.  I believe that the lessons learned from OpenID Connect are very applicable today.  Come join the conversation!</p>
<p>Finally, as a teaser, I’m also helping the OpenID Foundation to plan two additional 10th anniversary celebrations at prominent 2024 identity events – one in Europe and one in the Americas.  Watch this space for further news about these as it develops!</p>

Like the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml">zero data</a><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/10/zero_data.shtml"> that I wrote about a few weeks ago</a>, cloudless computing is a great name that captures an idea that is profound.</p><p>Cloudless computing uses cryptographic identifiers, verifiable data, and location-independent compute1 to move apps to the data wherever it lives, to perform whatever computation needs to be done, at the edge. The genius of of the name cloudless computing is that it gets us out of the trenches of dapps, web3, blockchain, and other specific implementations and speaks to an idea or concept. The abstractions can make it difficult get a firm hold on the ideas, but it's important to getting past the how so we can speak to the what and why.</p><p>You be rightly skeptical that any of this can happen. Why will companies move from the proven cloud model to something else? In this talk, Peter Levine talks specifically to that question.</p>    <p>One of the core arguments for why more and more computing will move to the edge is the sheer size of modern computing problems. Consider one example: Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD). I happen to be a Tesla owner and I bought FSD. At first it was just because I am very curious about it and couldn't stand to not have first-hand experience with it. But now, I like it so much I use it all the time and can't imagine driving without an AI assist. But that's beside the point. To understand why that drives computing to the edge, consider that the round trip time to get an answer from the cloud is just too great. The car needs to make decisions onboard for this to work. Essentially, to put this in the cloudless perspective, the computation has to move to where the data from the sensors is. You move the compute to the data, not the other way around.2</p><p>And that's just one example. Levine makes the point, as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/05/imagining_trillion_node_networks.shtml">I and others</a> have done, that the Internet of Things leads to trillions of nodes on the Internet. This is a difference in scale that has real impact on how we architect computer systems. While today's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/07/alternatives_to_the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a> still relies largely on the cloud and centralized servers, that model can't last in a true Internet of Things.</p><p>The future world will be more decentralized than the current one. Not because of some grand ideal (although <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#self-sovereign">those certainly exist</a>) but simply because the problems will force it to happen. We're using computers in more dynamic environments than the more static ones (like web applications) of the past. The data is too large to move and the required latency too low. Cloudless computing is the future.</p>    Notes   <p>Anderson calls this deterministic computer. He uses that name to describe computation that is consistent and predictable regardless of how the application gets to the data, but I'm not sure that's the core idea. Location independence feels better to me.</p>  <p>An interesting point is that training the AI that drives the car is still done in the cloud somewhere. But once the model is built, it operates close to the data. I think this will be true for a lot of AI models.</p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/santafeegret/3279695354">Cloudless Sunset</a> from Dorothy Finley (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0 DEED</a> - cropped)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

  <p>Crisis situation are characterised by being urgent, complicated, nuanced, ambiguous and messy. The easy part is acknowledging that crisis presents exceptional and unprecedented challenges for organisations and leadership teams. In such periods, the stakes appear higher, and the decisions made can have far-reaching consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The question of whether a leadership team should think, act and behave differently during times of war, conflict, and crisis is undoubtedly open for debate. But what did the last global pandemic (crisis) teach us, and what lessons learned have we forgotten in the light of new wars?&nbsp;</p>   <p><br></p><p>Pre-pandemic leadership framing about how to deal with a crisis.</p> The vast majority of how to deal with a crisis pre-pandemic was based on coaching, training and mentoring but lacked real experience of the realities because global crises do not happen at scale very often. Whilst essential to prepare, thankfully most directors never get to work in a crisis and learn. Pre-COVID, the structured and passed down wisdom focussed on developing the following skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Be Adaptable: In times of crisis, including war and conflict, the operating environment becomes highly volatile and uncertain. A leadership team must become more adaptable and flexible to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Directors are trained to be more willing to recognise and pivot their strategies and make quick decisions, unlike stable times, where longer-term planning is often feasible.</p><p>Unity and Cohesion: A leadership team should act cohesively during a crisis and drop the niggles and power plays. Clear communication and collaboration among executives and directors are essential to ensure everyone is aligned and working towards a common goal. Unity is critical in times of uncertainty to maintain the organisation's stability and morale.</p><p>Decisiveness: Crisis demands decisiveness, with fewer facts and more noise, from its leaders. In the face of adversity, a leadership team should be ready to make tough choices promptly which will be very different to normal day-to-day thinking. Hesitation can be costly, and the consequences of indecision are amplified and become more severe during a crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Resource Allocation: A crisis will strain resources, making efficient and effective allocation idealistic and not practical. A leadership team should reevaluate its resource allocation, prioritising the needs based on the best opinion today, which will mean compromise and sacrifice.&nbsp; It is about doing your best, as it will never be the most efficient, effective or right.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk Management: In times of crisis, certain risks are heightened. A leadership team must adjust its risk management strategy, potentially being more conservative and prudent to safeguard the people and the organisation's long-term viability.</p> This is a lovely twee list, they are obvious, highly relevant and important, but the reality is totally different. Leaders and directors quickly move past these ideals to the reality of crisis management.&nbsp;  The day-to-day stress and grind of crisis surface the unsaid, hostile and uncomfortable - all aspects we learned in COVID and include. <br><p>Consistency: Maintaining a level of consistency across the leadership’s behaviour, regardless of the personal view and external circumstances. Drastic changes in leadership style create additional confusion and anxiety, creating an additional dimension to the existing crisis.</p><p>Ethical Compass: The moral and ethical compass of a leadership team should not waver in times of crisis. Principles such as honesty, integrity, acceptance, and respect (for all views and opinions that are legal) should be upheld, as compromising on ethics can lead to long-term damage to the individual and organisation's reputation.&nbsp; Different opinions matter, as does the importance of ensuring they are aired and discussed openly, however hard and uncomfortable.&nbsp; We might not agree because of our own framing, but that does not mean we actually know what is true or false.&nbsp;</p><p>Strategic Focus: While adaptability is important, a leadership team should not lose sight of its agreed long-term strategic vision. Abrupt changes can disrupt the organisation's core mission and values. Strategies may need to be tweaked, but the overarching values and vision should remain consistent, even in the face of uncertainty.&nbsp; If it does not - then there is a massively different issue you are facing.</p><p>Transparency: Honesty and transparency are essential, particularly during times of crisis. A leadership team should communicate openly with themselves, employees and stakeholders, providing them with a clear understanding of the challenges and the strategies being employed to overcome them.&nbsp; Those prioritising themselves over the cause and survival need to be cut free.&nbsp;</p><p>Legal and Regulatory Compliance: A leadership team should not compromise on legal and regulatory compliance, however much there is a push to the boundaries. Violating laws or regulations can lead to severe consequences that may outweigh any short-term benefits. Many will not like operating in grey areas, which might mean releasing of the leadership team.</p><p>Crisis on Crisis: because we don't know what is going on in someone else's head, heart or home, individuals can quickly run into burnout.&nbsp; We don’t know who has a sick child, a family member has cancer, lost a loved one or is just in a moment of doubt.&nbsp; Each leadership team should assume that everyone in their team needs help and support constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> What have we already forgotten? <p>Post-pandemic leadership quickly forgot about burnout, ethics, transparency and single-mindedness to revert to power plays, incentives and individualism.&nbsp; It was easy to return to where we are most comfortable, and most experiences exist - stability and no global crisis.&nbsp; Interest rates and debt access are hard but are not a crisis unless your model is shot. &nbsp; The congratulatory thinking focussed on we survived the global crisis, it was a blip that is unlikely to be repeated.&nbsp;</p><p>The unique challenges and pressures of war demand adaptability, unity, decisiveness, and resource allocation adjustments - essential skills.&nbsp; However, we have learned that this focus should not come at the expense of consistency, ethical integrity, strategic focus, transparency, and legal compliance. A leadership team's ability to strike this balance can determine the organisation's survival and success during the most trying times. Ultimately, leadership must adapt while maintaining its core values and principles to navigate the turbulent waters of wartime effectively.</p><p>Whether a leadership team should act differently in times of war is a matter of balance, but the lessons and skills we have need to be front and centre.&nbsp; Today, focus on the team and spend more time than ever checking in on your team, staff, suppliers and those in the wider ecosystem.&nbsp; Crisis and conflict destroys life and lives at many levels.</p> <br>

<p>After a lot of discussion on the mailing list over the last few months, and after some excellent discussions at the OAuth Security Workshop, we've been working on revising the draft to provide clearer guidance and clearer discussion of the threats and consequences of the various architectural patterns in the draft.</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/about.html">Philippe De Ryck</a> for stepping up to work on this draft as a co-author!</p>

<p>This version is a huge restructuring of the draft and now starts with a concrete description of possible threats of malicious JavaScript as well as the consequences of each. The architectural patterns have been updated to reference which of each threat is mitigated by the pattern. This restructuring should help readers make a better informed decision by being able to evaluate the risks and benefits of each solution.</p>

We had 315 people from around the world who called 163 sessions. The energy was high and I enjoyed seeing so many people who are working on identity talking with each other and sharing their ideas. The topics were diverse. Verifiable credentials continue to be a hot topic, but authorization is coming on strong. In closing circle someone said (paraphrashing) that authentication is solved and the next frontier is authorization. I tend to agree. We should have the book of proceedings completed in about a month and you'll be able to get the details of sessions there. You can <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">view past Books of Proceedings here</a>.</p><p>As I said, there were attendees from all over the world as you can see by the pins in the map at the top of this post. Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (212), followed by Canada (29). Japan, the UK, and Germany rounded out the top five with 9, 8, and 8 attendees respectively. Attendees from India (5), Thailand (3), and Korea (3) showed IIW’s diversity with attendees from APAC. And there were 4 attendees from South America this time. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa again. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you’d like to come to IIW38, please let us know. If you’re working on identity, we want you there.</p><p>In terms of states and provinces, California was, unsurprisingly, first with 81. Washington (32), British Columbia (14), Utah (11), Ontario (11) and New York (10) rounded out the top five. Seattle (22), San Jose (15), Victoria (8), New York (8), and Mountain View (6) were the top cities.</p><p>As always the week was great. I had a dozen important, interesting, and timely conversations. If Closing Circle and Open Gifting are any measure, I was not alone. IIW is where you will meet people help you solve problems and move your ideas forward. Please come! IIW 38 will be held April 16-18, 2024 at the Computer History Museum. We'll have tickets available soon.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

It is also grounded in the key role that digital identity plays in the wider international human rights agenda and the recent OECD Digital Identity Recommendations. </p>



<p>It is really difficult to write about digital identity when trying to put humanity (not individuals) AND society at the center. This paper is a very strong and considerate effort to try and tackle a broad, complicated, but important topic.</p>



<p>Elizabeth was kind enough to acknowledge me in the paper because of our shared viewpoint and discussions on how Value-Sensitive Design and Human-Centric Design are key cogs in building ethical and inclusive digital identity systems. But what she and Mark have tackled goes far beyond what I am able to do, and I do hope to see their work have a big impact on all the Identirati&nbsp;currently engaged in shaping the future of Digital Credentials and Digital Identity.</p>

<p>I convened the session “What does Presentation Exchange do and what parts of it do we actually need?” this week at the <a href="https://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> to continue the discussion started during <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2395">two unconference sessions</a> at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2023">2023 OAuth Security Workshop</a>.  I briefly summarized the discussions that occurred at OSW, then we had a vigorous discussion of our own.</p>
<p>Key points made were:</p>
 
 There appeared to be rough consensus in the room that Presentation Exchange (PE) is pretty complicated.  People had differing opinions on whether the complexity is worth it. 
 A lot of the complexity of PE comes from being able to request multiple credentials at once and to express alternatives. 
 Ultimately, the verifier knows what kinds of credentials it needs and the relationships between them.  PE tries to let the verifier express some of that to the wallet. 
 Code running in the verifier making choices about the credentials it needs will always be more powerful than PE, because it has the full decision-making facilities of programming languages – including loops, conditionals, etc. 
 Making a composite request for multiple credentials can have a better UX than a sequence of requests.  In some situations, the sequence could result in the person having to scan multiple QR codes.  There may be ways to avoid that, while still having a sequence of requests. 
 Some said that they need the ability to request multiple credentials at once. 
 Brent Zundel (a PE author) suggested that while wallets could implement all of PE, verifiers could implement only the parts they need. 
 Not many parties had implemented all of PE.  Torsten Lodderstedt suggested that we need feedback from developers. 
 We could create a profile of PE, reducing what implementers have to build and correspondingly reducing its expressive power. 
 
<p>The slides used to summarize the preceding discussions are available as <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pptx">PowerPoint</a> and <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3.pdf">PDF</a>.  There are <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/What_does_PE_do_and_what_do_we_need-Part_3_Notes.txt">detailed notes</a> capturing some of the back-and-forth at IIW with attribution.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated for an informative and useful discussion.  My goal was to help inform the profiling and deployment choices ahead of us.</p>
<p>P.S.  Since Thursday’s discussion, it occurred to me that a question I wish I’d asked is:</p>
 
 When a verifier needs multiple credentials, they may be in different wallets.  If the verifier tries to make a PE request for multiple credentials that are spread between wallets, will it always fail because no single wallet can satisfy it? 
 
<p>Fodder for the next discussion…</p>

  The relationship between the Postgres SQL/JSON Path operators @@ and @?
confused me. Here’s how I figured out the difference.

column. SQL/JSON Path, introduced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016" title="Wikipedia: “SQL:2016”">SQL:2016</a> and added to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">Postgres</a> in

lifecycle. It’s a powerful enabler and fundamental technology underpinning
CipherDoc. I’m so happy to have found it.</p>
 Confusion 
<p>However, the distinction between the SQL/JSON Path operators <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
confused me. Even as I found that the <code>@?</code> operator worked for my needs and <code>@@</code>
did not, I tucked the problem into my mental backlog for later study.</p>
<p>The question arose again on a recent work project, and I can take a hint. It’s
time to figure this thing out. Let’s see where it goes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb @? jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Does JSON path return any item for the specified JSON value? 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt; 2)' → t</code></p>
 
 
 <code>jsonb @@ jsonpath → boolean</code> 
 Returns the result of a JSON path predicate check for the specified JSON
value. Only the first item of the result is taken into account. If the
result is not Boolean, then <code>NULL</code> is returned. 
 
<p><code>'{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2' → t</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These read quite similarly to me: Both return true if the path query returns an
item. So what’s the difference? When should I use <code>@@</code> and when <code>@?</code>? I went so
far as to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/77046554/79202" title="Stack Overflow: What's the difference between the PostgreSQL @? and @@ JSONB Operators?">ask Stack Overflow</a> about it. The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/77046858/79202">one answer</a> directed my attention
back to the <code>jsonb_path_query()</code> function, which returns the results from a
path query.</p>
<p>So let’s explore how various SQL/JSON Path queries work, what values various
expressions return.</p>
 Queries 
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING-TABLE" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Functions and Operators">The docs</a> for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> say:<a>1</a></p>
<blockquote>
 
 <code>jsonb_path_query ( target jsonb, path jsonpath [, vars jsonb [, silent boolean ]] ) → setof jsonb</code> 
 Returns all JSON items returned by the JSON path for the specified JSON
value. If the <code>vars</code> argument is specified, it must be a JSON object, and
its fields provide named values to be substituted into the jsonpath
expression. If the <code>silent</code> argument is specified and is true, the
function suppresses the same errors as the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> operators do. 
 
  <code>select * from jsonb_path_query(
    '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}',
    '$.a[*] ? (@ &gt;= $min &amp;&amp; @ &lt;= $max)',
    '{"min":2, "max":4}'
) →
 jsonb_path_query
------------------
 2
 3
 4
</code>   
 
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that a SQL/JSON Path query may return more than one
value. This feature matters for the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code> operators, which return a
single boolean value based on the values returned by a path query. And path queries
can return a huge variety of values. Let’s explore some examples, derived from
the sample JSON value and path query from the docs.<a>2</a></p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This query returns the entire JSON value, because that’s what <code>$</code> selects at the
start of the path expression. The <code>?()</code> filter returns true because its
predicate expression finds at least one value in the <code>$.a</code> array greater than
<code>2</code>. Here’s what happens when the filter returns false:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 5)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>  <p>None of the values in the <code>$.a</code> array are greater than five, so the query
returns no value.</p>
<p>To select just the array, append it to the path expression after the <code>?()</code>
filter:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2).a');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
(1 row)
</code>   Path Modes 
<p>One might think you could select <code>$.a</code> at the start of the path query to get the
full array if the filter returns true, but look what happens:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
(3 rows)
</code>  <p>That’s not the array, but the individual array values that each match the
predicate. Turns out this is a quirk of the Postgres implementation of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">path
modes</a>. From what I can glean, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016" title="Wikipedia: “SQL:2016”">SQL:2016</a> standard dictates something like
these <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/json-path-expressions-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#PATHMODE" title="JSON Path Expressions (SQL Server): Path mode">SQL Server descriptions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 In lax mode, the function returns empty values if the path expression
contains an error. For example, if you request the value $.name, and the
JSON text doesn’t contain a name key, the function returns null, but
does not raise an error. 
 In strict mode, the function raises an error if the path expression
contains an error. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>But the Postgres lax mode does more than suppress errors. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#STRICT-AND-LAX-MODES" title="PostgresSQL Docs: Strict and Lax modes">the docs</a> (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lax mode facilitates matching of a JSON document structure and path
expression if the JSON data does not conform to the expected schema. If an
operand does not match the requirements of a particular operation, it can be
automatically wrapped as an SQL/JSON array or unwrapped by converting its
elements into an SQL/JSON sequence before performing this operation.
Besides, comparison operators automatically unwrap their operands in the lax
mode, so you can compare SQL/JSON arrays out-of-the-box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few more details, but this is the crux of it: In lax mode, which is
the default, Postgres always unwraps an array. Hence the unexpected list of
results.<a>3</a> This could be particularly confusing when querying multiple
rows:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, '$.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 3
 4
 5
 3
 5
 8
(6 rows)
</code>  <p>Switching to strict mode by preprending <code>strict</code> to the JSON Path query restores
the expected behavior:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query(v, 'strict $.a ?(@[*] &gt; 2)')
        from (values ('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb), ('{"a":[3,5,8]}')) x(v);
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 [3, 5, 8]
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>Important gotcha to watch for, and a good reason to test path queries thoroughly
to ensure you get the results you expect. Lax mode nicely prevents errors when a
query references a path that doesn’t exist, as this simple example demonstrates:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'lax $.b');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
(0 rows)
</code>  <p>In general, I suggest always using strict mode when executing queries. Better
still, perhaps always prefer strict mode with our friends the <code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>
operators, which <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSONB-OP-TABLE" title="PostgreSQL Docs: Additional jsonb Operators">suppress some errors even in strict mode</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The jsonpath operators <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> suppress the following errors: missing
object field or array element, unexpected JSON item type, datetime and numeric
errors. The <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions described below can also be told to
suppress these types of errors. This behavior might be helpful when searching
JSON document collections of varying structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.a';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}' @? 'strict $.b';
 ?column? 
----------

</code>  <p>No error for the unknown JSON key <code>b</code> in that second query! As for the error
suppression in the <code>jsonpath</code>-related functions, that’s what the <code>silent</code>
argument does. Compare:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b');
ERROR:  JSON object does not contain key "b"

select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', 'strict $.b', '{}', true);

</code>   Boolean Predicates 
<p>The Postgres <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH">SQL/JSON Path Language docs</a> briefly mention a pretty significant
deviation from the SQL standard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A path expression can be a Boolean predicate, although the SQL/JSON standard
allows predicates only in filters. This is necessary for implementation of the
<code>@@</code> operator. For example, the following <code>jsonpath</code> expression is valid in
PostgreSQL:</p>
<p><code>$.track.segments[*].HR &lt; 70</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pithy statement has pretty significant implications for the return value
of a path query. The SQL standard allows predicate expressions, which are akin
to an SQL <code>WHERE</code> expression, only in <code>?()</code> filters, as seen previously:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$ ?(@.a[*] &gt; 2)');
    jsonb_path_query    
------------------------
 {"a": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This can be read as “return the path <code>$</code> if <code>@.a[*] &gt; 2</code> is true. But have a
look at a predicate-only path query:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}', '$.a[*] &gt; 2');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This path query can be read as “Return the result of the predicate <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code>,
which in this case is <code>true</code>. This is quite the divergence from the standard,
which returns contents from the JSON queried, while a predicate query returns
the result of the predicate expression itself. It’s almost like they’re two
different things!</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the predicate path query return value with selecting a boolean
value from the JSON. Consider this example:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Looks the same as the predicate-only query, right? But it’s not, as shown by
adding another <code>true</code> value to the <code>$.a</code> array:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>This path query returns the <code>true</code>s it finds in the <code>$.a</code> array. The fact that
it returns values from the JSON rather than the filter predicate becomes more
apparent in strict mode, which returns all of <code>$a</code> if one or more elements of
the array has the value <code>true</code>:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}', 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)');
  jsonb_path_query   
---------------------
 [true, false, true]
(1 row)
</code>  <p>This brief aside, and its mention of the <code>@@</code> operator, turns out to be key to
understanding the difference between <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code>. Because it’s not just that
this feature is “necessary for implementation of the <code>@@</code> operator”. No, I would
argue that it’s the only kind of expression usable with the <code>@@</code> operator</p>
 Match vs. Exists 
<p>Let’s get back to the <code>@@</code> operator. We can use a boolean predicate JSON Path
like so:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 2';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>It returns true because the predicate JSON path query <code>$.a[*] &gt; 2</code> returns true.
And when it returns false?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code>  <p>So far so good. What happens when we try to use a filter expression that returns
a <code>true</code> value selected from the JSONB?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false]}'::jsonb @@ '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Looks right, doesn’t it? But recall that this query returns all of the
<code>true</code> values from <code>$.@</code>, but <code>@@</code> wants only a single boolean. What happens
when we add another?</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @@ 'strict $.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 &lt;null&gt;
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Now it returns <code>NULL</code>, even though it’s clearly true that <code>@[*] == true</code>
matches. This is because it returns all of the values it matches, as
<code>jsonb_path_query()</code> demonstrates:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 true
 true
(2 rows)
</code>  <p>This clearly violates the <code>@@</code> documentation claim that “Only the first item of
the result is taken into account”. If that were true, it would see the first
value is <code>true</code> and return true. But it doesn’t. Turns out, the corresponding
<code>jsonb_path_match()</code> function shows why:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, '$.a ?(@[*] == true)');
ERROR:  single boolean result is expected
</code>  <p>Conclusion: The documentation is inaccurate. Only a single boolean is expected
by <code>@@</code>. Anything else is an error.</p>
<p>Futhermore, it’s dangerous, at best, to use an SQL standard JSON Path expression
with <code>@@</code>. If you need to use it with a filter expression, you can turn it into
a boolean predicate by wrapping it in <code>exists()</code>:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_match('{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb, 'exists($.a ?(@[*] == true))');
 jsonb_path_match 
------------------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>But there’s no reason to do so, because that’s effectively what the <code>@?</code>
operator (and the corresponding, cleverly-named <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code> function
does): it returns true if the SQL standard JSON Path expression contains any
results:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[true,false,true]}'::jsonb @? '$.a ?(@[*] == true)';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>Here’s the key thing about <code>@?</code>: you don’t want to use a boolean predicate path
query with it, either. Consider this predicate-only query:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, '$.a[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 false
(1 row)
</code>  <p>But see what happens when we use it with <code>@?</code>:</p>
  <code>select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? '$.a[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>It returns true even though the query itself returns false! Why? Because <code>false</code>
is a value that exists and is returned by the query. Even a query that returns
<code>null</code> is considered to exist, as it will when a strict query encounters an
error:</p>
  <code>select jsonb_path_query('{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb, 'strict $[*] &gt; 6');
 jsonb_path_query 
------------------
 null
(1 row)

select '{"a":[1,2,3,4,5]}'::jsonb @? 'strict $[*] &gt; 6';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code>  <p>The key thing to know about the <code>@?</code> operator is that it returns true if
anything is returned by the path query, and returns false only if nothing is
selected at all.</p>
 The Difference 
<p>In summary, the difference between the <code>@?</code> and <code>@@</code> JSONB operators is this:</p>
 
 <code>@?</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_exists()</code>) returns true if the path query returns any
values — even <code>false</code> or <code>null</code> — and false if it returns no values.
This operator should be used only with SQL-standard JSON path queries that
select data from the JSONB. Do not use predicate-only JSON path expressions
with <code>@?</code>. 
 <code>@@</code> (and <code>jsonb_path_match()</code>) returns true if the path query returns the
single boolean value <code>true</code> and false otherwise. This operator should be
used only with Postgres-specific boolean predicate JSON path queries,
that return data from the predicate expression. Do not use SQL-standard JSON
path expressions with <code>@@</code>. 
 
<p>This difference of course assumes awareness of this distinction between
predicate path queries and SQL standard path queries. To that end, I <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/7262A188-59CA-4A8A-AAD7-83D4FF0B9758%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers — Patch: Improve Boolean Predicate JSON Path Docs">submitted
a patch</a> that expounds the difference between these types of JSON Path
queries, and plan to submit another linking these differences in the docs for
<code>@@</code> and <code>@?</code>.</p>
<p>Oh, and probably another to explain the difference in return values between
strict and lax queries due to array unwrapping.</p>

<p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ewie" title="GitHub: Erik Wienhold">Erik Wienhold</a> for patiently answering my <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/15DD78A5-B5C4-4332-ACFE-55723259C07F%40justatheory.com" title="pgsql-hackers —&nbsp;JSON Path and GIN Questions">pgsql-hackers

oddities of <code>@@</code> were previously discussed in detail.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well almost. The docs for <code>jsonb_path_query</code> actually say, about the
last two arguments, “The optional <code>vars</code> and <code>silent</code> arguments act the same
as for <code>jsonb_path_exists</code>.” I replaced that sentence with the relevant
sentences from the <code>jsonb_path_exists</code> docs, about which more later.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>Though omitting the <code>vars</code> argument, as variable interpolation just
gets in the way of understanding basic query result behavior.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/adjsn/json-path-expressions.html#GUID-8656CAB9-C293-4A99-BB62-F38F3CFC4C13" title="Oracle Database JSON Developer’s Guide: SQL/JSON Path Expression Syntax Relaxation">Oracle docs</a> also discuss “implicit array
wrapping and unwrapping”, but I don’t have a recent Oracle server to
experiment with at the moment.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Experiments with JSON-LD VC payloads secured by JWS vs. Data Integrity<br>Detailed results: <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json">https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-vcs-not-just-json</a></p><p>In the world of Verifiable Credentials (VCs), it can be hard to keep track of various evolving formats and data models. A potpourri of similar-sounding terms can be found in specification documents, mailing lists and meeting notes, such as VCDM, VC-JWT, VC-JWS, JWT VCs, SD-JWT, SD-JWT-VC, SD JWS, VC JOSE COSE, SDVC, JsonWebSignature2020, etc.</p><p>Also, statements like the following can frequently be found in discussions:</p>  “Can we make @context optional. It’s simpler and not always&nbsp;needed.”  “If you don’t want to use @context and just ignore it, you&nbsp;could.”  “You can secure a JSON-LD VC using&nbsp;JWT.”  “You can use SD-JWT for any JSON payload, including JSON-LD.”  “JSON-LD is&nbsp;JSON.”  <p>One concrete question related to this is what it means if a VC using the JSON-LD-based W3C VC Data Model is secured by proof mechanisms that were designed without JSON-LD in&nbsp;mind.</p> Experimentation <p>To explore this, I conducted two experiments to describe what happens if you take a JSON-LD document based on the W3C VC Data Model, and you secure it once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jose-cose/">JWS</a>, and once with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/">Data Integrity</a>. The former signs the document, while the latter signs the underlying RDF graph of the document. The part where this gets interesting is the JSON-LD @context. For JWS, only the contents of the document matter. For Data Integrity, the contents of the @context matter as well. The two proof mechanisms have a rather different understanding of the “payload” that is to be&nbsp;secured.</p> Experiment #1: Data Integrity changes, JWS&nbsp;doesn’t <p>In the first experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1a.input">example1a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1a.jsonld">context1a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example1b.input">example1b.input</a>, which is equivalent to the above example1a.input. This document also references the same JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context1/,">https://example.com/context1/,</a> but now, the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context1b.jsonld">context1b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context1a.jsonld that was used&nbsp;above.</p><p>The result: If the contents of the JSON-LD @context change, even if the JSON-LD document stays the same, the Data Integrity signature also changes, whereas the JWS signature doesn’t change. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would fail, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;succeed.</p> Experiment #2: JWS changes, Data Integrity doesn’t <p>In the second experiment, we start with a JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2a.input">example2a.input</a>. This document references a JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2a/,">https://example.com/context2a/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2a.jsonld">context2a.jsonld</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent variation of this, we start with another JSON-LD document named <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/examples/example2b.input">example2b.input</a>, which is different from the above example2a.input. The difference is that the first document used the term “givenName”, while the second document uses the term “firstName”. The second document references a different JSON-LD @context <a href="https://example.com/context2b/,">https://example.com/context2b/,</a> and the contents of that @context are as in the file <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/json-ld-not-just-json/blob/main/contexts/context2b.jsonld">context2b.jsonld</a>, which is different from the file context2a.jsonld that was used above. The difference is that the first @context defines the term “givenName”, while the second @context defines the term “firstName”, however, they define them using the same URI, i.e. with equivalent semantics.</p><p>The result: Despite the fact that the JSON-LD document changes, the Data Integrity signature doesn’t change, whereas the JWS signature changes. This is because Data Integrity “understands” that even though the document has changed, the semantics of the RDF graph are still the same. JWS on the other hand “sees” only the JSON-LD document, not the semantics behind it. This also means that verifying a Data Integrity signature would succeed, whereas verifying a JWS signature would&nbsp;fail.</p> Conclusion <p>Depending on your perspective, you could interpret the results in different ways. You could call Data Integrity insecure, since it depends on information outside the JSON document. You could also call JWS insecure, since it fails to secure the JSON-LD data&nbsp;model.</p><p>The real point of this article is however NOT to say that any of the mentioned data models or proof mechanisms are inherently insecure, but rather to raise awareness of the nuances. To say “JSON-LD is JSON” is correct on the document layer, and wrong on the data model layer. Certain combinations of data models and proof mechanisms can lead to surprising results, if they are not understood properly.</p>

<p>Writing this post is hard, because the emotions are still fresh and very raw. In so many ways, I feel like I was only just beginning to know Vittorio Luigi Bertocci.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, we all feel like we “know” him, because he has always been a larger-than-life character operating at the very forefront of our industry, driving the development of some of the most important of our industry standards efforts, and leading the effort to educate technologists everywhere through his conference talks and educational videos, blogs, and articles. His enthusiasm, humor, and depth of knowledge would make his talks on even the driest of topics engaging and effective. He was so incredibly open on social media, sharing everything from his travel experiences, to his experiments in health data tracking, to his misadventures in Starbucks naming. He was always willing to engage in conversation with anyone and everyone on a wide variety of topics – on identity, on books and science fiction, on philosophy. And he was not shy about sharing his opinions. But more than anything, he was always ready to help someone breaking into our complex and confusing world of identity. He would often say that it was driven by his narcissism. But even if that were true, at the core of it was a desire to make sure we were all working towards making identity better.</p>



<p>Yes, we have all felt like we “know” him. Who else in identity has an anime character? Who else but him could pull off literally stopping mid sentence during a conference talk to pose for the photographer? And that hair!</p>


 
<a href="https://7ee14c.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WithVittorio.jpg"></a> 


<p>But it was only in these last few months, as he learnt about and tried to battle the disease that took him away from us, did I get to know just how much the public persona was not a facade. He reached out and connected with many of us, with the kind of honesty, openness, love, and vulnerability that I do not think I would ever be capable of. And in doing so, he did what he always did best – he taught a bunch of us so much about ourselves, about each other, and brought us together in a way that would have been damn near impossible if it weren’t for him.</p>



<p>We have all been robbed, because Vittorio has been taken from us way, way too soon. But we have also been given a gift, one that goes way beyond Vittorio’s contributions to the field of digital identity that in no small measure have enabled all of us to make a living. The memories that live in our hearts, the lessons on what it means to be one of the identirati, and the passion for life itself that he exemplified, and that I now feel compelled to try and emulate – this will be his legacy, for me at least.</p>



<p>Love you Vittorio. Forever.</p>

But the benefits go far beyond better security. </p><p>A few weeks ago, I came across this <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">article from StJohn Deakin from 2020 about </a><a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">zero data</a>. I've been <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/08/zero_trust.shtml">thinking a lot about zero trust</a> lately, so the name leapt out at me. I immediately knew what StJohn was speaking about because I've been talking about it too. My new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, talks about the concept. But the name—zero data—is simply brilliant. I want to dig into zero data in this post. I'll discuss the link between zero data and zero trust in a future post.</p><p>StJohn describes the idea like this:</p><blockquote><p>Personal data should be held by humans first, and by the companies, organisations and governments that humans choose to interact with, second. The ultimate in ‘data minimisation’ is for the platforms in the centre to simply facilitate the interactions and not hold any data at all. This is the exact opposite of our Google/Facebook/Amazon dominated world where all human data is being concentrated in a few global silos.</p><p>A zero data society doesn’t mean that data isn’t shared between us, quite the opposite. With increased trust and participation, the data available and needed to drive our global society will explode exponentially.</p><p>From <a href="https://www.citizenme.com/the-future-of-data-is-zero-data/">The Future of Data is ‘Zero Data’</a><br>Referenced 2023-09-30T17:37:15-0600</p></blockquote><p>If you think about this in the context of how the internet has worked for the last three decades, the concept of zero data might seem baffling. Yet, consider a day in your life. How often do you establish lasting relationships—and thus share detailed information about yourself—with every individual or entity you come across? Almost never. It would be absurd to think that every time you grab a coffee from the local store, you'd need to form a lasting bond with the coffee machine, the cashier, the credit card terminal, and other customers just to facilitate your purchase. Instead, we exchange only the essential information required, and relevant parties retain just the data that is needed long term.</p><p>To build a zero data infrastructure we need to transfer trustworthy data just-in-time. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a> (VCs) offer a way to represent information so that its authenticity can be verified through cryptographic means. They can be thought of as digital attestations or proofs that are created by an issuer about a subject and are presented by the holder to a verifier as required. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85d2af5e-4625-42c5-bf60-f69e2dbfbe24.heic">    </a>Verifiable Credential Exchange  <p>Here are some of the interaction patterns facilitated by verifiable credentials:</p>  <p>Selective Disclosure: VCs enable users to share only specific parts of a credential. For instance, a user can prove they are of legal age without revealing their exact date of birth.</p>  <p>Credential Chaining: Multiple credentials can be linked together, enabling more complex proofs and interactions. For example, an employer might hire an employee only after receiving a VC proving they graduated and another proving their right to work.</p>  <p>Holder-Driven Data Exchange: Instead of organizations pulling data about users, VCs shift the interaction model to users pushing verifiable claims to organizations when needed.</p>  <p>Anonymous Credential Proofs: VCs can be designed to be presented anonymously, allowing users to prove a claim about themselves without revealing their identity. For example, VCs can be used to prove the customer is a human with less friction than CAPTCHAs.</p>  <p>Proofs without Data Transfer: Instead of transferring actual data, users can provide cryptographic proofs that they possess certain data or prove predicates about the data, reducing the exposure of personal information. For example, VCs can be used to prove that the subject is over 21 without revealing who the subject is or even their birthdate.</p>  <p>Adaptive Authentication: Depending on the sensitivity of an online interaction, users can be prompted to provide VCs of varying levels of assurance, enhancing security in adaptable ways. I plan to talk about this more in my next post about zero data and zero trust.</p>  <p>These interaction patterns change traditional data management and verification models, enabling businesses to retain considerably less data on their clients. Verifiable credentials have numerous benefits and features of that provide a positive impact on data management, security, and user trust:</p>  <p>Data Minimization: As we've seen, with VCs, users can prove facts without revealing detailed data. By selectively sharing parts of a credential, business only see necessary information, leading to overall reduced data storage and processing requirements.</p>  <p>Reduced Redundancy &amp; Data Management: Trustworthy VCs reduce the need for duplicate data, simplifying data management. There's less need to track, backup, and maintain excess data, reducing complexity and associated costs.</p>  <p>Expiration, Revocation, &amp; Freshness of Data: VCs can be designed with expiration dates and can be revocable. This ensures verifiers rely on up-to-date credentials rather than outdated data in long-term databases.</p>  <p>Trust through Standardized Protocols: VCs, built on standardized protocols, enable a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a>. Multiple businesses can thus trust and verify the same credential, benefiting from reduced integration burdens and ensuring less custom development.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security &amp; Reduced Exposure to Threats: Data minimization reduces the size of the so-called honey pot, reducing the attraction for cyber-attacks and, in the event of a breach, limit the potential damage, both in terms of data exposed and reputational harm.</p>  <p>Compliance, Regulatory Benefits &amp; Reduced Liability: Adhering to data minimization aligns with many regulations, reducing potential legal complications. Storing minimal data also decreases organizational liability and regulatory scrutiny.</p>  <p>Cost Efficiency: By storing less data, organizations can achieve significant savings in storage infrastructure and IT operations, while also benefiting from focused data analytics.</p>  <p>Enhanced User Trust &amp; Reputation: By collecting only essential data, organizations can build trust with users, gaining a competitive edge in a privacy-conscious market that is increasingly growing tired of the abuses of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/05/can_the_digital_future_be_our_home.shtml">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>  <p>In essence, verifiable credentials shift the paradigm from "data collection and storage" to "data verification and trust." Online interactions are provided with the assurance they need without the business incurring the overhead (and risk) of storing excessive customer data. Zero data strategies not only reduce the potential attack surface for cyber threats but also offers a variety of operational, financial, and compliance benefits.</p><p>The biggest objection to a zero data strategy is likely due to its decentralized nature. Troves of user data make people comfortable by giving them the illusion of ready access to the data they need, when they need it. The truth is that the data is often unverified and stale. Nevertheless, it is the prevailing mindset. Gettng used to just-in-time, trustworthy data requires changing attitudes about how we work online. But the advantages are compelling.</p><p>And, if your business model depends on selling data about your customers to others (or facilitating their use of this data in, say, an ad network) then giving up your store of data may threaten precious business models. But this isn’t an issue for most businesses who just want to facilitate transactions with minimal friction.</p><p>Zero data aligns our online existence more closely with our real-world interactions, fostering new methods of communication while decreasing the challenges and risks associated with amassing, storing, and utilizing vast amounts of data. When your customers can prove things about themselves in real time, you'll see several benefits beyond just better security:</p>  <p>Reduced Sign-Up Friction: For services that rely on verified attributes (e.g., age, membership status, qualifications), users can <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/01/better_onboarding_with_verifiable_credentials.shtml">provide these attributes quickly with VCs, eliminating lengthy sign-up or verification processes</a>.</p>  <p>Cross-Platform Verification: A VC issued by one service can be verified and trusted by another, facilitating smoother cross-platform interactions and reducing the need for users to repetitively provide the same information.</p>  <p>Fewer intermediaries: VCs can allow for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">direct trust between parties without the need for a centralized authority</a>. This fosters more direct and decentralized interactions.</p>  <p>Zero data, facilitated by verifiable credentials, represents a pivotal transition in how digital identity is used in online interactions. By minimizing centralized data storage and emphasizing cryptographic verifiability, this approach aims to address the prevalent challenges in data management, security, and user trust. Allowing online interactions to more faithfully follow established patterns of transferring trust from the physical world, the model promotes just-in-time data exchanges and reduces unnecessary data storage. As both businesses and individual users grapple with the increasing complexities of digital interactions, the integration of verifiable credentials and a zero data framework stands out as a practical, friction-reducing, security-enhancing solution for the modern digital landscape.</p>

<p>Over the last year, I designed and implemented a simple web service, code-named
“CipherDoc”, that provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" title="Wikipedia: “Create, read, update, and delete”">CRUD</a> API for creating, updating, searching, and
deleting <a href="https://json.org" title="ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard">JSON</a> documents. The app enforces document structure via <a href="https://json-schema.org" title="JSON Schema is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents">JSON
schema</a>, while <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> powers the search API by querying a hashed subset
of the schema stored in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin.html" title="PostgreSQL Docs: GIN Indexes">GIN-indexed</a> <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html" title="PostgresSQL Docs: JSON Types">JSONB</a> column in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" title="PostgreSQL: The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database">Postgres</a>.</p>
<p>In may I gave a public presentation on the design and implementation of the
service at <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/" title="PGCon - PostgreSQL Conference for Users and Developers">PGCon</a>: CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on
Postgres. Links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/events/pgcon_2023/schedule/session/360-a-pattern-for-a-searchable-encrypted-json-document-service/" title="PGCon 2023 — CipherDoc: A Searchable, Encrypted JSON Document Service on Postgres">Description</a>

<p>I enjoyed designing this service. The ability to dynamically change the JSON
schema at runtime without database changes enables more agile development cycles
for busy teams. Its data privacy features required a level of intellectual
challenge and raw problem-solving (a.k.a., engineering) that challenge and
invigorate me.</p>
<p>Two minor updates since May:</p>
 
 I re-implemented the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-json.html#DATATYPE-JSONPATH" title="PostgreSQL Docs: jsonpath Type">JSON/SQL Path</a> parser using the original Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_15_4/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonpath_gram.y" title="jsonpath_gram.y: Grammar definitions for jsonpath datatype">path grammar</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goyacc" title="Goyacc is a version of yacc for Go. It is written in Go and generates parsers written in Go">goyacc</a>, replacing the hand-written parser roundly
castigated in the presentation. 
 The service has yet to be open-sourced, but I remain optimistic, and
continue to work with leadership at The Times towards an open-source
policy to enable its release.

<p>I wrote a post last year about Buzz theory, and the year before about <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-twitter-works-in-theory.html">Twitter theory</a>, so I thought I'd compare how Google+ (hereafter Plus) fits in with them too.</p> Flow <p>Plus is a <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/08/flow-past-web-even-better-than-realtime.html">flow</a> but it is re-ordered by responses to posts. It has a second flow of Notifications, that not only has an unread count (though it caps out at 9+), but that lurks atop every Google page, drawing you back in as you search or read gmail. What it chooses to notify you about are people who follow you (now mercifully collated into clumps, comments on your posts, and people plussing you (the equivalent of twitter @replies). Like Buzz, these Notifications end up privileged over the core flow, and also email you by default. </p> Faces <p>There are <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2009/05/faces-call-trust-code-in-our-brains.html">faces</a> of people next to each post, tapping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads. The replies and notifications have smaller faces, which makes it harder to work out who they are, as this is where strangers show up more. The faces shown for the circle you're watching, or the list of people also in a limited post are very tiny indeed.</p> Phatic <p>The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there, but at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuThg91-4Nw">the launch</a> there was much talk of Google 'hiding the irrelevant' so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine.</p><p>The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially. The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the 'naked in the school lunchroom' nightmare.</p> Following <p>Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model, and indeed adds a way to create private Buzzes for small groups, both key features. However, these are undermined by the confusing editing process. The Follower/Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;shva=1#buzz">Buzz in gmail</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/me">Google Profile</a> pages, and because of the auto-follow onboarding, rather opaque. The groups editing is in <a href="http://">Google Contacts</a>, but that doesn't show the Followers, Following, Chat Friends, Latitude or other subgroups. There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups.</p><p>The overall effect makes it feel more like a <a href="http://kevan.org/morningtonia.pl?MC_On_The_Net">Mornington Crescent server</a> than Twitter. I made a <a href="http://">Mornington Crescent</a> Buzz account; it seems to fit.</p> Publics <p>Twitter's natural view is different for each of us, and is of those we have chosen. We each have our own public that we see and we address. </p><p>The subtlety is that the <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/2008/04/digital-publics-conversations-and.html">publics</a> are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us, as they don't necessarily follow us, and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started. To see responses to us from those we don't follow, we have to click the Mentions tab. However, as our view is of those we choose to follow, our emotional response is set by that, and we behave more civilly in return.</p><p>Buzz reverses this. The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab, but anyone can use '@' to mention you, forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox. Similarly, if you comment on someone else's Buzz, any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox. The <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/11/06/the_tragedy_of_the_comments.php">tragedy of the comments</a> ensues, where <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/conferences/blog/2006/07/oscon_how_open_source_projects.html">annoying people</a> can take over the discussion, and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow.</p><p>This is the <a href="http://xkcd.com/202/">YouTube comments problem</a> yet magnified; when all hear the words of one, the conversation often decays.</p> Mutual media <p>By bringing in Twitter,blogs, Google Reader shared items, photos and other Activity Streams feeds, Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/09/Information-Aristocracy">listening Web</a> to the email dwellers who may left behind. By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others, we are each others media, we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation. Although we each only touch a local part of it, ideas can travel a long way.</p><p>If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz, this could be made to work.</p> Small world networks <p>Social connections are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Market/dp/0393325423%3FSubscriptionId%3D1K3HRANMNP9TFHJC9282%26tag%3Depeusepigone-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393325423">small-world network</a> locally strongly-connected, but spreading globally in a small number of jumps. The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/11/29/attention_netwo.html">model</a> of real world social networks that articulated SNS's like Facebook, but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed.</p><p>Buzz's promise is that it builds on <a href="http://activitystrea.ms/">Activity Streams</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/dclinton/XxER6oP4WGe/The-best-way-to-get-a-sense-of-where-the-Buzz-API">other open standards</a>, so it could help encourage others to do this better.</p>
