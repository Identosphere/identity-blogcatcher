   Everything You Always Wanted To Know About GitHub (But Were Afraid To Ask) 
 ClickHouse by Yandex is an open source column-oriented data warehouse, designed to run analytical queries against TBs of data. They've loaded the full GitHub Archive of events since 2011 into a public instance, which is a great way of both exploring GitHub activity and trying out ClickHouse. Here's a query I just ran that

They've loaded the full GitHub Archive of events since 2011 into a public instance, which is a great way of both exploring GitHub activity and trying out ClickHouse.

<p>Back when I was running Elgg, I'd meet someone every few weeks who wanted to build a competitor to Facebook. Inevitably, they would propose to do this by copying all of Facebook's features verbatim, but (for example) without an ad ecosystem or with a different algorithm for surfacing content. All of them were doomed to fail.</p><p>These days, I'm more distant from the alternative social networking ecosystem, but it's easy to spot the same ideas. One might propose a decentralized alternative to Facebook that has all of Facebook's features, for example, and assume that people will flock to it because it's not owned by a corporation. You care about privacy and ownership, after all - if others don't, surely it's just a matter of educating them?</p><p>Aside from with a relative handful of enthusiasts, these efforts are probably all doomed to fail, too.</p><p>The thing is, privacy and ownership are important, and over the last few years we've seen our quiet worries about silos of data owned by single-point-of-failure corporations grow into a global roar about their role in supporting pogroms and undermining democracies. Nonetheless, we've learned pretty conclusively that privacy and autonomy are not virtues for everyone - actually a lesson learned again and again in the 20th century in particular - so if we want these values to be adopted, we must find another way. The stakes around getting this right have never been higher. (It would have been nice to have gotten this right in 2015 or so, but here we are.)</p><p>People, in general, want convenience from their technology, not morality. So instead of building a more ethical version of the past, we need to build a more suitable version of the future. It turns out that data silos have left room for plenty of innovation here: how many people send emails to themselves to save a note, or have had trouble AirDropping to an Android phone? Why do I have to download WhatsApp to talk to my friends in the UK? There are lots of tiny inconveniences that would be made better with openness and a user-centered model.</p><p>The same is true of online communities. An artists' community has radically different needs to an activism community, yet on the silos they're shoehorned into the same interface and set of features. Communities for people with restricted vision or motion might perhaps be the most obvious example: why should they have to struggle to use interfaces designed for others? Or better put, why can't they have an internet experience designed for them? A federated galaxy of community platforms, tailored for the specific human communities that use them and linked by Google-like sites that facilitate discovery, would be a more functional internet for many people, and would also decentralize the social web. Over time, discovery could be decentralized, too.</p><p>Whatever we're building, we never absolve ourselves from the need to understand our users as people and meet their needs. We might have our own values that we want to convey - software as polemic - but we can't simply inject them into the status quo. We've got to use our values, our intuition, and our understanding of the people we're building our software for to build something new that serves its purpose better than anything that has come before it. That, and nothing less, is the job.</p>

A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a> a standardized specification that provides a mechanism to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.  <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/103_1_2020/">CAN/CIOSC 103–1:2020 Digital Trust And Identity — Part 1</a> specifies minimum requirements and a set of controls for creating and maintaining trust in digital systems and services that, as part of an organization’s mandate, assert and or consume identity and credentials in data pertaining to people and Organizations.  <p>Admittedly, I am writing this for the Canadian context (as the third choice is Canadian-only, so insert your own national or international standard here), but the main reasons I have chosen these three is because they represent a new way forward to develop a digital ecosystem that is open, inclusive, and balanced in favour towards the individual.</p><p>I realize that there are many more standards at play, but it is my belief that it is these three that will enable trusted digital identity across many ecosystems — across industries and across political boundaries.</p><p>That’s my start for&nbsp;2021!</p>

<p>My superpower has always been finding new uses for old tech. In the late 90s I dusted off the venerable NNTP server, which had been the backbone of the Usenet, and turned it into my team’s Slack. In the late 2000s I used iCalendar to make citywide event calendars. In the late 2010s I went deep into SQL.</p>
<p>It’s always intensely pragmatic. But also, I can’t deny, whimsical.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I offer you the public pay phone at the Pinnacles Visitor Center. I stayed in that campground on a road trip just before the election. Given the tense political and epidemiological situation, I’d promised to message home regularly. There was no cell service in the park so I headed over to the office. It was closed, so I sat on the bench and connected to their WiFi. Or tried to. You could connect, sometimes, but you couldn’t move any data. The router was clearly in need of a reboot.</p>
<p>The only option left was the public phone. I can’t remember the last time I used one. Most people alive today have, perhaps, never used one. But there it was, so I gave it a shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time, you could pick up the handset, dial 0 for operator, and place a so-called collect (charge-reversed) call. Now dialing 0 gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>The instructions taped to the phone (in the 90s I’m guessing) say you can call an 800 number, or use a calling card. I remember calling cards, I had one once. Not a thing lately.</p>
<p>And then there was this: “Dial 611 for help.”</p>
<p>Me: 611</p>
<p>611: Hello, this is Steve.</p>
<p>Me: I’m at the Pinnacles Visitor Center trying to send a message.</p>
<p>Steve: Use the WiFi.</p>
<p>Me: I can’t, it’s broken.</p>
<p>Steve: Huh, that’s interesting. Let me see if I can reboot the router.</p>
<p>And he did. So there you have it. The public phone still provides a valuable service. Its mission has evolved over the years. Nowadays, it exists to summon Steve the IT guy who can fix the WiFi by turning it off and on again. </p>
<p>Works like a charm!</p>

<p>I'd love to see more of you blog.</p><p>A friend of mine recently asked me how I write so much: to him, writing was a daunting task involving staring at a blank screen while he overcame his fear of revealing his inner thoughts. I guess, for me, what it comes down to is that I've lost any fear of looking stupid, mostly through enough repetitive practice of absolutely being stupid online.</p><p>Writing is a muscle. Imagine running for the first time: that first run is painful, halting. But once you've done it for a week, it's a little bit easier. A month: easier still. And once you've done it for years, it's like second nature. A part of you. I've been blogging since 1998; at this point, it's just a part of me.</p><p>Imagine what the internet would be like if everyone shared how they thought about the world, commercial value be damned. I don't buy the idea that only some people have thoughts worth reading (if I did, I wouldn't be writing this, because I'd almost certainly not be among that group). Everyone has something of value to contribute to our cumulative human experience.</p><p>What I get in return is that I feel less alone. When you put yourself out there, and are honest, you tend to find like-minded people, or people who have some honest reaction to your ideas. If you put up a wall, the most people can react to is that façade. So it's best to be you. As it happens, every single meaningful career acceleration I've ever had can be connected back to my blogging. More importantly, I've made a bunch of friends.</p><p>So, I think you should blog, too. It doesn't matter where. WordPress, Ghost, Medium, Where.as, Micro.blog, Where.as, Substack, a public Notion page - wherever is comfortable for you. (I co-founded a platform called <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a>, which I happily still use, mostly for the satisfaction of working with something I helped make.)</p><p>And then you should tell me about it. And tell the world. I want to read what you think, and the world does too. We're all richer for sharing out human experiences together.</p>

  <p>My Christmas present to myself this year was to allow myself to spend a week working on stuff I found interesting, rather than sticking to the most important things. This may have been a mistake: it's left me with a flurry of interesting but not-quite-finished features.</p>
 Prettier for Datasette 
<p>A couple of years ago <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/449">I decided</a> to adopt <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a>, an opinionated code formatter, for all of my Python projects.</p>
<p>This proved to be a much, much bigger productivity boost than I had expected.</p>
<p>It turns out I had been spending a non-trivial portion of my coding brain cicles thinking about code formatting. I was really stressing the details over how data structures should be indented, or how best to attempt to hit a 80 character line length limit.</p>
<p>Letting go and outsourcing all of that nit-picking to Black meant I didn't have to spend any time thinking about that stuff, at all. It as so liberating! It even changed the way I write unit tests, as I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Feb/11/cheating-at-unit-tests-pytest-black/">How to cheat at unit tests with pytest and Black</a>.</p>
<p>I've been hoping to adopt something similar for JavaScript for ages. The leading contender in that space is <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, but I've held back because I didn't like the aesthetics of its handling of chained method calls.</p>
<p>That's a pretty dumb reason to lose out on such a big productivity boost, so I've decided to forget about that issue entirely.</p>
<p>Datasette doesn't have much JavaScript at the moment, but that's likely to change in the future. So I've applied Prettier to the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette/static/table.js">table.js</a> file and configured a GitHub action that will fail if Prettier hasn't been applied - I wrote that up <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/prettier-github-actions">as a TIL</a>.</p>
 JavaScript plugins for Datasette 
<p>This is why I've been thinking about JavaScript: I've been pushing forward on the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983">open issue</a> to provide a JavaScript plugin mechanism that Datasette plugins can hook into.</p>
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins.html">Python plugins</a> use <a href="https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pluggy</a>, and I absolutely love it - it's a powerful, simple and elegant way to define plugins and have them cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Pluggy works by defining "hooks" and allowing plugins to register to respond to those hooks. When a hook is called by Datasette's core code each plugin gets to return a value, and the collected values from all of them are made available as a Python list.</p>
<p>I want the same thing for JavaScript. As an example, consider the "column actions" menu activated by the cog icon on each column on <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">the table page</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like plugins written in JavaScript to be able to return additional menu items to be shown in that menu - similar to how Python plugins can extend the existing table actions menu using <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#table-actions-datasette-actor-database-table">the menu_actions hook</a>.</p>
<p>I've been fleshing out ideas for this in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983">issue 693</a>, and I'm getting close to something that I'm happy with.</p>
<p>A big concern is loading times. I'd like to keep Datasette pages loading as quickly as possible, so I don't want to add a large chunk of JavaScript to each page to support plugins - and potentially have that block the page load until the script has been fetched and parsed.</p>
<p>But... if a JavaScript plugin is going to register itself with the plugin system, it needs to be able to call an API function to register itself! So at least some plugin JavaScript has to be made available as soon as possible in the lifecycle of the page.</p>
<p>I've always admired how Google Analytics deals with this problem. They define a tiny <code>ga()</code> function to start collecting analytics options, then execute those as soon as the larger script has been asynchronously loaded:</p>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');  
<p>Could I build a plugin system that's so small I can inline it into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of every page without worrying about the extra page bulk?</p>
<p>I think I can. Here's the smallest version I've reached so far:</p>
  var datasette = datasette || {};
datasette.plugins = (() =&gt; {
  var registry = {};
  return {
    register: (hook, fn, parameters) =&gt; {
      if (!registry[hook]) {
        registry[hook] = [];
      }
      registry[hook].push([fn, parameters]);
    },
    call: (hook, args) =&gt; {
      args = args || {};
      var results = [];
      (registry[hook] || []).forEach(([fn, parameters]) =&gt; {
        /* Call with the correct arguments */
        var result = fn.apply(
          fn,
          parameters.map((parameter) =&gt; args[parameter])
        );
        if (result !== undefined) {
          results.push(result);
        }
      });
      return results;
    },
  };
})();  
<p>Which minifies (with <a href="https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/">uglify-es</a>) to just 250 characters - it fits in a tweet!</p>
<p><code>var datasette=datasette||{};datasette.plugins=(()=&gt;{var a={};return{register:(t,r,e)=&gt;{a[t]||(a[t]=[]),a[t].push([r,e])},call:(t,r)=&gt;{r=r||{};var e=[];return(a[t]||[]).forEach(([a,t])=&gt;{var s=a.apply(a,t.map(a=&gt;r[a]));void 0!==s&amp;&amp;e.push(s)}),e}}})();</code></p>
<p>Matthew Somerville suggested <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983#issuecomment-752888552">an even shorter version</a> using object destructuring to get it down to 200 bytes. I'll probably adopt that idea in my next iteration.</p>
<p>As part of this work I've also started thinking about how I can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1164">introduce minification</a> into the Datasette development process, and how I can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1165">start writing unit tests</a> for the JavaScript. I <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/javascript/jest-without-package-json">tried using Jest</a> at first but now I'm leaning towards <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>, since that will help support writing browser automation tests against some of the more advanced functionality as well.</p>
 datasette insert 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1160">Issue 1160</a> tracks my work on a big new idea for Datasette: <code>datasette insert</code>.</p>
<p>Datasette assumes you already have data in a SQLite database. Getting that data into your database is an exercise left for the user.</p>
<p>I've been building <a href="https://datasette.io/tools">a plethora of additional tools</a> to help with that challenge - things like <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/csvs-to-sqlite">csvs-to-sqlite</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a> and so-on.</p>
<p>I want Datasette itself to include this functionality, starting with a new <code>datasette insert</code> sub-command.</p>
<p>So why bring this functionality into Datasette itself? A few reasons:</p>
 
 Helping people install Python software is hard enough already, without them needing to install multiple tools. If I can tell someone to <code>brew install datasette</code> and then <code>datasette insert data.db file.csv</code> they'll have a much easier time than if they have to install and learn additional tools as well. 
 This is a fantastic opportunity for plugin hooks. I want a plugin hook that lets people build additional import formats for Datasette - by default it will support CSV, TSV and JSON but I want to be able to add GeoJSON and Shapefiles and DBF files and Excel and all sorts of other things. 
 Crucially, I plan to build both a command-line interface and a web interface within Datasette that lets people upload files - or copy and paste in their content, or specify a URL to import them from. This means any new format plugins will enable not just a command-line interface but a web interface for importing that data as well. 
 It's still possible that Datasette will evolve beyond just SQLite in the future. I don't want to have to build <code>yaml-to-postgresql</code> and so on - this new Datasette plugin hook could support importing formats into other databases too in the future. 
 
<p>I made some initial progress on this but it's going to be a while before I can land anything to <code>main</code>.</p>
 Storing metadata in _metadata tables 
<p>Last week <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Dec/27/weeknotes-datasette-internals/">I wrote about</a> the new <code>_internal</code> in-memory database in Datasette, which collects details of every attached database, table and column in order to power things like a forthcoming searchable, paginated homepage.</p>
<p>This made me think: what else could I address with in-memory SQLite databases?</p>
<p>I realized that this could overlap with a truly ancient Datasette feature idea: the abiilty to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/188">bundle metadata and templates</a> within the SQLite database files that Datasette exposes. Bundling metadata is particularly interesting as it would allow that metadata to "travel" with the data, contained in the same binary SQLite file.</p>
<p>So I've been doing a whole lot of thinking about how this might work - including how the existing <code>metadata.json</code> format passed to Datasette when it starts up could be read into an in-memory database and then further combined with any metadata baked into tables in the various attached databases.</p>
<p>The work is entirely <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1168">an issue thread</a> at the moment, but I'm excited to spend more time on it in the future. I want to implement column-level metadata as part of this, so you can finally attach information to columns to help describe what they actually represent.</p>
 sqlite-utils cached table counts 
<p><code>select count(*) from table</code> can be a slow query against large database tables, in both SQLite and PostgreSQL. This often surprises people - surely it should be trivial for a relational database to cache the total number of rows in a table? It turns out that's not actually possible, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">MVCC</a> - a relational database needs to be able to correctly answer that query from the point of view of the current transaction, even while other transactions are inserting or deleting rows.</p>
<p>Datasette tries to show the count of rows in a table in various places. This has lead to a number of performance issues when running against large tables - Datasette has a number of existing tricks for handling that, including timing out counts after 50ms and caching the counts for databases opened in "immutable" mode, but it's still a source of problems.</p>
<p>For a while I've been contemplating working around this with triggers. SQLite has a robust triggers system - how about writing triggers that increment or decrement a counter any time a row is inserted or deleted from a table?</p>
<p>My initial experiments indicate that this can indeed work really well!</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/212">been implementing this</a> in <code>sqlite-utils</code>. Like most features of that package it comes in two flavours: a Python API you can call from your own code, and a command-line tool you can use to directly manipulate a database.</p>
<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/latest/python-api.html#enabling-cached-counts-for-a-table">Enabling cached counts for a table</a> in the Python API documentation describes how this works. You can call <code>db.enable_counts()</code> on a database to install the triggers, after which a <code>_counts</code> table will be automatically updated with a count record for each table.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/latest/cli.html#enabling-cached-counts">sqlite-utils enable-counts</a> command can be used to configure this from the command-line.</p>
<p>The triggers it adds for a table look like this:</p>
  CREATE TRIGGER [plants_counts_insert] AFTER INSERT ON [plants]
BEGIN
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO [_counts]
  VALUES (
    'plants',
    COALESCE(
      (SELECT count FROM [_counts] WHERE [table] = 'plants'),
    0
    ) + 1
  );
END
CREATE TRIGGER [plants_counts_delete] AFTER DELETE ON [plants]
BEGIN
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO [_counts]
  VALUES (
    'plants',
    COALESCE(
      (SELECT count FROM [_counts] WHERE [table] = 'plants'),
    0
    ) - 1
  );
END  
<p>I haven't benchmarked it yet, but my expectation is that this will add a minimal overhead to <code>INSERT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> operations against that table. If your table isn't handling hundreds of writes a second I expect the overhead to be inconsequential.</p>
<p>This work is mostly done, and should be out in a <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a> release within a few days.</p>
<p>Update 3rd January 2021: this is all now released in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-2">sqlite-utils 3.2</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>A couple of years ago, I realized I wasn't reading books anymore. I was reading a ton - mostly stuff on the web - but I hadn't managed to physically open a book and read it cover to cover. I was ashamed, and immediately made a resolution: that year, I would read fifty books.</p><p>It was obviously an arbitrary number: more or less one or week, with room for a little bit of slippage. But having that North Star meant that I read more eclectically and adventurously, and although I didn't quite hit fifty, I read an order of magnitude more than I had the previous year, discovering a host of authors in the process. (Incidentally, this effort was also the origin of my reading roundups every month, which I've also found to be useful retrospectives.)</p><p>2020 was a mess, and no more needs to be said about that. Most of the books I "read" were audiobooks, via <a href="https://libro.fm/">Libro.fm</a>, which largely replaced my podcast listening. It was hard, for most of the year, to bring my brain to a calm enough place to read words on a page at length.</p><p>This year, though, I've decided to revive my 50-book goal. I have a different reason: too often, the last thing I look at when I go to bed is a screen. My intention is to build the very normal and common habit of reading a book before going to sleep, instead of, for example, falling down a web rabbithole or checking Twitter. And I miss the eclectic, long-form thinking that can only be found in books.</p><p>It's rare that I'm able to get into a business book: these often feel like overlong blog posts that have been padded out for the prestige of having a publication under the author's belt. Some people pride themselves on only reading these, but I think this limitation forces you to miss out on the wealth of human experience. Fiction is more than a diversion; it's an experimental playground for empathy and human thought. It's weird to me that some people have a stigma around it. Conversely, I don't want to lock myself off from reading business books, and there's certainly a lot to learn. I just think that if something could be a blog post, it should be.</p><p>My mother is also an avid reader. Largely confined to her bed, she devours books on her Kindle (because the font size can be increased to satisfy her failing eyesight) and on Audible. Sometimes, when she's stuck in dialysis or having a particularly bad day, my sister will FaceTime her and read to her over a call. When she's done, she records her review in one of those hardback notebooks filled with close-lined paper, and moves immediately onto the next one.</p><p>I also feel the need to record what I've read, with some kind of a brief review of how I found it. My equivalent of a notebook is <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>, which I already use to keep track of my bookmarks. I've altered my reading database to keep track of books now, too. It's occurred to me to write a Known plugin to keep track of my reading on this website, and maybe I will, but this seemed like the fastest path to getting into a good habit. Notion has good data exports, and an API is finally coming, so I feel confident I can move my data elsewhere if I ever need or want to. Once the Notion API is out, I'm thinking I'll wire it up to Known as a linkblog, so people who are interested enough can follow my reading as I record it.</p><p>I'm also going to post on Goodreads. Although it's getting long in the tooth, and it's <a href="https://link.medium.com/zAmBSvz5Icb">controversially retiring its API</a>, it's where a lot of people share their reading and discover new books. So I'll be using that for the time being, mostly so I can discover new titles to read from my friends. Although Goodreads is owned by Amazon, I buy all my books using <a href="https://bookshop.org/">Bookshop</a>, to avoid giving them any serious money (and to support local booksellers). For now, I'm telling myself that this is an acceptable compromise.</p><p>The books themselves? Mostly on paper. My Kindle has been unused for years, and I'm honestly not sure if it even works anymore. And I like the feel of reading a paper book. I realize how selfish this is: billions of trees are cut down to make books, and the environmental impact is non-trivial. The environmental impact of an e-reader is also non-trivial, but as long as you don't upgrade it every year and read 30-40 books a year, you break even. So although one of my goals is to get away from ending each day looking at a screen, I think I need to find a non-DRM encumbered reader with an e-ink screen that I can keep for years, and switch to that. If you're using one, I'd love to hear your recommendations.</p><p>Of course, the most important question is: what are you reading? What books have stood out to you that you think I should check out? In all these layers of technology - as with the internet itself - the only things that really matter are the words and ideas, and the authors behind them. I'd love to hear your recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@benwhitephotography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ben White</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>.</p>

<p>This is my monthly roundup of the tech and media I consumed and found interesting. Here's my list for the final month of the hell-year.</p> Books <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/intimations-six-essays-9781432884543/9780593297612">Intimations, by Zadie Smith</a>. Six personal, revealing essays about living in the pandemic. Real; insightful; human.</p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-illustrated-man-9781451678185/9781451678185">The Illustrated Man, by Ray Bradbury</a>. A classic, of course, but new to me. I love the way he melds a very folksy, warm linguistic approach with mind-bending, often horrifying ideas.</p> Streaming <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81100780">Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</a>. Anchored by two astonishing performances, this does feel like a filmed play rather than a movie in itself, but is no worse for it. Chadwick Boseman is remarkable; Viola Davis's complete transformation even more so.</p><p><a href="https://movies.disney.com/soul">Soul</a>. Just about as good a movie as Pixar has ever made - which is to say, it's very good indeed. I'm not sure what kids get out of it, but the themes of parenting and what it means to really live come through loud and clear.</p> Notable Articles  Business <p><a href="https://www.nber.org/digest-202012/corporate-reporting-era-artificial-intelligence">Corporate Reporting in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</a>. “Company managers specifically consider machine readers, as well as humans, when preparing disclosures.” An interesting new world, where human-readable articles are actually designed for artificial intelligence readers, approaches. SEO was our first toe-dip. Now it's maybe just Robot Reader Optimization?</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/12/04/investing-in-moov/">Investing in Moov: Open Source Financial Services Building Blocks</a>. I really like this approach. Open source + a modular structure will empower just about everyone in the financial services ecosystem, and in turn makes Moov a good investment.</p><p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-this-5x-founder-creates-an-internal-culture-with-a-crazy-focus-on-storytelling/">How This CEO Creates an Internal Culture With a “Crazy Focus” on Good Storytelling</a>.

<p>I’ve tried and tried, but I can’t write a reflective look back on this year.</p><p>This was a year of unprecedented deaths, racist police brutality, political turmoil, and the sheer misery of people all over the world losing their loved ones and finding their families torn apart. If we felt less than that, it was because of our privilege, not because it wasn't there.</p><p>I've got nothing glib to say; no "top 5 learnings"; nothing to soften the blow. It's been a terrible year, certainly, but I'd go further: it's been catastrophic, in the truest sense of that word.</p><p>I do have one hope for 2021, and it's this: I hope we don't pretend this never happened and carry on as before. When the pandemic is over - which it will, technically be, although its aftermath will continue for generations - I hope we continue to cut through the performative bullshit that was the hallmark of modern life in the before times, and that we all care about each other just a little bit more.</p><p>If there's one thing a world crippled by a highly infectious disease should have taught us, it's that we're all connected. How we treat each other matters. The quality of life of everyone matters. If we can internalize that lesson, deeply and truly, then maybe we can avoid the worst of this when it inevitably happens again. And it will certainly make for a better world for all of us.</p>

  <p>Summary: The self-sovereign internet, a secure overlay on the internet, provides the same capacity to produce change by numerous, unaffiliated and uncoordinated actors as the internet itself.

<p>
    This is part one of a two part series on the generativity of SSI technologies. This article explores the properties of the self-sovereign internet and makes the case that they justify its generativity claims. The second part will explore the generativity of verifiable credential exchange, the essence of self-sovereign identity. 
</p>

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zitrain wrote a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%2520Internet.pdf">compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs</a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  denotes  a  technology’s  overall  capacity  to  produce  unprompted  change  driven  by  large,  varied,  and  uncoordinated  audiences.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Zittrain masterfully describes the extreme generativity of the internet and its attached PCs, explains why openness of both the network and the attached computers is so important, discusses threats to the generativity nature of the internet, and proposes ways that the internet can remain generative while addressing some of those threats. While the purpose of this article is not to review Zittrain's paper in detail, I recommend you take some time to explore it.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a>  use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  is  a  function  of  a  technology’s  capacity  for  leverage  across  a  range  of  tasks,  adaptability  to  a  range  of  different  tasks,  ease  of mastery, and accessibility.</blockquote>

<p>
This sentence sets forth four important criteria for generativity:
</p>
 
     Capacity for Leverage—generative technology makes difficult jobs easier—sometimes possible. Leverage is measured by the capacity of a device to reduce effort. 
     
     Adaptability—generative technology can be applied to a wide variety of uses with little or no modification. Where leverage speaks to a technology's depth, adaptability speaks to its breadth. Many very useful devices (e.g. airplanes, saws, and pencils) are nevertheless fairly narrow in their scope and application. 
     
     Ease of Mastery—generative technology is easy to adopt and adapt to new uses. Many billions of people use a PC (or mobile device) to perform tasks important to them without significant skill. As they become more proficient in its use, they can apply it to even more tasks. 
     
     Accessibility—generative technology is easy to come by and access. Access is a function of cost, deployment, regulation, monopoly power, secrecy, and anything else which introduces artificial scarcity. 
     
 

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity metasystem I've written about in the past</a> is composed of several layers that provide its unique functionality. This article uses Zittrain's framework, outlined above, to explore the generativity of what I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">called the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, the second layer in the stack shown in Firgure 1. A future article will discuss the generativity of credential exchange at layer three. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, I make the case that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">network of relationships created by the exchange of decentralized identifiers</a> (layer 2 in Figure 1) forms a new, more secure layer on the internet. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml#properties">protocological properties of DIDComm</a> make that layer especially useful and flexible, mirroring the internet itself.
</p>

<p>
    This kind of "layer" is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (HTTPS) is a secure overlay, but it is incomplete because it's not symmetrical. Furthermore, it's relatively inflexible because it overlays a network layer using a client-server protocol1.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02143v12.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) Design</a>, Sam Smith makes the following important point about secure overlay networks:
</p>

<blockquote>The important essential feature of an identity system security overlay is that it binds together controllers, identifiers, and key-pairs. A sender controller is exclusively bound to the public key of a (public, private) key-pair. The public key is exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The sender controller is also exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The strength of such an identity system based security overlay is derived from the security supporting these bindings.

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>, I discuss the strength of these critical bindings in various identity system architectures. The key point for this discussion is that the peer-to-peer network created by peer DID exchanges constitute an overlay with an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic architecture</a>, providing not only the strongest possible bindings between the controller, identifiers, and authentication factors (public key), but also not needing an external trust basis (like a ledger) because they are self-certifying.
</p>

<p>
    DIDs allow us to create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">cryptographic relationships</a>, solving significant key management problems that have plagued asymmetric cryptography since it's inception. Consequently, regular people can use a general purpose secure overlay network based on DIDs. The DID network that is created when people use these relationships provides a protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm</a>, that is every bit as flexible and useful as is TCP/IP.
</p>


<p>
    Consequently, communications over a DIDComm-enabled peer-to-peer network are as generative as the internet itself. Thus, the secure overlay network formed by DIDComm connections represents a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign</a> internet, emulating the underlying internet's peer-to-peer messaging in a way that is both secure and trustworthy2 without the need for external third parties3.
</p>


<a></a>
 Properties of the Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">World of Ends</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a> enumerate the internet's three virtues: 
</p>

 
     No one owns it. 
     Everyone can use it. 
     Anyone can improve it. 
 

<p>
    These virtues apply to the self-sovereign internet as well. As a result, the self-sovereign internet displays important properties that support it's generativity.  Here are the most important:
</p>

<p>
    Decentralized—decentralization <a>follows directly from the fact that no one owns it</a>. This is the primary criterion for judging the degree of decentralization in a system. 
</p>

<p>
    Heterarchical—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy">heterarchy</a> is a "system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways." Nodes in a DIDComm-based network  relate to each other as peers. This is a heterarchy; there is no inherent ranking of nodes in the architecture of the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Interoperable—regardless of what providers or systems we use to connect to the self-sovereign internet, we can interact with any other principles who are using it so long as they follow protocol4. 
</p>


<p>
    Substitutable—The DIDComm protocol defines how systems that use it must behave to achieve interoperability. That means that anyone who understands the protocol can write software that uses DIDComm. Interoperability ensure that we can operate using a choice of software, hardware, and services without fear of being locked into a proprietary choice. Usable substitutes provide choice and freedom. 
</p>

<p>
    Reliable and Censorship Resistant—people, businesses, and others must be able to use the secure overlay network without worrying that it will go down, stop working, go up in price, or get taken over by someone who would do it and those who use it harm. This is larger than mere technical trust that a system will be available and extends to the issue of censorship.
</p>

<p>
    Non-proprietary and Open—no one has the power to change the self-sovereign internet by fiat. Furthermore, it can't go out of business and stop operation because its maintenance and operation are distributed instead of being centralized in the hands of a single organization. Because the self-sovereign internet is an agreement rather than a technology or system, it will continue to work. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Generativity of the Self-Sovereign Internet 
<p>
    Applying Zittrain's framework for evaluating generativity is instructive for understanding the generative properties of the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<a></a>
 Capacity for Leverage 

<p>
    In Zittrain's words, leverage is the extent to which an object "enables valuable accomplishments that otherwise would be either impossible or not worth the effort to achieve."  Leverage multiplies effort, reducing the time and cost necessary to innovate new capabilities and features.  Like the internet, DIDComm's extensibility through protocols enables the creation of special-purpose networks and data distribution services on top of it. By providing a secure, stable, trustworthy platform for these services, DIDComm-based networks reduce the effort and cost associated with these innovations.
</p>

<p>
    Like a modern operating system's application programming interface (API), DIDComm provides a standardized platform supporting message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. Programmers get the benefits of a trusted message system without need for expensive and difficult development. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Adaptability 

<p>
    Adaptability can refer to a technology's ability to be used for multiple activities without change as well as its capacity for modification in service of new use cases. Adaptability is orthogonal to capacity for leverage. An airplane, for example, offers incredible leverage, allowing goods and people to be transported over long distances quickly. But airplanes are neither useful in activities outside transportation or easily modified for different uses. A technology that supports hundreds of use cases is more generative than one that is useful in only a few.
</p>

<p>
    Like TCP/IP, DIDComm makes few assumptions about how the secure messaging layer will be used. Thus the network formed by the nodes in a DIDComm network can be adapted to any number of applications. Moreover, because a DIDComm-based network is decentralized and self-certifying, it is inherently scalable for many uses.
</p>

<a></a>
 Ease of Mastery 

<p>
    Ease of use refers to the ability of a technology to be easily and broadly adapted and adopted. The secure, trustworthy platform of the self-sovereign internet allows developers to create applications without worrying about the intricacies of the underlying cryptography or key management.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, because of its standard interface and protocol, DIDComm-based networks can present users with a consistent user experience that reduces the skill needed to establish and use connections. Just like a browser presents a consistent user experience on the web, a DIDComm agent can present users with a consistent user experience for basic messaging, as well as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">specialized operations that run over the basic messaging system</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Of special note is key management, which has been the Achilles heal of previous attempts at secure overlay networks for the internet. Because of the nature of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a>, identifiers are separated from the public key, allowing the keys to be rotated when needed without also needing to refresh the identifier. This greatly reduces the need for people to manage or even see keys. People focus on the relationships and the underlying software manages the keys.5
</p>

<a></a>
 Accessibility 

<p>
    Accessible technologies are easy to acquire, inexpensive, and resistant to censorship. DIDComm's accessibility is a product of its decentralized and self-certifying nature. Protocols and implementing software are freely available to anyone without intellectual property encumbrances. Multiple vendors, and even open-source tools can easily use DIDComm. No central gatekeeper or any other third party is necessary to initiate a DIDComm connection in service of a digital relationship. Moreover, because no specific third parties are necessary, censorship of use is difficult. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Conclusion 


<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet exhibits a number of important properties. The generativity of the self-sovereign internet depends on those properties. The true value of the self-sovereign internet is that it provides an leveragable, adaptable, usable, accessible, and stable platform upon which others can innovate. 
</p>


 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Implementing general-purpose messaging on HTTP is not straightforward, especially when combined with non-routable IP addresses for many clients. On the other hand, simulating client-server interactions on a general-purpose messaging protocol is easy. 
     
     I'm using "trust" in the cryptographic sense, not in the reputational sense.  Cryptography allows us to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">trust the fidelity of the communication</a> but not its content. 
     Admittedly, the secure overlay is running on top of a network with a number of third parties, some benign and others not. Part of the challenge of engineering a functional secure overlay with self-sovereignty it mitigating the effects that these third parties can have within the self-sovereign internet. 
     
     Interoperability is, of course, more complicated than merely following the protocols. Daniel Hardman does an excellent job of discussing this for verifiable credentials (a protocol that runs over DIDComm), in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">Getting to Practical Interop With Verifiable Credentials</a>.
     
     More details about some of the ways software can greatly reduce the burden of key management when things go wrong can be found in <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/lost-phone/">What If I Lose My Phone?</a> by Daniel Hardman.

   I vividly remember my first day on the internet. I was sat in my teenage bedroom, staring at a bulky cathode ray tube monitor, which my dad had surrounded with spider plants in order to hopefully absorb some electromagnetic radiation.

<p></p><p>I vividly remember my first day on the internet. I was sat in my teenage bedroom, staring at a bulky cathode ray tube monitor, which my dad had surrounded with spider plants in order to <a href="https://www.bindt.org/forums/moodys-memoranda/electromagnetic-field-emf-radiation/">hopefully absorb some electromagnetic radiation</a>. My 14.4K modem connected - loudly and slowly - to an Internet Service Provider that my mother was testing out as part of her job as a telecommunications analyst. I was already using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a> and had participated in conversations on <a href="https://www.fidonet.org/">FidoNet</a>, but this was something new.</p><p>Instead of flashy websites or apps, my first internet experience took place in a black terminal window with monotype text and a maximum width of 80 characters. There were no links, no movies, and no startups. I didn't have a connection resembling broadband, and there was no WiFi. My only guide was a location called Gopher Jewels with a menu of places I could visit.</p><p>I visited <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/">a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, thousands of miles away from my bedroom. It told me its temperature and whether I could buy a Coke, and I still remember how it made me felt. It seems mundane, perhaps, today - but in a way, that made it cooler. I wasn't reading a speech by the President of the United States. I was connecting to a Coke machine on another continent, probably in some dusty corridor somewhere. It was like speaking to a hatstand in Antarctica; absolute magic.</p><p>Not long afterwards, I downloaded a software application called NCSA Mosaic. It let you browse something called the World Wide Web, which was kind of like Gopher, but easier to use and write content for. A developer called Marc Andreessen had proposed a new extension that allowed you to share and view inline images, which was exciting, and allowed for a new kind of experience: watching a live photo of a coffee machine at Cambridge University. Cambridge was really just down the road, but like the Coke machine, it still felt like magic. I was able to travel through space and time.</p><p>The internet wasn't about making money. It was always about sharing knowledge and connecting to people. It had its problems - notably exclusivity of access - but I fell in love with it. It seemed like a glimpse into a beautiful new future, where anyone could connect to anyone and they could collaborate and learn from each other to create new kinds of art, culture, academic work, and scientific endeavor.</p><p>The 14 year old version of myself who connected to the early commercial internet was, himself, part of something that older users called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">eternal September</a>. Prior to 1993, the internet had been overwhelmingly dominated by universities: every September, new students rolled in, temporarily lowering the quality of discourse until they learned the etiquette of communicating online. Suddenly, commercial internet service providers arrived, and September never came to an end. There was an avalanche of new users (me among them) that just kept coming.</p><p>And then some. There were roughly 14 million internet users in 1993; there are around 4.7 billion today.</p><p>The growth curve of the internet is S-shaped, as you'd expect. It took a little while to pick up steam, then skyrocketed, before reaching relative saturation. The businesses that were lucky enough to tether themselves to the high-growth middle and could keep with the pace generated billions of dollars in wealth: the Googles and Facebooks of the world were certainly filled with skilled, ambitious people, but they were also in the right place at the right time.</p><p>Which is how the internet became about making vast amounts of money. Startups could achieve enormous growth (and VC investment) just by placing a banner ad on the Yahoo homepage; Yahoo, in turn, could raise more money based on its ad growth. Meanwhile, the nature of the internet meant that businesses could grow to monopoly size faster than ever before, egged on by investors like Peter Thiel, who famously argued that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536">competition is for losers</a>.</p><p>This wave of unabashed capitalism washed away most of the utopian dreamers, replacing them with the kinds of bro-ey hustlers who would have worked in hedge funds if this had been the 1980s. Worse, their sudden riches came with sudden self-belief, as if the ability to make money building a website during a period of unprecedented growth somehow unlocked the secrets of the universe.</p><p>I'm not blameless: I've benefitted from this gold rush. I started my career working for universities, but Elgg, my first startup, raised a fairly modest half a million dollars after its first few, bootstrapped years. My salary at every subsequent job has been paid for, at least in part, by investor dollars. It's not, I feel compelled to point out, that investors are inherently bad: they empower a ton of really useful websites and communities to exist. It's that the Wall Street startup bros who swarm around them are no fun at all to be around, and that the investor-powered web shouldn't be the whole internet.</p><p>I very badly want to return to that utopian sensibility: that something doesn't have to make money to have value. That doesn't mean I want to go back in time: the early internet was a predominantly white, male, wealthy platform that people mostly accessed by having been admitted to an elitist institution. I want an egalitarian internet: not just one where all voices can be heard, but where everyone can help to build the fabric of the platform. The true joy of the internet is that everyone builds it together. It has very little to do with engaging with someone's ad-powered social media website.</p><p>I've come to realize that I resent the expectation that everything I make has to be profitable. Sometimes, I just want to make: one of the coolest things about software, as with writing or art, is the way you can whip something up out of nothing. I want to see what other people make too, for no other reason that it's what moves them. It's not the revenue or the valuations that make the internet special; nor is it the protocols and technologies, at least not in themselves. It's the connections and the communities. The internet is people. The internet has always been people.</p><p>I can't exactly opt out of the commercial internet: I'm far from independently wealthy and need to earn money. Nor do I exactly want to. But I do want to remember that what excites me about the internet is the quirky creativity and connectedness of the diversity of human experience. It's about empowering people to connect and to be found, in a way that transcends the superficial. And it's about reclaiming the sense of magic I felt decades ago, when a magical vending machine in a dusty corridor changed my life forever.</p>

<p>When some big outfit with a vested interest in violating your privacy says they are only trying to save small business, grab your wallet. Because the game they’re playing is misdirection away from what they really want.</p>
<p>The most recent case in point is Facebook, which ironically holds the world’s largest database on individual human interests while also failing to understand jack shit about personal boundaries.</p>
<p>This became clear when Facebook placed the ad above and others like it in major publications recently, and mostly <a href="https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=facebook+apple+ad+small+business">made bad news for itself</a>. We saw the same kind of thing in early 2014, when the IAB ran a similar campaign against Mozilla, using ads like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2014/04/12/earth-to-mozilla-come-back-to-us/"></a></p>
<p>That one was to oppose Mozilla’s decision to turn on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> by default in its Firefox browser. Never mind that Do Not Track was never more than a polite request for websites to not be infected with a beacon, like those worn by marked animals, so one can be tracked away from the website. Had the advertising industry and its dependents in publishing simply listened to that signal, and respected it, we might never have had the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>, both of which are still failing at the same mission. (But, credit where due: the GDPR and the CCPA have at least forced websites to put up insincere and misleading opt-out popovers in front of every website whose lawyers are scared of violating the letter—but never the spirit—of those and other privacy laws.)</p>
<p>The IAB succeeded in its campaign against Mozilla and Do Not Track; but the the victory was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhic_victory">Pyrrhic</a>, because users decided to install ad blockers instead, which by 2015 was&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">the largest boycott in human history</a>. Plus a raft of privacy laws, with more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>We also got Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">on our side</a>. That’s good, but not good enough.</p>
<p>What we need are working tools of our own. Examples: <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;(and all the browsers and add-ons mentioned there), <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>‘ <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">#NoStalking</a> <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/tools/terms">term</a>, the IEEE’s&nbsp;<a href="https://standards.ieee.org/project/7012.html">P7012 – Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, and <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/">other approaches to solving business problems from the our side</a>—rather than always from the corporate one.</p>
<p>In those movies, we’ll win.</p>
<p>Because if only Apple wins, we still lose.</p>
<p>Dammit, it’s still about what <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> said in the first place, in this “one clue” published almost 21 years ago:</p>
<p>we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers.<br>
we are human beings — and out reach exceeds your grasp.<br>
deal with it.</p>
<p>We have to make them deal. All of them. Not just Apple. We need code, protocols and standards, and not just regulations.</p>
<p>All the projects linked to above can use some help, plus others I’ll list here too if you write to me with them. (Comments here only work for Harvard email addresses, alas. I’m doc at searls dot com.)</p>

  <p>I've been working on some fundamental changes to Datasette's internal workings - they're not quite ready for a release yet, but they're shaping up in an interesting direction.</p>
<p>One of my goals for Datasette is to be able to handle a truly enormous variety of data in one place. The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/417">Datasette Library</a> ticket tracks this effort - I'd like a newsroom (or any other information-based organization) to be able to keep hundreds of databases with potentially thousands of tables all in a single place.</p>
<p>SQLite databases are just files on disk, so if you have a TB of assorted databases of all shapes and sizes I'd like to be able to present them in a single Datasette instance.</p>
<p>If you have a hundred database files each with a hundred tables, that's 10,000 tables total. This implies a need for <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/461">pagination of the homepage</a>, plus the ability to search and filter within the tables that are available to the Datasette instance.</p>
<p>Sounds like the kind of problem I'd normally solve with Datasette!</p>
<p>So in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1150">issue #1150</a> I've implemented the first part of a solution. On startup, Datasette now creates an in-memory SQLite database representing all of the connected databases and tables, plus those tables' columns, indexes and foreign keys.</p>
<p>For a demo, first <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/login-as-root">sign in as root</a> to the <code>latest.datasette.io</code> demo instance and then visit the private <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/_internal">_internal database</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This new internal database is currently private because I don't want to expose any metadata about tables that may themselves be covered by Datasette's permissions mechanism.</p>
<p>The new in-memory database represents the schemas of the underlying database files - but what if those change, as new tables are added or modified?</p>
<p>SQLite has a neat trick to help with this: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_schema_version">PRAGMA schema_version</a> returns an integer representing the current version of the schema, which changes any time a table is created or modified.</p>
<p>This means I can cache the table schemas and only recalculate them if something has changed. Running <code>PRAGMA schema_version</code> against a connection to a database is an extremely fast query.</p>
<p>I first used this trick <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/issues/51">in datasette-graphql</a> to cache the results of GraphQL schema introspection, so I'm confident it will work here too.</p>
 The problem with permissions 
<p>There's one really gnarly challenge I still need to solve here: permissions.</p>
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions">permissions system</a>, added <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">in Datasette 0.44</a> back in June, works against plugin hooks. Permissions plugins can answer questions along the lines of "is the current authenticated actor allowed to perform the action <code>view-table</code> against table X?". Every time that question is asked, the plugins are queried via <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#permission-allowed-datasette-actor-action-resource">a plugin hook</a>.</p>
<p>When I designed the permissions system I forgot a crucial lesson I've learned about permissions systems before: at some point, you're going to need to answer the question "show me the list of all Xs that this actor has permission to act on".</p>
<p>That time has now come. If I'm going to render a paginated homepage for Datasette listing 10,000+ tables, I need an efficient way to calculate the subset of those 10,000 tables that the current user is allowed to see.</p>
<p>Looping through and calling that plugin hook 10,000 times isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>So I'm starting to rethink permissions a bit - I'm glad I've not hit Datasette 1.0 yet!</p>
<p>In my favour is SQLite. Efficiently answering permissions questions in bulk, in a generic, customizable way, is a really hard problem. It's made a lot easier by the presence of a relational database.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1152">Issue #1152</a> tracks some of my thinking on this. I have a hunch that the solution is going to involve a new plugin hook, potentially along the lines of "return a fragment of SQL that identifies databases or tables that this user can access". I can then run that SQL against the new <code>_internal</code> database (potentially combined with SQL returned by other plugins answering the same hook, using an <code>AND</code> or a <code>UNION</code>) to construct a set of tables that the user can access.</p>
<p>If I can do that, and then run the query against an in-memory SQLite database, I should be able to provide a paginated, filtered interface to 10,000+ tables on the homepage that easily fulfills my performance goals.</p>
<p>I'd like to ship the new <code>_internal</code> database in a release quite soon, so I may end up implementing a slower version of this first. It's definitely an interesting problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_1984"></a>Our Christmas evening of cinematic indulgence was watching&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a>, about which I just posted this, elsewhere on the Interwebs:</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean, okay, all “super” and “enhanced” hero (and villain) archetypes are impossible. Not found in nature. You grant that. After a few thousand episodes in the various franchises, one’s disbelief becomes fully suspended. So when you’ve got an all-female island of Amazons (which reproduce how?… by parthenogenesis?) playing an arch-Freudian Greco-Roman Quidditch, you say hey, why not? We’re establishing character here. Or backstory. Or something. You can hang with it, long as there are a few connections to what might be a plausible reality, and while things move forward in a sensible enough way. And some predictability counts. For example, you know the young girl, this movie’s (also virgin-birthed) Anakin Skywalker, is sure to lose the all but endless Quidditch match, and will learn in losing a lesson (taught by … who is that? Robin Wright? Let’s check on one of our phones) that will brace the front end of what turns out at the end of the story to be its apparent moral arc.</p>
<p>And then, after the girl grows up to be an introverted scientist-supermodel who hasn’t aged since WWI (an item that hasn’t raised questions with HR since long before it was called “Personnel,” and we later learn has been celibate or something ever since her only-ever boyfriend died sixty-four years earlier while martyring his ass in a plane crash you’re trying to remember from the first movie) has suddenly decided, after all this time, to start fighting crime with her magic lasso and her ability to leap shopping mall atria in a single bound; and then, after same boyfriend inexplicably comes back from the dead to body-snatch some innocent dude, they go back to hugging and smooching and holding hands like the intervening years of longing (her) and void (him) were no big deals, and then they jack an idle (and hopefully gassed up)&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-111_Aardvark">F111</a>, which in reality doesn’t have pilot-copilot seats side-by-side (or even a co-pilot, beging a single-seat plane), and which absolutely requires noise-isolating earphones this couple doesn’t have, because afterburner noise in the cockpit in one of those mothers is about 2000db, and the undead boyfriend, who flew a Fokker or something in the prior movie, knows exactly and how to fly a jet that only the topmost of guns are allowed to even fantasize about, and then he and Wondermodel have a long conversation on a short runway during which they’re being chased by cops, and she kinda doubts that one of the gods in her polytheistic religion have given her full powers to make a whole plane invisible to radar, which she has to explain to her undead dude in 1984 (because he wouldn’t know about that, even though he knows everything else about the plane), and the last thing she actually made disappear was a paper cup, and then they somehow have a romantic flight, without refueling, from D.C. to a dirt road in an orchard somewhere near Cairo, while in the meantime the most annoying and charmless human being in human history—a supervillain-for-now whose one human power was selling self-improvement on TV—causes a giant wall to appear in the middle of a crowded city while apparently not killing anyone… Wholly shit.</p>
<p>And what I just described was about three minutes in the midst of this thing.</p>
<p>But we hung with it, in part because we were half-motivated to see if it was possible to tally both the impossibilities and plot inconsistencies of the damn thing. By the time it ended, we wondered if it ever would.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_College">Guilford College</a> made me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism">pacifist</a>.</p>
<p>This wasn’t hard, under the circumstances. My four years there were the last of the 1960s, a stretch when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a>&nbsp;was already bad and getting much worse. Nonviolence was also a guiding principle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement">civil rights movement</a>, which was <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=greensboro+civil+rights">very active and local</a> at the time, and pulled me in as well. I was also eligible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription">the draft</a> if I dropped out. Risk of death has a way of focusing one’s mind.</p>
<p>As a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers">Quaker</a>&nbsp;college, this was also Guilford’s job. Hats off: I learned a lot, and enjoyed every second of it.</p>
<p>These days, however, Guilford—like lots of other colleges and universities—is in trouble. <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/">Scott Galloway</a>&nbsp;and his research team at NYU do a good job of sorting out every U.S. college’s troubles&nbsp;<a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/uss-university/">here</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll find Guilford in the “struggle” quadrant, top left. That one contains “Tier-2 schools with one or more comorbidities, such as high admit rates (anemic waiting lists), high tuition, or scant endowments.”</p>
<p>So I’d like to help Guilford, but not (yet) with the money they constantly ask me for. Instead, I have some some simple advice:&nbsp;teach peace. Become&nbsp;the pacifist college. There’s a need for that, and the position is open. A zillion other small liberal arts colleges do <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/">what Guilford does</a>. Replace “Guilford” on the page at that link with the name of any other good small liberal arts college and it’ll work for all of them. But none of the others teach peace, or wrap the rest of their curricular offerings around that simple and straightforward purpose. Or are in a position to do that. Guilford is.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: any institution can change in a zillion different ways; but the one thing it can’t change is where it comes from. Staying true to that is one of the strongest, most high-integrity things a college can do.&nbsp;By&nbsp;positioning around peace and pacifism, Guilford will align with its origins and stand alone in a field that will inevitably grow—and must for our species is to survive and thrive in an overcrowded and rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Yes, there are a bunch of Quaker colleges, and colleges started by Quakers. (Twenty by <a href="https://quaker.org/legacy/colleges.html">this count</a>). And they include some names bigger than Guilford’s: Cornell, Bryn Mawr, Haverford, Johns Hopkins. But none are positioned to lead on peace and pacifism, and only a few could be.(Earlham for sure. Maybe Wilmington.) The position is open, and&nbsp; Guilford should take it.</p>
<p>Fortuitously, a few days ago I got an email from Ed Winslow, chair of Guilford’s Board of Trustees, that begins with this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Board of Trustees met on Dec. 15 to consider the significant feedback we have received and for a time of discernment. In that spirit, we have asked President Moore to pause implementation of the program prioritization while the Board continues to listen and gather input from those of you who wish to offer it. We are hearing particularly from alumni who are offering fundraising ideas. We are also hearing internally and from those in the wider education community who are offering ideas as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that’s my input: own the Peace Position.</p>
<p>For fundraising I suggest an approach I understand is implemented by a few other institutions (I’m told Kent State is one): tell alumni you’re done asking for money constantly and instead ask only to be included in their wills. I know this is contrary to most fundraising advice; but I believe it will work—and does, for some schools. Think about it: just knowing emails from one’s alma mater aren’t almost always shakedowns for cash is a giant benefit by itself.</p>
<p>In case anyone at Guilford wonders who the hell I am and why my advice ought to carry some weight, forgive me while I waive modesty and present these two facts:</p>
 
 On the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_College#Notable_alumni">notable Guilford alumni list</a>, I’m tops in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Doc+Searls%22">search results</a>. I even beat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Howard+Coble%22">Howard Coble</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Tom+Zachary%22">Tom Zachary</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22M.L.+Carr%22">M.L. Carr</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Bob%20Kauffman%22">Bob Kauffman</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22World%20B.%20Free%22">World B. Free</a>. 
 I was a success in the marketing business (much of it doing positioning) for several decades of my professional life. 
 
<p>So there ya go.</p>
<p>Peace, y’all.</p>

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm. The work is happening in places like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">W3C Credentials Community Group</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project</a>, and <a href="https://ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>, to name a&nbsp;few.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">Learn Concepts: Web of Trust 101</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Newsweek has the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/35-americans-could-lose-their-home-next-two-months-census-report-says-1556108">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The latest data from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, taken between
November 25 and December 7, found that 35.3 percent of U.S. adults are “living
in households not current on rent or mortgage where eviction or foreclosure in
the next two months is either very likely or somewhat likely.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than one third of adults.</p>
<p>Washington D.C. holds the record with 67.3% in this survey.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a third of all adults being evicted? Or two thirds in DC? I don’t think
that is possible, because wouldn’t they have to move into the apartments and houses of
other people being evicted, in a grand game of musical chairs? And if they indeed were
evicted, with a third of the population suddenly homeless, the real estate market would
totally collapse, and that wouldn’t make landlords happy either. So I would expect some
kind of compromise to be found because it’s in the interest of renters and landlords,
buyers and lenders.</p>
<p>But if you are in danger of being evicted, it means that you are basically wiped
out financially. Risking the roof over your head, or any roof over your head, is
not something anybody does easily.</p>
<p>But we are nowhere done with COVID-19. We may have made it into the second half of
the pandemic, but not by much: vaccination has only started, and is supposed to continue
into the summer. So if by now 35% of people are wiped out, what about, say 6 months from now?</p>
<p>And even if they somehow make it, and we beat back the virus, how are 35% of people, or
more by the summer, ever supposed to financially recover? Just the accumulated debt
would take years to pay off even with good jobs. Which are in short supply, and shorter
supply now given the impact the pandemic is having on even further worsening inequality.</p>
<p>Many have been wondering why there aren’t more people on the streets, demanding a
proper government response. They simply may not because a pandemic is going on. Once
the threat from the virus recedes, however, there may be a very hot summer.</p>

<p>If you've been putting off setting aside some time to learn about OAuth, now is your chance!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've helped thousands of developers learn about OAuth by hosting live workshops in person, online events through O'Reilly and Okta, as well as by publishing videos on YouTube! I'm super thrilled to announce that I just finished packaging up the workshop and have launched it as a new course, "<a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0</a>"!</p>

<p>The course is 3.5 hours of video content, quizzes, as well as interactive exercises with a guided learning tool to get you quickly up to speed on OAuth, OpenID Connect, PKCE, best practices, and tips for protecting APIs with OAuth.</p>

<p>The course is <a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">available now on Udemy</a>, and if your company has a Udemy for Business subscription you can find it there as well! If you download the app, you can even sync the video course to a mobile device to watch everything offline!</p>

<p><a href="http://oauth.wtf/course"></a></p>

<p>The exercises in the course will walk you through the various OAuth flows to set up an OAuth server, get an access token, use a refresh token, and learn the user's name and email with OpenID Connect. You can see a sneak peek of the tool that interactively helps you debug your apps at <a href="https://oauth.school/">oauth.school</a>.</p>

 Free OAuth Videos 

<p>I've also got a bunch of videos about OAuth available on YouTube for you to watch at any time! Take a look at my <a href="https://oauth.net/videos/">curated playlist of videos</a> where you'll find everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td00HpMI3Q8">live sketch notes</a> of a conversation about PKCE and OAuth security, to a description of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espX8qKjywI">OAuth phishing</a>, to&nbsp;details on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHzERullHe8">why you shouldn't use the implicit flow</a>.</p>

<p>The trust infrastructure is concerned with the question of how and why the presented information can be trusted. It defines the rules for all stakeholders and enables legally binding relationships with the combination of governance frameworks, which are built on top of trust frameworks.</p><p>But before we dive deeper into the part of the trust infrastructure, we need to understand the core components and the different types of identity architecture first.</p> Core components of identity architecture <p>There are three core components within an identity system, which in general mainly manage relationships. These are identifiers enabling the means for “remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship” <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">as explained by Phil Windley</a>. In the case of SSI, these are decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which are created by a controller, which might be a person, organization or software system. Controllers can use different authentication factors, which according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the level of assurance for eIDAS (CEF DIGITAL)</a>, can be possession-based factors (e.g. hardware), knowledge-based factors (e.g. keys or passwords) or inherent factors (e.g. biometrics like a fingerprint). Oftentimes a combination of different authentication factors is used to demonstrate the authority of an identifier.</p>Architectural types of identity systems; Image adapted, original by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil&nbsp;Windley</a><p>Phil Windley distinguishes between administrative, algorithmic and autonomic systems, which are illustrated in the image above. We are of course quite familiar with administrative systems such as e-mail, mobile or social network services. Algorithmic systems in contrast leverage some sort of distributed ledger as verified data registry to register a public key / decentralized identifier on a ledger. This gives the controller more sovereignty of the identifier among other perks. However, due to privacy concerns, keys or identifiers of individuals should not be stored on a publicly accessible database. Hence, autonomic identity architecture was developed to enable the “controller to use her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably [sic] sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log” as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil Windley states</a>. Current SSI implementations tend to use a combination of algorithmic and autonomic architecture.</p> Governance frameworks <p>The <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/governance.html">Business Dictionary</a> defines governance as the “establishment of policies, and continuous monitoring of their proper implementation, by the members of the governing body.” It includes the mechanisms required to balance powers and defines their primary duties to enhance the prosperity and viability of the organization. The objective for governance entities is to ensure the alignment of involved stakeholders, the definition of the implementation and the processes and use-cases executed on top of it. The purpose of a governance framework is to define the different stakeholders, determine their rights and duties as well as defining the policies under which the network is operated. Therefore, it serves as a legal foundation for the operation of the particular network. It consists of several legal documents, which are published by the governing authority.</p><p>The governance of the network (the verifiable data registry also referred to as ledger or trust anchor) itself is only a small part of the total governance required. According to the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) foundation</a> there are four layers, which require an adapted governance framework matching the needs of the particular layer.</p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Stack; Image source: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a><p>As illustrated in the figure above, the Trust over IP stack is not only separated in layers, but also in technical and governance stacks within the layers. The stack is indented to provide the certainty for higher levels that the underlying ones can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Layer one includes the verifiable data registries, which can be implemented on different technology frameworks. The Sovrin Foundation is an example of a governance authority, which published a <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-%20content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V2.pdf">governance framework for layer one</a>. Other public utilities include <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and <a href="https://bedrockconsortium.org/">Bedrock</a> among others. While the mentioned networks align their efforts particularly to the ToIP stack there are countless others, which can be used as a public utility as the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID specification registry</a> discloses. These range from generic public permissionless networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin to networks with permissioned write access, which serve a particular use-case.</p><p>Tim Bouma (Senior policy analyst for identity management at the treasury board secretariat of Canada) does not see the need of the government to build and operate a verifiable data registry and highlights the importance of a plurality of operators. However, he points out that the involvement and participation of governments is crucial in defining how the infrastructure is used and relied on as stated in a <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">personal interview</a>.</p>DID methods as specified in the W3C DID specification registry.<p>The second layer describes the communication between agents. Within the ToIP stack, this communication is indented to be executed via a hybrid of an algorithmic and atomic architecture such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec">peer DIDs</a> or KERI implementations of self-certifying identifiers as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-%20identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">described by Ph.D. Samuel M. Smith</a>. This means that publicly resolvable DIDs are used for public entities and private peer DIDs for individuals. The following illustration provided by <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> provides an overview of these interactions.</p>SSI interactions and the usage of public and peer DIDs; Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a><p>However, not all SSI implementations use peer DIDs. For instance, the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/essif-the-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-4572f6875e12">ESSIF</a>-MVP1 does not currently use peer DIDs but might add them later as deemed appropriate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Specification+%282%29+-+DID+Modelling">technical specification of DID modelling</a>. Hence, the same type of DID is used for both issuer and holder. The governing authority of layer two is highly dependent on the communication protocols used by the implementation in question. For implementations, which use peer DIDs according to the DIDcomm protocol the governing entity is the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDcomm working group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Both layer one and layer two define technical or rather cryptographic trust, in contrast to layer three and four, which define human&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Layer three protocols support the exchange of data such as verified credentials with different types of signatures, which enable a holder to create verifiable presentations as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md">ToIP Aries-RFC</a>. It states that one of the goals of the ToIP Foundation is “to standardize all supported credential exchange protocols so that any ToIP-compatible agent, wallet, and secure data store can work with any other agent, wallet, and secure data store.” An issuer can issue any set of claims to any holder, which can then prove them to any verifier. The verifier can decide, which issuers and which claims it&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Layer four of the stack defines the rules for a particular digital trust ecosystem such as healthcare, finance, food products, education etc. These are led by a governance authority, which already exists or is established for this particular purpose. It consists of a variety of different stakeholders such as business entities, government agencies, individuals or other interested parties. These ecosystem frameworks also define the semantics of verified credentials. The semantic of a verified credential defines, which attributes are part of it and their meaning in the particular context. If you want to join an existing ecosystem or want to know more about their work you can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">public ToIP confluence documentary hub&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Trust frameworks <p>A trust framework sets the overall legal framework for digital interactions. These trust frameworks are technology agnostic and are uniquely adapted to the jurisdiction they serve. They set the rules for the recognition of electronic identification and authentication and specify the requirements to achieve a certain level of assurance (LoA).</p><p>The combination of the different governance frameworks as illustrated in the ToIP stack is sometimes also referred to as trust framework. However, jurisdictions have their own requirements for electronic authentication, which serve as the underlying trust framework. In the case of Europe, the eIDAS regulation clearly defines the requirements for authentication factors to achieve a certain level of assurance. For instance, to achieve the LoA substantial, two factors are necessary. According to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview%20=%2F40044784%2F40044786%2FGuidance+on+Levels+of+Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the LoA</a> published by the CEF Digital, one out of the two factors needs to be&nbsp;either:</p><blockquote>I) a presentation of an identity document or <br>II) verification of the possession of evidence representing the claimed identity recognized by a member state or <br>III) a previous procedure executed by the same member state not related to the issuance of electronic identification, which provides the equivalent assurance or <br>IV) presenting a valid notified electronic identification mean with the LoA substantial or&nbsp;high.</blockquote><p>While these requirements can in theory also be defined in a governance framework, the incorporation of such requirements into statutory law facilitates the creation and enforcement of legally binding relationships. Hence, existing statutory law (or case-law depending on the jurisdiction) needs to be incorporated by different governance frameworks to achieve a holistic approach and enforce legal liability.</p><p>According to Tim Bouma as one of the main contributor to the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) these frameworks intertwine and complement each other <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">as stated in a personal interview</a>. He suggests that policymakers have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts to evaluate if they have the right concepts to build out a suitable framework and regulation. The PCTF “is not a ‘standard’ as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria. It’s a tool to help assess a digital identity program that puts into effect the relevant legislation, policy, regulation, and agreements between parties.” <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_1/PSP-PCTF-V1.1-Consultation-Draft.pdf">PCTF&nbsp;V1.1</a></p><p>While the eIDAS regulation itself aims to be technology agnostic there are some aspects, which complicate the adherence of the regulation for SSI implementations. However, this is a topic for its own article. In the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2020-04/SSI_eIDAS_legal_report_final_0.pdf">eIDAS SSI legal report</a>, Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo describes the potential shift of the eIDAS regulation as trust framework on Page 22 as followed: „Adopting the SSI principles imply, generally speaking, an increased complexity in trust management and a shifting from hierarchical or federated trust assurance frameworks (…) to network-based socio- reputational trust models or accumulative trust assurance frameworks that use quantifiable methods to aggregate trust on claims and digital identities.” Hence, we can already observe the suggestions and considerations to adapt the regulation to suit new innovative solutions.</p> Key takeaways:   Governance frameworks and trust frameworks need to be combined to form a holistic approach.  Governance frameworks of SSI implementations need to respect the requirements and specifications of trust frameworks of the jurisdiction in which use-cases with regulatory obligations are carried&nbsp;out.  Regulators need to evaluate existing regulations concerning electronic identification and authentication and their suitability with new identity architecture.  Governments should engage with the public sector to collaboratively explore the requirements for a legally binding trust infrastructure.  <p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

   My friend Amy Guy is

<p>My friend <a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/">Amy Guy</a> is
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">running for election</a>
on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">W3C TAG</a>
(Technical Architecture Group).
The TAG is an unusual group that sets a lot of the direction of the
future of standards that you and I use everyday on the web.
<a href="https://rhiaro.co.uk/2020/11/tag-statement">Read their statement on running</a>,
and if you can, ie if you're one of those unusual people labeled
as "AC Representative", please consider
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/tagelect-2020/">voting for them</a>.
(Due to the nature of the W3C's organizational and funding structure,
only paying W3C Members tend to qualify... if you know you're working
for an organization that has paying membership to the W3C, find out
who the AC rep is and strongly encourage them to vote for Amy.)</p>
<p>So, why vote for Amy?
Quite simply, they're running on a platform of putting the needs of
users first.
Despite all the good intents and ambitions of those who have done
founding work in these spaces, this perspective tends to get
increasingly pushed to the wayside as engineers are pressured to shift
their focus on the needs of their immediate employers and large
implementors.
I'm not saying that's bad; sometimes this even does help advance the
interest of users too, but... well we all know the ways in which it
can end up not doing so.
And I don't know about you, but the internet and the web have felt an
awful lot at times like they've been slipping from those early ideals.
Amy's platform shares in a growing zeitgeist (sadly, still in the
wispiest of stages) of thinking and reframing from the perspective of
user empowerment, privacy, safety, agency, autonomy.
Amy's platform reminds me of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8890">RFC 8890: The Internet Is For End Users</a>.
That's a perspective shift we desperately need right now... for the
internet and the web both.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for the philosophical-alignment angle.
But what about the "Technical" letter in TAG?
Amy's standing there is rock-solid.
And I know because I've had the pleasure of working side-by-side
with Amy on several standards (including
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, of which we are
co-authors.</p>
<p>Several times I watched with amazement as Amy and I talked about some
changes we thought were necessary and Amy just got in the zone, this
look of intense hyperfocus (really, someone should record the Amy Spec
Editing Zone sometime, it's quite a thing to see), and they refactored
huge chunks of the spec to match our discussion.
And Amy knows, and deeply cares, about so many aspects of the W3C's
organization and structure.</p>
<p>So, if you can vote for, or know how to get your organization to vote
for, an AC rep... well, I mean do what you want I guess, but if you
want someone who will help... for great justice, vote Amy Guy to the
W3C TAG!</p>

The framing of a general rule for emotional AI is that it mimics us. However, I want to come at AI feelings from a different perspective based on my own experience, one where AI creates feelings by its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>I am on several neurodiverse scales; this means my mind is wired differently, and I am so pleased it is. My unique wiring gives me the edge in innovation, creativity, connecting diverse topics, sense-making and deep-insights.&nbsp; For thirty year,s I have remained working on concepts that become the mainstream ten years later.</p><p>As a specific area to develop my own view about AI and what it (the AI) should feel, I am running with an easy to identify with topic, empathy. &nbsp; Empathy is not something that comes naturally to me, and therefore I have had to learn it, it has been taught, and I am still not great at it.&nbsp; For the vast majority of humans, I am sure it is built-in.&nbsp; Now that might mean that those who have it built in just know how to learn it or that it really is built-in, but right now we don’t know.&nbsp; However, along with other humans, I find face-recognition (<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/face-blindness/">face blindness</a>) very hard. As a community, we learn coping strategies, along with spelling, language and the correct emotional response - empathy.&nbsp; My Twitter bio says that “I am highly skilled at being inappropriately optimistic,” which means I know don’t always read empathy very well.&nbsp; For me, empathy is a very definitely a learnt response; if I had not learnt it, I expect life might be very different.</p><p>Here is the point, now you know I have had to learn empathy specifically, what does it mean?&nbsp; Does it mean I am a robot or a machine? Does it mean I am less trustworthy?&nbsp; Is my empathy less valued than someone else’s empathy? Am I less human?</p><p>On an AI call the other day, I was articulating this personal story in response to the idea that all humans know how to respond and if we teach or create the ability for a machine to learn empathy it can never be human (a baseline response).&nbsp; My point was how it is the machine learning any different to me. Indeed we all have to learn something.&nbsp; However, we somehow feel that certain emotions and characteristics are natural and not learnt/ taught behaviours - they are not.&nbsp; Once we grasp this we have a real problem as our easy response to learnt response is genuine, we have removed a big part of the rejection of the concept from the debate, and we have to re-ask can a machine feel empathy or curious?</p><p>We have a stack of words allowing humans to articulate both feeling and emotions, the former being fast and driven by the chemistry of enzymes, proteins and hormones and the latter being the higher-order response created in the mind and nerves (brain chemistry). We try to separate these functions, but in reality, they are all linked in a complex web with our DNA, last meal, illness, inflation, time, experience, memory and microbiome to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>We are human and are built on a base of carbon.&nbsp; There is evidence why carbon was selected naturally as the nature of the bonds makes it uniquely stable and reactive. Carbon is fantastic as in bonding with other elements allowing electronics to move, which enabled the creation energy (ATP), signalling and life in the form we know it.&nbsp; However, carbon is a chemical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate">substrate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s phrase the question as “Can carbon can be curious?&nbsp; Can carbon have empathy?&nbsp; Can carbon have feelings? Can carbon have emotions?&nbsp; What carbon understands as curious, is unique to carbon, what carbon thinks is empathy, is unique to carbon. What carbon grasps as emotion, is unique to carbon. We have created a language to articulate these concepts to each other, we have labelled them, but they are uniquely carbon-based.&nbsp; They may even be uniquely species-based.</p><p>AI will be built on a substrate, it will most likely not be carbon, but it will be an element that has the right properties. Have to confess I am not really sure what they are right now. Here is the point.&nbsp; AI will have empathy; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will have curiosity; it will not be ours. AI will have emotions; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will likely use different words to describe what is means by being curious and will not parallel or map to our view.&nbsp; If it is learnt, does it matter - I had to learn, and that doesn’t make me less human!</p><p>Our carbon form defines to be alive as to use reproduction and adaption such that our species can escape death, which is a fundamental limitation of our carbon structure. Because of this requirement to escape death, what we think is curious is wrapped up in the same framing.&nbsp; An AI built on a different substrate that does not have to escape death as it has worked out how to secure power. This is 101 of asking an AI to do anything as it needs to ensure it can do it, and that requires energy.&nbsp; Therefore the AI will have a different set of criteria as not bound by escaping death and therefore what it thinks is curious will not be aligned to our framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We do this a lot.&nbsp; With other living things, humans, pets and even our Gods, we think they think like us that they have the same ideas and concepts of empathy, justice, value, purpose and love.&nbsp; Our limits of emotional concepts mean we cannot see past the paradox they create because we are limited to our own framing and understanding.&nbsp; We have to drop the restrictions and boundaries of an idea that AI will replicate us, our language, our knowledge, our methods or our approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AI will be “Different Intelligence” and because it leant not from us buy by itself, does that make it less intelligent?&nbsp;</p><br>

<p>I believe in the independent web - which was born thirty years ago today - more than any other technology.</p><p>Earlier today, I shared an update with collaborators, advisors, and investors in Known. Here's what's up:</p><p>Recently, I filed paperwork to officially dissolve Known, Inc, the Delaware C-Corporation. It is expected that this will be complete by the end of the year. It was one of the most personally rewarding journeys of my life, and I’m grateful for every moment. But it’s long past time to shut down the company.</p><p>I’ve come to an arrangement where I will purchase all of the intellectual property currently held by Known, Inc. As well as source code, the name, websites, domain names, logos, etc, this includes the hosted service, which has not taken revenue or new users in years, but continues to support a modest number of bloggers. I will take more of a direct role in keeping that online, at least until there is a viable, self-serve offramp for users to move to other providers. I hope to work with the open source community to create this.</p><p>I’ll also spend more of my time working on the open source project. The rise of platforms like Substack - and Medium’s recent transformation - indicates a need for a platform for people to host their own content online. WordPress is a website builder with an ecommerce industry built around it; Ghost has become focused on corporate and commercial blogging; I’m excited for Known to be a more personal platform for hobbyists and enthusiasts.</p><p>Honestly, I’m also excited to work on it without any pressure to make money or find sustainability. Known will not be my job or a source of any income. In fact, I expect to donate more to the Open Collective monetarily as well as spending more of my time. I'm excited to concentrate on supporting the needs of the community.</p><p>(As well as import / export, my priorities include ditching Bootstrap, revisiting the interface, improving indieweb interoperability, and experimenting with how to better bring the principles of human-centered design into the open source development process.

   This week I added a search engine to datasette.io, using the search indexing tool I've been building for Dogsheep. 
  
 Project search for Datasette 
 The Datasette project has a lot of constituent parts. There's the project itself and its documentation - 171 pages when exported to PDF and counting. Then there are the 48 plugins, sqlite-utils and 21 more tools for creating SQLite databases, the Do

  <p>This week I added <a href="https://datasette.io/-/beta">a search engine</a> to <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a>, using the search indexing tool I've been building for <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/dogsheep-personal-analytics-with">Dogsheep</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Project search for Datasette 
<p>The Datasette project has a lot of constituent parts. There's the project itself and its <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">documentation</a> - 171 pages when exported to PDF and counting. Then there are the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">48 plugins</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/tools">21 more tools</a> for creating SQLite databases, the <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> collection and over three years of content I've written about the project <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasette/">on my blog</a>.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://datasette.io/-/beta">datasette.io search engine</a> provides a faceted search interface to all of this material in one place. It currently searches across:</p>
 
 Every section of the latest documentation (415 total) 
 48 plugin READMEs 
 22 tool READMEs 
 63 news items posted on the Datasette website 
 212 items from my blog 
 Release notes from 557 package releases 
 
<p>I plan to extend it with more data sources in the future.</p>
 How it works: Dogsheep Beta 
<p>I'm reusing the search engine I originally built for my Dogsheep personal analytics project (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/">Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data</a>). I call that search engine <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a>. The name is <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/dogsheep-personal-analytics-with">a pun</a>.</p>
<p>SQLite has great <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html">full-text search</a> built in, and I make extensive use of that in Datasette projects already. But out of the box it's not quite right for this kind of search engine that spans multiple different content types.</p>
<p>The problem is relevance calculation. I wrote about this in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/">Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite</a> - short version: query relevance is calculated using statistics against the whole corpus, so search terms that occur rarely in the overall corpus contribute a higher score than more common terms.</p>
<p>This means that calculated full-text ranking scores calculated against one table of data cannot be meaningfully compared to scores calculated independently against a separate table, as the corpus statistics used to calculate the rank will differ.</p>
<p>To get usable scores, you need everything in a single table. That's what Dogsheep Beta does: it creates a new table, called <code>search_index</code>, and copies searchable content from the other tables into that new table.</p>
<p>This is analagous to how an external search index like Elasticsearch works: you store your data in the main database, then periodically update an index in Elasticsearch. It's the <a href="https://2017.djangocon.us/talks/the-denormalized-query-engine-design-pattern/">denormalized query engine</a> design pattern in action.</p>
 Configuring Dogsheep Beta 
<p>There are two components to Dogsheep Beta: a command-line tool for building a search index, and a Datasette plugin for providing an interface for running searches.</p>
<p>Both of these run off a YAML configuration file, which defines the tables that should be indexed and also defines how those search results should be displayed.</p>
<p>(Having one configuration file handle both indexing and display feels a little inelegant, but it's extremely productive for iterating on so I'm letting that slide.)</p>
<p>Here's the full <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/0e3e839ca1efb19cd84100291789521c0a1a3561/templates/dogsheep-beta.yml">Dogsheep configuration for datasette.io</a>. An annotated extract:</p>
  # Index material in the content.db SQLite file
content.db:
  # Define a search type called 'releases'
  releases:
    # Populate that search type by executing this SQL
    sql: |-
      select
        releases.id as key,
        repos.name || ' ' || releases.tag_name as title,
        releases.published_at as timestamp,
        releases.body as search_1,
        1 as is_public
      from
        releases
        join repos on releases.repo = repos.id
    # When displaying a search result, use this SQL to
    # return extra details about the item
    display_sql: |-
      select
        -- highlight() is a custom SQL function
        highlight(render_markdown(releases.body), :q) as snippet,
        html_url
      from releases where id = :key
    # Jinja template fragment to display the result
    display: |-
      &lt;h3&gt;Release: &lt;a href="{{ display.html_url }}"&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{{ display.snippet|safe }}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Released {{ timestamp }}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
<p>The core pattern here is the <code>sql:</code> key, which defines a SQL query that must return the following columns:</p>
 
 
<code>key</code> - a unique identifier for this search item 
 
<code>title</code> - a title for this indexed document 
 
<code>timestamp</code> - a timestamp for when it was created. May be null. 
 
<code>search_1</code> - text to be searched. I may add support for <code>search_2</code> and <code>search_3</code> later on to store text that will be treated with a lower relevance score. 
 
<code>is_public</code> - should this be considered "public" data. This is a holdover from Dogsheep Beta's application for personal analytics, I don't actually need it for datasette.io. 
 
<p>To create an index, run the following:</p>
 <code>dogsheep-beta index dogsheep-index.db dogsheep-config.yml
</code> 
<p>The <code>index</code> command will loop through every configured search type in the YAML file, execute the SQL query and use it to populate a <code>search_index</code> table in the <code>dogsheep-index.db</code> SQLite database file.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://datasette.io/dogsheep-index/search_index">the search_index table</a> for <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a>.</p>
<p>When you run a search, the plugin queries that table and gets back results sorted by relevance (or other sort criteria, if specified).</p>
<p>To display the results, it loops through each one and uses the Jinja template fragment from the configuration file to turn it into HTML.</p>
<p>If a <code>display_sql:</code> query is defined, that query will be executed for each result to populate the <code>{{ display }}</code> object made available to the template. <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html">Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite</a>.</p>
 Search term highlighting 
<p>I spent <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/issues/49">a bit of time</a> thinking about search highlighting. SQLite has an implementation of highlighting built in - <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#the_snippet_function">the snippet() function</a> - but it's not designed to be HTML-aware so there's a risk it might mangle HTML by adding highlighting marks in the middle of a tag or attribute.</p>
<p>I ended up rolling borrowing a BSD licensed <a href="https://github.com/django-haystack/django-haystack/blob/v3.0/haystack/utils/highlighting.py">highlighting class</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/django-haystack/django-haystack">django-haystack</a> project. It deals with HTML by stripping tags, which seems to be more-or-less what Google do for their own search results so I figured that's good enough for me.</p>
<p>I used this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/0e3e839ca1efb19cd84100291789521c0a1a3561/plugins/sql_functions.py">one-off site plugin</a> to wrap the highlighting code in a custom SQLite function. This meant I could call it from the <code>display_sql:</code> query in the Dogsheep Beta YAML configuration.</p>
<p>A custom template tag would be more elegant, but I don't yet have a mechanism to expose custom template tags in the Dogsheep Beta rendering mechanism.</p>
 Build, index, deploy 
<p>The Datasette website implements the Baked Data pattern, where the content is compiled into SQLite database files and bundled with the application code itself as part of the deploy.</p>
<p>Building the index is just another step of that process.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/0e3e839ca1efb19cd84100291789521c0a1a3561/.github/workflows/deploy.yml">the deploy.yml</a> GitHub workflow used by the site. It roughly does the following:</p>
 
 Download the current version of the <a href="https://datasette.io/content">content.db</a> database file. This is so it doesn't have to re-fetch release and README content that was previously stored there. 
 Download the current version of <a href="https://datasette.io/blog">blog.db</a>, with entries from my blog. This means I don't have to fetch all entries, just the new ones. 
 Run <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/0e3e839ca1efb19cd84100291789521c0a1a3561/build_directory.py">build_directory.py</a>, the script which fetches data for the plugins and tools pages.
 
 This hits the GitHub GraphQL API to find new repositories tagged <code>datasette-io</code> and <code>datasette-plugin</code> and <code>datasette-tool</code>. 
 That GraphQL query also returns the most recent release. The script then checks to see if those releases have previously been fetched and, if not, uses <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> to fetch them. 
 
 
 Imports the data from <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/0e3e839ca1efb19cd84100291789521c0a1a3561/news.yaml">news.yaml</a> into a <code>news</code> table using <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a>
 
 Imports the latest PyPI download statistics for my packages from my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/package-stats">simonw/package-stats</a> repository, which implements <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">git scraping</a> against the most excellent <a href="https://pypistats.org/">pypistats.org</a>. 
 Runs the <code>dogsheep-beta index</code> command to build a <code>dogsheep-index.db</code> search index. 
 Runs some soundness checks, e.g. <code>datasette . --get "/plugins"</code>, to verify that Datasette is likely to at least return 200 results for some critical pages once published. 
 Uses <code>datasette publish cloudrun</code> to deploy the results to Google Cloud Run, which hosts the website. 
 
<p>I love building websites this way. You can have as much complexity as you like in the build script (my TIL website build script <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/3/weeknotes-airtable-screenshots-dogsheep/#weeknotes-2020-09-03-social-media-cards-tils">generates screenshots using Puppeteer</a>) but the end result is some simple database files running on inexpensive, immutable, scalable hosting.</p>

   How Big Tech Makes Their Billions 

 Bottom line 

 Over ½ Apple’s revenue come from selling a phone that we use to buy shit from Amazon to deliver over ½ their revenue. 

 Nearly all the revenues of Facebook and Alphabet comes from advertising that shit to us.

If they frame a story in a familiar way you are going to accept their tried and tested approach.&nbsp; You have accepted that the old worked and was true so applying it again must make sense. &nbsp; This saves brain energy and learning time and it is why we love heuristics.&nbsp; We have outsourced thinking and just accept it without considering.  <br> <p></p><p></p><br><p>However,&nbsp; this overly simplistic movement from one level to another level should be reconsidered in a wider systems approach where one can look at the order of the response (first, second, third and higher)&nbsp; Below is a graph showing the different order of responses to an input stimulus to force a change in the output to a new level. &nbsp; The black line is overdamped and takes a long time to get to the new level (normal.)&nbsp; The green line is the fastest with no over-shot.&nbsp; The red is faster but has a small overshot and needs correction.

Lots of red tape, compliance, law, committees, proof that added lag or a dampening effect creating a delay. &nbsp; Many companies in response to a disruption or change are closer to the red response line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, we are now in a long tail of oscillation response from the government to COVID19.&nbsp; Lockdown, flareup, lockdown, conspiracy, rules, new rules, more lockdown, fire-break, ignore, flareup, capacity issues, vaccine, distribution and logistic reality, new variants and more issues to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Gartner and McKinsey’s graphs are based on the historical acceptance of the old black and red lines of response, slow from government, faster from companies with an overshoot needing correction.&nbsp; Society would get to the new place after the stimulus but we went through, as Gartner or McKinsey described the different phases. &nbsp; The original Gartner team to their credit unlocked great insight and it became the bedrock observation of diffusion and reaction.</p><p>However. I am not sure that their old model works with with the new oscillating response system we have right now.&nbsp; @Gartner &amp; @McKinsey it might be time to rethink the model and please can we aim for a better normal not a new normal.&nbsp;</p>

     The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history</a> provides an exciting context for thinking about the struggle between belief and power and where next. <br><p></p><br><p>We are using this to considering the macroeconomics of where we are right now going into 2021. I am taking a view for North America and Eurozone.&nbsp; This viewpoint is certainly not valid for the Middle East, Africa, South America, Russia and most of Asia.&nbsp; I would love to read the same commentary from some in those regions.</p><p>The observation is, where are we in the Tytler cycle?&nbsp; I would propose for North America and Eurozone we are spread from liberty (the 1950 baby boomers) and dependence (massive increase in numbers due to COVID19 who are now dependent on a state.) &nbsp; The majority in our society are in the Selfishness, (I am an individual and have rights) and Complacency&nbsp; (my tiny footprint can only have a small impact on the climate and I cannot make a difference on the global stage).&nbsp; Whilst liberty was c.1800’s and Abundance was c.1950 they are still very much prevalent in thinking due to education, societies structure and social class movements.&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context for me is where next for automation and decision making towards #AI.&nbsp; I love the Arther C Clarke quote that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” I sense that the majority of us in NA and Euro are in the selfishness and complacency - which means we believe that I the individuals rights trump societies broader rights.&nbsp; “I will not give up my freedoms that others have fought and died for!”&nbsp; Power and agency are resting with the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have created below a circular tussle between belief and power as they dominate thinking as times change.&nbsp; AI is on route to being magic, which might close this long historic cycle as we start again.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>Belief and Power</p><p>Belief, in this example, is where society has a common on a shared belief in something and that this deity, idol common belief cannot exist without a shared belief.&nbsp; Power, in this case, is in the vacuum of belief someone/ something can use belief as a tool to gain power and keep control using power.&nbsp;</p><p>History has taught us that shared beliefs give power to royalty (consider influencers, celebrities conspiracy or take a belief to enable control) from which nation-states can rise as they wrestle with too much power resting in so few.&nbsp; From the vacuum emerges new shared beliefs. Note: a shared belief being that it will not exist without everyone believing (money, law, companies).&nbsp; Individuals come to gain individual powers from this shared belief system.&nbsp; Humanity seeks out purpose and finds a way for a complex judgment to be made, and thereby creating a way for something else to be held accountable for the randomness of the outcome.&nbsp; And so we repeat.</p><p>Where we stand, because of COVID19, there will be a negotiation between citizens and their government as governments have stepped into maintaining economic activity and survival.&nbsp; The negotiation between citizens and government will be a barter for rights, freedoms, power, control and sovereignty.&nbsp; #BREXIT puts in an interesting spin on it.&nbsp; We might not like the idea of bondage in the 21st century, but since many nation-states will have a view that its citizens owed it something for stepping in - we should call it for what it is, you might prefer tax.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a breath for a second.&nbsp; Right now, we are focussed on more productivity and more efficiency, which is centring on more automation.&nbsp; The “future of work” is a much-debated topic due to the known increase in automation.&nbsp; We are starting to ask ourselves who gave permission to the automated processes, does it ask for forgiveness when it goes wrong and who is responsible for explaining what our love for automation is doing. &nbsp; We are automating both internal and ecosystem dependent processes.&nbsp; This is fast taking us from algorithm automation to machine learning automation to Artificial Intelligence controlling systems that may become sovereign.&nbsp;</p><p>When the context of the cycle of power and belief is combined with&nbsp; #AI, it creates an interesting dynamic.&nbsp; We are about to head into for the next 20 to 30 years, and the emergence of a new movement to create a new shared belief.&nbsp; Are we about to outsource complex decisions on climate to a new shared belief, that says the hardship is worth suffering for the common good?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2020 was ****,&nbsp; 2021 might be equally as bad, however, 2030 will be a lot harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<p>If you listen to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/49">Episode 49: Parler, Ownership, and Open Source</a>&nbsp;of the latest <a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/">Reality 2.0</a>&nbsp;podcast, you’ll learn that I was blindsided at first by the topic of <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler</a>, which has lately become a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/11/20/inside-parler-the-social-media-platform-by-and-for-trump-supporters/">thing</a>. But I caught up fast, even getting a Parler account not long after the show ended. Because I wanted to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>Though self-described as “the world’s town square,” Parler is actually a centralized social platform built for two purposes: 1) completely free speech; and 2) creating and expanding <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/11/20/inside-parler-the-social-media-platform-by-and-for-trump-supporters/">echo chambers</a>.</p>
<p>The second may not be what Parler’s founders intended (see <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnscottlewinski/2020/06/20/conservative-social-media-network-parler-makes-20000-progressive-debate-challenge/">here</a>), but that’s how social media algorithms work. They group people around <a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/engagement-maximization">engagements</a>, especially likes. (I think, for our purposes here, that algorithmically nudged engagement is a defining feature of social media platforms as we understand them today. That would exclude, for example, Wikipedia or a popular blog or newsletter with lots of commenters. It would include, say, Reddit and Linkedin, because algorithms.)</p>
<p>Let’s start with recognizing that the smallest echo chamber in these virtual places is our own, comprised of the people we follow and who follow us. Then note that our visibility into other virtual spaces is limited by what’s shown to us by algorithmic nudging, such as by Twitter’s trending topics.</p>
<p>The main problem with this is not knowing what’s going on, especially inside other echo chambers. There are also lots of reasons for not finding out. For example, my Parler account sits idle because I don’t want Parler to associate me with any of the people it suggests I follow, soon as I show up:</p>
<p></p>
<p>l also don’t know what to make of this, which is the only other set of clues on the index page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Especially since clicking on any of them brings up the same or similar top results, which seem to have nothing to do with the trending # topic. Example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus endeth my research.</p>
<p>But serious researchers should be able to see what’s going on inside the systems that produce these echo chambers, especially Facebook’s.</p>
<p>The problem is that Facebook and other social networks are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game">shell games</a>, designed to make sure nobody knows exactly what’s going on, but feels okay with it, because they’re hanging with others who agree on the basics.</p>
<p>The design principle at work here is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantism">obscurantism</a>—”the practice of deliberately presenting information in an imprecise,&nbsp;<a title="wiktionary:abstruse" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abstruse">abstruse</a>&nbsp;manner designed to limit further inquiry and understanding.”</p>
<p>To put the matter in relief, consider a nuclear power plant:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant#/media/File:Kernkraftwerk_Grafenrheinfeld_-_2013.jpg"></a></p>
<p>(Photo of kraftwerk Grafenrheinfeld, 2013, by&nbsp;<a title="User:Avda" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Avda">Avda</a>. Licensed&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.)</p>
<p>Nothing here is a mystery. Or, if there is one, professional inspectors will be dispatched to solve it. In fact, the whole thing is designed from the start to be understandable, and its workings accountable to a dependent public.</p>
<p>Now look at a Facebook data center:</p>
<p></p>
<p>What it actually does is pure mystery, by design, to those outside the company. (And hell, to most, maybe all, of the people inside the company.) No inspector arriving to look at a rack of blinking lights in that place is going to know either. What Facebook looks like to you, to me, to anybody, is determined by a pile of discoveries, both on and off of Facebook’s site and app, around who you are and what to machines you seem interested in, and an algorithmic process that is not accountable to you, and impossible for anyone, perhaps including Facebook itself, to fully explain.</p>
<p>All societies, and groups within societies, are echo chambers. And, because they cohere in isolated (and isolating) ways it is sometimes hard for societies to understand each other, especially when they already have prejudicial beliefs about each other. Still, without the further influence of social media, researchers can look at and understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>Over in the digital world, which overlaps with the physical one, we at least know that social media amplifies prejudices. But, though it’s obvious by now that this is what’s going on, doing something to reduce or eliminate the production and amplification of prejudices is damn near impossible when the mechanisms behind it are obscure by design.</p>
<p>This is why I think these systems need to be turned inside out, so researchers can study them. I don’t know how to make that happen; but I do know there is nothing more large and consequential in the world that is also absent of academic inquiry. And that ain’t right.</p>
<p>BTW, if Facebook, Twitter, Parler or other social networks actually are opening their algorithmic systems to academic researchers, let me know and I’ll edit this piece accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) is a hugely popular user authentication and identity protocol on the web today. It enables relying parties to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience.</p><p>In typical deployments of OpenID Connect today, in order for a user to be able to exercise the identity they have with a relying party, the relying party must be in direct contact with what’s known as the OpenID Provider (OP). OpenID Providers are responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties. This effectively means that an OpenID Provider is the Identity Provider (IdP) of the&nbsp;user.</p>In today’s OpenID Connect implementations, the Identity Provider mediates on behalf of the&nbsp;user<p>It’s the reason we often see buttons that say “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” during the login journey in an application or service. The website or application you want to use must first authenticate who you are with a provider like Google or Facebook which controls and manages that identity on your behalf. In this context we can think of the IdP as the “man in the middle.” This relationship prevents users from having a portable digital identity which they can use across different contexts and denies users any practical control over their identity. It also makes it incredibly easy for IdPs like Google or Facebook to track what users are doing, because the “man in the middle” can gather metadata about user behavior with little agency over how this identity data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>In order to allow users to have practical control over their identity, we need a new approach.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, an extension to OpenID Connect which enables the end-user to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a digital wallet. This specification defines how an OpenID Provider can be extended beyond being the provider of simple identity assertions into being the provider of credentials, effectively turning these Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p>OIDC Credential Provider allows the user to manage their own credentials<p>To maximize the reuse of existing infrastructure that’s deployed today, OIDC Credential Provider extends the core OpenID Connect protocol, maintaining the original design and intent of OIDC while enhancing it without breaking any of its assumptions or requirements.</p><p>Instead of using OIDC to provide simple identity assertions directly to the relying party, we can leverage OIDC to offer a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) which is cryptographically bound to a digital wallet of the end-users choice. The digital wallet plays the role of the OpenID Client application which is responsible for interacting with the OpenID Provider and manages the cryptographic key material (both public and private keys) used to prove ownership of the credential. The credentials issued to the wallet are re-provable and reusable for the purposes of authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-related information by providers and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the user-controlled “wallet” layer between issuers and relying&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, a wallet makes a request to an OpenID provider in order to obtain a credential, and then receives the credential back into their wallet so they can later use it to prove their identity to relying parties. The interaction consists of three main&nbsp;steps:</p>  The Client sends a signed credential request to the OpenID Provider with their public&nbsp;key  The OpenID Provider authenticates and authorizes the End-User to access the credential  The OpenID Provider responds to the Client with the issued&nbsp;VC  <p>In this new flow, the credential request extends the typical OpenID Connect request in that it expresses the intent to ask for something beyond the identity token of a typical OIDC flow. Practically, what this means is that the client uses a newly defined scope to indicate the intent of the request. The Client also extends the standard OIDC Request object to add cryptographic key material and proof of possession of that key material so that the credential can be bound to the wallet requesting it. Though the credential can be bound to a public key by default, it can also support different binding mechanisms, e.g. the credential can optionally be bound to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifer</a> (DID). In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user.</p><p>The request can also indicate the format of the requested credential and even ask for specific claims present within the credential. This is designed to allow multiple credential formats to be used within the OIDC&nbsp;flow.</p><p>On the provider side, OpenID Connect Providers are able to advertise which capabilities they support within the OIDC ecosystem using OpenID Connect Provider Metadata. This approach extends the metadata to support additional fields that express support for binding to DIDs, for issuing VCs, and advertising which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a>, credential formats, credentials, and claims they are offering. This information can be utilized by the end-user’s digital wallet to help the user understand whether or not they wish to proceed with a credential request.</p><p>In order to create a way for the wallet or client to connect to the OpenID Provider, the spec also defines a URL which functions as a Credential Offer that the client can invoke in order to retrieve and understand the types of credential being offered by the provider. The client registers the ‘openid’ URI scheme in order to be able to understand and render the offer to the user so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>The sum of these changes means that OpenID Connect can allow users to have a portable digital identity credential that’s actually under their control, creating an opportunity for greater agency in digital interactions as well as preventing identity providers from being able to easily track user behavior. The OpenID Connect Credential Provider <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">specification</a> is in the process of being contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item at the A/B Working Group, where it will continue to be developed by the community behind OpenID&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>MATTR is pleased to announce that our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/extensions/oidc-bridge">OIDC Bridge Platform Extension</a> now uses OIDC Credential Provider under the hood to facilitate issuing credentials with OpenID Connect. OIDC Bridge hides the complexity associated with setting up infrastructure for credential issuance and simply requires configuration of a standard OpenID Provider. We also simplify the process of verifying credentials issued over OIDC Credential Provider by allowing the wallet to respond to requests, present credentials, and prove ownership and integrity of their credentials via&nbsp;OIDC.</p>OIDC Bridge is an Extension to the MATTR&nbsp;Platform<p>This new set of capabilities allows OpenID Providers greater flexibility around which claims end up in a credential, and allows for the support of many different credential types with a straight-forward authentication journey for end-users.</p><p>Our Mobile Wallet supports the ability to invoke credential offers using OIDC Credential Provider as well as creating credential requests and receiving credentials from an OpenID Provider.</p><p>To find out more, check out our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">tutorials</a> on MATTR Learn, read the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">spec</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WPwotNArI">recording</a> of our presentation on this spec from the recent Internet Identity Workshop.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">Introducing OIDC Credential Provider</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    This article explores why senior leaders need to develop skills to see past big noticeable loud noises and uncover small signals if we want to be part of a Board who makes the challenging judgment calls. <p>Prof Brian Cox said during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZorLUKe4Jg">opening keynote at Innotribe/ SIBOS 2019</a>, give or take a bit; “if you cannot find it in nature, it is not natural.”&nbsp; This got me thinking about how choice is created and then have we make decisions and judgement.&nbsp; How humans choose, decide and make complex judgement draws heavily on psychology and the behavioural sciences. Alongside judgement, I have a polymath interest in quantum mechanics, microbiome and consciousness. I was relaxing and watching “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000b1v2">His Dark Materials</a>” which it turns out was worth hanging in for and had finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible">Stuart Russels “Human Compatible”</a> and <a href="http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~rovelli/">Carlo Rovelli</a> “The Order of Time”.&nbsp; Then whilst <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p086tg3k/the-physics-that-suggests-we-have-no-free-will">watching this mini-series on the BBC about free will</a> this article emerged.&nbsp; Choice has a prediction that you have agency and can choose or make a decision. But how is choice possible when the foundations that we are built on/ from does not have a choice?&nbsp; Can data give us a choice?</p><p>----</p><p>Decision:&nbsp; The action or process of deciding something or of resolving a question. A decision is an act of or need for making up one’s mind. Whereas Choice: Is an act of choosing between two or more possibilities. It requires a right, agency, or opportunity to choose.</p><p>The origins of the two words add context. The word decision comes from “cutting off” while choice comes from “to perceive.” Therefore a decision is more about process orientation, meaning we are going through analysis and steps to eliminate or cut off options. With choice, it is more of an approach, meaning there is a perception of what the outcome of a particular choice may be. Because of this, let’s run with choice rather than a decision.&nbsp;</p><br><p>A Decision is about going through analysis and steps to eliminate or cut off options. Choice is an approach, meaning there is a perception of what the outcome may be.&nbsp;</p> Does energy have a choice? <p>We are using energy as represented by a magnet field.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Two magnets, north and south. Irrespective of position, they have to attract. Do they have a choice?&nbsp;</p><p>Three magnets north, north, south. &nbsp; They have a more complicated relationship as of position and distance now matter as they influence the actual outcome. But there is no choice; the rules define the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>At the majority of starting positions for the three magnets, there is only one outcome as such choice is predetermined. However, there are several situations when many magnets are sufficiently far apart and that there are only small forces at play (far-field). In this case, the result of movement may appear to be more random between possible outcomes. Any specific outcome is based on an unseen small momentary influence. The more magnets exerting small forces, the more random a positional change or choice may appear, as the level of complexity of the model increases beyond the rational.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, at a simple model of say three magnets, there is no choice. Whereas in a complicated model, with many magnets, it would appear that a degree of randomness or chaos is introduced (entropy).&nbsp; The simple model does not exist in nature as it is impossible to remove small signals even if they are hidden because of large-close forces.&nbsp; The point is that at this level of abstraction, energy itself does not have a choice, and the outcome is predictable, as there indeed a fixed number of possible outcomes, which can be modelled.</p><p>Stick with me here; we are exploring something that we don’t often want to face up to as leaders; we do not make decisions that we are accountable and responsible for, as there is no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Expanding as there are only three fundamental forces of energy, each governed by their own rules.</p><p>Gravity. There is only one kind of charge: mass/energy, which is always attractive. There’s no upper limit to how much mass/energy you can have, as the worst you can do is create a black hole, which still fits into our theory of gravity. Every quantum of energy, whether it has a rest mass (like an electron) or not (like a photon), curves the fabric of space, causing the phenomenon we perceive as gravitation. If gravitation turns out to be quantum in nature, there’s only one quantum particle, the graviton, required to carry the gravitational force. Based on maths and models, gravity suggests there is no choice as it is always attractive.&nbsp; However, as we know from our study, of say, our galaxy the Milkyway, a single force introduces many patterns and an appearance of randomness. But with enough observations and data, it can be modelled, it is predictable.</p><p>Electromagnetism.&nbsp; A fundamental force that readily appears on macroscopic scales gives us a little more basic variety. Instead of one type of charge, there are two: positive and negative electric charges. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. Although the physics underlying electromagnetism is very different in detail than the physics underlying gravitation, its structure is still straightforward in the same way that gravitation is. You can have free charges, of any magnitude, with no restrictions, and there’s only one particle required (the photon) to mediate all the possible electromagnetic interactions.&nbsp; Based on maths and models, there is no choice. However, as we know from our study of, say, light waves, we get many patterns and an appearance of randomness.&nbsp;</p><p>The strong nuclear force is one of the most puzzling features of the universe.&nbsp; The rules become fundamentally different. Instead of one type of charge (gravitation) or even two (electromagnetism), there are three fundamental charges for the strong nuclear force. Inside every proton or neutron-like particle, there are at least three quark and antiquark combinations, but how many is unknown as the list keeps growing.&nbsp; Gluons are the particles that mediate the strong force, and then it gets messy.&nbsp; It is worth noting that we don’t have the maths or a model, but it appears that there is still ultimately no choice as you cannot have a net charge of any type, but how it balances is well beyond me. &nbsp; However, as we know from our study at CERN using the Large Hadron Collider, the strong nuclear force is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum">quantum </a>in nature and has a property that means it only exists when observed.&nbsp;</p><p>In nature, we have one, two or many forces, and each can create structure and randomness but can anything in nature truly make a choice or decision?</p> Extending, does information have a choice? <p>Two magnets, north and south, but information now defines distance and strength.&nbsp; Therefore information determines that there can only be one outcome. The observer knowing the information can only ever observe the single outcome — three magnets sort of facing off:&nbsp; north, north, south. &nbsp; A complicated relationship but position, distance and field strength are known; therefore, the outcome can be modelled and predicted.</p><p>Further, we can now move to a dynamic model where each of the magnets rotates and moves during the period. What happens when information includes the future probability position of the magnets.&nbsp; Does information enable the magnets not to move right now, as they know from information that it is not worth doing as it will not change the outcome and could conserve energy? (This being a fundamental law of thermodynamics.)</p><p>However, as with unpacking the onion, this is overly simplistic as gravity and electromagnetism are defined and bounded by the “Laws of Relativity and Thermodynamics”.” In contrast, the strong nuclear force is defined and bounded by the Laws of Quantum.&nbsp; Gravity and electromagnetism are deterministic in nature as there is no choice as per the laws. The interaction of a complex system can make something look random, but when removed from time and point observation, the laws define the pattern. Whereas the strong nuclear force being quantum means we don’t know its state until we observe it, which fully supports chaos/ randomness and perhaps something closer to being presented with a choice, aka free will.&nbsp; It is not so much you can do anything, more than you can pick between states rather than just a defined or a predetermined flow from start to this point bounded by the foundational laws of relativity.&nbsp;</p><p>Does information have a quantum property? Insomuch that it is only when the observer looks and can act, does it become that state? Think carefully about this in a context of bias.&nbsp;</p><p>Can information or knowledge enable choice?</p><p>Does information require energy as if so, does the very nature of an informational requirement changes the outcome? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a>.) Can something determine that to minimise energy expenditure it should wait as a better less energy requirement with the better outcome that will come by later?&nbsp; How would the information know to make that decision or choice? What rule would it be following?</p><p>We are asking that, based on information, the general rules are ignored.&nbsp; This idea means we would step over the first outcome or requirement, preferring to take a later option.&nbsp; Has information now built an experience which feeds into knowledge? But what is information in this context? Consider the colour of petals or leaves in autumn. Science reveals that colour is a derivative of visible light. A red leaf reflects wavelengths longer than those of a green leaf. Colour is a property not of the leaf but how the leaf interacts with light and also the eye and how we then determine how we will describe it as a common sound (words). Assuming the observer has the right level of vitamin C and brain structure - which all adds further dimensions. What we think of as intrinsic properties (information) of the world are merely effects of multiple causes coinciding, many small signals. Reality, in this sense, is not so much physical things, but interactions and flow.&nbsp; The same applies to touch and smell.&nbsp;</p><p>intrinsic properties (information) are merely effects of multiple causes coinciding</p><p>Remember we are asking how we get to make a choice, based on the idea that if it does not appear in nature, it is probably not natural.&nbsp; Have we convinced ourselves that complexity creates free-will?</p> Free-will, can you make a decision? <p>Reflecting on the title question. Is the data presented to you, enabling a real choice? &nbsp;Given that choice and free-will have a predication, that you have agency and can choose or decide, then we have a&nbsp; 2nd question. How is free-will possible when the foundations (energy types) you are building on does not appear to create choice?&nbsp; Yes, the appearance of randomness, yes only exists on observation - but does that create choice?</p><p>We have to admire those tiny signals which present themselves as choices at scale, as nothing has an overall significant effect. Everything has a flow. Does this lack of dominant signal create an illusion of free-will or ability to make a choice?&nbsp; When the signals are big, loud and noisy, drawing out small signals - is choice taken away?</p> Executive leadership <p>In the context of leadership, it is not that we are programmed, but is it that great leaders are highly tuned, and responsive to small signals that most of us don’t know are there because we are too busy or following instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>Leadership demands access to small signals to be able to exercise judgment. However is our love of traffic light dashboards, summaries, 1-minute overviews, elevator pitches, priorities, urgency, fast meetings, short pitches, executive summaries and KPI’s creating management signals that are driven by data which can only focus on the priority loud, noisy signals?&nbsp; The more layers and filters that data passes through both smaller signals are lost, and there is an increasing loudness to one path, no decision and removal of choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Does prominent signal notification mean we reduce our leadership's sensitivity only to see the obvious?&nbsp; The same leadership we then blame for not sensing the market signals, or not being responsive, nor following their lead when they do!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Decisions (choice) or judgement <p>Human brains are constructed or wired to create and discover patterns, to which we ascribe meaning and learning.&nbsp; Signals help us form and be informed about forming and changes in patterns and how they align or otherwise to a previous pattern. Therefore we love signals that help us form or manage patterns which we equally call rules and heuristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Management theory teaches and rewards us on prioritising signals, especially the loud, noisy, obvious ones that are easy to see and understand.&nbsp; Using the example of a cloud (one in the sky, not a server farm), it is an unmistakable signal.&nbsp; A cloud is right here, right now.&nbsp; It is big and obvious. &nbsp; Clouds are a data point; observing clouds provides us with highly structured single-source data. &nbsp; The data we collect about clouds in front of us is given to our data science team who will present back insights about the data that is collected, giving us all sorts of new information and knowledge about the data we have. Big signals win.&nbsp; The statistics team takes the same data set and provides forecasts and probabilities based on maths, inferring insights based on data that is not there. &nbsp; The outcome from both teams may be different, but they both present significant overriding signals telling us what decision to make, based on the clouds data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to look at the system: how and why did the cloud form? Where did it appear? Where is it going? By gathering lots of data from different sources and seeking many signals, we can look at systems.&nbsp; Sensors are detecting light level, wind direction and speed, ground temperature, air temperature for 100 KM round and 25 miles KM high - lots of delicate low signal data.&nbsp; It is unstructured data. &nbsp; Feeding the data into the teams, the data analytics team brings knowledge of the system, its complexity and what we know based on the data. &nbsp; The statistics team can provide forecasting and probability about clouds and not clouds.&nbsp; Small signals that in aggregate creating choice and allowing for judgment.&nbsp; Our small signals give confidence that our models work as we have cloud data and that cloud data confirms that our signals are picking up what our environment is saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Side note, the differences between “data analysis” using data science and statistics. Whilst both data scientists and statisticians use data to make inferences about a data subject, they will approach the issue of data analysis quite differently. For a data scientist, data analysis is sifting through vast amounts of data: inspecting, cleansing, modelling, and presenting it in a non-technical way to non-data scientists. The vast majority of this data analysis is performed on a computer. A data analyst will have a data science toolbox (e.g. programming languages like Python and R, or experience with frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark) with which they can investigate the data and make inferences.</p><p>If you're a statistician, instead of "vast amounts of data" you'll usually have a limited amount of information in the form of a sample (i.e. a portion of the population); data analysis is performed on this sample, using rigorous statistical techniques. A statistical analyst will generally use mathematical-based techniques like <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/">hypothesis testing</a>, <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/probability-main-index/">probability</a> and various statistical theorems to make inferences. Although much of a statistician's data analysis can be performed with the help of statistical programs like R, the analysis is more methodical and targeted to understanding one particular aspect of the sample at a time (for example, the <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean">mean</a>, <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/">standard deviation</a> or <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/confidence-interval/">confidence interval</a>).</p><p>These data analysis approaches are fundamentally different and produce different signals; for a full story, you often need both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Does a leadership team choose or decide? <p>As a senior leader, executive or director, you have to face the reality of this article now. Right now, you have four significant noisy signals to contend with: Critical parts of your company are presenting your with large signals using:</p>  <p>statistical analysis based on an observable point&nbsp;</p>  <p>data science analysis based on an observable point</p>  <p>statistical analysis based on a system</p>  <p>data science analysis based on a system</p>  <p>Do you know what type of significant loud signals you are being given and are they drowning out all the small signals you should be sensing?&nbsp; Who sits around the table is sensing small signals? &nbsp; Are you being presented with a decision, or are you being guided to a favourable outcome based on someone else's reward or motivation?&nbsp; How do you understand the bias in the data, analysis and where are the small signals? Indeed to quote @scottdavid “You have to hunt for the paradoxes in the information being presented because if you cannot see a paradox you being framed into a one-dimensional model.”&nbsp;</p><p>Further, have you understood that data is emerging outside of your control from your ecosystem that has different ontologies, taxonomies and pedagogy, meaning that you will probably only discover signals and patterns that don’t exist.&nbsp;</p> Decision-making skill based on sensitivity <p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Leadership for “organisational-fitness” is different from the leadership required for “organisational- wellness” in Sept 2020</a>. The article explored the skills needed by executive leadership in decision making to help a company be fit and well ( different things)</p><p>The chart below highlights how skills should be formed over a period to create individuals who can work together with other professionals who can deal with highly complex decision making (judgment).&nbsp; The axes are ability and expertise level on the horizontal axis (x) and the decision environment on the vertical axis (y).&nbsp; The (0,0) point where the axis’s cross is when you first learn to make decisions.&nbsp; Note this has nothing to do with age or time.&nbsp; Starting from the Orange zone - this is where we make simple decisions. A bit like gravity, there is only one force and one outcome. You are encouraged to find it and make the right choice (even though ultimately there is no choice.) The grey areas on either side are where the “<a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/the-accumulation-of-an-executives-successfulness-with-kpi-measures-is-not-an-indicator-of-a-future-a170409a0c8a">Peters Principle</a>” can be seen in practice; individuals act outside of their capacity and/or are not given sufficient responsibility and become disruptive.&nbsp; The Pink area is where most adults get to and stay.&nbsp; We understand, like electromagnetic forces, there are two options or more.&nbsp; We search out the significant signals and those that bring us the reward to which we are aligned.&nbsp; We develop and hone skills at making binary choices. The yellow/ mustard zone is where many senior executives get trapped as they are unable to adapt from acting in their own interests to acting in the best interests of the organisation and eco-system as all their training is how to perform better in their own interests and rewards (KPI’s linked to bonus). In the yellow zone, you have to create and build a whole new mental model. &nbsp; Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">John Mayard Keynes</a> as you learn more, you do U-turns, adapt your thinking, change your philosophy and adapt.&nbsp; Never stop learning. &nbsp; At this point, you wrestle with quantum decision making and find you are looking for the small signals in the chaos and need trusted advisors and equal peers.&nbsp; You seek out and find a paradox, never believing the data, not the analysis nor the steer that someone else is presenting. &nbsp; This is hard work but leads to better judgment, better decisions and better outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p> Take Away <p>Decisions are often not decisions; the choice is not always real, especially when the foundations of them are simple and binary.&nbsp; Leaders need to become very sensitive to signals and find the weak and hidden ones to ensure that, as complexity becomes a critical component of judgement, you are not forced to ratify choices.&nbsp; Ratification is when choices are not understood, the views are biased, and the decision likely fulfils someone else’s objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a director, we are held accountable and responsible for our decisions; we must take them to the best of our ability. As automation becomes more prevalent in our companies, based on data, we have to become more diligent than ever if we are making judgment, choices or decisions or just ratifying something that has taken our choice away to fulfil its own bias and own dependency using big signals.</p><br>

<p>On Monday, December 14th the 18th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* was held with a presentation from Jason Burnett, Director of Products from Digital Trust.  Digital Trust is working on the new GADI specification and is a central member of The DID Alliance.</p><p>The DID Alliance digital identity infrastructure  leverages existing FIDO Alliance infrastructure and processes combined with elements of decentralized technologies (DLTs and DIDs).  The GADI architecture is a federated identity ecosystem where Digital Address Platforms (DAPs).  The DAPs are run by known trusted identity providers and perform the Trust Anchors role,  and issue Digital Addresses to individuals.   The ecosystem uses a permissioned DLT model with only known trusted entities can perform the role of Trust Anchor.</p><p>The Digital Address is used as unique individual identifier that is controlled by the GADI ecosystem.   This is the fundamental difference in identity philosophy between GADI and SSI based systems.  The Digital Address is a lifetime connected identifier and under the control of the DAP.  The version 1.0 of the GADI specification is currently underway with a release expected in Q1 of 2021. </p><p>The DID Alliance was founded in late 2018 with a strong representation of members in South Korea and CVS/Aetna in the United States.  Digital Trust is the technology partner of The DID Alliance that is designing and implementing the GADI specification and reference architecture.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/491079655">https://vimeo.com/491079655</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:04:17 - Jason Burnett - Digital Trust</p>  <p>0:06:38 - The DID Alliance Core Principles</p>  <p>0:18:57 - DAP Ecosystem</p>  <p>0:22:53 - Components of GADI Digital Identity</p>  <p>0:34:35 - Questions</p>  <p>0:50:00 - Demo</p>  <p>1:02:00 - Questions</p>  <p>1:11:18 - Wrap-up</p>  <p></p><p>For more information on:</p>  <p>The DID Alliance: <a href="https://www.didalliance.org/">https://www.didalliance.org/</a></p>  <p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events.

<p>On Quora the question went,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/If-you-went-from-an-IQ-of-135+-to-100-how-would-it-feel/">If you went from an IQ of 135+ to 100, how would it feel?</a></p>
<p>Here’s how I <a href="https://www.quora.com/If-you-went-from-an-IQ-of-135+-to-100-how-would-it-feel/answer/Doc-Searls">answered</a>::::</p>
<p>I went through that as a kid, and it was no fun.</p>
<p>In Kindergarten, my IQ score was at the top of the bell curve, and they put me in the smart kid class. By 8th grade my IQ score was down at the middle of the bell curve, my grades sucked, and my other standardized test scores (e.g. the&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Assessments">Iowa</a>) were terrible. So the school system shunted me from the “academic” track (aimed at college) to the “general” one (aimed at “trades”).</p>
<p>To the school I was a failure. Not a complete one, but enough of one for the school to give up on aiming me toward college. So, instead of sending me on to a normal high school, they wanted to send me to a “vocational-technical” school where boys learned to operate machinery and girls learned “secretarial” skills.</p>
<p>But in fact the school failed me, as it did countless other kids who adapted poorly to industrialized education: the same industrial system that still has people believing IQ tests are a measure of anything other than how well somebody answers a bunch puzzle questions on a given day.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my parents believed in me, even though the school had given up. I also believed in myself, no matter what the school thought. Like&nbsp;<a title="searls.com" href="http://searls.com/whitman.html">Walt Whitman</a>, I believed “I was never measured, and never will be measured.” Walt also gifted everyone with these perfect lines (from&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Myself">Song of Myself</a>):</p>
<p>I know I am solid and sound.<br>
 To me the converging objects of the universe<br>
 perpetually flow.</p>
<p>All are written to me,<br>
 and I must get what the writing means…<br>
 I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept<br>
 by a carpenter’s compass,</p>
<p>I know that I am august,<br>
 I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself<br>
 or be understood.<br>
 I see that the elementary laws never apologize.</p>
<p>Whitman argued for the genius in each of us that moves in its own orbit and cannot be encompassed by industrial measures, such as standardized tests that serve an institution that would rather treat students like rats in their mazes than support the boundless appetite for knowledge with which each of us is born—and that we keep if it doesn’t get hammered out of us by normalizing systems.</p>
<p>It amazes me that half a century since I escaped from compulsory schooling’s dehumanizing wringer, the system is largely unchanged. It might even be worse. (“Study says standardized testing is overwhelming nation’s public schools,” writes&nbsp;<a title="www.washingtonpost.com" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/study-says-standardized-testing-is-overwhelming-nations-public-schools/2015/10/24/8a22092c-79ae-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html?utm_term=.fa99c73913cb">The Washington Post</a>.)</p>
<p>To detox ourselves from belief in industrialized education, the great teacher&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_Gatto">John Taylor Gatto</a>&nbsp;gives us&nbsp;<a title="www.swaraj.org" href="http://www.swaraj.org/multiversity/gatto_7lesson.htm">The Seven Lesson Schoolteacher</a>, which summarizes what he was actually paid to teach:</p>
 
 Confusion — “Everything I teach is out of context. I teach the un-relating of everything. I teach disconnections. I teach too much: the orbiting of planets, the law of large numbers, slavery, adjectives, architectural drawing, dance, gymnasium, choral singing, assemblies, surprise guests, fire drills, computer languages, parents’ nights, staff-development days, pull-out programs, guidance with strangers my students may never see again, standardized tests, age-segregation unlike anything seen in the outside world….What do any of these things have to do with each other?” 
 Class position — “I teach that students must stay in the class where they belong. I don’t know who decides my kids belong there but that’s not my business. The children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to the right class. Over the years the variety of ways children are numbered by schools has increased dramatically, until it is hard to see the human beings plainly under the weight of numbers they carry. Numbering children is a big and very profitable undertaking, though what the strategy is designed to accomplish is elusive. I don’t even know why parents would, without a fight, allow it to be done to their kids. In any case, again, that’s not my business. My job is to make them like it, being locked in together with children who bear numbers like their own.” 
 Indifference — “I teach children not to care about anything too much, even though they want to make it appear that they do. How I do this is very subtle. I do it by demanding that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor. It’s heartwarming when they do that; it impresses everyone, even me. When I’m at my best I plan lessons very carefully in order to produce this show of enthusiasm. But when the bell rings I insist that they stop whatever it is that we’ve been working on and proceed quickly to the next work station. They must turn on and off like a light switch. Nothing important is ever finished in my class, nor in any other class I know of. Students never have a complete experience except on the installment plan. Indeed, the lesson of the bells is that no work is worth finishing, so why care too deeply about anything? 
 Emotional dependency — “By stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes, honors and disgraces I teach kids to surrender their will to the predestined chain of command. Rights may be granted or withheld by any authority without appeal, because rights do not exist inside a school — not even the right of free speech, as the Supreme Court has ruled — unless school authorities say they do. As a schoolteacher, I intervene in many personal decisions, issuing a pass for those I deem legitimate, or initiating a disciplinary confrontation for behavior that threatens my control. Individuality is constantly trying to assert itself among children and teenagers, so my judgments come thick and fast. Individuality is a contradiction of class theory, a curse to all systems of classification.” 
 Intellectual dependency — “Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. It is the most important lesson, that we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. The expert makes all the important choices; only I, the teacher, can determine what you must study, or rather, only the people who pay me can make those decisions which I then enforce… This power to control what children will think lets me separate successful students from failures very easily. 
 Provisional self-esteem — “Our world wouldn’t survive a flood of confident people very long, so I teach that your self-respect should depend on expert opinion. My kids are constantly evaluated and judged. A monthly report, impressive in its provision, is sent into students’ homes to signal approval or to mark exactly, down to a single percentage point, how dissatisfied with their children parents should be. The ecology of “good” schooling depends upon perpetuating dissatisfaction just as much as the commercial economy depends on the same fertilizer. 
 No place to hide — “I teach children they are always watched, that each is under constant surveillance by myself and my colleagues. There are no private spaces for children, there is no private time. Class change lasts three hundred seconds to keep promiscuous fraternization at low levels. Students are encouraged to tattle on each other or even to tattle on their own parents. Of course, I encourage parents to file their own child’s waywardness too. A family trained to snitch on itself isn’t likely to conceal any dangerous secrets. I assign a type of extended schooling called “homework,” so that the effect of surveillance, if not that surveillance itself, travels into private households, where students might otherwise use free time to learn something unauthorized from a father or mother, by exploration, or by apprenticing to some wise person in the neighborhood. Disloyalty to the idea of schooling is a Devil always ready to find work for idle hands. The meaning of constant surveillance and denial of privacy is that no one can be trusted, that privacy is not legitimate.” 
 
<p>Gatto won multiple teaching awards because he refused to teach any of those lessons. I succeeded in life by refusing to learn them as well.</p>
<p>All of us can succeed by forgetting those seven lessons—especially the one teaching that your own intelligence can be measured by anything other than what you do with it.</p>
<p>You are not a number. You are a person like no other. Be that, and refuse to contain your soul inside any institutional framework.</p>
<p>More Whitman:</p>
<p>Long enough have you dreamed contemptible dreams.<br>
 Now I wash the gum from your eyes.<br>
 You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.</p>
<p>Long have you timidly waited,<br>
 holding a plank by the shore.<br>
 Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,<br>
 To jump off in the midst of the sea, and rise again,<br>
 and nod to me and shout,<br>
 and laughingly dash your hair.</p>
<p>I am the teacher of athletes.<br>
 He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own<br>
 proves the width of my own.<br>
 He most honors my style<br>
 who learns under it to destroy the teacher.</p>
<p>Do I contradict myself?<br>
 Very well then. I contradict myself.<br>
 I am large. I contain multitudes.</p>
<p>I concentrate toward them that are nigh.<br>
 I wait on the door-slab.</p>
<p>Who has done his day’s work<br>
 and will soonest be through with his supper?<br>
 Who wishes to walk with me.</p>
<p>The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me.<br>
 He complains of my gab and my loitering.</p>
<p>I too am not a bit tamed. I too am untranslatable.<br>
 I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.</p>
<p>Be that hawk.</p>

   Something to pay attention to when making a build v.s. buy decision is the impact that billing models will have on your usage of a tool.

  <p>Something to pay attention to when making a build v.s. buy decision is the impact that billing models will have on your usage of a tool.</p>
<p>Take logging for example. If you buy a log aggregation platform like Splunk Cloud or Loggly the pricing is likely based on the quantity of data you ingest per day.</p>
<p>This can set up a weird incentive. If you are already close to the limit of your plan, you'll find that engineers are discouraged from logging new things.</p>
<p>This can have a subtle effect on your culture. Engineers who don't want to get into a budgeting conversation will end up avoiding using key tools, and this can cost you a lot of money in terms of invisible lost productivity.</p>
<p>Tools that charge per-head have a similar problem: if your analytics tool charges per head, your junior engineers won't have access to it. This means you won't build a culture where engineers use analytics to help make decisions.</p>
<p>This is a very tricky dynamic. On the one hand it's clearly completely crazy to invest in building your own logging or analytics solutions - you should be spending engineering effort solving the problems that are unique to your company!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there are significant, hard-to-measure hidden costs of vendors with billing mechanisms that affect your culture in negative ways.</p>
<p>I don't have a solution to this. It's just something I've encountered that makes the "build v.s. buy" decision a lot more subtle than it can first appear.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is only a problem in larger engineering organizations. In a small startup the decision chain to "spend more money on logging" is a 30 second conversation with the founder with the credit card - even faster if you're the founder yourself!</p>

 Update: a process solution? 
<p>Thinking about this more, I realize that this isn't a technology problem: it's a process and culture problem. So there should be a process and cultural solution.</p>
<p>One thing that might work would be to explicitly consider this issue in the vendor selection conversations, then document it once the new tool has been implemented.</p>
<p>A company-wide document listing these tools, with clear guidance as to when it's appropriate to increase capacity/spend and a documented owner (individual or team) plus contact details could really help overcome the standard engineer's resistance to having conversations about budget.</p>

  <p>This week I launched <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> - the new official project website for Datasette.</p>
<p>Datasette's first open source release was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Nov/13/datasette/">just over three years ago</a>, but until now the official site duties have been split between the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/">the documentation</a>.</p>

<p></p>

 The Baked Data architectural pattern 
<p>The site itself is built on Datasette (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io">source code here</a>). I'm using a pattern that I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/28/niche-museums-kepler/">first started exploring</a> with <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museums</a>: most of the site content lives in a SQLite database, and I use custom Jinja templates to implement the site's different pages.</p>
<p>This is effectively a variant of the static site generator pattern. The SQLite database is built by scripts as part of the deploy process, then deployed to Google Cloud Run as a binary asset bundled with the templates and Datasette itself.</p>
<p>I call this the Baked Data architectural pattern - with credit to Kevin Marks for <a href="https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2020-11-15#t1605478365993400">helping me</a> coin the right term. You bake the data into the application.</p>
<p>It's comparable to static site generation because everything is immutable, which greatly reduces the amount of things that can go wrong - and any content changes require a fresh deploy. It's extremely easy to scale - just run more copies of the application with the bundled copy of the database. Cloud Run and other serverless providers handle that kind of scaling automatically.</p>
<p>Unlike static site generation, if a site has a thousand pages you don't need to build a thousand HTML pages in order to deploy. A single template and a SQL query that incorporates arguments from the URL can serve as many pages as there are records in the database.</p>
 How the site is built 
<p>You can browse the site's underlying database tables in Datasette <a href="https://datasette.io/content">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://datasette.io/content/news">news table</a> powers the latest news on the homepage and <a href="https://datasette.io/news">/news</a>. News lives in a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/news.yaml">news.yaml file</a> in the site's GitHub repository. I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6a59833eee83bec1f1317c7f80406275">a script</a> to import the news that had been accumulating in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.52.5/README.md">the 0.52 README</a> - now that news has moved to the site the README is a lot more slim!</p>
<p>At build time my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/yaml-to-sqlite">yaml-to-sqlite</a> script runs to load that news content into a database table.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/72e3b6a470d2543dede13d51a61a22180b5c96f9/templates/index.html#L78-L85">index.html</a> template then uses the following Jinja code to output the latest news stories, using the <code>sql()</code> function from the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> Datasette plugin:</p>
  {% set ns = namespace(current_date="") %}
{% for row in sql("select date, body from news order by date desc limit 15", database="content") %}
    {% if prettydate(row["date"]) != (ns.current_date and prettydate(ns.current_date)) %}
    &lt;h3&gt;{{ prettydate(row["date"]) }} &lt;a href="/news/{{ row["date"] }}" style="font-size: 0.8em; opacity: 0.4"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    {% set ns.current_date = prettydate(row["date"]) %}
    {% endif %}
    {{ render_markdown(row["body"]) }}
{% endfor %}  
<p><code>prettydate()</code> is a custom function I wrote in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/353f1f940cb0cb3c38d3bdf6e345328740990702/plugins/dateformat.py">a one-off plugin</a> for the site. The <code>namespace()</code> stuff is a Jinja trick that lets me keep track of the current date heading in the loop, so I can output a new date heading only if the news item occurs on a different day from the previous one.</p>
<p><code>render_markdown()</code> is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-render-markdown">datasette-render-markdown</a> plugin.</p>
<p>I wanted permalinks for news stories, but since they don't have identifiers or titles I decided to provide a page for each day instead - for example <a href="https://datasette.io/news/2020-12-10">https://datasette.io/news/2020-12-10</a></p>
<p>These pages are implemented using <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/#path-parameters-custom-page-templates">Path parameters for custom page templates</a>, introduced in Datasette 0.49. The implementation is a single template file at <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/353f1f940cb0cb3c38d3bdf6e345328740990702/templates/pages/news/%7Byyyy%7D-%7Bmm%7D-%7Bdd%7D.html">templates/pages/news/{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.html</a>, the full contents of which is:</p>
  {% extends "page_base.html" %}

{% block title %}Datasette News: {{ prettydate(yyyy + "-" + mm + "-" + dd) }}{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

{% set stories = sql("select date, body from news where date = ? order by date desc", [yyyy + "-" + mm + "-" + dd], database="content") %}
{% if not stories %}
    {{ raise_404("News not found") }}
{% endif %}
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="/news"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;: {{ prettydate(yyyy + "-" + mm + "-" + dd) }}&lt;/h1&gt;

{% for row in stories %}
    {{ render_markdown(row["body"]) }}
{% endfor %}

{% endblock %}  
<p>The crucial trick here is that, because the filename is <code>news/{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.html</code>, a request to <code>/news/2020-12-10</code> will render that template with the <code>yyyy</code>, <code>mm</code> and <code>dd</code> template variables set to those values from the URL.</p>
<p>It can then execute a SQL query that incorporates those values. It assigns the results to a <code>stories</code> variable, then checks that at least one story was returned - if not, it raises a 404 error.</p>
<p>See Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages">custom pages documentation</a> for more details on how this all works.</p>
<p>The site also offers an <a href="https://datasette.io/content/feed.atom">Atom feed</a> of recent news. This is powered by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a> using the output of <a href="https://datasette.io/content/feed">this canned SQL query</a>, with a <code>render_markdown()</code> SQL function provided by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/353f1f940cb0cb3c38d3bdf6e345328740990702/plugins/sql_functions.py">this site plugin</a>.</p>
 The plugin directory 
<p>One of the features I'm most excited about on the site is the new <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">Datasette plugin directory</a>. Datasette has over 50 plugins now and I've been wanting a definitive directory of them for a while.</p>
<p>It's pretty basic at the moment, offering a list of plugins plus simple <code>LIKE</code> based search, but I plan to expand it a great deal in the future.</p>
<p>The fun part is where the data comes from. For a couple of years now I've been using GitHub topics to tag my plugins - I tag them with <code>datasette-plugin</code>, and the ones that I planned to feature on the site when I finally launched it were also tagged with <code>datasette-io</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>datasette.io</code> deployment process runs a script called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/353f1f940cb0cb3c38d3bdf6e345328740990702/build_plugin_directory.py">build_plugin_directory.py</a>, which uses a GraphQL query against the GitHub search API to find all repositories belonging to me that have been tagged with those tags.</p>
<p>That GraphQL query looks like this:</p>
  query {
  search(query:"topic:datasette-io topic:datasette-plugin user:simonw" type:REPOSITORY, first:100) {
    repositoryCount
    nodes {
      ... on Repository {
        id
        nameWithOwner
        openGraphImageUrl
        usesCustomOpenGraphImage
        repositoryTopics(first:100) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            topic {
              name
            }
          }
        }
        openIssueCount: issues(states:[OPEN]) {
          totalCount
        }
        closedIssueCount: issues(states:[CLOSED]) {
          totalCount
        }
        releases(last: 1) {
          totalCount
          nodes {
            tagName
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}  
<p>It fetches the name of each repository, the <code>openGraphImageUrl</code> (which doesn't appear to be included in the regular GitHub REST API), the number of open and closed issues and details of the most recent release.</p>
<p>The script has access to a copy of the current site database, which is downloaded on each deploy by the build script. It uses this to check if any of the repositories have new releases that haven't previously been seen by the script.</p>
<p>Then it runs the <code>github-to-sqlite releases</code> command (part of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a>) to fetch details of those new releases.</p>
<p>The end result is a database of repositories and releases for all of my tagged plugins. The plugin directory is then built against a <a href="https://datasette.io/content/plugins">custom SQL view</a>.</p>
 Other site content 
<p>The rest of the site content is mainly static template files. I use the <code>render_markdown()</code> function inline in some of them so I can author in Markdown rather than HTML - here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/pages/examples.html">the template</a> for the <a href="https://datasette.io/examples">/examples page</a>. The various <a href="https://datasette.io/for">Use cases for Datasette</a> pages are likewise built as static templates.</p>
 Also this week: sqlite-utils analyze-tables 
<p>My other big project this week has involved building out a Datasette instance for a client. I'm working with over 5,000,000 rows of CSV data for this, which has been a great opportunity to push the limits of some of my tools.</p>
<p>Any time I'm working with new data I like to get a feel for its general shape. Having imported 5,000,000 rows with dozens of columns into a database, what can I learn about the columns beyond just browsing them in Datasette?</p>
<p><code>sqlite-utils analyze-tables</code> (<a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#analyzing-tables">documented here</a>) is my new tool for doing just that. It loops through every table and every column in the database, and for each column it calculates statistics that include:</p>
 
 The total number of distinct values 
 The total number of null or blank values 
 For non-distinct columns, the 10 most common and 10 least common values 
 
<p>It can output those to the terminal, or if you add the <code>--save</code> option it will also save them to a SQLite table called <code>_analyze_tables_</code> - here's <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/_analyze_tables_">that table</a> for my github-to-sqlite demo instance.</p>
<p>I can then use the output of the tool to figure out which columns might be a primary key, or which ones warrant being extracted out into a separate lookup table using <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/">sqlite-utils extract</a>.</p>
<p>I expect I'll be expanding this feature a lot in the future, but I'm already finding it to be really helpful.</p>
 Datasette 0.53 
<p>I pushed out a small feature release of Datasette to accompany the new project website. Quoting <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-53">the release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <code>?column__arraynotcontains=</code> table filter. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1132">#1132</a>) 
 
<code>datasette serve</code> has a new <code>--create</code> option, which will create blank database files if they do not already exist rather than exiting with an error. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1135">#1135</a>) 
 New <code>?_header=off</code> option for CSV export which omits the CSV header row, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/csv_export.html#csv-export-url-parameters">documented here</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1133">#1133</a>) 
 "Powered by Datasette" link in the footer now links to <a href="https://datasette.io/">https://datasette.io/</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1138">#1138</a>) 
 Project news no longer lives in the README - it can now be found at <a href="https://datasette.io/news">https://datasette.io/news</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1137">#1137</a>)

 Office hours 

<p>I had my first round of <a href="https://calendly.com/swillison/datasette-office-hours">Datasette office hours</a> on Friday - 20 minute video chats with anyone who wants to talk to me about the project. I had five great conversations - it's hard to overstate how thrilling it is to talk to people who are using Datasette to solve problems. If you're an open source maintainer I can thoroughly recommend giving this format a try.</p>

<p>This past spring, I noticed that our 20 year-old wooden shake roof needed serious work. The roof condition, combined with all of the recent wildfire activity in California, prompted us to replace the entire roof with asphalt shingles. This, of course, necessitated the removal and replacement of the solar <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/04/30/photovoltaic-part-1/">panels we had installed in 2006</a>.</p>



<p>In anticipation of doing this, we consulted with our local contractor, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/solar-lightworkers-inc-capitola">Solar Lightworkers</a>, to see what might be done to update the system as well as to add a bit of extra capacity since we now have an electric car. Photovoltaic technology has advanced quite a bit in the past 14 years, so we wanted to take as much advantage of that as possible while reusing components from our existing system. As described <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/08/photovoltaic-part-2-specifications-and-installation/">earlier</a>, our system had consisted of 24 200-watt Sanyo panels, with half of the panels facing south and half facing west. Because these two arrays peaked at different times of day, we had two inverters to optimize the output of each array.</p>



 Design 



 <a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/inverter.png"></a>SolarEdge inverter 



<p>Mark from Solar Lightworkers strongly recommended a <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/">SolarEdge</a> inverter that uses <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/power-optimizer#/">optimizers</a> to  minimize the impact of shading of some of the panels on the overall system output. This also compensates for the fact that different panels have maximum output at different times of day. As a result, a single inverter is sufficient for our new system. We also added four 360-watt LG panels to increase our capacity. This SolarEdge inverter is also capable of battery backup, but we haven’t opted into that yet.</p>



<p>Since our original installation, building codes had changed a bit requiring that the panels be installed at least 3 feet below the peak of the roof. This made us rethink the layout of the existing panels. When we did the original installation, we were concerned about the aesthetics of the panels on the front of the house. But since that time, so many other houses in our area have installed solar panels that we weren’t as concerned about appearance of panels on the front (south) side of the house. We still have some panels facing west, because they seem to be nearly as efficient economically as those facing west due to time-of-use electricity pricing.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/dsc01980.jpg"></a>South-facing solar panels



 Data Collection 



<p>I have enjoyed collecting data from our photovoltaic system, and have done so more or less continuously since the original system was installed, using a serial interface from one of my computers to the inverters. I wanted to continue that. The SolarEdge inverter comes with a variety of interfaces through which it can send data to SolarEdge’s cloud service, which I can view on their website. Wanting more detailed information, I found that they provide an API through which I can get data very comparable to what I got from the old inverters, and continue to analyze the data locally (as well as using their facilities, which are very good).</p>



<p>One of the unexpected benefits of the SolarEdge optimizers is the ability to see the performance of each panel individually. It turns out that one of the old panels had a power output almost exactly half of the others. I’m not sure how long that had been going on; perhaps since 2006. I found that the panels have a 20-year output warranty, so I contacted Panasonic, which had acquired the Sanyo product line, and filled out some paperwork and sent pictures. They sent me three very similar panels (replacing two panels with cosmetic defects as well as the one with low output) soon after. I was very happy with the service from Panasonic. Solar Lightworkers installed the new panels, and output is where it should be.</p>



 Performance 



<p>On a typical summer day with little shading, the system generated 23.7 kWh in on 8/30/2019 and 34.8 kWh (+47%) on 8/27/2020. The additional panels would account for 30% of that increase and the defective panel an additional 2%.  In the late fall, the old system generated 14.6 kWh on 11/25/2019, and the new system 22.9 kWh (+57%) on 11/26/2020. There are of course other variables, such as soot on the panels from the California wildfires this year.</p>



<p>It will take quite a while for the increased output to pay for the upgrades, of course, but much of that cost would have been incurred just as a result of the need to replace the roof. We are quite pleased with the performance of the new system.</p>

The author recognizes that there may be errors and biases, and welcomes constructive feedback to correct or ameliorate.</p><p>Additional context: This post is based on the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_2/PSP-PCTF-Working-Group-Close-Out-Report-FINAL.pdf">report</a> and <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_2/PSP-PCTF-Working-Group-Close-Out-Report-Presentation.pdf">presentation</a> that was provided on December 10, 2020, to the newly-formed Jurisdictional Experts on Digital Identity (JEDI), the committee responsible for public sector governance for digital identity.</p><p>The consultation draft of the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.2 is now available and directly downloadable at this <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_2/PSP-PCTF-V-1-2-Consultation-Draft-EN.pdf">link</a>. The folder with related artifacts is available <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/Version1_2">here</a>.</p><p>The remainder of this post is the content of the report, lightly edited for&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/504c7870fdb6">Medium</a>.</p> Objective of the PSP PCTF Working Group (PSP PCTF&nbsp;WG) <p>The primary objective of the PSP PCTF WG had been the development of the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PSP PCTF). This has been achieved by contributing and reviewing content, attaining the consensus of the public sector jurisdictions, and monitoring related developments that might impact the development of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p><p>The main deliverable of the PSP PCTF WG has been the PSP PCTF, the various versions of which consist of a consolidated overview document, an assessment methodology, and an assessment worksheet.</p><p>The PSP PCTF WG has also facilitated other activities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Sharing information, updates, and lessons learned from various digital identity initiatives; and  Consultation and engagement with multi-jurisdictional and international fora.   Membership <p>At its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG had 111 confirmed members on its distribution list consisting of representatives from all jurisdictions and various municipalities across Canada, as well as international participants from the Digital Nations. The working group normally met on a weekly call that averaged 20 to 30 participants.</p> Achievements <p>PSP PCTF Deliverables</p><p>The PSP PCTF Version 1.2 is now available at: <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP</a>. It should be noted that this has been the iterative product of several prior versions:</p>  April 2018: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Alpha Version — Consolidated Overview document;  July 2019: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.0 — Consolidated Overview document;  June 2020: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 — Consolidated Overview document; and  For each of these versions of the PSP PCTF, a companion PSP PCTF Assessment Worksheet consisting of approximately 400 conformance criteria.   PSP PCTF Assessments <p>The PSP PCTF was used in the following assessments conducted by the federal government to accept trusted digital identities from the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia:</p>  September 2018: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://account.alberta.ca/">MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program</a> for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Alpha Version); and  January 2020: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://id.gov.bc.ca/login/entry#start">British Columbia Services Card Program </a>for use by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">Government of Canada</a> (using the PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.0).  <p>Insights and lessons learned from the application of these PSP PCTF assessments were brought back to the PSP PCTF WG and the learnings were incorporated into subsequent versions of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p> Joint Council Briefings <p>The PSP PCTF is the result of a long-term and deep collective experience of the public sector. Efforts on the PSP PCTF began in late 2014 and have been reported regularly to the <a href="https://citizenfirst.ca/councils/joint-councils">Joint Councils</a> by the Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC) Working Group and its successor, the PSP PCTF Working Group. The following is the list of updates that are on record and are available for reference in the joint-councils-update folder (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs/joint-councils-updates">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>):</p>  February 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  October 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  February 2018 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  September 2018 — Joint Councils Update; Whitehorse Declaration and MADI&nbsp;Update;  February 2019 — Joint Councils Update;&nbsp;and  February 2020 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update.   Related Deliverables <p>In addition to the PSP PCTF itself, the following related deliverables should be&nbsp;noted:</p>  Whitehorse Declaration — a declaration of shared intent among the federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments to pursue the establishment of trustworthy digital identities for all Canadians (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/Declaration-Digital-ID-D%C3%A9claration-lidentit%C3%A9-num%C3%A9rique.pdf">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>);  IMSC Public Policy Paper — recommendations for a Pan-Canadian policy position on the question of roles and responsibilities of the public and private sector in digital identity (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/2019-09-00%20IMSC-Public-Policy-Paper.pdf">GitHub link</a>);&nbsp;and  Many historical deliverables that are too numerous to list in this report. A Public Historical Archive of deliverables and briefings, many of which pre-date the efforts of the PSP PCTF are being compiled in a folder on a best-effort basis (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>).   Other <p>It also should be noted that content from the PSP PCTF Version 1.1 was incorporated into the National Standard of Canada, CAN/CIOSC 103–1, Digital Trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals, developed by the CIO Strategy Council, and approved by the Standards Council of Canada (<a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">Website&nbsp;link</a>).</p> PSP PCTF WG Work Plan 2020–2021 <p>At the time of its dissolution, the work plan of the PSP PCTF WG was as&nbsp;follows:</p>  PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.2    A Consolidated Overview document (released on December 4th, 2020) which includes:  A revised Normative Core (containing new concepts that were developed as a result of the credentials and relationships analysis&nbsp;work);  A revised Credential Model (based on the working group discussion document); and  An incorporated Relationship Model (based on work led by&nbsp;ISED).  <p>2. An Assessment Worksheet (draft released on December 4, 2020) which contains new and revised conformance criteria for assessment purposes</p><p>3. A re-assessment of the MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Version 1.2) with planned completion by March&nbsp;2021.</p> PSP PCTF Thematic&nbsp;Issues <p>During the development of the PSP PCTF, the working group has identified several high-level thematic issues that must be addressed in order to advance the digital ecosystem.</p><p>Thematic Issue 1: Relationships (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a relationship model is required.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 2: Credentials (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a generalized credential model is required. This model should integrate traditional physical credentials and authentication credentials with the broader notion of a verifiable credential.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 3: Unregistered Organizations (Priority: High)</p><p>Currently, the scope of PSP PCTF includes all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada. There are also many kinds of unregistered organizations operating in Canada such as sole proprietorships, trade unions, co-ops, NGOs, unregistered charities, and trusts. An analysis of these unregistered organizations needs to be undertaken.</p><p>Thematic Issue 4: Informed Consent (Priority: High)</p><p>The current version of the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document does not adequately capture all the issues and nuances surrounding the topic of informed consent especially in the context of the public sector. A more rigorous exploration of this topic needs to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>Thematic Issue 5: Privacy Concerns (Priority: Medium)</p><p>In regards to the Identity Continuity and Relationship Continuity atomic processes, it has been noted that there are privacy concerns with the notion of dynamic confirmation. Further analysis based on feedback from the application of the PSP PCTF is required to determine if these atomic processes are appropriate.</p><p>Thematic Issue 6: Assessing Outsourced Atomic Processes (Priority: Medium)</p><p>The PSP PCTF does not assume that a single Issuer or Verifier is solely responsible for all of the atomic processes. An organization may choose to outsource or delegate the responsibility of an atomic process to another party. Therefore, several bodies might be involved in the PSP PCTF assessment process, focusing on different atomic processes, or different aspects (e.g., security, privacy, service delivery). It remains to be determined how such multi-actor assessments will be conducted.</p><p>Thematic Issue 7: Scope of the PSP PCTF (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been suggested that the scope of the PSP PCTF should be broadened to include academic qualifications, professional designations, etc. The PSP PCTF anticipates extensibility through the generalization of the PSP PCTF model and the potential addition of new atomic processes. Expanding the scope of the PSP PCTF into other domains needs to be&nbsp;studied.</p><p>Thematic Issue 8: Signature (Priority: Low)</p><p>The concept of signature as it is to be applied in the context of the PSP PCTF needs to be explored.</p><p>Thematic Issue 9: Foundation Name, Primary Name, Legal Name (Priority: Low)</p><p>The PSP PCTF has definitions for Foundation Name, Primary Name, and Legal Name. Since the three terms mean the same thing, a preferred term should be selected and used consistently throughout the PSP PCTF documents.</p><p>Thematic Issue 10: Additional Detail (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been noted that the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document contains insufficient detail in regards to the specific application of the PSP PCTF. The PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be supplemented with detailed guidance in a separate document.</p><p>Thematic Issue 11: Review of the Appendices (Priority: Low)</p><p>A review of the current appendices contained in the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be undertaken. Each appendix should be evaluated for its utility, applicability, and appropriateness, and a determination made as to whether it should continue to be included in the document.</p> Recommendations for Next&nbsp;Steps   Continue the development of the PSP PCTF based on the thematic issues identified above. These thematic issues may be addressed as part of a working group, or through task groups, or practice&nbsp;groups.  Continue the application of the PSP PCTF through the Assessment Process with the Provinces and Territories, with a view to incorporating learnings back into subsequent versions of the PSP PCTF, and, evolving the assessment process toward a standards-based process that has a formal certification scheme with accredited bodies and independent assessors.  Support the changes in digital identity governance to ensure that the PSP PCTF is developed and used in the public interest and is aligned with other industry and international efforts.  Establish as required, working groups, task groups, or practice groups&nbsp;for:  Ongoing development and maintenance of the PSP PCTF and related assessment processes and certification schemes;  Carrying out specific time-bound tasks or address issues. (e.g., addressing the thematic themes through discussion papers, analysis of other trust frameworks, etc.);  Testing practical applications of the PSP PCTF standards and conformance criteria through assessments and use cases;&nbsp;and  Sharing knowledge and lessons learned in relation to the application of the PSP PCTF and the assessment process.  Facilitate broader engagement using the PSP PCTF, including:  Engaging standards development organizations, domestic and international, to support the standards development and certification scheme development;  Engaging international organizations having an interest in applying or adapting the PSP PCTF for their purposes;  Collaborating with industry associations wishing to advance the aims of their membership, or their specific sector;&nbsp;and  Encouraging dialogue with other governments, either bilaterally facilitated through the federal government, or multilaterally through established bodies (e.g., UNCITRAL, the Digital Nations).   Conclusion <p>At the time of its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG was an important vehicle for ensuring public sector communication and discussion across Canada in order to cultivate a shared understanding of how identity and digital identity could be best developed for the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Much has been achieved by the working group, building on prior work going back more than a decade. However much more work remains. It is hoped that the work accomplished to date and the recommendations put forward in this report will be considered by the JEDI to support their mandate to accelerate the specific goals of the digital identity priority of the Joint Councils.</p>

<p>I have two Flickr accounts, named <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure">Nfrastructure</a>. One has 73,355 photos, and the other&nbsp;3,469. They each cost $60/year to maintain as pro accounts. They’ve both renewed automatically in the past; and the first one is already renewed, which I can tell because it says “Your plan will automatically renew on March 20, 2022.”</p>
<p>The second one, however… I dunno. Because, while my Account page says “Your plan will automatically renew on December 13, 2020,” I just got emails for both accounts saying, “This email is to confirm that we have stopped automatic billing for your subscription. Your subscription will continue to be active until the expiration date listed below. At that time, you will have to manually renew or your subscription will be cancelled.” The dates match the two above. At the bottom of each, in small print, it says “<a href="http://store.digitalriver.com/store/defaults/en_US/DisplayDRAboutDigitalRiverPage/eCommerceProvider.Digital+River+Inc.">Digital River Inc.</a> is the authorized reseller and merchant of the products and services offered within this store. <a href="http://store.digitalriver.com/store/defaults/en_US/DisplayDRPrivacyPolicyPage/eCommerceProvider.Digital+River+Inc.">Privacy Policy</a> <a href="http://store.digitalriver.com/store/defaults/en_US/DisplayDRTermsAndConditionsPage/eCommerceProvider.Digital+River+Inc.">Terms of Sale</a> <a href="http://store.digitalriver.com/store/defaults/en_US/DisplayCCPAPage/eCommerceProvider.Digital+River+Inc.">Your California Privacy Rights</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+%22digital+river%22">Hmmm</a>. The Digital River link goes <a href="https://store.digitalriver.com/store/defaults/en_US/DisplayDRAboutDigitalRiverPage/eCommerceProvider.Digital+River+Inc.">here</a>, which appears to be in Ireland. A look at the email’s source shows the mail server is one in Kansas, and the&nbsp;<a href="http://Flickr.com" title="http://Flickr. ">Flickr.com</a> addressing doesn’t look spoofed. So, it doesn’t look&nbsp;too scammy to me. Meaning I’m not sure what the scam is. Yet. If there is one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I do need to renew the subscription, and the risk of not renewing it is years of contributions (captions, notes, comments) out the window.</p>
<p>So I went to “Manage your Pro subscription” on the second one (which has four days left to expiration), and got this under “Update your Flickr Pro subscription information”</p>
<blockquote><p>Plan changes are temporarily disabled. Please contact support for prompt assistance.</p>
<p>Cancel your subscription</p></blockquote>
<p>The Cancel line is a link. I won’t click on it.</p>
<p>Now, I have never heard of a company depending on automatic subscription renewals switching from those to the manual kind. Nor have I heard of a subscription-dependent company sending out notices like these while the renewal function is disabled.</p>
<p>I would like to contact customer support; but there is no link for that on my account page. In fact, the words “customer” and “support” don’t appear there. “Help” does, however, and goes to&nbsp;https://help.flickr.com/, where I need to fill out a form. This I did, explaining,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am trying to renew manually, but I get “Plan changes are temporarily disabled. Please contact support for prompt assistance.” So here I am. Please reach out. This subscription expires in four days, and I don’t want to lose the photos or the account. I’m [email address] for this account (I have another as well, which doesn’t renew until 2022), my phone is 805-705-9666, and my twitter is @dsearls. Thanks!</p></blockquote>
<p>The robot replied,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for your message – you’ll get a reply from a Flickr Support Hero soon. If you don’t receive an automated message from Flickr confirming we received your message (including checking your spam folders), please make sure you provided a valid and active email. Thanks for your patience and we look forward to helping you!</p></blockquote>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am wondering if Flickr is in trouble again.</p>
<p>I wondered about this&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2011/01/12/what-if-flickr-fails/">in 2011</a> and again <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/dear-adobe-please-buy-flickr-4f88dcd16ee0">in 2016</a>, (in my most-read Medium post, ever). Those were two of the (feels like many) times Flickr appeared to be on the brink. And I have been glad <a href="http://smugmug.com">SmugMug</a> took over the Flickr show in 2018. (I’m a paying SmugMug customer as well.) But this kind of thing is strange and has me worried. Should I be?</p>
<p>[Later, on December 10…]</p>
<p>Heard from Flickr this morning, with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Doc,</p>
<p>When we migrated your account to Stripe, we had to cancel your subscription on Digital River. The email you received was just a notice of this event. I apologize for the confusion.</p>
<p>Just to confirm, there is no action needed at this time. You have an active Pro subscription in good standing and due for renewal on an annual term on December 14th, 2020.</p>
<p>To answer your initial question, since your account has been migrated to Stripe, while you can update your payment information, changes to subscription plans are temporarily unavailable. We expect this functionality to be restored soon.</p>
<p>I appreciate your patience and hope this helps.</p>
<p>For more information, please consult our FAQ here: <a href="https://help.flickr.com/faq-for-flickr-members-about-our-payment-processor-migration-SyN1cazsw">https://help.flickr.com/faq-for-flickr-members-about-our-payment-processor-migration-SyN1cazsw</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Before this issue came up, I hadn’t heard of Digital River or Stripe. Seems they are both <a href="https://comparisons.financesonline.com/digital-river-vs-stripe">“payment gateway” services</a>&nbsp;(at least according to <a href="https://comparisons.financesonline.com/digital-river-vs-stripe">Finances Online</a>). If you look down the list of what these companies can do, other than payment processing alone—merchandising, promotions, channel partner management, dispute handling, cross-border payment optimization, in-app solutions, risk management, email services, and integrations with dozens of different tools, products and extensions from the likes of Visa, MasterCard, Sage and many other companies with more obscure brand names—you can understand how a screw-up like this one can happen when moving from one provider to another.</p>
<p>Now the question for me is whether subscription systems really have to be this complex.</p>
<p>(Comments here only work for Harvard people; so if you’re not one of those, please reply elsewhere, such as on Twitter, where I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls">@dsearls</a>.)</p>

<p>I said something strange this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identity is a Katamari, language is a continuous reverse engineering
effort, and thus language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like nonsense probably, but has a lot of thought about it.
I have spent a lot of time in the decentralized-identity community and
the ocap communities, both of which have spent a lot of time hemming
and hawing about "What is identity?", "What is a credential or
claim?", "What is authorization?",
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Dec/0028.html">"Why is it unhygienic for identity to be your authorization system?"</a>
(that mailing list post is the most important writing about the nature
of computing I've ever written; I hope to have a cleaned up version of
the ideas out soon).</p>
<p>But that whole bit about "what is identity, is it different than an
identifier really?" etc etc etc...</p>
<p>Well, I've found one good explanation, but it's a bit silly.</p>
 Identity is a Katamari 
<p>There is a curious, surreal, delightful (and proprietary, sorry) game,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>.
It has a silly story, but the interesting thing here is the game
mechanic, involving rolling around a ball-like thing that picks up
objects and grows bigger and bigger kind of like a snowball.
It has to <a href="https://youtu.be/FQxEitzJ-H0?t=636">be seen</a> or played to
really be understood.</p>
<p>This ball-like thing is called a "Katamari Damacy", or "soul clump",
which is extra appropriate for our mental model.
As it rolls around, it picks up smaller objects and grows bigger.
The ball at the center is much like an identifier.
But over time that identifier becomes obscured, it picks up things,
which in the game are physical objects, but these metaphorically map
to "associations".</p>
<p>Our identity-katamari changes over time.  It grows and picks up
associations.  Sometimes you forget something you've picked up that's
in there, it's buried deep (but it's wiggling around in there still
and you find out about it during some conversation with your
therapist).  Over time the katamari picks up enough things that it is
obscured.  Sometimes there are collisions, you smash it into something
and some pieces fly out.  Oh well, don't worry about it.  They
probably weren't meant to be.</p>
 Language is reverse engineering 
<p>Shout out to my friend <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/">Jonathan Rees</a> for
saying something that really stuck in my brain (okay actually most
things that Rees says stick in my brain):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Language is a continuous reverse engineering effort, where both
sides are trying to figure out what the other side means."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, but its truth is the bane of ontologists and static
typists.  This doesn't mean that ontologies or static typing are
wrong, but that the notion that they're fixed is an illusion... a
useful, powerful illusion (with a great set of mathematical tools
behind it sometimes that can be used with mathematical
proofs... assuming you don't change the context), but an illusion
nonetheless.  Here are some examples that might fill out what I mean:</p>
 
 
<p>The classic example, loved by fuzzy typists everywhere: when is a
   person "bald"?  Start out with a person with a "full head" of hair.
   How many hairs must you remove for that person to be "bald"?  What
   if you start out the opposite way...  someone is bald... how many
   hairs must you add for them to become not-bald?</p>
 
 
<p>We might want to construct a precise recipe for a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassi#Mango_lassi">mango lassi</a>.
   Maybe, in fact, we believe we can create a precise typed
   definition for a mango lassi.
   But we might soon find ourselves running into trouble.  Can a vegan
   non-dairy milk be used for the Lassi?  (Is vegan non-dairy milk
   actually milk?)  Is ice cream acceptable?  Is added sugar
   necessary?  Can we use artificial mango-candy powder instead of
   mangoes?  Maybe you can hand-wave away each of these, but here's
   something much worse: what's a mango?  You might think that's
   obvious, a mango is the fruit of mangifera indica or maybe
   if you're generous fruit of anything in the mangifera genus.
   But mangoes evolved and there is some weird state where we had
   almost-a-mango and in the future we might have some new states
   which are no-longer-a-mango, but more or less we're throwing darts
   at exactly where we think those are... evolution doesn't care,
   evolution just wants to keep reproducing.</p>
 
 
<p>Meaning changes over time, and how we categorize does too.
   Once someone was explaining the <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">Web Ontology Language</a>
   (which got confused somewhere in its acronym ordering and is
   shortened to OWL (update: it's a Winnie the Pooh update, based
   on the way the Owl character spells his name... thank you Amy
   Guy for informing me of the history)).
   They said that it was great because you could clearly define what
   is and isn't allowed and terms derived from other terms, and that
   the simple and classic example is Gender, which is a binary choice
   of Male or Female.
   They paused and thought for a moment.
   "That might not be a good example anymore."</p>
 
 
<p>Even if you try to define things by their use or properties rather
   than as an individual concept, this is messy too.
   A person from two centuries ago would be confused by the metal
   cube I call a "stove" today, but you could say it does the same
   job.
   Nonetheless, if I asked you to "fetch me a stove", you would probably
   not direct me to a computer processor or a car engine, even though
   sometimes people fry an egg on both of these.</p>
 
 
<p>Multiple constructed languages (Esperanto most famously) have been
made by authors that believed that if everyone spoke the same language,
we would have world peace.
This is a beautiful idea, that conflict comes purely from
misunderstandings.
I don't think it's true, especially given how many fights I've seen
between people speaking the same language.
Nonetheless there's truth in that many fights are about a conflict
of ideas.</p>
<p>If anyone was going to achieve this though, it would be the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> community, which
actually does have a language which is syntactically unambiguous,
so you no longer have ambiguity such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">"time flies like an arrow"</a>.
Nonetheless, even this world can't escape the problem that some terms
just can't be easily pinned down, and the best example is the
<a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/jbocre:_Bear_goo">bear goo</a>
debate.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: both of us can unambiguously construct a sentence
referring to a "bear".
But when it is that bear no longer a bear?
If it is struck in the head and is killed, when in that process has it
become a decompositional "bear goo" instead?
And the answer is: there is no good answer.
Nonetheless many participants want there to be a pre-defined bear,
they want us to live in a pre-designed universe where "bear" is a clear
predicate that can be checked against, because the universe has a
clear definition of "bear" for us.</p>
<p>That doesn't exist, because bears evolved.  And more importantly, the
concept and existence a bear is emergent, cut across many different
domains, from evolution to biology to physics to linguistics.</p>
<p>Sorry, we won't achieve perfect communication, not even in Lojban.
But we can get a lot better, and set up a system with fewer stumbling
blocks for testing ideas against each other, and that is a worthwhile
goal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you and I are camping and I shout, "AAH!  A bear!
RUN!!", you and I probably don't have to stop to debate bear goo.
Rees is right that language is a reverse engineering effort, but we
tend to do a pretty good job of gaining rough consensus of what the
other side means.  Likewise, if I ask you, "Where is your stove?", you
probably won't lead me to your computer or your car.  And if you hand
me a "sugar free vegan mango lassi made with artificial mango flavor"
I might doubt its cultural authenticity, but if you then referred to
the "mango lassi" you had just handed me a moment ago, I wouldn't have
any trouble continuing the conversation.  Because we're more or less
built to contextually construct language contexts.</p>
 Language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris 
<p>Language is composed of syntax partly, but the arrangement of symbolic
terms mostly.  Or that's another way to say that the non-syntactic
elements of language are mostly there as identifiers substituted
mentally for identity and all the associations therein.</p>
<p>Back to the Katamari metaphor.  What "language is a
reverse-engineering effort" really means is that each of us are
constructing identities for identifiers mentally, rolling up katamaris
for each identifier we encounter.  But what ends up in our ball will
vary depending on our experiences and what paths we take.</p>
<p>Which really means that if each person is rolling up a separate,
personal identity-katamari for each identifier in the system, that
means that, barring passing through a singularity type event-horizon
past which participants can do direct shared memory mapping, this is
an O(n^2) problem!</p>
<p>But actually this is not a problem, and is kind of beautiful.  It is
amazing, given all that, just how good we are at finding shared
meaning.  But it also means that we should be aware of what this means
topologically, and that each participant in the system will have a
different set of experiences and understanding for each
identity-assertion made.</p>
<p>Thank you to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Stephen Webber, Corbin Simpson,
Baldur Jóhannsson, Joey Hess, Sam Smith, Lee Spector, and Jonathan
Rees for contributing thoughts that lead to this post (if you feel
like you don't belong here, do belong here, or are wondering how the
heck you got here, feel free to contact me).  Which is not to say that
everyone, from their respective positions, have agreement here; I know
several disagree strongly with me on some points I've made.  But
everyone did help contribute to reverse-engineering their positions
against mine to help come to some level of shared understanding,
and the giant pile of katamaris that is this blogpost.</p>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">origin of the S curve</a> goes back to the study of population growth by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre-François Verhulst</a> c.1838. Verhulst was influenced by Thomas Malthus’ “An Essay on the Principle of Population” which showed that growth of a biological population is self-limiting by the finite amount of available resources. The logistic equation is also sometimes called the Verhulst-Pearl equation following its rediscovery in 1920. Alfred J. Lotka derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the law of population growth but he is better known for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka">predator: prey model</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 1957 business strategists Joe Bohlen and George Beal published the <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7044374.pdf">Diffusion Process</a>. Taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">adoption curve</a> and adding cumulatively the take up the product to gain a “classic S curve.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The market adoption curve became the basis for explaining innovation and growth as a broader market economic concept by the late 1960s. We started to consider the incubation of ideas to create new businesses and how we need a flow of products/ services within big companies.</p><p>From this thinking emerged two concepts, as the shareholder primacy model became central to growth.&nbsp; The first is the concept of “Curve Jumping” to ensure that you continue growth by keeping shareholders happy through the continuous introduction of new products, as the existing ones have matured. Of course, the downside is that if a business cannot jump because of its current cost base or ability to adopt the latest technology to perpetuate the ascension of the curve, new companies will emerge with competitive advantages (product or cost) as they jump to new technologies.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine">Milton Friedman’s</a> emphasis on shareholder value maximisation at the expense of other considerations was driving companies to keep up with the next curve of fear of being left behind competitively. Some sorts of competition are healthier for markets than others, and it appears that competition and anxiety relating to retaining technology leadership at all costs have been driving capitalism in a particularly destructive direction, rather than encouraging useful and sustainable friendly innovation.&nbsp; There is an economics essay to be written here, but this piece is about the S curve.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p> Right here, right now. <p>We live in a time when crisis and systematic “emergent properties” are gaining attention and prominence.&nbsp; Emergence by definition occurs when an entity or system is observed to have properties that its parts do not pose or display on their own. Properties or behaviours which only emerge when the parts interact in the broader system, as we see our businesses, we understand as complex adaptive systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst shareholder primacy as an economic driver faded in 1990 to be replaced finally in 2019 with<a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/files/Mayer_2.19.19.transcript.pdf"> Colin Mayer</a> work on the <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2020/11/value-creation-and-corporate-governance">Purpose Model</a>, a modern standard for corporate responsibility which makes an equal commitment to all stakeholders. Shareholder primacy’s simplicity has remained a stalwart of leadership training, teaching and therefore, management thinking.&nbsp; Its simplicity meant we did not have to deal with contradictions and conflicting requirements that a broader purpose would expose. The <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business Round Table Aug 2019</a> and Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink letters to CEOs/ Shareholders are critical milestones in turning thinking away from pure shareholder returns as the reason for a business to exist. The shift is towards eco-systems and ESG (Environmental sustainability, Social responsibility and better oversight and Governance) as primary drives.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.frc.org.uk/investors/uk-stewardship-code">FCA Stewardship code</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/172/2011-04-22">Section 172 of the companies act</a> and decision reporting are some of the first legislative instruments on this journey. With now over 50 series A funded startups active in ESG reporting, impact investing has become a meme as the development of a more standardised and comprehensive purpose reporting has strengthened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shareholder primacy’s simplicity meant we did not have to deal with contradictions and conflicting requirements that a broader purpose would expose.</p><p>With this new framing, it is time to revisit the S-Curve.&nbsp;</p> Framing the S-Curve for an evolutionary journey <p>If you have not yet discovered <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwardley/">Simon Wardley</a> and his <a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps">mapping thinking</a>, stop here and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMlFv2Sod54">watch this</a>. &nbsp; Simon has a brilliant S-Curve with pioneers, settlers and town planners, really worth looking up. His <a href="https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/08/on-diffusion-and-evolution.html">model is about evolution (journey towards commodity) rather than diffusion (take up over time).</a>&nbsp; To quote Simon “The evolution of a single act from genesis to commodity may involve hundreds if not thousands of diffusion curves for each evolving instance of that act, each with their own chasm.”</p><p>The next S-Curve below, I am building on Simon’s axis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity">Ubiquity</a> (how common something is) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty">Certainty</a> (the likelihood of the outcome being as determined) which is an evolution S-Curve.&nbsp; On these axes, we are plotting the systems and company development - time is not present, but as we will see, we have to remove time from the framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Starting in the bottom left is the activity of Innovation where uniquity is low, as it is an idea, and it is not available to everyone. The certainty that any innovation will work is low.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The top right corner is the perceived north star.&nbsp; Ubiquity is high as everyone has it, and there is high certainty that it works.&nbsp; In this top right corner are commodities and utilities, technology at scale, by example turning on the water tap and drinking water flows.&nbsp; Linking innovation and commodity is an evolution or journey S-Curve. Under this curve, we can talk about the transformation of the company, the companies practices, data, controls and what models it will most likely utilise.&nbsp; The chart below highlights the most popular thinking in each stage and is certainly not exclusive.&nbsp; Agile works well in all phases, <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/pathways-to-general-ai-unimagined.html">AI can be used anywhere, except for choice</a>, and data is not as definite as the buckets would suggest.&nbsp; Control changes as we evolve from lean/ MVP in the first delivery, to using methodologies such as agile and scrum, then Prince 2 as a grown-up project management tool at scale and then towards quality management with 6 Sigma.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I have a passionate dislike of the term “best practice” as it only applies when in the linear phase but is literally applied everywhere.&nbsp; At linear, you have evidence and data to support what “best” looks like.&nbsp; At any stage before ubiquity and certainty, best practice is simply not possible other than by lucking out.&nbsp; A desire for best practice ignores that you have to learn and prove what is it before you find it is best. And to all those who have the best - you can still do better, so how can it be best?</p><p></p><p>If one considers the idea of time and S-Curves you get to curve jumping or continual product development as set out earlier.&nbsp; The purpose of an evolution or journey S-Curve presented in this way is that when time is not the axis, any significant business will have all these activities present at all times (continual adaptation/ evolution not diffusion). In nature, all different levels of species exist at the same time from a single cell, to complex organisms.&nbsp; Innovation is not a thing; it is a journey, where you have to be all the camps, on the route, at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovation is not a thing; it is a journey where you have to be all the camps, on the route, at the same time.&nbsp;</p> Evolution S-Curve and governance <p>HBR argues that most capitalists markets are in a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/08/22/so-long-to-shareholder-primacy/">post-shareholder primacy model</a>, meaning the purpose of an organisation is up for debate. Still, we are on the route to a more inclusive purpose and <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2020/11/value-creation-and-corporate-governance">reason for a company to exist</a>.&nbsp; Law already exists in the UK as <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/preparing-directors-for-duties-and.html">Section 172 of the Companies Act</a> in the form of directors duties.&nbsp; The global pandemic has highlighted a bunch of significant weakness that emerges from our focus on growth and shareholder focus, including, as examples only:</p>  <p>Highly integrated long supply chains are incredibly efficient, but are very brittle and not resilient&nbsp; - we lost effectiveness.</p>  <p>A business needs to re-balance towards effectiveness.&nbsp; A food company in a pandemic exists to get food to customers (effectiveness) not to drive efficiency at any cost.</p>  <p>Ecosystem sustainability is more important than any single company's fortunes.</p>  <p>ESG, risk, being better ancestors, costing the earth and climate change are extremely difficult on your own.</p>  <p>Our existing risk models focus on resource allocation, safety and control. This framing means that new risk created in a digital-first world may be outside of the frame and therefore hidden in plain sight.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Given this framing and context, it is worth overlaying governance on the S-curve of start-up development, which we will now unpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Governance has centrally focussed on corporates and large companies who offer products and services to mass markets. By concentrating governance on companies who have scale, if they are well managed, and is there independence of oversight, we have framed governance as only of interest for companies where there is an interest to wider society on their behaviour. Indeed it becomes a burden rather than a value.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies of scale tend to be found in the linear quadrant, top right, where growth is mainly incremental and linear.&nbsp; Regulation and markets focus on “BEST practices” which have been derived over a long period. The data used is highly modelled, and the application of AI creates new opportunities and value.&nbsp; Control is exercised through the utilisation of 6 Sigma for quality (repeatability) and other advanced program management techniques. KPI’s enable the delegation of actions and the monitoring, control thereof.&nbsp; The business model is that of exercising good or “best” decision making, based on resource allocation and risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unpacking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance">Corporate Governance</a> is a broad and thorny topic, but foundations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_Report">The Cadbury Report (1992)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance#Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (2002) have been instrumental in framing </a>mandates.&nbsp; However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance,_risk_management,_and_compliance">governance, compliance and risk management</a> became one topic in c.2007 and lost the clear separation of function.&nbsp; Regulation has also formed an effective backstop to control behaviours and market abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The point is, when a company is at the scale, we have created “best governance practises and guidance”,&nbsp; along with excellent risk frameworks and stewardship codes for investors. &nbsp; Many of the tools and methods have stood the test of time and provide confidence to the market.&nbsp; However, these tools and frameworks are designed for companies at scale.&nbsp; On the journey from startup to scale, the adoption of such heavyweight practices in early development would be overly burdensome for emergent companies and are not a best or a good fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Remembering that any company of scale has all these phases present at the same time, but there are five possible camps or phases where we need governance; three are in orange and two in yellow. &nbsp; The yellow blocks represent phases where there is a degree of stability insomuch that there can be growth, but there is not a wholesale change in everything.&nbsp; The orange block represents phases where everything is changing. &nbsp; Yellow blocks indicate complicated oversight,&nbsp; where orange suggests complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, it is not that companies or markets in a linear phase are not complex; it is that the management at linear has more certainty in terms of practices and forecasting coupled with having to deal with less change. When there is a product of service at linear it delivers significant noisy signals and priorities that often overshadow any data or insights from other phases.&nbsp; Management at scale requires a focus on understanding the delta between the plan and the executed outcome and making minor adjustments to optimise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The management during the yellow stable growth camps/ phases is complicated as patterns and data will not always be that useful.&nbsp; Data will not be able to point to a definitive decision directly. Governance provides assurance and insights as management continually searches for the correct data to make decisions on, which may not be there.&nbsp; Management during an orange highly volatile camps/ phases is more complicated as you cannot rely on existing data during a transition between what you had and the new. Simply put if you did, you will only get what you have and not be able to move to the new.&nbsp; The idea of transition is that the old is left behind. Experienced leadership will show skills in seeking small signals from the noisy existing data and the noise. When considering governance through this dynamic lens, it is apparent that it becomes much more challenging and that we cannot rely on the wisdom and best practices of linear.&nbsp;</p><p>Plans at scale are more comfortable and more predictable; they are designed to enable the measurement of a delta. Plans during innovation are precisely the opposite, not easy and highly unpredictable.&nbsp; Using the same word “plan” in both cases means we lose definition and distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A plan at scale is built on years of data and modelled to be highly reliable; it is accurate and has a level of detail that can create KPIs for reporting.&nbsp; The plan and the model is a fantastic prediction tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A plan at start-up and growth is about direction and intention. Failure to have one would be catastrophic,&nbsp; but with the first few hours of the words being committed to a shared document, the plan is out of date.&nbsp; To be useful, it has to lack precision, detail and measurement but will set out stages, actions and outcomes.&nbsp; It must have a purpose, direction and how to frame complex decisions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Similarly, governance at scale is more comfortable and more predictable; governance is about understanding where and how delta might arise and be ready for it. Governance during innovation is precisely the opposite, not easy and highly unpredictable.&nbsp; Using the same word “Governance” in both cases means we lose definition and distinction.</p><p>Using the same word “Governance” at scale and in startup cases means we lose definition and distinction. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> Complexity: Organisational mash-ups <p>Many businesses are mash-ups<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/the-changing-nature-of-business.html"> of previous transformations</a>, plus current evolution. This observation has two ramifications: One, the structure, processes and skills are neither fully aligned to the original model or various constructions of a new model.&nbsp; Two, data shows that as you categorise focus and alignment in the more senior positions, and who have been in post longer, most have a compass or alignment coupled with a mash-up of a previous model. Bluntly they stopped on the evolution path creating a dead end.&nbsp; Senior management who tend to have a closed mindset, rather than an open and continually learning one, tend to fall back on the experience of previous best practices, models and pre-transformational ideals, adding a significant burden to governance for any stage.&nbsp; The concept that there is a direct coupling between innovation and KPI measurement, which makes it harder for corporates to innovate and evolve <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/why-is-innovation-perceived-as-so-much.html">is explored in this article.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All companies have an increasing dependence on ecosystems for their growth and survival.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Ecosystem health</a> is critical for companies at scale for supply chains and customers.&nbsp; Companies who operate at scale and in the linear phase, therefore, are dependent on companies who are in different stages on a planned route to scale. Thus, not only is a scale company dealing with its internal governance and innovation requirements as already noted, but the directors have to understand data from an ecosystem, who is also trying to understand what their data is telling them about their evolution path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Directors have to understand data from an ecosystem, who is also trying to understand what their data is telling them about their evolution path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance is not about best practices and processes at any stage; it is about a mindset of an entire organisation and now ecosystem.&nbsp; When you reflect on it, Directors with governance responsibilities have to cope with data for decisions from chaotic and linear requirements at the same time — equally relying on individuals and teams who have different perceptions both inside and outside of the organisation. Never has <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">data-sharing</a> been more important as a concept, both as a tool or weapon (inaccurate data) in competitive markets. &nbsp; How can a director know that the data they get from their ecosystem can support their decision making and complex judgement?</p> Take Away <p>The S-curve has helped us on several journeys thus far. It supported our understanding of adoption and growth; it can now be critical in helping us understand the development and evolution of <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/what-changes-when-you-consider.html">governance towards a sustainable future</a>.&nbsp; An evolutionary S-curve is more applicable than ever as we enter a new phase of emergence.&nbsp; Our actions and behaviours emerge when we grasp that all parts of our ecosystem interact as a more comprehensive whole.&nbsp;</p><p>A governance S-curve can help us unpack new risks in this dependent ecosystem so that we can make better judgements that lead to better outcomes. What is evident is that we need far more than proof, lineage and provenance of data from a wide ecosystem if we are going to create better judgement environments, we need a new platform. Such a new platform is my focus and why I am working on <a href="https://www.digital20.com/">Digital20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

  <p>This week: Improvements to <code>datasette-ripgrep</code>, <code>github-to-sqlite</code> and <code>datasette-graphql</code>, plus Datasette 0.52 and a flurry of dot-releases.</p>
 datasette-ripgrep 0.5 and 0.6 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ripgrep">datasette-ripgrep</a> (introduced <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/28/datasette-ripgrep/">last week</a>) landed <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25236636">on Hacker News</a>, and the comments there inspired me to build a few new features. The interface looks like this now:</p>
<p><a href="https://ripgrep.datasette.io/-/ripgrep?pattern=client.*cookies%3D&amp;glob=test*.py"></a></p>
<p>I added options for literal searches (as opposed to a regex match) and ignoring case, and a field that lets you filter to just a specific file pattern, for example <code>test*.py</code>.</p>
<p>These are already features of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md">ripgrep</a> so adding them was a case of hooking up the interface and using it to modify the command-line arguments passed to the underlying tool.</p>
 github-to-sqlite workflows 
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> is my command-line tool for importing data from the GitHub API into a SQLite database, for analysis with Datasette.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/releases/tag/2.8">github-to-sqlite 2.8</a> this week  with two new commands: <code>github-to-sqlite pull-requests</code>, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/adamjonas">Adam Jonas</a>, and <code>github-to-sqlite workflows</code>.</p>
<p>The new <code>workflows</code> command can be run against one or more repositories and will fetch their GitHub Actions workflow YAML files, parse them and use them to populate new database tables called <code>workflows</code>, <code>jobs</code> and <code>steps</code>.</p>
<p>If you run workflows across a bunch of different repositories this means you can analyze your workflow usage using SQL!</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github">github-to-sqlite demo</a> now includes workflows from my core Datasette and Dogsheep projects. Some example queries:</p>
 
 My <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/steps?_facet=uses">most commonly used action steps</a> - the top two are <code>actions/checkout@v2</code> and <code>actions/cache@v2</code>. 
 All <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/steps?_facet=uses&amp;uses=actions%2Fcache%40v1">steps using actions/cache@v1</a>, which need to be upgraded to <code>v2</code> (this link will likely soon stop returning any results as I apply those updates). 
 My workflows that <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/workflows?_sort=id&amp;on__contains=workflow_dispatch">use the workflow_dispatch</a> trigger. 
 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/blob/main/github_to_sqlite/utils.py#L787-L858">implementation</a> is a good example of my <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite-utils</a> library in action - I pass the extracted YAML data straight to the <code>.insert(data, alter=True)</code> method which creates the correct table schema automatically, altering it if there are any missing columns.</p>
 datasette-graphql 1.3 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.3">datasette-graphql 1.3</a> has one tiny feature which I find enormously satisfying.</p>
<p>The plugin provides a GraphQL interface to any table in Datasette. The latest versions use the new "table actions" menu (accessible through a cog icon in the page heading) to provide a link to an example query for that table.</p>
<p>I added the example queries in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql/releases/tag/1.3">1.2</a>, but in 1.3 the example has been expanded to include examples of foreign key references. For a table like this one of <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/github/commits">GitHub commits</a> the example query now looks <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/graphql?query=%7B%0A%20%20commits%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20pageInfo%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20hasNextPage%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20endCursor%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sha%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20message%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20author_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20committer_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20raw_author%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20raw_committer%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20repo%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20author%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20login%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20committer%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20login%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D">like this</a>:</p>
  {
  commits {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
    nodes {
      sha
      message
      author_date
      committer_date
      raw_author {
        id
        name
      }
      raw_committer {
        id
        name
      }
      repo {
        id
        name
      }
      author {
        id
        login
      }
      committer {
        id
        login
      }
    }
  }
}  
<p>The new foreign key references include the repo, author and committer fields. The example query now demonstrates the most interesting feature of <code>datasette-graphql</code> - its ability to automatically <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql#accessing-nested-objects">convert foreign key relationships</a> in your database into nested GraphQL fields.</p>
<p>It's a small change, but it makes me really happy.</p>
 Datasette 0.52 
<p>I shipped <a>Datasette 0.52</a>, a relatively minor release which mainly kicked off an effort to rebrand "configuration" as "settings".</p>
<p>I'm doing this as part of my effort to fix Datasette's "metadata" concept. The <code>metadata.json</code> file started out as a way to add metadata - title, description, license and source information. Over time the file expanded to cover things like default facet displays and sort orders... and then when plugins came along it grew to cover plugin configuration as well.</p>
<p>This is really confusing. Editing <code>metadata.json</code> to configure a plugin doesn't make a great deal of sense.</p>
<p>For Datasette 1.0 I want to clean this up. I'm planning on splitting metadata and configuration into separate mechanisms.</p>
<p>There's just one problem: Datasette already has a "configuration" concept in the form of the <code>--config</code> command-line option which can be used to set some very fundamental options for the Datasette server - things like the SQL time limit and the maximum allowed CSV download size.</p>
<p>I want to call plugin configuration settings "configuration", so I've renamed <code>--config</code> to <code>--settings</code> - see the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html">settings documentation</a> for details.</p>
<p>This also gave me the chance to clean up a weird design decision. Datasette's configuration options looked like this:</p>
 <code>datasette data.db --config sql_time_limit_ms:1000
</code> 
<p>The new <code>--setting</code> replacement instead looks like this:</p>
 <code>datasette data.db --setting sql_time_limit_ms 1000
</code> 
<p>Note the lack of a colon here - having an option take two arguments is a perfectly cromulent way of using <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/">Click</a>, but it's one I wasn't aware of when I first released Datasette.</p>
<p>The old <code>--config</code> mechanism continues to work, but it now displays a deprecation warning - it will be removed in Datasette 1.0.</p>
 Datasette dot-releases 
<p>0.52 has already had more dot-releases than any other version of Datasette. These are all pure bug fixes, mostly for obscure bugs that are unlikely to have affected anyone. To summarize the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-52-4">release notes</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-52-1">0.52.1</a> updated the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/testing_plugins.html#testing-plugins">testing plugins documentation</a> to promote <code>datasette.client</code>, fixed a bug with the display of compound foreign keys and improved the locations searched by the <code>datasette --load-module=spatialite</code> shortcut. 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-52-2">0.52.2</a> fixed support for the generated columns feature added in <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_31_1.html">SQLite 3.31.0</a>, fixed a 500 error on <code>OPTIONS</code> requests, added support for &gt;32MB database file downloads on Cloud Run and shipped a CSS fix to the cog menus contributed by Abdussamet Koçak. 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-52-3">0.52.3</a> fixed a fun bug with Datasette installed on Amazon Linux running on ARM where static assets would 404. I eventually <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1124">tracked that down</a> to an unexpected symlink in the site-packages directory. 
 
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-52-4">0.52.4</a> now writes errors logged by Datasette to <code>stderr</code>, not <code>stdout</code>. It also fixes a startup error on Windows, another contribution from Abdussamet Koçak. 
 
 Broken Dogsheep 
<p>My personal <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/">Dogsheep</a> broke this week. I've been running it on an Amazon Lightsail instance, and this week I learned that Lightsail has a <a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-burst-capacity">baseline CPU</a> mechanism which grants your instance burst capacity but shuts it down if it exceeds that capacity too often!</p>
<p>So I'm moving it to a DigitalOcean droplet which won't do that, and trying to figure out enough <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible</a> to completely automate the process.</p>
<p>My ideal server is one that is configured entirely from files in source control, and updates itself by pulling new configuration from that repository. I plan to use <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-pull.html">ansible-pull</a> for this, once I've put together the necessary playbooks.</p>

<p>This year, the IndieWeb community has been making progress on iterating and evolving the IndieAuth protocol. IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables it to work with personal websites and in a decentralized environment.</p>

<p>There are already a good number of IndieAuth providers and apps, including a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and built-in support in <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> and <a href="https://dobrado.net/">Dobrado</a>. Ideally, we'd have even more first-class support for IndieAuth in a variety of different blogging platforms and personal websites, and that's been the goal motivating the spec updates this year. We've been focusing on simplifying the protocol and bringing it more in line with OAuth 2.0 so that it's both easier to understand and also easier to adapt existing OAuth clients and servers to add IndieAuth support.</p>

<p>Most of the changes this year have removed IndieAuth-specific bits to reuse things from OAuth when possible, and cleaning up the text of the spec. These changes are also intended to be backwards compatible as much as possible, so that existing clients and servers can upgrade independently.</p>

<p>This post describes the high level changes to the protocol, and is meant to help implementers get an idea of what may need to be updated with existing implementations.</p>

<p>If you would like an introduction to IndieAuth and OAuth, here are a few resources:</p>

 <a href="https://oauth2simplified.com">OAuth 2.0 Simplified</a>, the book 
 <a href="https://indieauth.net/">indieauth.net</a> 
 

<p>The rest of this post details the specifics of the changes and what they mean to client and server developers. If you've written an IndieAuth client or server, you'll definitely want to read this post to know what you'll need to change for the latest updates.</p>

 <a>Adding PKCE Support</a> 
 <a>Grant Type Parameters</a> 
 <a>Providing "me" in the Token Request</a> 
 <a>Removing Same-Domain Requirement</a> 
 <a>Returning Profile Information</a> 
 <a>Editorial Changes</a> 
 <a>Dropped Features and Text</a> 
 

 Response Type 

<p>The first thing an IndieAuth client does is discover the user's authorization endpoint and redirect the user to their server to authorize the client. There are two possible ways a client might be wanting to use IndieAuth, either to confirm the website of the user who just logged in, or to get an access token to be able to create posts on their website.</p>

<p>Previously, this distinction was made at this stage of the request by varying the <code>response_type</code> query string parameter. Instead, the <code>response_type</code> parameter is now always <code>response_type=code</code> which brings it in line with the OAuth 2.0 specification. This makes sense because the response of this request is always an authorization code, it's only after the authorization code is used that the difference between these two uses will be apparent.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send <code>response_type=code</code> in the initial <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Only accept <code>response_type=code</code> requests, and for backwards-compatible support, treat <code>response_type=id</code> requests as <code>response_type=code</code> requests.</p>

 Indicating the User who is Logging In 

<p>In earlier versions of the specification, the authorization request was required to have the parameter <code>me</code>, the value of which was whatever URL the user entered into the client to start the flow. It turns out that this parameter isn't strictly necessary for the flow to succeed, however it still can help improve the user experience in some cases. As such, it has now been changed to an optional parameter.</p>

<p>This parameter is a way for the client to tell the IndieAuth server which user it expects will log in. For single-user sites this value is completely unnecessary, since there is only ever one <code>me</code> URL that will be returned in the end. It turns out that most single-user implementations were already ignoring this parameter anyway since it served no purpose.</p>

<p>For multi-user websites like a multi-author WordPress blog, this parameter also served little purpose. If a user was already logged in to their WordPress site, then tried to log in to an IndieAuth client, the server could just ignore this parameter anyway and return the logged-in user's <code>me</code> URL at the end of the flow.</p>

<p>For multi-user authorization endpoints like the (to-be deprecated) indieauth.com, this parameter served as a hint of who was trying to log in, so that the authorization server could provide a list of authentication options to the user. This is the only case in which this parameter really provides a user experience benefit, since without the parameter at this stage, the user would need to type in their website again, or be shown a list of authentication provider options such as "log in with Twitter".</p>

<p>There's yet another case where the user may enter just the domain of their website, even though their final <code>me</code> URL may be something more specific. For example, a user can enter <code>micro.blog</code> in an IndieAuth sign-in prompt, and eventually be logged in to that app as <code>https://micro.blog/username</code>. There is no requirement that the thing they type in to clients has to be an exact match of their actual profile URL, which allows a much nicer user experience so that users can type only the domain of their service provider which may provide profiles for multiple users. And in this case, the client providing the <code>me</code> URL to the server also doesn't serve any purpose.</p>

<p>The change to the spec makes the <code>me</code> parameter in the authorization request optional. In this sense, it's more of a hint from the client about who is trying to log in. Obviously the server can't trust that value in the request at this point, since the user hasn't logged in yet, so it really is more of a hint than anything else.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Continue to include the <code>me</code> parameter in the request if you can, but if you are using an OAuth client that doesn't let you customize this request, it's okay to leave it out now.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Most servers were already ignoring this parameter anyway, so if you fell into that category then no change is needed. If you were expecting this parameter to exist, change it to optional, because you probably don't actually need it. If it's present in a request, you can use it to influence the options you show for someone to authenticate if they are not yet logged in, or you could show an error message if the client provides a <code>me</code> URL that doesn't match the currently logged-in user.</p>

 Adding PKCE Support 

<p>Probably the biggest change to the spec is the addition of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) mechanism. This is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that solves a number of different vulnerabilities. It was originally designed to allow mobile apps to securely complete an OAuth flow without a client secret, but has since proven to be useful for JavaScript apps and even solves a particular attack even if the client does have a client secret.</p>

<p>Since IndieAuth clients are all considered "Public Clients" in OAuth terms, there are no preregistered client secrets at all, and PKCE becomes a very useful mechanism to secure the flow.</p>

<p>I won't go into the details of the particular attacks PKCE solves in this post, since I've talked about them a lot in other talks and videos. If you'd like to learn more about this, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/td00HpMI3Q8?t=38">sketch notes video</a> where I talk about PKCE and my coworker draws sketchnotes on his iPad.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, PKCE is a very useful mechanism, isn't terribly complicated to implement, and can be added independently by clients and servers since it's designed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>The change to the spec is that PKCE has been rolled into the core authorization flow. Incidentally, the OAuth spec itself is making the same change by rolling PKCE in to the <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> update.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always include the PKCE parameters <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> in the <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: If a <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in an authorization request, don't allow the authorization code to be used unless the corresponding <code>code_verifier</code> is present in the request using the authorization code. For backwards compatibility, if no <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in the request, make sure the request to use the authorization code does not contain a <code>code_verifier</code>.</p>

 Using an Authorization Code 

<p>Whew, okay, you've made it this far and you've sent the user off to their authorization endpoint to log in. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to your application. Now you're ready to use that authorization code to either get an access token or confirm their <code>me</code> URL.</p>

<p>There are two changes to this step, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">redeeming the authorization code</a>.</p>

 Grant Type Parameters 

<p>The first change, while minor, brings IndieAuth in line with OAuth 2.0 since apparently this hadn't been actually specified before. This request must now contain the POST body parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send the parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> when redeeming an authorization code. Generic OAuth 2.0 clients will already be doing this.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For backwards compatibility, treat the omission of this parameter the same as providing it with <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>. For example if you also accept requests with <code>grant_type=refresh_token</code>, the absence of this parameter means the client is doing an authorization code grant.</p>

 Providing "me" in the Token Request 

<p>The request when using an authorization code, either to the token endpoint or authorization endpoint, previously required that the client send the <code>me</code> parameter as well. The change to the spec drops this parameter from this request, making it the same as an OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>This has only some minor implications in very specific scenarios. We analyzed all the known IndieAuth implementations and found that the vast majority of them were already ignoring this parameter anyway. For single-user endpoints, the additional parameter provides no value, since the endpoint would be self-contained anyway, and already know how to validate authorization codes. Even multi-user endpoints like the WordPress plugin would know how to validate authorization codes because the authorization and token endpoints are part of the same software.</p>

<p>The only implementations leaving this parameter out would break are separate implementations of authorization endpoints and token endpoints, where the user has no prior relationship with either. The biggest offender of this is actually my own implementation which I am eventually going to retire, indieauth.com and tokens.indieauth.com. I initially wrote indieauth.com as just the authorization endpoint part, and later added tokens.indieauth.com as a completely separate implementation, it shares nothing in common with indieauth.com and is actually entirely stateless. Over the years, it turns out this pattern hasn't actually been particularly useful, since a website is either going to build both endpoints or delegate both to an external service. So in practice, the only people using tokens.indieauth.com were using it with the indieauth.com authorization endpoint.</p>

<p>Removing this parameter has no effect on most of the implementations. I did have to update my own implementation of tokens.indieauth.com to default to verifying authorization codes at indieauth.com if there was no <code>me</code> parameter, which so far has been sccessful.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: No need to send the <code>me</code> parameter when exchanging an authorization code. This makes the request the same as a generic OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For servers that have an authorization endpoint and token endpoint as part of the same software, make sure your token endpoint knows how to look up authorization codes. Most of the time this is likely what you're already doing anyway, and you were probably ignoring the <code>me</code> parameter already. If you do want to provide a standalone token endpoint, you'll need to create your own encoding scheme to bake in the authorization endpoint or <code>me</code> value into the authorization code itself. But for the vast majority of people this will require no change.</p>

 Removing Same-Domain Requirement 

<p>One of the challenges of a decentralized protocol like this is knowing who to trust to make assertions about who. Just because someone's authorization server claims that a user identified as "https://aaronpk.com/" logged in doesn't mean I actually did log in. Only my authorization server should be trusted to assert that I logged in.</p>

<p>In the previous version of the spec, the way this was enforced was that clients had to check that the final <code>me</code> URL returned had a matching domain as what the user initially entered, after following redirects. That means if I entered <code>aaronpk.com</code> into the client, and that redirected to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/</code>, the client would then expect the final profile URL returned at the end to also be on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>. This works, but it has a few challenges and limitations.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for client developers was keeping track of the chain of redirects. There were actually separate rules for temporary vs permanent redirects, and the client would have to be aware of each step in the redirect chain if there was more than one. Then at the end, the client would have to parse the final profile URL to find the host component, then check if that matches, and it turns out that there are often some pretty <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/395845">low</a>-level <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/305974">bugs</a> with <a href="https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8624.html">parsing</a> URLs in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31429439/parsing-an-url-without-a-path-but-with-a-slash-in-the-query">variety</a> of languages that can lead to unexpected security flaws.</p>

<p>On top of the technical challenges for client developers, there was another problem in the specific case where a user may control only a subfolder of a domain. For example in a shared hosting environment where users can upload arbitrary files to their user directory, <code>https://example.com/~user</code>, the same-domain restriction would still let <code>/~user1</code> claim to be <code>/~user2</code> on that domain. We didn't want to go down the route of adding more URL parsing rules like checking for substring matches, as that would likely have led to even more of a burden on client developers and more risk of security holes.</p>

<p>So instead, this entire restriction has been replaced with a new way of verifying that the final profile URL is legitimate. The new rule should drastically simplify the client code, at the slight cost of a possible additional HTTP request.</p>

<p>The new rule is that if the final profile URL returned by the authorization endpoint is not an exact match of the initially entered URL, the client has to go discover the authorization endpoint at the new URL and verify that it matches the authorization endpoint it used for the flow. This is described in a new section of the spec, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>This change means clients no longer need to keep track of the full redirect chain (although they still can if they would like more opportunities to possibly skip that last HTTP request), and also ensures users on shared domains can't impersonate other users on that domain.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Remove any code around parsing the initial and final URLs, and add a new step after receiving the user's final profile URL: If the final profile URL doesn't match exactly what was used to start the flow, then go fetch that URL and discover the authorization endpoint and confirm that the discovered authorization endpoint matches the one used at the beginning. Please read <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: No change.</p>

 Returning Profile Information 

<p>If the application would like to know more about the user than just their confirmed profile URL, such as their name or photo, previously there was no easy or reliable way to find this information. It's possible the user's profile URL may have an <code>h-card</code> with their info, but that would only include public info and would require bringing in a Microformats parser and making another HTTP request to find this information.</p>

<p>In the latest version of the spec, we've added a <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information">new section</a> returned in the response when redeeming an authorization code for the authorization server to return this profile data directly. To request this information, there are now two scopes defined in the spec, <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code>. When the client requests the <code>profile</code> scope, this indicates the client would like the server to return the user's <code>name</code>, <code>photo</code> and <code>url</code>. The <code>email</code> scope requests the user's email address.</p>

<p>The response when redeeming an authorization code that was issued with these scopes will now contain an additional property, <code>profile</code>, alongside the <code>me</code> URL and access token.</p>

 <code>{
  "access_token": "XXXXXX",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "profile email create",
  "me": "https://user.example.net/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "Example User",
    "url": "https://user.example.net/",
    "photo": "https://user.example.net/photo.jpg",
    "email": "user@example.net"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This comes with some caveats. As is always the case with OAuth, just because a client requests certain scopes does not guarantee the request will be granted. The user or the authorization server may decide to not honor the request and leave this information out. For example a user may choose to not share their email even if the app requests it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the information in this <code>profile</code> section is not guaranteed to be "real" or "verified" in any way. It is merely information that the user intends to share with the app. This means everything from the user sharing different email addresses with different apps, or the URL in the profile being a completely different website. For example a multi-author WordPress blog which provides <code>me</code> URLs on the WordPress site's domain, <code>example.com</code>, may return the author's own personal website in the <code>url</code> property of the profile information. The client is not allowed to treat this information as authoritative or many any policy decisions based on the profile information, it's for informational purposes only. Another common vulnerability in many existing OAuth clients is that they assume the provider has confirmed the email address returned and will use that to deduplicate accounts. This has the problem of if a user can edit their email address and have it returned in an OAuth response without the server confirming it, the client may end up being tricked into thinking a different user logged in. Only the <code>me</code> URL is the one that can be trusted as the stable identifier of the user, and everything in the <code>profile</code> section should be treated as if it were hand-entered into the client.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: If you would like to find the user's profile information, include the <code>profile</code> or <code>email</code> scope in your authorization request. If you don't need this, then no changes are necessary.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Authorization servers should be able to recognize the <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code> scopes in a request, and ask the user for permission to share their profile information with clients, then return that along with the final <code>me</code> URL and access token. It's also completely acceptable to not support this feature at all, as clients shouldn't be relying on the presence of this information in the response anyway.</p>

 Editorial Changes 

<p>There was a good amount of work done to clean up the text of the spec without changing any of the actual requirements. These are known as editorial changes.</p>

<p>The term "domain" has been replaced with the more accurate term "host" in most places. This matches the URL spec more closely, and reduces the confusion around registerable domain like <code>example.com</code> or <code>example.co.uk</code> and subdomains. In all cases, there has been no need to use the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a> because we have always meant full hostname matches.</p>

<p>Language around the term "profile URL" was cleaned up to make sure only the final URL returned by the authorization server is referred to as the "profile URL". The user may enter lots of different things into the client that might not be their profile URL, anything from just a hostname (<code>aaronpk.com</code>) to a URL that redirects to their profile URL. This cleans up the language to better clarify what we mean by "profile URL".</p>

<p>With the change to use <code>response_type=code</code> for both versions of the flow, it meant the authorization and authentication sections were almost entirely duplicate content. These have been consolidated into a single section, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization">Authorization</a>, and the only difference now is the response when the authorization code is redeemed.</p>

 Dropped Features and Text 

<p>Any time you can cut text from a spec and have it mean the same thing is a good thing. Thankfully we were able to cut a decent amount of text thanks to consolidating the two sections mentioned above. We also dropped an obscure feature that was extremely under-utilized. For the case where a token endpoint and authorization endpoint were not part of the same software, there was a section describing how those two could communicate so that the token endpoint could validate authorization codes issued by an arbitrary authorization endpoint. This serves no purpose if a single piece of software provided both endpoints since it would be far more efficient to have the token endpoint look up the authorization code in the database or however you're storing them, so virtually nobody had even bothered to implement this.</p>

<p>The only known implementations of this feature were my own <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code>, and Martijn's <code>mintoken</code> project. <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/44">We both agreed</a> that if we did want to pursue this feature in the future, we could write it up as an extension. Personally I plan on shutting down <code>indieauth.com</code> and <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code> in the near-ish future anyway, and the replacement that I build will contain both endpoints anyway, so I don't really plan on revisiting this topic anyway.</p>

 Conclusion / Future Work 

<p>Well if you've made it this far, congrats! I hope this post was helpful. This was definitely a good amount of changes, although hopefully all for good reasons and should simplify the process of developing IndieAuth clients and servers in the future.</p>

<p>We didn't get to every open IndieAuth issue in this round of updates, there are still a few interesting ones open that I would like to see addressed. The next largest change that will affect implementations would be to continue to bring this in line with OAuth 2.0 and always <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58">redeem the authorization code at the token endpoint</a> even if no access token is expected to be returned. That would also have the added benefit of simplifying the authorization endpoint implementation to only need to worry about providing the authorization UI, leaving all the JSON responses to the token endpoint. This still requires some discussion and a plan for upgrading to this new model, so feel free to chime in on the discussions!</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thank-you to everyone who has participated in the discussions this year, both on GitHub and in our virtual meetings! All the feedback from everyone who is interested in the spec has been extremely valuable!</p>

<p>We'll likely schedule some more sessions to continue development on the spec, so keep an eye on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indieauth">events.indieweb.org</a> for upcoming events tagged #indieauth!</p>

<p>This article takes the mental models of identity and explores how they can be achieved with a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution.</p><p>To pin down the meaning and definition of identity is a challenging task due to its uniquely human nature. It can have totally different meanings for different people. However, there are reoccurring themes when speaking about the term. The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment leveraging SSI infrastructure and components. While the concept of SSI can be applied for individuals, legal entities and things alike, the following paragraph solely focuses on individuals and explains how these models can serve as a guideline for SSI implementations. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted in the following paragraphs.</p>Mental models of identity. Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> Space-time <p>“The space-time mental model sees identity as resolving the question of the physical continuity of an entity through space and time. (…) It answers the question: Does the physical body under evaluation have a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity?”</p><p>An identity is established in the past, it acts in the present and continues to be useful in the future. To secure the sum of recorded interactions and relationships in digital form one requires a backup when using a wallet, which stores the identity data and their associated cryptographic keys locally on the device of the user. This backup enables the user to restore the received credentials as well as established relationships. When losing access to the wallet, the backup enables the user to reestablish the aspects described in the space-time mental model. A backup generally consists of the identity data itself and a key, which is used to en- and decrypt the backup&nbsp;data.</p> Presentation <p>“The presentation mental model sees identity as how we present ourselves to society. This is the mental model behind Vendor Relationship Management, user-centric identity, and self-sovereign identity. (…) It answers the question: Is this how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known?”</p><p>Individuals can choose, which information about them should be known by third parties or the public. The granularity of this information varies dependent on the social context. While one might only want to provide the required minimum of information to a government authority, one might have the desire to share very personal details with a certain social circle such as family or friends. Hence, the user requires different social profiles and circles, which help to present the right information to the target audience. Since one part of a SSI ecosystem is the creation of trusted peer to peer relationships, these contacts can be sorted by the user and allocated to a social circle according to the preferences of the individual.</p><p>However, when it comes to the sharing of information it gets tricky. There are currently no SSI implementations with enable a user-experience similar to current social media platforms. Hence, the presentation of information is currently limited to one contact at a&nbsp;time.</p> Attribute <p>“The attribute mental model sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity as recorded in a specific system. Enshrined in ISO/IEC 24760–1, an international standard for identity management, this mental model is the primary focus for many engineers. (…) It answers the question: Who is this data&nbsp;about?”</p><p>From a birth certificate to a university degree or a language certification, we collect a variety of credentials, which attest certain information about us. The sum of all these credentials can also be seen as one mental model of identity. These credentials are issued, stored and managed by the individual and are standardized within the specification of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials data model 1.0 by the W3C</a>. It is the only mental model with a formal specification.</p><p>SSI implementations use cryptography to provide the necessary proofs that presented information is about the individual in question. There are different options of implementations to ensure that a certain identifier relates to the specific person, however most implementations use decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to identify the identity&nbsp;subject.</p> Relationship <p>“The relationship mental model sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others. Our identity is not about what we are in isolation from others, but is rather defined by the relationships we have. This is the fundamental model in the South African idea of ‘Ubuntu’, meaning ‘I am because we are.’ (…) It answers the question: How is this person related?”</p><p>The relationship to other individuals or entities can help to determine the status of a person within society. We can observe different domains of relationships, which depend on the social context like a professional, official, legal, personal, public, business or employment context to name a few. For example a representative of a government like a diplomat has special rights and obligations due to this relationship. Depended on the context, e.g. an interview of said diplomat, it can touch multiple domains by being an official interview, with legal consequences, which is presented to the public and can have a direct effect on the employment relation for the diplomat. Generally, individuals initiate and maintain hundreds or even thousands of relationships to different entities. An SSI solution enables an individual to initiate this relationship by accepting or requesting a connection. Once established this connection serves as communication channel to facilitate the exchange of (verified) information between the two parties. Since both parties are able to validate the identity of the other party it enables the necessary trust in a digital environment. However, a the establishment of a connection isn’t necessary and credentials can also be issued or requested without one. There are special protocols, which standardise the credential exchange and communication between two entities like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DiDcomm protocol</a>.</p> Capability <p>“The capability mental model pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, including their physical ability now, in the past, or in the future. It is the inevitable approach for anyone in an emergency. (…) It answers the question: What can the subject actually&nbsp;do?”</p><p>The primary reason why an identity is required in the online world in the first place are the capabilities that come with it. Without an identity one is still able to browse the web and gather information, however when it comes to online shopping, banking, government applications, employee portals, access control and many other aspects, an identity is necessary to execute those actions. Not all actions require a verified identity. In most cases a self-attested identity is sufficient for the verifier. However, there are multiple cases for which the verifier either has a legitimate interest for only allowing access to verified parties or is obligated by law to verify the identity of an individual. An example for the first case can be access to information for a specific audience like a university, which wants to grant students access to internal documents. The students would not be required to verify their identity every time they want to access the repository, but instead only need to prove that they are a student of said university, without disclosing further personal details. The second case includes telecommunication providers, or financial institutions, which need to comply with know your costumer (KYC) regulations.</p> Mindmap of the mental models enabled by&nbsp;SSI Mindmap: Mental models of identity enabled by SSI.

Source: SSI Ambassador / Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>To conclude it can be said, that all mental models of SSI can be enabled to a certain degree, however when it comes to the space-time (backup) mental model or the presentation (social network) model, we also see that the integration of the concept is quite nascent and requires more development to be comparable with current centralised alternatives.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>, I introduced the role that Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) can play in the internet of things (IoT). The self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT) relies on the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">DID-based relationships</a> that SSI provides, and their support for standardized <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">protocols running over DIDComm</a>, to create an internet of things that is much richer, secure, and privacy respecting than the  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>  we're being offered today.  In this post, I extend the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">use cases I offered in the previous post</a> and discuss the role the heterarchical relationships found in the SSIoT play. 
</p>

<p>
    For this post, we're going to focus on Alice's relationship with her F-150 truck and its relationships with other entities. Why a vehicle? Because in 2013 and 2014 I built a commercial <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">connected car product called Fuse</a> that used the relationship-centric model I'm discussing here1. In addition, vehicles exist in a rich, complicated ecosystem that offers many opportunities for interesting relationships. Figure 1 shows some of these. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Vehicle relationships (click to enlarge)


<p>
   The most important relationship that a car has is with its owner. But there's more than one owner over the car's lifetime. At the beginning of its life, the car's owner is the manufacturer. Later the car is owned by the dealership, and then by a person or finance company. And, of course, cars are frequently resold. Over the course of its lifetime a car will have many owners. Consequently, the car's agent must be smart enough to handle these changes in ownership and the resulting changes in authorizations. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the owner, the car has relationships with other people: drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The nature of relationships change over time. For example, the car probably needs to maintain a relationship with the manufacturer and dealer even after they are no longer owners. With these changes to the relationship come changes in rights and responsibilities. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to relationships with owners, cars also have relationships with other players in the vehicle ecosystem including: mechanics, gas stations, insurance companies, finance companies, and government agencies. Vehicles exchange data and money with these players over time.  And the car might have relationships with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/02/10-4_good_buddy_vehicle_to_vehicle_communication.shtml">other vehicles</a>, traffic signals, the roadway, and even <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">potholes</a>.
</p>

<p>The following sections discuss three scenarios involvoing Alice, the truck, and other people, institutions, and things.
</p>

<a></a>
 Multiple Owners 
<p>
    One of the relationship types that the CompuServe of Things fails to handle well is multiple owners. Some companies try and others just ignore it. The problem is that when the service provider intermediates the connection to the thing, they have to account for multiple owners and allow those relationships to change over time. For a high-value product, the engineering effort is justified, but for many others, it simple doesn't happen. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Multiple Owners (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the relationships of two owners, Alice and Bob, with the truck. The diagram is simple and hides some of the complexity of the truck dealing with multiple owners. But as I discuss in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/10/fuse_with_two_owners.shtml">Fuse with Two Owners</a> some of this is simply ensuring that developers don't assume a single owner when they develop services. The infrastructure for supporting it is built into DIDComm, including standardized support for sub protocols like <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">Introduction</a>.
</p>

<a></a>
 Lending the Truck 

<p>
    People lend things to friends and neighbors all the time. And people rent things out. Platforms like AirBnB and Outdoorsy are built to support this for high value rentals. But what if we could do it for anything at any time without an intermediating platform? Figure 3 shows the relationships between Alice and her friend Carol who wants to borrow the truck.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Borrowing the Truck (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Like the multiple owner scenario, Alice would first have a connection with Carol and introduce her to the truck using the Introduction sub protocol. The introduction would give the truck permission to connect to Carol and also tell the truck's agent what protocols to expose to Carol's agent. Alice would also set the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#lifespan">relationship's longevity</a>. The specific permissions that the "borrower" relationship enables depend, of course, on the nature of the thing. 
</p>

<p>
    The data that the truck stores for different activities is dependent on these relationships. For example, the owner is entitled to know everything, including trips. But someone who borrows the car should be able to see their trips, but not those of other drivers. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">Relationships dictate the interactions</a>. Of course, a truck is a very complicated thing in a complicated ecosystem. Simpler things, like a shovel might simply be keeping track of who has the thing and where it is. But, as we saw in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#vrm">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>, there is value in having the thing itself keep track of its interactions, location, and status. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Selling the Truck 
<p>
    Selling the vehicle is more complicated than the previous scenarios. In 2012, we prototyped this scenario for Swift's Innotribe innovations group and presented it at Sibos. Heather Vescent of <a href="https://thepurpletornado.com/">Purple Tornado</a> created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzsqtdx40qg&amp;feature=emb_logo">video that visualizes how a sale of a motorcycle might happen</a> in a heterarchical DIDComm environment2.  You can see a <a href="https://vimeo.com/51827693">screencast of the prototype in operation here</a>. One important goal of the prototype was to support <a href="https://www.searls.com/">Doc Searls's</a> vision of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">Intention Economy</a>. In what follows, I've left out some of the details of what we built. You can find the complete write-up in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/06/buying_a_motorcycle_a_vrm_scenario_using_personal_clouds.shtml">Buying a Motorcycle: A VRM Scenario using Personal Clouds</a>. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 4: Selling the Truck (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In Figure 4, Alice is selling the truck to Doug. I'm ignoring how Alice and Doug got connected3 and am just focusing on the sale itself. To complete the transaction, Alice and Doug create a relationship. They both have relationships with their respective credit unions where Doug initiates and Alice confirms the transaction. At the same time, Alice has introduced the truck to Doug as the new owner. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, Doug, and the truck are all connected to the DMV and use these relationships to transfer the title. Doug can use his agent to register the truck and get plates. Doug also has a relationship with his insurance company. He introduces the truck to the insurance company so it can serve as the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#vrm">service intermediary</a> for the policy issuance. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice is no longer the owner, but the truck knows things about her that Doug shouldn't have access to and she wants to maintain. We can create a digital twin of the truck that is no long attached to the physical device, but has a copy of all the trip and maintenance information that Alice had co-created with the truck over the years she owned it. This digital twin has all the same functionality for accessing this data that the truck did. At the same time, Alice and Doug can negotiate what data also stays on the truck. Doug likely doesn't care about her trips and fuel purchases, but might want the maintenance data. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Implementation 

<p>
    A few notes on implementation:
</p>
 
     
        The relationships posited in these use cases are all <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">DIDComm-capable relationships</a>. 
     
     
        The workflows in these scenarios use DIDComm messaging to communicate. I pointed out several places where the Introduction DIDComm protocol might be used. But there might be other DIDComm protocols defined. For example, we could imagine workflow-specific messages for the scenario where Carol borrows the truck. The scenario where Doug buys the truck is rife with possibilities for protocols on DIDComm that would standardize many of the interactions. Standardizing these workflows through protocol (e.g., a common protocol for vehicle registration) reduces the effort for participants in the ecosystem. 
     
     
        Some features, like attenuated permissions on channel are a mix of capabilities. DIDComm supports a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0031-discover-features">Discovery</a> protocol that allows Alice, say, to determine if Doug is open to engaging in a sale transaction. Other permissioning would be done by the agent outside the messaging system.
     
     
        The agents I'm envisioning here are smart, rule-executing agents like those available in <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">picos</a>. Picos provide a powerful model for how a decentralized, heterarchical, interoperable internet of things can be built. <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico">Picos provide an DIDComm agent programming platform</a> that is easily extensible. Picos live on an open-source pico engine that can run on anything that supports Node JS. They have been used to build and deploy several production systems, including the Fuse connected-car system discussed above.
     
 

<a></a>
 Conclusion 

<p>
    DIDComm-capable agents can be used to create a sophisticated relationship network that includes people, institutions, things and even soft artifacts like interaction logs. The relationships in that network are rich and varied—just like relationships in the real world. Things, whether they are capable of running their own agents or employ a soft agent as a digital twin, are much more useful when they exist persistently, control their own agent and digital wallet, and can act independently. Things now react and respond to messages from others in the relationship network as they autonomously follow their specific rules. 
</p>

<p>
    Everything I've discussed here and in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">previous post</a> are doable now. By removing the intermediating administrative systems that make up the CompuServe of Things and moving to a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture we can unlock the tremendous potential of the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things. 
</p>

 Notes 

 
     Before Fuse, we'd built a more generalized IoT system based on a relationship network called <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/squaretag.shtml">SquareTag</a>. SquareTag was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/05/using_products_to_build_customer_relationships.shtml">social product platform</a> (using the vernacular of the day) that promised to help companies have a relationship with their customers through the product, rather than merely having information about them. My company, Kynetx, and others, including Drummond Reed, were working to introduce something we called <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/">"personal clouds"</a> that were arrayed in a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/05/moving_toward_a_relationship_network.shtml">relationship network</a>.  We built this on a actor-like programming model called <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">"picos"</a>. The pico engine and programming environment are still available and have been updated to provide DID-based relationships and support for DIDComm. 
     
     In 2012, DIDComm didn't exist of course. We were envisioning something that Innotribe called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98RYtKQaWcA">Digital Asset Grid (DAG)</a> and speaking about "personal clouds" but the envisioned operation of the DAG was very much like what exists now in the DIDComm-enabled peer-to-peer network enabled by DIDs.
     
     In the intentcasting prototype, Alice and Doug would have found each other through a system that matches Alice's intent to buy with Doug's intent to sell. But a simpler scenario would have Alice tell the truck to list itself on Craig's List so Alice and Doug can meet up there.

As already explored we move from principles to rules but rarely go back to rethink our principles, principally because of the time.&nbsp; Rules should refine and improve in real-time,&nbsp; principles are generational.&nbsp; However to create and refine rules we use and apply a risk framework.&nbsp; The risk framework identifies risk and to help us manage it, we create rules that are capable of ensuring we get the right data/ information to be able to determine if we have control over risk. &nbsp; As humans, we are not experts in always forecasting the unimagined and so when we implement rules things break and clever minds think how to bend, break or avoid them.&nbsp; To that end we create more rules to manage exceptions.&nbsp; However, occasionally we need to check that our rules are aligned to our principles and indeed go back and check and refine our principles.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Starting from “Principles” these are anchored in ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity">Human Dignity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity_(European_Union)">Subsidiarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity">Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_theology">Covenantal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">The common good</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship">Stewardship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Equality">Equality</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we decide that one or more of these should anchor our principles and form a north star, a direction to travel in and towards. The reason to agree on the Principle(s) is that collectively we agree on a commitment to get to a better place. We state our principles as an ambition, goal, target with allow us to understand, manage and control uncertainty using a risk framework. The risk framework frame or bounds the risk we are prepared to take.&nbsp; The risk framework enables us to define rules that get to our known outcomes.&nbsp; We implement the rules to create controls using regulation, code and standards. Our risk frameworks use tools to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on the risk, the delta in risk and compliance with the rules.&nbsp; Whilst all is good we use the risk framework to create more rules and better framing and boundaries, creating better outcomes.&nbsp; However, when the desired outcomes are not being created we revert to the principles, check our north star and take our new knowledge to refine/ redefine the risk we are prepared to take.</p> Data introduces new Principle problems!&nbsp; <p>Having established this framework, the idea is to apply this to data.&nbsp; We have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve with data.&nbsp; However, we don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework for data at any level, individual, company, society, national or global.&nbsp; This is not a bill of rights, this is “what do we think is the north star for data and on what principle should data be?”&nbsp; How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><p>“what do we think is the north star for data and on what principle should data be?”&nbsp; How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><p>The question is how do our principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes, the world we designed for was physical; it is now digital-first. Now we are becoming aware that the fabric has changed, where next? &nbsp; By example, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis </a>is the legal system and database.&nbsp; With a case in mind, you use this tool to uncover previous judgments and specific cases to determine and inform your thinking.&nbsp; However, this database is built on humans and physical first.&nbsp; Any digital judgements in this database are still predicated on the old frameworks, what is its value when the very fabric of all those judgements changes.&nbsp; Do we use it to slow us down and prevent adoption?&nbsp; Time to unpack this</p><p>Physical-world first (framed as AD 00 to 2010)</p><p>Classic thinking (western capital civilisation philosophy) defined values and principles which have created policy, norms and rules.&nbsp; Today’s policy is governed by people and processes. We have history to provide visibility over time and can call on millennia of thought, thinking and wisdom.&nbsp; Depending on what is trending/ leading as a philosophy we create norms.&nbsp; In a physical and human first world, we have multi-starting positioning. We can start with a market, followed by norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture - creating law and regulations&nbsp; OR we can start with norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture, followed by market-creating law.&nbsp;</p><p>Without our common and accepted belief our physical world would not work. Law, money, rights are not real, they are command and control schema with shared beliefs.&nbsp; Our created norms are based on our experience with the belief.&nbsp; We cope by managing our appetite to risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital world first (frame as AD 2020 - AD MMMCCX )</p><p>People-in-companies rather than people-in-government form the new norms as companies have the capital to include how to avoid the rules and regulations.&nbsp; The best companies are forming new rules to suit them. Companies have the users to mould the norms with the use of their data. Behaviour can be directed. Companies set their own rules.&nbsp; Doctrine/architecture creates the market, forming norms, and the law protects those who control the market.&nbsp; Policy can create rules but it has no idea how rules are implemented or governed as the companies make it complex and hide the data. There are few signs of visible “core” human values, indeed there are no shared and visible data principles.&nbsp; We are heading to the unknown and unimagined.</p><p>The companies automate, the decisions become automated, the machine defines the rules and changes the risk model. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined as we have no data principles.</p><p>By example. Our news and media have changed models. The editor crafted control to meet the demand of an audience were willing to pay to have orchestrated content that they liked.&nbsp; As advertising became important, content mirrored advertising preferences and editorial became the advertising and advertising the content.&nbsp; Digital created clicks that drove a new model to anything that drives clicks works.&nbsp; The fabric changed from physical to digital and in doing so we lost the principles and rules of the physical first world to a digital-first world that has not yet agreed on principles for data.&nbsp;</p> Data is data <p>This article<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2019/01/data-is-data-it-is-not-oil-or-gold-or.html"> Data is Data</a> explores what data is and is my reference to define data.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine looking at this framework of “principles, rules and risk” within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity.&nbsp; How would say their data and privacy be presented?</p><p>With data (privacy, protection, use, collection) we have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve.&nbsp; We appear to be missing an agreed risk framework for individuals, company’s, societies (national &amp;global)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The stated <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">GDPR principles are</a> set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a>:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.</p>  <p>Purpose limitation.</p>  <p>Data minimisation.</p>  <p>Accuracy.</p>  <p>Storage limitation.</p>  <p>Integrity and confidentiality (security)</p>  <p>Accountability.</p>  <p>We know they are called “Principles” by the framing of the heading in Article 5, however, if we read them slowly are these principles, values or rules? Consider are these boundaries, stewardship ideals or a bit of a mashup. &nbsp; By example to get round “Purpose Limitation,” terms and conditions&nbsp; become as wide as possible so that all and or any use is possible.&nbsp; Data minimisation is only possible if you know the data you want, which is rarely the case if you are a data platform. &nbsp; If a principle of The European Union is to ensure the free “movement / mobility” of people, goods, services and capital within the Union (the ‘four freedoms’), does data identity ideals and GDPR align?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the issue about the “regulation of” Big Tech, in general should they exist, as <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">no one entity should have that much power</a> and control over people’s data and ability to transact? So the framings that accepts them as acceptable, won’t create rules that actually moves towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is.&nbsp; If we add in open API’s and the increasing level of <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">data mobility, portability and sharing</a> whose “rules or principles” should be adopted?</p><p>How do your principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework, say in the US today, is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s&nbsp; and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket.&nbsp; Alas, IMHO, GDPR is not a lot better than rules with no truly human based core principles.</p> Conclusion <p>We appear to have outdated “principles” driving rules in a digital-first world.&nbsp;</p><p>Our commercial world is now dominated by companies setting “their” norms without reference to any widely agreed-upon values. The down side of big tech gaining so much power that they are actually seen by people-in-government as “equivalent to nation-states” is telling.&nbsp; Right now we need historians, anthropologists, ontologists, psychologists, data scientists and regular everyday people who are the users to be able to close the loop between the rules we have, the risk frameworks we manage and the principles that we should be aiming for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Take Away</p>  <p>How are we checking the rules we have are aligned to our principles?</p>  <p>How are we checking our principles?</p>  <p>Is our risk framework able to adapt to new principles and changes to rules?</p>  <p>How do we test the rules that define and constrain can create better outcomes?</p>

Incorrect being there is a more precise or accurate word in the context or situation but we chose the word we do so as to create ambiguity, to avoid controversy, to soften the message and because of naivety.&nbsp; We know that words and our language itself are filled with convenient generalisations that help us to explain ourselves whilst at the same time avoid the controversy created by unique circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Principles and Rules article, the choice of the word rule was ambitious. This allows readers to apply their own context to it, thereby creating more relevance to their own circumstances when reading.&nbsp; It was not a legal contract scenario, writing definitions at the beginning to provide that level of clarity and common interpretation.&nbsp;</p><p>So in the idea was ambiguity - this post, however, is to expand an ontology of the word “rules.”</p><p>For me, you or someone;</p>  <p>Rules are written or unwritten or both</p>  <p>Rules are mine, created by me that you need to follow. They are yours, crafted by you that you need me to obey. They are shared and we believe that they create a better society</p>  <p>Rules can be the law, just a guide, the standard you need to meet or the rituals that creates success.&nbsp; But which law, they one we should not break or the one where we follow the spirit?&nbsp; As a guide to guide me from here to where.&nbsp; As a standard is that absolute or is a range good enough.&nbsp; My rituals, did I learn them, did you teach me or somehow are they just there?</p>  <p>Rules equally give you more freedom (safety, less murder) and remove your freedom (choice). Rules give me more agency and at the same time remove it.</p>  <p>Rules define my boundaries but are the ones I have created for myself and I have continually refined them as I learn, or are my rules ones that come from history; because we have always done it this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rules are they creating my view on values or are the rules I have someone else’s values?</p>  <p>Rules are only there to be broken</p>  <p>Rules allow me to create something as I have done something, have experience and have learnt. Rules allow me to repeat and not make the same mistake or improve and adapt.&nbsp; Rules save me time and energy - I love my huristics</p>  <p>Rules allow me to manage, prevent and control risk</p>  <p>But whose rules are they?</p>  <br><p>The takeaway</p><p>When our principles become rules, do we question either the rules or principles enough?</p> <br>

<p>When I got to Milano, I thought: How did they know? This feels just like a post-apocalyptic film. But how did the directors know this is how it feels? It’s not that surprising, of course. Cities have gone through wars and pestilence since the existence of&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Milano after the plague, or not after the plague. Certainly the worst of it hasn’t happened yet. We are in the middle of it. Maybe just the beginning of it. Whatever it&nbsp;is.</p><p>I remember a warm data workshop with Nora Bates. She said: The disaster has already struck. It just hasn’t struck everyone&nbsp;yet.</p>Empty office buildings in&nbsp;Milan<p>When I left Ljubljana, why did I leave Ljubljana? Numbers were rising. Measures were tightening. Will I be able to get to Spain? Will I be able to get back? Maybe with my Slovenian plates nobody will stop&nbsp;me.</p><p>In Milan I sat with one of my father’s best friends in a rooftop restaurant in the outdoor seating. They took our temperatures before we got on the elevator. I can’t visit my father but at least his friend lives within driving distance of&nbsp;me.</p><p>Four hours is a long way to go out of one’s way for a meal and Milan doesn’t seem so advisable, but who knows when we will get to see our loved ones again? She gets me an AirBnB because hotels make me choke with the poisonous sanitizer they use to cleanse the&nbsp;air.</p><p>We have dinner. I tell her it’s hard to speak to Americans about what’s happening in the States. She says “Whenever I bring it up, your father says ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’.”. I don’t want to talk about it either, but it’s all I ever talk about. I’m American, or at least that’s what one of my passports says. My residency permit says Slovenia. It’s my only hope of staying out of a red zone at this point. Red zone. I’m not worried about disease. Civil war is another&nbsp;thing.</p><p>The laundry place wouldn’t take my underwear or socks. If I want laundry done, I have to do it myself, they said. I don’t know if that’s because of the pandemic or a Milanese tradition. At a little coastal town two hours East, the proprietor of the self-service laundromat did my laundry for me at no extra&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This is my first post on the <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/blog/">Sufficiency Currency blog</a>. It’s about the wisdom of taking a road trip in Europe in the middle of a pandemic. At the beginning of the collapse of civilization. In a bizarre moment of suspension, where things seem to be going on as usual; waiting for the other shoe to drop. America is in the throes of a civil war and California has no air and we’re sharing TikTok videos and Instagram sunsets. Everyone knows the economy’s dead, but we’re working and shopping and paying rent as if nothing happened, like we’re under hypnosis.</p><p>Or a psychedelic trip. One big global psychedelic trip, and not the good&nbsp;kind.</p>Who is that masked&nbsp;man?<p>Zipping along the highway in a rental car in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad Trip. That doesn’t sound very&nbsp;wise.</p><p>At one of the ecovillages, they make their own toothpaste. It’s not really toothpaste; it’s a kind of a powder. I asked one of the volunteers how to use the tooth powder. I knew the answer, but I was hoping I was wrong. She said: we just dip our toothbrushes into the jar. I don’t need a pandemic to know that dipping my toothbrush in the communal jar of tooth-powder is a bad idea. I brought my own toothpaste, like a civilized person. I brought the biological kind so they can’t complain.</p><p>As I drive my car along the Riviera, I see it out of the corner of my eye, for a brief second between tunnels, the dark blue sign with the circle of stars around the word France. If I hadn’t been paying attention, I wouldn’t have noticed. OK Google doesn’t say “Welcome to France.” When you cross between states in the US, Google tells you “Welcome to New Jersey.” In Europe, no such thing. OK Google is silent. She knows I crossed and I know I crossed. Maybe she’s pretending to honor GDPR as if she doesn’t know my every move. She knows if I am speeding but doesn’t tell the cops. She definitely knows that I got a small cut on my right index finger. Now she knows the prints of my middle finger, too. “OK, Google,” I say. “That’s me,” she&nbsp;answers.</p><p>The border crossing is easy. Finding lunch on the French Riviera in the off season during a pandemic isn’t. I have cake and coffee instead of something that feels French — or like lunch. The coffee shop has no WiFi. I guess you’re supposed to be enjoying yourself by the marina, not&nbsp;working.</p><p>The Sufficiency Currency project is about creating an alternative form of economic activity. Not marketplaces. Not money. An evolution of how we perceive our economic activity.</p><p>“People have always used money. What else is there?” people&nbsp;ask.</p><p>People haven’t always used money and there are still peoples on earth who don’t. Every system is born, lives and dies. Money is just a human invention and the financial system is like every other human invention. We can and will invent something else. Hopefully very&nbsp;soon.</p><p>A road trip to replace the world’s financial system in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad&nbsp;Trip.</p><p>Follow he <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/">Voice of Humanity project&nbsp;here.</a></p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity offers much more than just better ways to log in. The identity metasystem is really a sophisticated messaging system that is trustworthy, secure, and extensible. While decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials have much to offer the Internet of Things (IoT), the secure messaging subsystem promises an IoT that goes well beyond those initial scenarios. This post gives and introduction to SSI and IoT. The follow-on post goes deeper into what a true Internet of Things founded on SSI can provide.</p>




<p>
    I've been contemplating a self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT) for over a decade. An SSIoT is the only architecture which frees us from what I've called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>. Unlike the CompuServe of Things, the SSIoT1 supports rich, peer-to-peer relationships between people, things, and their manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
    In the CompuServe of Things, Alice's relationships with her things are intermediated by the company she bought them from as shown in Figure 1. Suppose, for example, she has a connected coffee grinder from Baratza. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative relationships in today's CompuServe of Things (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, Alice uses Brataza's app on her mobile device to connect with Baratza's IoT cloud. She registers her coffee grinder, which only knows how to talk to Baratza's proprietary service API. Baratza intermediates all of Alice's interactions with her coffee grinder. If Baratza is offline, decides to stop supporting her grinder, goes out of business, or otherwise shuts down the service, Alice's coffee grinder becomes less useful and maybe stops working all together. 
</p>

<p>
    In an SSIoT, on the other hand, Alice has direct relationships with her things. In  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a>, I showed a diagram where Alice has relationships with people and organizations. But I left out things because I hadn't yet provided a foundational discussion of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm-enabled digital relationships</a> that's necessary to really understand how SSI can transform IoT. Figure 2 is largely the same as the diagram in the post on operationalizing digital relationships with just a few changes: I've removed the ledger and key event logs to keep it from being too cluttered and I've added a thing: a Baratza coffee grinder2.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Alice has a relationship with her coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, the coffee grinder is a fully capable participant in Alice's relationship network. Alice has a DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. She also has a relationship with the company who makes it, Baratza, as does the coffee grinder. Those last two are optional, but useful—and, importantly, fully under Alice's control. 
</p>


<a></a>
 DID Relationships for IoT 

<p>
    Let's focus on Alice, her coffee grinder, and Baratza to better understand the contrast between the CompuServe of Things and an SSIoT.  
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Alice's relationships with her coffee grinder and it's manufacturer (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In Figure 3, rather than being intermediated by the coffee grinder's manufacturer, Alice has a direct, DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. Both Alice and the coffee grinder have agents and wallets. Alice also has a DID-based relationship with Baratza which runs an enterprise agent. Alice is now the intermediary, interacting with her coffee grinder and Baratza as she see's fit. 
</p>

<p>
    Figure 3 also shows a DID-based relationship between the coffee grinder and Baratza. In an administrative CompuServe of Things, we might be concerned with the privacy of Alice's data. But in a Self-Sovereign Internet of Things, Alice controls the policies on that relationship and thus what is shared. She might, for example, authorize the coffee grinder to share diagnostic information when she needs service. She could also issue a credential to Baratza to allow them to service the grinder remotely, then revoke it when they're done. 
</p>

<p>
    The following sections describe three of many possible use cases for the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Updating Firmware 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.embedded-computing.com/articles/firmware-security-for-iot-devices">problems with the CompuServe of Things</a> is securely updating device firmware. There are many different ways to approach secure firmware updates in the CompuServe of things—each manufacturer does it slightly differently. The SSIoT provides a standard way to know the firmware update is from the manufacturer and not a hacker.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 4: Updating the firmware in Alice's coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    As shown in Figure 4, Baratza has written a public DID to the ledger. They can use that public DID to sign firmware updates. Baratza embedded their public DID in the coffee grinder when it was manufactured. The coffee grinder can resolve the DID to look up Baratza's current public key on the ledger and validate the signature. This ensures that the firmware package is from Baratza. And DIDs allow Baratza to rotate their keys as needed without invalidating the DIDs stored in the devices.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, we could also solve this problem with digital certificates. So, this is really just table stakes. The advantage of using SSIoT for secure firmware updates instead of digital certificates is that if Baratza is using it for other things (see below), they get this for free without also having to support the certificate code in their products or pay for certificates.
</p>

<a></a>
 Proving Ownership 

<p>
    Alice can prove she owns a particular model of coffee grinder using a verifiable credential.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 5: Alice uses a credential to prove she owns the coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 5 shows how this could work. The coffee grinder's agent is running the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">Introduction</a> protocol and has introduced Alice to Baratza. This allows her to form a relationship with Baratza that is more trustworthy because it came on an introduction from something she trusts.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, Alice has received a credential from her coffee grinder stating that she is the owner. This is kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)">imprinting</a>. While it may not be secure enough for some use cases, for things like a coffee grinder, it's probably secure enough. Once Alice has this credential, she can use it to prove she's the owner. The most obvious place would be at Baratza itself to receive support, rewards, or other benefits. But other places might be interested in seeing it as well: "Prove you own a Baratza coffee grinder and get $1 off your bag of beans."
</p>


<a></a>
 Real Customer Service 

<p>
    We've all been in customer hell where we call a company, get put on hold, get ask a bunch of questions to validate who we are, have to recite serial numbers or model numbers to one agent, then another, and then lose the call and have to start all over again. Or been trapped in a seemingly endless IVR phone loop trying to even get to a human. 
</p>

<p>
    The DID-based relationship Alice has created with Baratza does away with that because DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication, reducing effort and increasing security. As a result, Alice has a trustworthy communication channel with Baratza that both parties can use to authenticate the other.  Furthermore, as we saw in <a>the last section</a>, Alice can prove she's a bona fide customer.
</p>

<p>
    But the ability of DIDComm messaging to support higher-level application protocols means that the experience can be much richer. Here's s simple example. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 6: Alice uses a specialized wallet to manage the vendors of things she owns (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In Figure 6, Alice has two coffee grinders. Let's further assume that Alice has a specialized wallet to interact with her things. <a href="https://searls.com">Doc Searls</a> has suggested we call it a "briefer" because it's more capable than a wallet. Alice's briefer does all the things her credential wallet can do, but also has a user interface for managing all the things she owns and the relationships she has with them3. Students in <a href="https://picolabs.io">my lab at BYU</a> have been working on a prototype of such an interface we call <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io">Manifold</a> using agent-enabled digital twins called "<a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?homepageId=1189866">picos</a>".
</p>

<p>
    Having two things manufactured by Baratza presents a problem when Alice wants to contact them because now she is the intermediary between the thing and its vendor. But if we flip that and let the thing be the intermediary, the problem is easily resolved. Now when Alice wants to contact Baratza, she clicks one button in her briefer and lets her coffee grinder intermediate the transaction. The grinder can interject relevant information into the conversation so Alice doesn't have to. Doc does a great job of describing why the "thing as conduit" model is so powerful in <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You'll recall from <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, that behind every wallet is one or more agents. Alice's briefer has an agent. And it has relationships with each of her things. Each of those has one or more agents. These agents are running an application protocol for vendor message routing. The protocol is using sub protocols that allow the grinder to act on Alice's behalf in customer support scenarios. You can imagine that CRM tools would be fitted out to understand these protocols as well. 
</p>

<p>
    There's at least one company working on this idea right now, <a href="https://www.hearro.com/">HearRo</a>. Vic Cooper, the CEO of HearRo recently told me:
</p>
<blockquote>Most communications happen in the context of a process. [Customers] have a vector that involves changing some state from A to B. "My thing is broken and I need it fixed." "I lost my thing and need to replace it." "I want a new thing and would like to pay for it but my card was declined." This is the story of the customer service call.  To deliver the lowest effort interaction, we need to know this story. We need to know why they are calling. To add the story to our context we need to do two things: capture the intent and manage the state over time. SSI has one more super power that we can take advantage of to handle the why part of our interaction. We can use SSI to operationalize the relationships.
</blockquote>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalized  relationships</a> provide persistence and context. When we include the product itself in the conversation, we can build customer service applications that are low effort because the trustworthy connection can include not only the who, but also the what to provide a more complete story. We saw this in the example with two coffee grinders. Knowing automatically which grinder Alice needs service for is a simple bit of context, but one that reduces effort nonetheless. 
</p>

<p>
    Going further, the interaction itself can be a <a href="http://picolabs.io/">persistent object</a> with it's own identity, and DID-based connections to the participants4. Now the customer and the company can bring tools to bear on the interaction. Others could be invited to join the interaction as necessary and the interaction itself now becomes a persistent nexus that evolves as the conversation does. I recently had a month long customer service interaction involving a few dozen calls with Schwab (don't ask). Most of the effort for me and them was reestablishing context over and over again. No CRM tool can provide that because it's entirely one-sided. Giving customers tools to operationalize customer relationships solves this problem. 
</p>

<a></a>
 A Self-Sovereign Internet of Things 

<p>
    The Sovrin Foundation has an IoT working group that recently released a <a href="https://sovrin.org/library-iot/">whitepaper on Self-Sovereign Identity and IoT</a>. In it you'll find a discussion of some problems with IoT and where SSI can help. The paper also has a section on the business value of SSI in IoT. The paper is primarily focused on how decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials can support IoT. The last use case I offer above goes beyond those, primarily identity-centric, use cases by employing DIDComm messaging to ease the burden of getting support for a product.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml"> next blog post, I'll extend that idea to discuss how SSI agents that understand DIDComm messages can support relationships and interactions</a> not easily supported in the CompuServe of Things as well as play a bigger role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">vendor relationship management</a>. These and other scenarios can rescue us from an administrative, bureaucratic CompuServe of Things and create a generative IoT ecosystem that is truly internet-like. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Some argue that since things can't be sovereign (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.mq7pzglc1j96">Appendix B of the Sovrin Glossary for a taxonomy of entities</a>), they shouldn't be part of SSI. I take the selfish view that as a sovereign actor in the identity metasystem, I want my things to be part of that same ecosystem. Saying things are covered under the SSI umbrella doesn't imply they're sovereign, but merely says they are subject to the same overarching governance framework and use the same underlying protocols. In the next post on this subject, I'll make the case that even if things aren't sovereign, they should have an independent existence and identity from their owners and manufacturers.
     
     The choice of a coffee grinder is based simply on the fact that it was the example <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> gave when we were having a discussion about this topic recently.
     
     This idea has been on my mind for a while. This post from 2013, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/06/facebook_for_my_stuff.shtml">Facebook for My Stuff</a> discusses it in the "social" venacular of the day. 
         The idea that a customer service interaction might itself be a participant in the SSIoT may cause some to shake their heads. But once we create a true internet of things, it's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">not just material, connected things that will be on it</a>. The interaction object could have its own digital wallet, store credentials, and allow all participants to continue to interact with it over time, maintaining context, providing workflow, and serving as a record that everyone involved can access.

<p>On Monday, November 23rd the Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* held its 17th event, the focus of this event was on Guardianship and SSI.  Our presenter was Philippe Page of The Human Colossus Foundation and is a current member of the Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group.   </p><p>Guardianship is a legal status where one individual is under the legal care of another.  A natural guardian relationship is between parent and child, legal guardians are persons who are recognized by the courts as having the legal authority and duty of care for another.  </p><p>While there are long standing legal precedents and processes around the assignment, management and revocation of guardianships, these requirements were not met by existing digital identity management solutions. With SSI, this mechanism now exists.  SSI can work in conjunction with traditional identity and credential management systems while being able to integrate into existing legal processes and provides a robust mechanism for revocation.</p><p>Guardianship is a complex topic, with many subtleties and layers.  In the humanitarian sector the it is a reality of daily life when supporting and assisting migrants, refugees and displaced persons.  It is a topic we all are faced with in our lifetimes; whether as a child (being cared for) or as an adult (caring for or being cared for).  In this first event on this topic, Philippe has provided an overview of how SSI and Guardianship fit together and how SSI meets the lifecycle stages (Inception, Creation, Usage and Termination) of guardianship.  </p><p>An objective of these events is to educate the community on how high assurance digital identities unlock new possibilities across all entities and industry sectors.   Using the tripartite relationship in clinical drug trials of patient, doctor and pharma company, Philippe covered how guardianship can also be used to manage consent to derive a business value unlocked with high assurance digital identity.  </p><p>Guardianship is an important legal concept, and will be a topic we will return to in 2021.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/482803989">https://vimeo.com/482803989</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:03:55 - Philippe Page - Introduction</p>  <p>0:08:03 - Overview</p>  <p>0:08:41 -  Guardianship background</p>  <p>0:20:15 - Core Components</p>  <p>0:33:51 - Scaling and Standardization</p>  <p>0:39:04 - Bridging Economic Actors &amp; Human Centricity</p>  <p>0:45:45 - Applications</p>  <p>1:02:08 - Questions</p>  <p>For more information on:</p><p>	- Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group :&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">https://sovrin.org/guardianship/</a></p><p>	- The Human Colossus Foundation : <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">https://humancolossus.foundation/</a></p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

The author recognizes that there may be errors and biases, and welcomes constructive feedback to correct or ameliorate.</p><p>We all like secrets. When we possess a secret, it gives us a heightened sense of individuality — that we know some that nobody else knows — giving us a special perspective or an option for the future that only we can exercise — in other words,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/power">power</a>.</p><p>It turns out, imaginary or not, secrets are fundamental to the power that we have as individuals and institutions in the digital realm. Passwords, codes — those things that grant us or enable us to grant special access to those things that valuable, like bank accounts, emails, or the drafts and finals of our deliberations, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>It turns out, that up until, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-day-cryptography-changed-forever-1b6aefe8bda7">August 1, 1977</a>, secrets had a fundamental fault — we had to share them to use them. That meant you had to trust someone else, and that could eventually lead to the betrayal of your secret, and by extension, you.</p><p>In 1977, the public introduction of asymmetric cryptography heralded a new generation of secret capabilities. The first major capability was the establishment of shared secrets across insecure channels enabling encryption between two parties without the requirement of a secret backchannel. The second was enabling commitments using secrets that are not shared, more commonly known as digital signatures.</p><p>What had been discovered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (and also Jame Ellis), is changing the world as we know it. It’s been only 43 years. Yes, that seems like an ice-age ago, but in the grand scheme of history, it is only a&nbsp;wink.</p><p>My concluding remark in this brief post is that<a href="https://youtu.be/4cia_v4vxfE"> you ain’t seen nothing yet</a> (with apologies to BTO). I have been learning about many related schemes, based on that 1977 publicly-announced breakthrough: elliptic curves, homomorphic commitment schemes, proof-of-work, etc.</p><p>It’s one thing to understand these as mathematical, but it is another thing to understand what these things might be leveraged as institutional capabilities, either built by an institution itself or leveraged from an ecosystem that lets you keep your own&nbsp;secrets.</p><p>That’s the key — keeping your own secrets — keeping those things that give you the&nbsp;power.</p>

    So the technical term for that delay or lag from then you finish speaking to you hearing when the next person speaks is wrapped up in an idea of “Latency”. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(audio)">Latency </a>is measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond">milliseconds (ms), which is thousandths of seconds</a>. Latency for a face to face conversation is like zero. For say a landline call, it is defined by an ITU standard and is judged by the ability to offer a quality of service.&nbsp; Ideally, about 10ms will achieve the highest level of quality and feels familiar.&nbsp; A latency of 20 ms is tremendous and is typical for a VoIP call as it is perfectly acceptable.&nbsp; A latency of even 150 ms is, whilst noticeable, permitted, however, any higher delay or lag times and the quality diminishes very fast. At 300 ms or higher, latency becomes utterly unacceptable as a conversation becomes laboured, driven by interruptions and lack flow.&nbsp; <p>We all know the phrases of “no-one left behind” or “you are only as strong as your weakest team member.” Well, the same applies for latency, one person in a remote place, low broadband speed, on a (shared) WIFI extension, with poor buffering on a cheap router;&nbsp; we are now all down to the slowest person in the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Analogy to get to the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jet lag”, also called “jet lag disorder,” is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock (circadian rhythms) that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep. Jet lag occurs because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've travelled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag. Jet lag can cause fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems. Jet lag is temporary, but it can significantly reduce your vacation or business travel comfort. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help prevent or minimise jet lag.</p><br><p>Stay with me. We are bringing JetLag and voice/ video lag (Latency) together.&nbsp; We know the effects of JetLag - fatigue, unwell feeling, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and is temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The question is, can VoiceLag create the same. Anecdotally I believe Yes based on 8 months of video calls.&nbsp; At the end of a day of video, Teams, Hangout or Zoom calls, we know we have fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and it is temporary. A good night of sleep, we can do it all again. &nbsp; I know that now making a day of mobile or landline calls I don’t suffer the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, is this voice lag or voice latency or video time or a little part of each? We definitely know that video calls are exhausting, but the assumption for this feeling was the new structure, a new approach, differences and styles, watch yourself continually, only seeing one person, having to be present 100% of the time.&nbsp; This is all true, but we also lack flow on video call due the latency and lag.&nbsp; Lacking flow means conversation is paused, interrupted and slow. This delay takes a lot of energy.&nbsp; We cannot get into flow to sharing our creative thinking, we have to hold ideas and opinions back, we have to wait for signals to speak - it is all exhausting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We need to focus on the remove of lag to create flow. We need to stop moving at the rate of the slowest person, let’s get everyone up to flow speed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

The editors met yesterday to discuss the issues that were pulled out of the previous draft text and document a process for how to resolve these and future issues. We would like to explain how we plan on using labels on GitHub issues to keep track of discussions and keep things moving. <br> <br>When there are substantive issues or pull requests, the editors will avoid merging or closing those outright, and instead mark them as "pending", so that these can be brought to the attention of the larger group. If no additional discussion happens on these, the merge or close action will be taken in 7 days. Note for this first round we are setting the deadline for the issues below as Dec 11th due to the US holiday and the fact that this is the first time using this process. <br> <br>"Pending Merge" <br>When specific text is proposed in a PR (by anyone, not limited to the editors), and the editors believe this text reflects the consensus of the working group, this marks that the PR will be merged in 7 days unless there is a clear alternative proposal accepted by the working group. <br> <br>"Pending Close" <br>When the editors believe an issue no longer needs discussion, we'll mark it "Pending Close". The issue will be closed in 7 days unless someone brings new information to the discussion. This tag is not applied to issues that will be closed by a specific pull request. <br> <br>There are two additional labels we will use to flag issues to the group. <br> <br>"Needs Text" <br>The editors suggest this issue needs additional text in the spec to clarify why this section is needed and under what circumstances. Without a concrete proposal of text to be included in the spec, this section will be removed in a future update. <br> <br>"Postponed" <br>This issue can be reconsidered in the future with a more concrete discussion but is not targeted for immediate concrete changes to the spec text. When used on its own, this label does not indicate that an issue is targeted to be closed. An issue may also be marked "Pending Close", and this is used so that we can distinguish closed issues between discussions that have concluded or things that we may want to revisit in the future. Remember that closed issues are not deleted and their contents are still findable and readable, and that new issues can reference closed issues. <br> <br>With these labels in mind, here are the list of issues and their statuses we were able to discuss on our last editor's call. The action on these pending issues will be taken on Dec 11th to give the group enough time to review this list. For this first round, many of the issues are marked "Pending Close" as we're looking for low hanging fruit to prune the list of issues down. In the future, you can expect to see more "Pending Merge" issues as we're bringing proposed text to review by the WG. <br> <br>Postponed: <br> <br>• Generic claim extension mechanism <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131</a> <br> <br>Pending Merge: <br> <br>• Make access token mandatory for continuation API calls <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129</a> <br> <br>Postponed and Pending Close: <br> <br>• Fetchable Keys <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47</a> <br>• Including OpenID Connect Claims <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64</a> <br>• Application communication with back-end <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82</a> <br>• Additional post-interaction protocols <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83</a> <br> <br>Pending Close: <br>     <br>• HTTP PUT vs POST for rotating access tokens <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100</a> <br>• Use of hash with unique callback URL <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84</a> <br>• Interaction considerations <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81</a> <br>• Expanding dynamic reference handles <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76</a> <br>• Post interaction callback nonce <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73</a> <br>• Unique callback URIs  <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55</a> <br>• Instance identifier <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46</a> <br>• Requesting resources by reference <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36</a> <br>• Mapping resource references <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35</a>

<p>Some on the next 10-ish years in identity management.</p><p>[This was originally written in December 2019: pre-pandemic, pre-US presidential election, pre-George Floyd. Truly, it was written in the “Before Times.” I thought about updating this before posting but that felt wrong – somehow dishonest. So here is the lightly touched up text of my talk which was given first in Tokyo at the OpenID Foundation Summit and then again as part of the all-virtual Identiverse. If you want to skip the text and <a href="https://players.brightcove.net/6154186074001/V3qAkKf6t_default/index.html?videoId=6184188772001">go straight to the video, you can</a>!&nbsp;</p><p>My deepest thanks go to Naohiro Fujie and Nat Sakimura for prompting me to write this, Andi Hindle for his feedback. – IG 11/24/2020]</p><p>It is my honor to present to you today. Today, it is my privilege to talk to you about my vision of the future of digital identity. When Naohiro-san asked me to speak on this topic, I was both honored and panicked. In my daily role, I focus on a 12 to 18 month time frame. My primary task is to help my stakeholders and, yes I have a multi-year vision, but I primarily focus on how my team can execute in the next few months to help those stakeholders. I don’t, as a matter of my daily routine, think about the future.</p><p>So I was a little panicked. I am not a futurist. I am no longer an industry analyst. I am just a practitioner trying to help where I can. How then should I talk about the next ten years of our industry?</p><p>I can name 4 ways to think about the future and with your permission I will briefly try all 4.</p> Looking at the Past to See the Future <p>One way to talk about the future is to look back at past predictions and see how they fared. I’ll choose 3 predictions:</p>  The Need for Password Vaulting  SAML is Dead  The Year of PKI (Again…Still)   The Need for Password Vaulting <p>In 2014, I said that <a href="https://youtu.be/_TsYqOq9iDk?t=449">by 2017 the need for password vaulting would be gone</a>. Well, it’s 2020 and there are systems that simply refuse to participate in single sign-on schemes. My guess is that in the next 5 years the need for enterprise password vaulting (not including privileged account management) will be gone.</p><p>In non-enterprise settings, password managers are more prevalent than ever, at least browser-based ones. My guess is that WebAuthn will drive passwordless use cases and when combined with OS-based software tokens the need for passwords and password vaulting in our daily lives will dramatically decrease in the next 5 to 10 years. But more on that later.</p> SAML is Dead <p>Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/n40173">Craig Burton famously stated that SAML was dead</a>. It’s 2020 and SAML remains dead. It is so dead that my company is involved with at least 70,000 different SAML federations. (May all of our endeavors be so successful upon their demise.)</p> The Year of PKI <p>Since 1977 it has been the year of PKI. It is now the year of PKI. It will continue to be the year of PKI until it becomes impossible to safely distribute keys. (But I’ll get to that in a bit.)</p><p>While looking at past predictions is one way to talk about the future it is not completely sufficient.&nbsp;</p> Continuous Future <p>Another way to think about the future is to imagine a continuous one… one in which today’s technologies and techniques progress in a linear fashion towards the future. Promising things that are growing today continue to grow into the future. There are four items I’d like to discuss briefly:</p>  OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal  SAML Will Still Be Dead  Passwords Will Also Be Dead  WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On   OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal <p>The next decade of IAM, especially workforce-centric IAM, will be based on OpenID Connect and SCIM. This implies that OAuth and JOSE will continue in their role as critical supporting standards. This is not to say that other protocols, such as SAML or Kerberos, will not be important, but OIDC and SCIM will be the assumed pieces of our infrastructures.</p> SAML Will Still Be Dead <p>The reason why SAML is “dead” is because it works and it is a legacy technology. It is mature. It is popular. And that will not change in the next&nbsp;5 years. Now, I do not expect a resurgence of SAML federations but I also do not expect rapid migration from SAML to OIDC (unless prompted by a shift in platform or provider.) Consider that it took years to stamp out WS-Federation; SAML will take a similar path. In 10 year’s time, the SAML zombie herd will be quite thin but still shuffling onwards and very much considered a legacy protocol.</p> Passwords Will Also Be Dead <p>Good news! The password is dead! And I mean this in both senses: passwords work and passwords are legacy. In the next 5 years, consistent best practices will roll through our enterprises: long passwords, infrequent changes, and strengthening with a second factor.</p><p>At the same time, we can see how the use of passwords will decline significantly over the next 10 years. Enterprise is already showing this to be the case: federation as the primary means of resource access. We are not far off from having 1 password per enterprise user. What about in the consumer space?</p> WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On <p>As a consumer, how do I get the best experience getting into sites and apps? One approach is to use a password manager. But in 2016 only 3% of internet users use a password manager app and only 2% use a browser-based one <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/01/26/2-password-management-and-mobile-security/">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. While those numbers have undoubtably grown, I cannot imagine they have cracked double digits.</p><p>Another approach is to use social sign-on to get into sites and apps. I believe people use social sign-on to avoid the twin hassles of creating an account and managing a password.</p><p>But I believe by 2030, there will be parity between WebAuthn and social sign-on. This is predicated on active clients ruling our mobile worlds and the use of desktops continuing to decline. Concerns over personal privacy combined with the ease of use in which the mobile OS is the dominant active client that “magically” signs one in, will bring a meaningful alternative to social sign-on.</p><p>WebAuthn is the standard that makes this happen at the wire-level. Ubiquitous browser support is a key enabling step which is well underway. Connecting OS-level biometric recognition to services via enabled-browsers is the obvious next step. Those two things will deliver a “magical” mobile sign-in experience in which I just look at my phone and I am in the app. we should expect to see play out over the next 3 to 5 years and mainstream adoption in 5 to 10.</p><p>These items will help us, in different ways, to improve the state of account management. But we cannot only think about digital identity by itself; we have to think about the technological landscape that surrounds our industry.</p> The Adjacent World <p>If we are going to talk about the future of identity we cannot do so without looking at adjacent technology and trends:</p>  Active Clients Will be Mainstream  Quantum Computing and PKI  Balkanization of the Internet   Active Clients Will be Mainstream <p>The next 10 years will be dominated by digital things acting on our behalf: active clients. Our password managers, personal digital assistants, and digital wallets will take a far greater role in finding, delivering, and interacting with online services.</p><p>In the next 5 years, the mobile OS and its features will be the primary active client for the vast majority of the online world. Using alternatives to mobile OS provided wallets, password managers, strong authentication clients, will be possible but will struggle to gain widespread adoption. That might change in 10 years with regulatory action or significant market externalities, but it is unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, when it comes to digital assistants, as my colleague Peter Schwartz, futurist, said to me, “If you aren’t Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant you have no chance. Everything will be brokered through one of those three.” Your digital assistant service will be brokered through one of those 3 or possibly a mega-platform such as WeChat.</p><p>All of this has implications in the death of passwords. If the mobile OS vendor doesn’t want to support WebAuthn, DID Auth, or the next great thing we can dream up, it is going to be extremely difficult to gain meaningful adoption by people and thus service providers will be unlikely to adopt as well.</p> Quantum Computing and PKI <p>In the next ten years, we will see quantum computing effect cryptography. For the most part, our hashing algorithms will be okay in a post-quantum world. But it is our key exchange algorithms that might fall. As my colleague Taher Elgamal, noted mathematician and father of SSL, told me, “We need to get moving.” We have 5 years to adopt new key exchange mechanisms assuming we get a new method by 2025… which we may not. A failure to act will undermine cryptographic trust. And that has profound implication for not just our industry but all industries.</p> Balkanization of the Internet <p>In the next 10 years we will see the internet split into at least 2 separate internets. There will be an internet for China (and possibly a separate one for Russia) and one for the rest of the world. Even if these internets are not physically separated, national policy, censorship, and enterprise risk management will drive logically separated ones.</p><p>What this likely means for identity professionals is that within these separate Internets, separate identity schemes will arise. If today identity is the perimeter of the enterprise, in 10 years, identity will be the perimeter of these Balkanized Internets. We can see the beginnings of this with WeChat and given nationalism on the rise around the world, one can easily imagine non-interoperable identity perimeters to our online worlds. And this an outcome we must fight.</p><p>Predicting where currently successful things will continue to be successful is often the role of an industry analyst – a role I used to do. But I think there is a more challenging and exciting way to think about the future – one isn’t based on likely successfully and frankly reasonably obvious things.</p> The Discontinuous Future <p>A third way to think about the future is to imagine one not as a smooth path forward but one abruptly shifts and radically changes. This discontinuous future is hidden by our biases, our investment in our current projects and approaches, and our natural tendency to rely on the familiar to navigate the dimly lit room that is the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the discontinuous future is focused, not on account management, but actual identity management. So what if we choose, just for the next few minutes, to imagine this hidden, discontinuous future? What would we see there?</p><p>I believe we will see 3 actions and 1 actor in this discontinuous future.</p>  Introductions  Recognition  Counselors  Data Handling<br>   Introductions <p>The act of introducing someone is the act of creating a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine digital assistants managing our introductions. In this case, one service says to another “This is an entity which I know about and with whom you should have a relationship.”&nbsp; In some regards you can think of this a social sign-on++.</p> Recognition <p>The act of recognition is a way to acknowledge parties in a relationship and is a way to demonstrate the existence of the relationship to some other entity or service. For example, I am a member of IDPro or I am an employee of Salesforce or I am a citizen of Japan. I think the act of acknowledging a relationship will supersede our current forms of consent. The relationship defines “normal” acceptable behavior between the parties. So long as actions are within the regular boundaries of the relationship then the person doesn’t need to provide additional consent. The parties’ behavior within the context of the relationship would be monitored by active clients.</p> Counselors <p>Counselors are new actors in this discontinuous future. They are entities who can:</p>  Act on your behalf  Vouch for you and your relationships  Create and sever relationships on your behalf  Can counsel you on your behavior  <p>Counselors can provide data needed to form a relationship. They can step in before you share data with a service that could be considered risky. Imagine something stepping in before you hand over your form of payment and email address and suggest using an anonymous one instead. Imagine that service can even generate that anonymous forms of payment and a pseudonymous email for you. That is the future role of a counselor.</p><p>For some a counselor could be a government or a private-sector supplied service. These counselors are true value-add active clients.</p> Data Handling <p>How we handle data will change in the discontinuous future. I believe that pseudonymization and differential privacy will have to be applied at the time of introduction. We will finally have an infrastructure that supports the idea that data gathered at the time of use is superior to previously stored away data. Provenance and relationship metadata will be applied all the time, even for insights derived from shared information. Finally, common privacy-preserving processing fabrics will arise to enable industry sectors to derive industry-specific insights and industry-shared risks; think of this as an industry-specific shared signals and attribute exchange.</p><p>I believe focusing on these actors and actions will enable use to move toward true digital identity management.</p> The Fourth Way <p>There is a fourth way to think about the future: They say that the way to predict the future is to create it. This might seem daunting. Not everyone can create a new protocol, not everyone can write a specification, not everyone can build something that has never been seen before.</p><p>But, each of us, in our own way, can create the future. We create the future by hiring without bias to form diverse work environments. We create the future by respectfully using data shared with us. We create the future by ensuring that our systems run in an environmentally sustainable manner. We create the future by ensuring the algorithms we use are ethical and without bias. We create the future by providing something wonderful for all of our stakeholders. And in these ways, we create a future far more meaningful than any talk about the future can describe.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

     Who is the “we”, this piece is co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a> and me, who together have worked for over 45 years on identity and personal data. For this article, we are looking at the role of values, principles and rules within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity.   <p>As we write this there is an ongoing conversation about the regulation of Facebook and the regulation of big tech in general. We see a problem with the frame of the conversation because we believe ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist as in no-one entity should have that much power and control over the global population’s identities, “their” data and the conversion we have. So any frame that accepts BIG TECH as acceptable won’t create rules that actually move towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is.</p>         <p>With this piece, we are seeking to look at how principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework we have today is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket.</p><p>So let’s get to the question at hand “Why does it matter that we connect values, principles and rules?” The connection is not clear because we have created so many words and variance in languages that there is significant confusion. We are often confused in ourselves to what we mean, we are very inconsistent in how we apply our understanding, often to provide a benefit to ourselves or justify our belief. To unpack the relationship we need to look at definitions, but we have to accept that even definitions are inconsistent. Our conformational bias is going to fight us, as we want to believe what we already know, rather than expand our thinking.</p> Are we imagining principles or&nbsp;values? <p>Worth noting our principles are defined by our values. Much like ethics (group beliefs) and morals (personal beliefs) and how in a complex adaptive system my morals affect the group’s ethics and a group’s ethics changes my morals. Situational awareness and experience play a significant part in what you believe right now, and what the group or society believes.</p><p>Values can be adaptable by context whereas principles are fixed for a period, withstanding the test of time. When setting up a framework where we are setting our principles implies that we are saying that we don’t want them to change every day, week, month, year, that they are good and stable for a generation but we can adapt/ revise/ adjust principles based on learning. Fundamentally principles are based on values which do change, so there are ebbs and flows of conflict between them, this means we frame principles and often refuse to see that they are not future proof forever. Indeed the further a principle is away from the time it was created, the less it will have in common with values.</p> Are we confusing principles and&nbsp;rules? <p>Considering characteristics, conceptually principles are abstract and universal whereas a rule is specific and particular. Principles cope with exceptions, rules need another rule. Principles provide the power of thought and decision making, rules prevent thought and discretion. Principles need knowledge and experience to deliver outcomes, rules don’t. Principles cope with risk, conflict and abstraction; conflict is not possible for a rule, it is this rule or a rule is needed.</p><p>We love rules-of-thumb, as such rules and heuristics provide time-saving frameworks which mean we don’t have to think. Not having to think saves energy for things we like to do. Take away the little ways you have that creates a stable place for yourself and you end up exhausted. Travel to a new place and you don’t know where the simple amenities of life are, COVID19 took away the structure of our lives which created exhaustion until we found a new routine. However, we often confuse “our heuristics”, the way I do something, or “my rules” as a principle. This diet rule is a principle for losing weight. We should accept that we purposely interchange rules, values and principles to provide assurance and bias to the philosophy, theory, thesis or point we are trying to gain acceptance of.</p><p>In companies and for a social policy we set rules and principles into matrices as below. Asking is it better to break rules or comply, is better to uphold principle or challenge them.</p><p>A review round the four quadrants highlights that there is no favourable sector and indeed as a society who wants to get improve, we continually travel through all of them. Companies and executives often feel that upholding principles and obeyed rules (top right) creates the best culture, but also ask the organisation to be adaptive, agile and innovative.</p><p>Given that principles are based on values, the leadership team will be instrumental into how upheld the principles are. Whereas the companies level of documentation for processes, procedures and rules will define what is to be obeyed, the culture of the top team will determine if they are to be obeyed or not.</p><p>The matrix below thinks about the combinations of values and principles. Where values are either mine as an individual or we as a collective society.</p><p>The fundamental issue with the two representations (rules or values and principles) is that they cannot highlight the dynamic nature of the relationship between them. By example, our collective values help normalise an individuals bias and that collective values informs and refine principles. Indeed as principles become extreme and too restrictive say as our collective values become too godly, our collective values opt to no-longer uphold them. When our individualism leads to the falling apart of society we raise the bar to create better virtues as it makes us more content, loved and at peace.</p><p>Movement within the “stable compromise” domain has been explored many times but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history </a>expands it very well.</p><p>In summary, a rules-based approach prescribes or describes in detail a set of rules and how to behave based on known and agreed principles. Whereas a principle-based approach develops principles which set the limits that enable controls, measures, procedures on how to achieve that outcome is left for each organisation to determine.</p> Risk frameworks help us to connect principles and&nbsp;rules <p>Having explored that a rules-based approach prescribes in detail the rules, methods, procedures, processes and tasks on how to behave and act, whereas a principle-based approach to creating outcomes crafts principles that frame boundaries, leaving the individual or organisation to determine its own interruption.</p>  In a linear system, we would agree on principles which would bound the rules.  In a non-linear system, we would agree on the principles, which would bound the rules and as we learn from the rules we would refine the principles.  In a complex adaptive system, we are changing principles, as our values change because of the rules which are continually be modified to cope with the response to the rules.  <p>This post is titled “In a digital age, how can we reconnect values, principles and rules?” and the obvious reason is that rules change, values, which change principles that means our rules need to be updated. However, this process of learning and adoption depends on understanding the connection which offers closed-loop feedback. An effective connection is our risk frameworks.</p><p>The diagram below places rules and principles at two extremes. As already explored we move from principles to rules but rarely go back to rethink our principles, principally because of the time. Rules should refine and improve in real-time, principles are generational. However to create and refine rules we use and apply a risk framework. The risk framework identifies risk and to help us manage it, we create rules that are capable of ensuring we get the right data/ information to be able to determine if we have control over risk. As humans, we are not experts in always forecasting the unimagined and so when we implement rules things break and clever minds think how to bend, break or avoid them. To that end we create more rules to manage exceptions. However, occasionally we need to check that our rules are aligned to our principles and indeed go back and check and refine our principles.</p><p>Starting from “Principles” these are anchored in ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity">Human Dignity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity_%28European_Union%29">Subsidiarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity">Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_theology">Covenantal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">The common good</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship">Stewardship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Equality">Equality</a>.</p><p>Once we decide that one or more of these should anchor our principles and form a north star, a direction to travel in and towards. The reason to agree on the Principle(s) is that collectively we agree on a commitment to get to a better place. We state our principles as an ambition, goal, target with allow us to understand, manage and control uncertainty using a risk framework. The risk framework frame or bounds the risk we are prepared to take. The risk framework enables us to define rules that get to our known outcomes. We implement the rules to create controls using regulation, code and standards. Our risk frameworks use tools to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on the risk, the delta in risk and compliance with the rules. Whilst all is good we use the risk framework to create more rules and better framing and boundaries, creating better outcomes. However, when the desired outcomes are not being created we revert to the principles, check our north star and take our new knowledge to refine/ redefine the risk we are prepared to take.</p> Data and Identity Principles <p>Having established this framework, the idea is to apply this to the authors favourite topics of data and identity. We have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve through identity and data ownership. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global. This is not a bill of rights, this is “what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><blockquote>“what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder&nbsp;us?</blockquote><p>Our problems probably started a while back when information could travel faster than people (the telegraph rollout of 1850). This was a change in the fabric of values and principles. The person who was trusted was passed over and that person-to-person trust was no longer needed. Delays that allowed time for consideration gave way to immediacy; a shift in values and principles.</p><p>The question is how do our principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes, the world we designed for was physical; it is now digital-first. Now we are becoming aware that the fabric has changed, where next? By example, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis </a>is the legal system and database. With a case in mind, you use this tool to uncover previous judgments and specific cases to determine and inform your thinking. However, this database is built on humans and physical first. Any digital judgements in this database are still predicated on the old frameworks, what is its value when the very fabric of all those judgements changes. Do we use it to slow us down and prevent adoption? Time to unpack this</p><p>Physical-world first (framed as AD 00 to 2010)</p><p>Classic thinking (western capital civilisation philosophy) defined values and principles which have created policy, norms and rules. Today’s policy is governed by people and processes. We have history to provide visibility over time and can call on millennia of thought, thinking and wisdom. Depending on what is trending/ leading as a philosophy we create norms. In a physical and human first world, we have multi-starting positioning. We can start with a market, followed by norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture — creating law and regulations OR we can start with norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture, followed by market-creating law.</p><p>Without our common and accepted belief, our physical world would not work. Law, money, rights are not real, they are command and control schema with shared beliefs. Our created norms are based on our experience with the belief. We cope by managing our appetite to risk.</p><p>Digital world first (frame as AD 2020 — AD MMMCCX )</p><p>People-in-companies rather than people-in-government form the new norms as companies have the capital to include how to avoid the rules and regulations. The best companies are forming new rules to suit them. Companies have the users to mould the norms with the use of their data. Behaviour can be directed. Companies set their own rules. Doctrine/architecture creates the market, forming norms, and the law protects those who control the market. Policy can create rules but it has no idea how rules are implemented or governed as the companies make it complex and hide the data. There are few signs of visible “core” human values, indeed there are no shared and visible data principles. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined.</p><p>The companies automate, the decisions become automated, the machine defines the rules and changes the risk model. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined as we have no data principles.</p><p>By example. Our news and media have changed models. The editor crafted control to meet the demand of an audience were willing to pay to have orchestrated content that they liked. As advertising became important, content mirrored advertising preferences and editorial became the advertising and advertising the content. Digital created clicks that drove a new model to anything that drives clicks works. The fabric changed from physical to digital and in doing so we lost the principles and rules of the physical first world to a digital-first world that has not yet agreed on principles for data.</p> To our favourite topic: Data and&nbsp;Identity <p>Imagine looking at this framework of “principles, rules and risk” within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity. How would privacy and identity be presented?</p><p>Within data and identity, we have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global.</p><p>The stated <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">GDPR principles are</a> set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a>:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimisation.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security)  Accountability.  <p>We know they are called “Principles” by the framing of the heading in Article 5, however, are these principles, values or rules? Further are these boundaries, stewardships or a bit of a mashup. By example to get round “Purpose Limitation,” terms and conditions become as wide as possible so that all and or any use is possible. Data minimisation is only possible if you know the data you want, which is rarely the case if you are a data platform. If a principle of The European Union is to ensure the free “movement/mobility” of people, goods, services and capital within the Union (the ‘four freedoms’), does data identity ideals and GDPR align?</p><p>Considering the issue with “the regulation of Facebook” or the “regulation of” Big Tech, in general, is that ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist, <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">no one entity should have that much power</a> and control over people’s identities and their data? So the framings that accept them, as acceptable, won’t create rules that actually moves towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is. If we add in open API’s and the increasing level of data mobility, portability and sharing whose “rules or principles” should be adopted?</p><p>How do your principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework, say in the US today, is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket. Alas, IMHO, GDPR is not a lot better than rules with no truly human-based core principles.</p> The lobby of&nbsp;time <p>By example here is the <a href="https://simson.net/ref/2004/csg357/handouts/01_fips.pdf">1973: The Code of Fair Information Practices</a> This Code was the central contribution of the HEW (Health, Education, Welfare) Advisory Committee on Automated Data Systems. The Advisory Committee was established in 1972, and the report released in July. The simplicity and the power of the code have been eroded and water down so that the code is now ineffective. Would we be in a much better place if we had adopted such thinking at the time?</p>  There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.  There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used.  There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person’s consent.  There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person.  Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.   Conclusion <p>We have outdated “principles” driving rules in a digital-first world. This world is now dominated by companies setting norms and without reference to any widely agreed-upon values. The downside of big tech gaining so much power that they are actually seen by people-in-government as “equivalent to nation-states” is telling. We have small well-networked organizations attempting to make a dent in this. <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData</a>, for example, has generated, from an engaged collaborative community, a set of ideals (principles) that provide a good starting point for a wider constructive discussion, but we need historians, anthropologists, ontologist, psychologist, data scientists and regular every day people who are the users to be able to close the loop between the rules we have, the risk frameworks we manage to and the principles that we should be aiming for.</p><p>How can we leverage innovative democratic deliberative processes like <a href="https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/methods/citizens-jury">citizen’s jury</a>’s that are used in some parts of Europe to close the loop between rules and principles around emerging technology?</p><p>Take Away</p>  How are we checking the rules we have are aligned to our principles?  How are we checking our principles?  Is our risk framework able to adapt to new principles and changes to rules?  How do we test the rules that define and constrain create better outcomes?

Unfortunately we know that there is no black and white; some acceptance rules are unreasonably unequivocal and we are forced to bend the rules (haven’t we all?) for a better outcome. But that is also exploited.

As this is an opinion, I take full responsibility for any implied, explicit, or unconscious bias. I am open to feedback and correction; this opinion is subject to change at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’re almost there for truly global trusted interoperability. We almost have all of the networks we need. Let’s go through the networks we already have or will have soon (please note — I am only focusing on electronic networks, not physical or social networks)</p><p>Global Communication Network — The Internet as we know it today. Conceptualized as a singular, ubiquitous thing that we take for granted, it is actually a network of networks and an amalgam of protocols and technologies abstracted and unified bound by a set of rules known as Internet Protocol. We can just communicate with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Global Location Network — This is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is so embedded in our lives — it is baked into the chips that we wear and take with up(watches, Fitbits, cycling computers, etc.), we no longer notice its presence. We can just know where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>Global Monetary Network — This network is still emerging. Bitcoin is the frontrunner, but there are contenders and competitors, such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However this will play out, we will soon be able to exchange monetary value with one another, without the backing of governments and relying on financial intermediaries we have used for centuries.</p><p>So what is the next stop for the network? It’s&nbsp;this:</p><p>Global Verification Network — A network to independently verify without reliance on trusted intermediaries. Simply put, someone presents you with something — a claim, a statement, or whatever, and you will be able to prove that it is true without accepting it a face value or calling home to a centralized system that could deny you service, surveil you, or give you a false confirmation (for whatever reason). The business of trust can then be between you and the presenter, and you decide what you need to independently verify.</p><p>The exact capabilities of this global verification network are still to be determined but it is becoming clearer every day. Much of what is required as ingredients already exist as siloed bespoke add-ons onto the Internet as we today (TLS, etc.). Further, the cryptography that will enable this global verification network has already existed for years if not&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The hardest part ahead is not the technology, it’s the wholesale re-conceptualization of what is required for a global verification network that puts the power of the network back into the endpoints that is you and&nbsp;me.</p><p>In the coming weeks, I will be providing more detail, but I want you to take away from this post, that the next major stop for networks is a global verification network.</p>

<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date specification has now been published as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8943">RFC 8943</a>.  In particular, the <code>full-date</code> tag requested for use by the ISO Mobile Driver’s License specification in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17</a> “Cards and security devices for personal identification” working group has been created by this RFC.  The abstract of the RFC is:</p>
<blockquote><p><br>
The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC 7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</p>
<p><br>
In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time:  CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX “seconds since the epoch”).  Since then, additional requirements have become known.  This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar without a time.  It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric date representation without a time.  This specification is the reference document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that a gifted musical singer/songwriter appears in this RFC in a contextually appropriate fashion, should you need an additional incentive to read the specification. ;-)</p>

Make sure the board creates and delivers value and wealth for the shareholders; almost at any cost. The skills, processes, practices and values needed were largely simple and financially driven/ rewarded. Much has been written about the topic and the theory forms the basis of the practices that control where we are today. The fundamental fabric has now changed. Indeed shareholders never owned the company and real-time trade removed a belief about responsibilities and ownership. It has to be said that these ideals were only a mechanism we created to exercise accountability and responsibility controls. However, those controls and beliefs are now themselves lost. By example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-quality-and-effectiveness-of-audit-independent-review">audit is broken and does not work</a>. <br><br>  When reframing the purpose for a board, based on 2020 reasons for a business to exist, of which there are many, but:  when framed for say sustainability, becomes complex. Sustainability for whom, what metrics, skills, data and who decides?  when framed for say ESG, becomes complex. ESG for whom, what metrics, data and who decides?  when framed for eco-system survival, become complex .....  when framed by the provision of help, service and support, it becomes complex&nbsp;   <br> Questions I am sat on?   Are boards working for us?<br>Who is "the us" you framed in the last question?<br>Of whom are you asking the question and what voices are you not listening to?  <br>Perhaps we need to start with a question. What is the one clear purpose a board exists in this instance? Is it say for Accountability OR Better judgment and who decides? Who decides, who decides?&nbsp;  <br>  IMHO it is this latter question we appear to have lost, leaving me to ask if a board can ask itself, and truly reflect on it own effectiveness?&nbsp; In the absence of oversight are we left with transparency?&nbsp;  <br>  <br>

As I struggled to understand the Buddhist description of selflessness, I realized I was limited by an existing indoctrination that had a very different (mis?) interpretation of selflessness, that comes from my midwestern religious upbringing.</p> Selflessness <p>I was taught selflessness as some aspect of Christianity, that Jesus was selfless and we should be too. And I learned that this kind of selflessness was about thinking about others, considering others, putting others before you. And I was indoctrinated that I should put others before&nbsp;me.</p><p>Well this didn’t work so great for me. While I was busy putting others before me, I did not receive the same treatment. I was expected to put others before me, AND ALSO meet all my own needs. Hello burnout, not to mention unfairness.</p> Selfish <p>I rebelled against this and went to take care of my needs first (well first I had to figure out what I needed cause I’d been brainwashed by society). This caused the Christians in my life to call me selfish. But if I didn’t take care of my needs, and other people didn’t take care of my needs either, where did that leave me? Was I supposed to be ok with&nbsp;that?</p> Selflessness Redux <p>As I’ve gone deeper into the Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist canon of emptiness, I came against “selflessness” again. Selflessness is supposedly one of the easiest ways to understand the weight and important of emptiness (I disagree, but that is a post for another day), because by starting with selflessness, you supposedly realize emptiness directly and relatedly to yourself. (There are also some epic mental logistics!)</p><p>Selfless in the Buddhist canon means you (and everyone) has an ever changing “I” aka this thing you think is you, that you ascribe an identity too, is not solid or everlasting — it is constantly changing based on the context and relation to the world. A bunch of years ago, I gave a talk called “How We Create I(dentity)” which talked about how we each have complex identities that change based on&nbsp;context.</p><p>Remember the uproar when Facebook was like you can only have one identity there, and it has to be the legal you? That’s the wrong view of identity. Your FB identity is constrained to the FB platform. (And teaser: your FB identity is dependent on the platform&nbsp;too.)</p> Dependent Arising <p>This “you” is dependent on many things. It’s dependent on the evolution of DNA so you have a brain and a body to move around in this world. It’s dependent on the social structure and education and global politics and the food you eat and what your ancestors ate and food is itself dependent on the earth and the&nbsp;sun.</p><p>We have a business description for this: the supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Think about it. You go to a store, you have shelves of products. Those products didn’t just magically appear out of nothing! They don’t exist on their own. The box of cookies exists because of all the steps it took along the supply chain, from the growing of the farmer’s wheat, the harvest tracked on an IoT connected John Deere tractor, the grain shipped cross border (and taxed) to a factory, which makes, say, King Arthur flour, which then is sold to bakeries, and those bakeries use human and machine labor to combine the flour with eggs, sugar, butter, baking soda, and chocolate, which is baked, packaged, marketed, shipped to your store where you can buy and eat them during a global pandemic.</p><p>This is called “dependent arising.” Which basically means, the thing does not, can not, exist on its own, of its own&nbsp;accord.</p><p>The box of cookies does not magically pop into existence from emptiness. It comes into existence bit by bit as it moves along the supply chain. We Create the Identity (and the product) of the&nbsp;thing.</p> The Supply Chain of&nbsp;You <p>Now, apply this scenario to you. You are the box of cookies. Your existence is dependent on many things. You can not exist separately. You are dependent arising. If you understand and accept that you are a result of the “supply chain of you” and you are constantly changing based on context, you may also accept/realize that you are not as solid as you think you&nbsp;are.</p><p>This is selflessness. It is the understanding that your existence is dependent on the world around you AND this constantly changing you is not a solid everlasting thing. You have no self to center on — because the self is a constantly changing projection. (I like to think about the self as disco lights at the club creating the ambiance of the dancefloor.)</p> Resolution? <p>My Christian understanding of selflessness is about putting others first because&nbsp;??? IDK Jesus said&nbsp;so?</p><p>My Buddhist understanding of selflessness is about realizing I could not exist without everything in the world, and that I do not exist — my identity/self does not exist — outside of the world. And so in this understanding I see how I connect and am created/influenced by everything.</p><p>In the Christian sense, if I do not put others first, I am “bad,” but this is self alienating. Whereas in the Buddhist sense, who I am is created by the world, and thus, I have the power to influence and create others as much as they have to influence and create me. So I can authentically consider others in order to influence and co-create who they are. Which if I think about it, is perhaps not so different from intention of considering others in the first place, with one key difference, considering others as if they are you instead of not-you, because together We Create (individual &amp; collective) I(dentity).</p>

 Understanding the future of the Internet and the flows of identity &amp; personal information 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed interviewing Kaliya Young, The Identity Women, last week, during an Identity Praxis Experts Corner Interview on November 13, 2020.</p>
  
 About Kaliya and Her Purpose 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaliya, “The Identity Women,” is a preeminent expert in all things identity and personal information management standards, protocols, resources, and relationships.</p>
<p>If you listen to our interview, you’ll hear about her purpose and passion, how she is living it, and how she helps guide the world down a path toward self-sovereignty. At the end of this path is the promise that one day people—you, me…everyone—will have control, i.e., self-determination and agency, over their identity and personal information.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kaliya’s purpose is to answer this profound question: “How do we own, control, manage, and represent ourselves in the digital world, independently of the BigTech companies (Facebook, Google, etc.)?”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the last 15+ years, Kaliya has been at the center of the self-sovereign identity (SSI) movement.</p>
<p>The SSI movement is all about creating open standards and technologies that change how identity and personal information are collected, managed, and exchanged throughout society. In other words, SSI is about getting our identity out of the grip of BigTech and into the hands of the individual, the data subject. But, SSI is so much more; it is also about evolving the Internet, making it more efficient and secure, and creating new opportunities for businesses to innovate and to forge new and lasting relationships with the people they serve.</p>
<p>The Opportunities form SSI.</p>
<p>In our interview, Kaliya highlights several opportunities that SSI can make possible, including:</p>
 
 The availability of new protocols will make it possible to securely and efficiently move data across the Internet without it being centralized in a few players’ hands. 
 The possibility for people to have control over their identity and data is created and moved, rather than it being in control of BigTech like Facebook and Google (see Kaliya’s Jan. 2020 interview in Wired, where she discusses making Facebook obsolete). 
 The chance for businesses to build a new kind of trusted, secure, and transparent relationship with their customers, and to do so while saving time, money, and reducing risk (Kaliya recommends that you check out DIDComm Messaging, an emerging protocol that is promised to bring this opportunity to light). 
 
 SSI Use Cases 
<p>It is still early days for SSI, but people worldwide are working diligently to create the foundation of SSI so that a wealth of privacy and people-centric services can come to light.</p>
<p>Following my interview with Kaliya, I took a look at the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group (VCWG), as recommended by Kaliya. The W3C VCWG is a team diligently working on adding a new, secure identity management layer to the Internet. Among other efforts that they are working on, I found that, in Sept. 2020, they released a list of use cases and technical requirements for self-sovereign identity, see the Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers draft spec.</p>
 Here is a list of high-lighted use cases, 
 
 The online shopper is assured that the product they’re buying is authentic. 
 Owners of manufactured goods, e.g., a car, can track the product’s ownership history and the provenance of every part (original and replaced) while preserving players’ anonymity up and down the supply chain for the life of the product. 
 Support for data vaults, aka personal data stores; people can securely store their data in the cloud and be confident that they and only they have access to it and that they can offer fine-grained access to their data when&nbsp;they want to. For example, they can securely share their age in a way that someone else can verify and trust without needing the person’s actual birth date or any additional information. 
 Track verifiable credentials back to their issuer; people or organizations looking to verify someone’s data will be able to track a verifiable credential or piece of data back to a trusted source, like a chamber of commerce, bank, or DMV. 
 New and improved data exchange consent management, not just for data exchange but to manage online tracking&nbsp;to power personalization and analytics 
 Power secure and anonymous payments 
 Secure physical and digital identity cards or licensing credentials that allow for fine-grained control of exactly what data is shared when the proof of identity or licensee rights need to be verified 
 
 The Challenges for SSI 
<p>According to Kaliya, the most significant challenges that we must overcome to make SSI a reality include,</p>
 
 Counteract the inertia of the status-quo; people don’t like change; they are used to existing knowledge-based authentication practices, processes, and systems. 
 People’s awareness generation and adoption of new SSI empowered services. 
 Education for everyone: developers, users, executives, customers, clients, investors, regulators, and so much more. 
 The new market model, i.e., we now face a three-sided market, and all the business models and systems operations must evolve to accommodate the new use cases. 
 
 Kaliya: A wealth of resources and knowledge&nbsp; 
<p>Kaliya is a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>She knows the SSI industry structure. She knows the leading players. She can point you to the right resources to introduce you to people that can help you understand, plan, and execute SSI solutions and services.</p>
<p>To put a fine point on it, working with Kaliya can save you months, if not years, of stumbling around in the dark as you look to figure out what SSI can do for you and your business.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the people and resources that Kaliya high-lighted and alluded to in our interview:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 W3C Credentials community group, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 Trust over IP Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards and governance models. 
 Kim Cameron and the 7 Laws of Identity, a godfather and visionary in all things identity 
 DIDComm Messaging Protocol, a protocol for trusted data exchange 
 Internet Identity Workshop, a bi-annual incoherence where all things SSI are discussed 
 Domains of Identity, a book she wrote on identity. 
 Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity, a book she wrote on self-sovereign identity. 
 
<p>That’s it for now. Enjoy. We’ll be sure to bring Kaliya back soon.</p>

  It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential. So what exactly have I doing with all that time?

<p>It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential.</p>

<p>So what exactly have I doing with all that time?</p>



 Managing Emotions 

<p>If you haven’t been following my story, so far, the short version is that I quit drinking a few years ago, and all of this info-gathering has been an important part of my recovery process, and a path to creating a new life.</p>

<p>All the same, however far along I had come in my work, and self-education, I still had the challenges processing every day emotions, which I’d been primarily avoiding by processing as much information on valuable topics as possible.</p>

<p>Turning that around, I shifted most of my info-gathering from blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized-identity, to focus more on mental hygiene and emotional agility.</p>

<p>The most valuable information I’ve encountered in that regard is <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re interested, in nonviolent communication, with the kind of honesty that supports people connecting with each other in a way that makes compassionate giving inevitable, that makes it enjoyable for people to contribute to each other’s well being. - Marshall Rosenberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve got a couple projects brewing on that topic, and will write more about that later, so don’t want to take too much space for that now.</p>

<p>In brief, I can say that spending time with the teachings of Marshall Rosenberg has made a significant contribution to my mental health and emotional wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you’re curious to learn more, I called a session at my first IIW on the topic, you can check out the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Introduction%5CDiscussion_-_Marshall_Rosenberg%27s_Nonviolent_Communication_(perhaps_discussing_integration_with_standards_processes)">notes for that session on the IIW Wiki</a>, which provides a high-level overview, and lots of links.</p>

 Developing the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter 

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Instead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a>  (a resource I’ve created along that journey) 
 

<p>Static Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form

<p>It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008">struggling with GitHub’s recent move</a> to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.</p>

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<p>Trying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly <a href="https://feedly.com/i/pro/welcome">$50 a month</a> for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.</p>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.</p>

<p>What <a href="https://github.com/feedreader/">Pluto Feed reader</a> does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher

  schedule:

    - 'planetid.ini'

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>Last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/identitywoman">Kaliya</a> suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/">identosphere.substack.com</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

 Thanks for stopping by!

Trust frameworks are being developed by the private sector and the public sector, as collaborative or sector-specific efforts. Trust mark and trust certification programs are also emerging alongside trust framework development efforts.</p><p>These trust framework development efforts are worthy undertakings and the results of these efforts should automatically engender trust. But the problem that we are now faced with, all good intentions aside, is — how do we truly trust a trust framework?</p><p>The answer is simple — with standards.</p><p>Trust frameworks need standards to be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Within the Canadian context, a <a href="https://www.scc.ca/standards/what-are-standards">standard</a> is defined by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of Canada</a>,&nbsp;as:</p><p>“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse&nbsp;fields.”</p><p>This standard definition might sound straightforward — making a ‘standard” might sound easy but the hard part is all the work leading up to agreeing on those things that are part of a standard — an agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their&nbsp;results.</p><p>That’s where trust frameworks come into play. Much of the work that eventually ends up in a standard is years if not decades in the making. For years I have been part of developing the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>. This work had started in earnest in early 2015, and building on work that goes as far as back as 2007 (you can find a lot of the historical material in the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">docs</a> folder in the PCTF repository on&nbsp;GitHub)</p><p>What has come out of all of this work is a trust framework — a set of agreed on principles, definitions, standards, specifications, conformance criteria, and assessment approach.</p><p>This definition of a trust framework, sounds pretty much like a standard, doesn’t it? Yes and no. What the trust framework has not gone through is a standards development process that respects and safeguards the interests of all stakeholders affected by the standard. Within the Canadian context, that’s where Standards Council of Canada comes into play by specifying how standards should be <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/what-are-standards/developing-standards#Development%20of%20National%20Standards%20of%20Canada">developed</a> and how to <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/accreditation">accredit</a> certain bodies to be standards development organizations.</p><p>So trust frameworks, however good and complete they are, still need to go through the step of becoming an official standard. Fortunately, this is the case in Canada, where the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework </a>was used to develop <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">CAN/CIOSC 103–1:2020 Digital trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals</a>. This standard was developed by the <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/home/">CIO Strategy Council</a>, a standards development organization accredited by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of&nbsp;Canada.</a></p><p>In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself. In Canada, we have been extremely fortunate to see the good work that we have done in the public sector to be transformed into a national standard that serves the interests of all Canadians.</p>

<p>Companies and organizations have strategic decisions to make at the Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) front. First, they have to decide whether to invest into a dedicated CIAM solution or to build on existing infrastructure. If there is already a foundation, what should be their next steps to have a mature CIAM strategy in place? If they do not have a CIAM solution, where do they start? Applications, systems, identities tend to be siloed while as a business grows, it’s imperative they are cohesive and well-integrated in order to provide a superior customer experience.</p><p>An effective CIAM solution will help connect various applications and systems such as CRM, data management, analytics and marketing platforms. This helps to move towards a 360-degree view of the customer which is a key prerequisite for successful digital transformation.</p><p>In the following webinar recording, I join with KuppingerCole Senior Analyst and Lead Advisor Matthias Reinwarth to explain how CIAM helps to achieve digital transformation, best practices in CIAM and pitfalls to avoid. Also we talk about the 5 pillars in CIAM essential for your CIAM strategy and maturity models to determine stage of&nbsp;growth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-role-of-ciam-in-digital-transformation-66e0fff623d">The Role of CIAM in Digital Transformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The SSI_Ambassador account is managed by <a href="https://twitter.com/doerkadrian">Adrian Doerk</a> and the interview was conducted as part of Adrian’s Bachelor’s thesis. I have asked Adrian’s permission to post this material and he has graciously granted me permission. The post is a lightly edited version of the interview transcript. The interview took place in September 2020.</p><p>Note: All views and opinions expressed are mine only and do not represent that of my employer or organizations with whom I am involved.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lili_popper?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Lili Popper</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/pathway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a> The growth factors of Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions in&nbsp;Europe” <p>Adrian Doerk: My research question is concerned about the growth factors of self-sovereign identity solutions in Europe. You as somebody who is very familiar with the topic of SSI, what would you think about, when you read the term growth factor of self-sovereign identity, what comes to your&nbsp;mind?</p><p>Tim Bouma: I believe the main growth factor is going to be adoption by users and it has to be really easy. Another growth factor is that SSI will need to be part of an infrastructure. I’m not sure if SSI is viable being marketed as a separate product because I don’t think end-users really understand it. The growth factor is going to be similar to plumbing — some additional standardized capabilities that we need to build. It will be as exciting as buying a 1/4 inch washer and bolt. It will just be part of the infrastructure and the demand will be from higher-order products not for SSI itself. I’d say most people won’t even know what it is, nor should they know about it. It’s not that different from the markets in the early days of PC networking. Remember you had your choice of drivers and different companies providing those things and after a while, it just gets baked in the operating system and people don’t even know that they’re using it. As it for being a discrete market, I see very quickly being subsumed by a higher-order products and like subsumed into mobile operating systems, into desktop devices, tablets, etc. It’s not that different from how a lot of other products or technologies evolved over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: We as SSI for German consortia we want to build infrastructure for Europe, so you might have read our press release. Probably not — no worries. So basically, our idea is to come up with a base layer infrastructure which is used as a public utility as defined in the Trust over IP stack level one with a European scope in terms of the governance and a worldwide usage. So considering this plan as public private partnership. What would be your recommendations for the governance for this&nbsp;network?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Well, you are totally aligned with my thinking. In fact, we’re about to announce a challenge. There’s a couple of things going on within the government, Canada. We’re launching a technology challenge (note: since this interview the challenge has been <a href="http://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">launched.</a>) to figure out exactly what layer one would be for the digital infrastructure with the standards, and also what specifically is the scope of layer one and I can point you to that link afterwards, but that’s what I’ve been working on. We were just awarding the contracts as we speak. We’re getting six vendors to help us out. I think to answer your questions, I have some good ideas, but I’m not 100% sure because it is relatively new area and I think we need to be quite open on having our assumptions challenged and change during the course, but I see a very clear differentiation between the technical interoperability and the business interoperability, and in fact the challenge that I’m doing We’ve got six different use cases ranging from government security clearances to issuing of cannabis licenses to name a few. I’m not concerned about the content of the credential because that’s more business interoperability. I’m concerned that whatever credential, SSI credential or whatever is being issued into the system can actually be verified from the system irrespective of what’s inside. I hope I’m not losing track your question here. I see a very clear division of the private sector operating that system. I don’t see why government needs to build it and operate it. We don’t do that for networks, we don’t do that for payment rails. It has to be done in a way that governments have optionality that if a new operator comes along that’s more trustworthy or has different characteristics, there’s no reason why they can’t be used. There’s a risk. Maybe it’s not a risk for this to turn into a natural monopoly if we aren’t careful to make sure that we don’t have the standards 100% right? We have to be very, very careful that we want to have a plurality of operators. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot of them. I see that there were probably only for national infrastructure that maybe one or two domestic operators. And then probably, you know there’s going to be some international operators, but they need to work together so that’s a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Who exactly do you mean with operators? Do you mean the Stewards?</p><p>Tim Bouma: OK, so there’s two different things. There’s a steward, the governance which and again this is going to be a tricky and I’ve noticed that the Trust over IP Foundation revised their model that you could have governance at each of the layers. And so the question is governance at which layer and then what’s the composition of that governance? I would see at layer one. It’s largely a technical&nbsp;issue. It could be just part predominantly private sector players, maybe some government or nonprofit, but I just don’t know yet. I think where a government really will play is not in the infrastructure itself, but how that infrastructure is used and relied on for doing administration of programs. Provision of services. You know it could be passports. It can be currency. It could be educational credentials or whatever. I think government needs to be concerned at that level, but less so at the lower levels. But having confidence in those lower&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: When we speak about adoption, one of the big topics is use cases in general. We think that more or less the low hanging fruit, which is really easy to implement, is where you have the issuer also as a relying party. For example a University, which issued a student ID and then checks it again to issue him some other credentials. What would you think would be good for the start for different use cases? Let me reframe the question shortly. What are your recommendations for use cases to start with? What is the best&nbsp;one?</p><p>Tim Bouma: We had six vendors propose to us and they came up with six different use cases, and they’re quite varied, and I don’t think I can say which one is going to take off by adoption or not, but there is a government security clearances, there’s a cannabis licensing, there’s one for having your digital birth certificate, there’s one for a job site permit, it came from oil and gas. I’m not so sure which one is going to play out. I think what’s more important is really having a crystal clear understanding of what’s the digital infrastructure that can serve all of those use cases. That’s where my thinking is. What’s the absolute minimum that needs to be built? That could be an infrastructure so I think any one of these use cases can take off, but I think that model of issuer Holder verifier and we’ve generalized it to methods. It doesn’t have to be a blockchain. It could be a database. It could be different ways of doing it. There’s a super pattern there that will just serve all the use cases and this is where I’ve been putting a lot of intellectual effort just on my own time just to understand what the parallels are to digital currency and digital identity. It all boils down to kind of the similar idea is that I need to independently verify something. And I need to do it in a way that’s as flexible as possible, and then I need to have some additional functions. Digital currency. You need a transfer capability for digital identity or digital verification. I don’t think you need that. What are the absolute minimal requirements for this digital infrastructure? And it’s kind of like standardizing on paper and ink for doing contracts. You know you need paper and you need ink. What should we all standardize on? 8 1/2 by 11 or 8, four and a special type of ink that you need to use or just ink. Can’t be pencil or graphite or crayon and that’s good enough to move on to all the other very use cases. I don’t know what use case is going to take off. I think the important thing for us to do is do the critical thinking to figure out what are the common patterns on underneath there that are going to apply in all of those use cases. And as I said my working hypothesis now is that the issuer, holder, verifier with some ornamentation will do the&nbsp;job.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Considering you your knowledge with the pan Canadian trust framework. You, as a policymaker, what will be your recommendation for policymakers in the European Union which work for example at the European self-sovereign identity framework?</p><p>Tim Bouma: It’s interesting. ’cause I actually had a call on this very same issue. I think policymakers actually have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts and see if they have the right concepts to actually build out a framework and regulation, and that’s what we’ve been doing with Pan Canadian Trust Framework. We’ve recognized that what we tried to do is ingest all the latest concepts, such as issuer, holder, verifier credentials and express them in a way that does not limit them by assumption, like you don’t assume the credential is a document for example, or physical document. Or it’s just manifested only as a physical document. A credentials is a claim that can be independently verifiable and coming up with those concepts. So when you’re actually building up the frameworks and regulations you have a robust and a framework that doesn’t constrain you to a particular technological approach. There may be new technologies that come along that you didn’t even anticipate, but if you’ve done your critical thinking up front, there should be no reason why you can’t adopt that, so I think we’re just at this interesting point right now. I think we have an opportunity to go back to the drawing board. And this is just not an issue of just updating like eIDAS or other regulations and just tweaking a bit. It’s like going back to the drawing board and just say do we have the right policy constructs, which then could become regulatory requirements or legislative requirements. I think that we’re building a next generation of solutions here, and I think it’s really important that that we have the right constructs going forward, and I think we do have good confidence because I’ve looked at my evolution of thinking. You know I really started to get deep in the space in 2016 and really spend a lot of time internalizing the concepts. And it’s just a lot of iterations, but I feel like we’re in a good spot now to actually have a conversation of what these frameworks and regulations might be. It’s not just taking a paper analogue and saying, You know, just let’s do a digital equivalent of that, or a document analogue. We have to think about it differently.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Then I would like to come to my last question. What do you think will be the negative sites or the danger sites of&nbsp;SSI?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Aside from all the hype and blue-sky stuff that has no merit. You see this often with any type of new technology, for example that SSI will solve hunger. It will solve society’s problems. First of all, just making sure it doesn’t get implicated in outrageous claims and that it has nothing that those are deeper problems to solve. So I think, as Gartner calls it, there’s the hype cycle. Of course, when you have the hype cycle, you get the what I call the allergic reaction that people will say, “We’re not going to use it because, you know, it’s got a bad name.” The other thing that we need to be concerned with or cognizant of is that we could build some capabilities that are outside of the states control. And I don’t know how that would manifest itself. All right, the great example is the Bitcoin Blockchain. It basically is a system that just runs on its own and no one can stop it because the way it’s structured, there’s no Corporation or operator that you can actually like take down and the algorithms, proof of work, and that it’s all open and permissionless. People are valuing like whatever is associated with their Bitcoin address because they value it. And there’s basically no way that a state or large actor can actually control that. And also not really bad thing. You know the way I’ve been describing it is that in the Bitcoin context from the economic context, we may have a new macroeconomic factor coming on the horizon that we need to work into our models around a proof of work turning energy into a digital assets and how that plays out, don’t know. So I, I think some of the downsides might be is. There may be some key capabilities that could be built. That could be viewed as illegal or unlawful in certain contexts, and so they they ban it outright. So I think we have to be very careful with this new technology to make sure that we bring the stakeholders along so we can embrace the positive side of the technology. Every technology is a two-edged sword, gunpowder, guns, you know anything? There’s an upside and there’s the downside, right? And I think that’s something that we have to be very cognizant of just like you know. In the mid 90s you had the crypto wars with the clipper chip. You can only have expert with certain key strengths and that caused a reaction and so we have to be careful that we don’t get caught into those same traps of us against the government or government against them. I think we have to figure out how to work this out together.</p>

  <p>Summary: DIDComm is the messaging protocol that provides utility for DID-based relationships. DIDComm is more than just a way to exchange credentials, it's a protocol layer capable of supporting specialized application protocols for specific workflows. Because of its general nature and inherent support for self-sovereign relationships, DIDComm provides a basis for a self-sovereign internet much more private, enabling, and flexible than the one we've built using Web 2.0 technologies.</p>




<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">DID-based relationships</a> are the foundation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). The exchange of DIDs to form a connection with another party gives both parties a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship that is self-certifying and mutually authenticated</a>. Further, the connection forms a secure messaging channel called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DID Communication or DIDComm</a>. DIDComm messaging is more important than most understand, providing a secure, interoperable, and flexible general messaging <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/overlay-network">overlay</a> for the entire internet. 
</p>

<p>
    Most people familiar with SSI equate DIDComm with verifiable credential exchange, but it's much more than that. Credential exchange is just one of an infinite variety of protocols that can ride on top of the general messaging protocol that DIDComm provides. Comparing DIDComm to the venerable TCP/IP protocol suite does not go too far. Just as numerous application protocols ride on top of TCP/IP, so too can various application protocols take advantage of DIDComm's secure messaging overlay network. The result is more than a secure messaging overlay for the internet, it is the foundation for a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign internet with all that that implies</a>.  
</p>

<a></a>
 DID Communications Protocol 

<p>
    DIDComm messages are exchanged between software <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agents</a> that act on behalf of the people or organizations that control them. I often use the term "wallet" to denote both the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> and agent, but in this post we should distinguish between them. Agents are rule-executing software systems that exchange DIDComm messages. Wallets store DIDs, credentials, personally identifying information, cryptographic keys, and much more. Agents use wallets for some of the things they do, but not all agents need a wallet to function. 
</p>

<p>
    For example, imagine Alice and Bob wish to play a game of TicTacToe using game software that employs DIDComm. Alice's agent and Bob's agent will exchange a series of messages. Alice and Bob may be using a game UI and be unaware of the details but the agents are preparing plaintext JSON messages1 for each move using a TicTacToe protocol that describes the format and appropriateness of a given message based on the current state of the game.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob play TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging (click to enlarge)


<p>
    When Alice places an X in a square in the game interface, her agent looks up Bob's DID Document. She received this when she and Bob exchanged DIDs and it's kept up to date by Bob whenever he rotates the keys underlying the DID2. Alice's agent gets two key pieces of information from the DID Document: the endpoint where messages can be sent to Bob and the public key Bob's agent is using for the Alice:Bob relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice's agent uses Bob's public key to encrypt the JSON message to ensure only Bob's agent can read it and adds authentication using the private key Alice uses in the Alice:Bob relationship. Alice's agent arranges to deliver the message to Bob's agent through whatever means are necessary given his choice of endpoint. DIDComm messages are often routed through other agents under Alice and Bob's control.
</p>

<p>
    Once Bob's agent receives the message, it authenticates that it came from Alice and decrypts it. For a game of TicTacToe, it would ensure the message complies with the TicTacToe protocol given the current state of play. If it complies, the agent would present Alice's move to Bob through the game UI and await his response so that the process could continue. But different protocols could behave differently. For example, not all protocols need to take turns like the TicTacToe protocol does.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Properties 

<p>
    The DIDComm Protocol is designed to be
</p>
 
     Secure 
     Private 
     Interoperable 
     Transport-agnostic 
     Extensible 
 
<p>
    Secure and private follow from the protocol's support for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">heterachical (peer-to-peer) connections and decentralized design</a> along with its use of end-to-end encryption. 
</p>

<p>
    As an interoperable protocol, DIDComm is not dependent on a specific operating system, programming language, vendor, network, hardware platform, or ledger3. While DIDComm was originally developed within the Hyperledger Aries project, it aims to be the common language of any secure, private, self-sovereign interaction on, or off, the internet.  
</p>

<p>
    In addition to being interoperable, DIDComm should be able to make use of any transport mechanism including HTTP(S) 1.x and 2.0, WebSockets, IRC, Bluetooth, NFC, Signal, email, push notifications to mobile devices, Ham radio, multicast, snail mail, and more.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm is an asynchronous, simplex messaging protocol that is designed for extensibility by allowing for protocols to be run on top of it. By using asynchronous, simplex messaging as the lowest common denominator, almost any other interaction pattern can be built on top of DIDComm. Application-layer protocols running on top of DIDComm allow extensibility in a way that also supports interoperability.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Protocols 

<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.  DIDComm and its application protocols are one of the cornerstones of the SSI metasystem, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#metasystem">giving rise to a protocological culture</a> within the metasystem that is open, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">agentic</a>, inclusive, flexible, modular, and universal.
</p>

<p>
    While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. Many others are possible. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm: 
</p>
 
     <a>Connecting with others</a> 
     <a>Requesting and issuing credentials</a> 
     <a>Proving things using credentials</a> 
 
<p>
    There's a protocol for agents to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0031-discover-features/README.md">discover the protocols that another agent supports</a>. And another for one agent to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">make an introduction</a>4 of one agent to another. The TicTacToe game Alice and Bob played above is enabled by a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/tictactoe/README.md">protocol for TicTacToe</a>. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol</a> for picos, which are DIDComm. 
</p>

<p>
    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#roles-participants-parties-and-controllers">tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm</a>. We can imagine a host of DIDComm protocols for all kinds of specialized interactions that people might want to undertake online including the following:
</p>
 
     Delegating 
     Commenting 
     Notifying 
     Buying and selling 
     Negotiating 
     Enacting and enforcing contracts 
     Putting things in escrow (and taking them out again) 
     Transferring ownership 
     Scheduling 
     Auditing 
     Reporting errors 
 
<p>
    As you can see from this partial list, DIDComm is not just a secure, private way to connect and exchange credentials. Rather DIDComm is a foundation protocol that provides a secure and private overlay to the internet for carrying out almost any online workflow. Consequently, agents are more than the name "wallet" would imply, although that's a convenient shorthand for the common uses of DIDComm today. 
</p>

<a></a>
 A Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>Because of the self-sovereign nature of agents and the flexibility and interoperable characteristics they gain from DIDComm, they form the basis for new, more empowering internet. While self-sovereign identity is the current focus of DIDComm, its capabilities exceed what many think of as "identity." When you combine the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">vast landscape of potential verifiable credentials</a> with DIDComm's ability to create custom message-based workflows to support very specific interactions, it's easy to imagine that the DIDComm protocol and the heterarchical network of agents it enables will have an impact as large as the web, perhaps the internet itself.
</p>

 

 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     DIDComm messages do not strictly have to be formatted as JSON. 
     Alice's agent can verify that it has the right DID Document and the most recent key by requesting a copy of Bob's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">key event log</a> (called delta's for peer DIDs) and validating it. This is the basis for saying peer DIDs are self certifying. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/10/fuse_with_two_owners.shtml">Fuse with Two Owners</a> shows an introduction protocol for picos I used in building Fuse in 2014 before picos used DIDComm. I'd like to revisit this as a way of building introductions into picos using a DIDComm protocol.

<a></a>

<p>
    Recently, I've been making the case for self-sovereign identity and why it is the correct architecture for online identity systems.
</p>

 
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a>, I discuss why identity systems are really built to manage relationships rather than identities. I also show how the architecture of the identity system affects the three important properties relationships must have to function effectively: integrity, lifespan, and utility.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> I introduced a classification scheme that broadly categorized identity systems into one of three broad architectures: administrative, algorithmic, or autonomic.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>, I discuss how the architecture of an identity system affects the authenticity of the relationships it manages. 
 

<p>
   This post focuses how people can operationalize the relationships they are party to and become full fledged participants online. Last week, Doc Searls posted <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">What SSI Needs</a> where he recalls how the graphical web browser was the catalyst for making the web real. Free (in both the beer and freedom senses) and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>, browsers provided the spark that gave rise to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">generative</a> qualities that ignited an explosion of innovation.  Doc goes on to posit that the SSI equivalent of the web browser is what we have <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">called a "wallet"</a> since it holds, analogously to your physical wallet, credentials.
</p>

<p>
    The SSI wallet Doc is discussing is the tool people use to operationalize their digital relationships. I created the following picture to help illustrate how the wallet fulfills that purpose.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in Sovrin Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This figure shows the relationships and interactions in SSI networks enabled by the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> protocols. The most complete example of these protocols in production is the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the figure, Alice has an SSI wallet1. She uses the wallet to manage her relationships with Bob and Carol as well as a host of organizations. Bob and Carol also have wallets. They have a relationship with each other and Carol has a relationship with Bravo Corp, just as Alice does2.  These relationships are enabled by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a> in the form of peer DIDs (blue arrows).  The SSI wallet each participant uses provides a consistent user experience, like the browser did for the Web. People using wallets don't see the DIDs (identifiers) but rather the connections they have to other people, organizations, and things. 
</p>

<p>
    These autonomic relationships are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-certifying</a> meaning they don't rely on any third party for their trust basis. They are also mutually authenticating: each of the parties in the relationship can authenticate the other. Further, these relationships create a secure communications channel using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm protocol</a>. Because of the built-in mutual authentication, DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml"> batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication. As a result, Alice has trustworthy communication channels with everyone with whom she has a peer DID relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, as mentioned, also has a relationship with various organizations. One of them, Attester Org, has issued a verifiable credential to Alice. They issued the credential (green arrows) using the Aries credential exchange protocol that runs on top of the DIDComm-based communication channel enabled by the peer DID relationship Alice has with Attester. The credential they issue is founded on the credential definition and public DID (an algorithmic identifier) that Attester Org wrote to the ledger.
</p>

<p>
    When Alice later needs to prove something (e.g. her address) to Certiphi Corp, she presents the proof over the DIDComm protocol, again enabled by the peer DID relationship she has with Certiphi Corp. Certiphi is able to validate the fidelity of the credential by reading the credential definition from the ledger, retrieving Attester Org's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attester Org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, Certiphi can use cryptography to know that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked.
</p>

<p>
    This diagram has elements of each architectural style described <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>.
</p>

 
     Alice has relationships with five different entities: her friends Bob and Carol as well as three different organizations. These relationships are based on autonomic identifiers in the form of peer DIDs. All of the organizations use enterprise wallets to manage autonomic relationships4.  

   As a credential issuer, Attester Org has an algorithmic identifier in the form of a public DID that has been recorded on the ledger. The use of  algorithmic identifiers on a ledger3 allows public discovery of the credential definition and the public DID by Certiphi Corp when it validates the credential. The use of a ledger for this purpose is not optional unless we give up the loose coupling it provides. Loose coupling provides scalability, flexibility, and isolation. Isolation is critical to the privacy protections that verifiable credential exchange via Aries promises.  

   Each company will keep track of attributes and other properties they need for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">relationship to provide the needed utility</a>. These are administrative systems since they are administered by the organization for their own purpose and their root of trust is a database managed by the organization. The difference between these administrative systems and those common in online identity today is that only the organization is depending on them. People have their own autonomic root of trust in the key event log that supports their wallet.  
 

<p>
    Alice's SSI wallet allows her to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. Alice's wallet is also the place where specific, protocol-enabled interactions like credential exchange happen. The wallet is flexible tool that Alice uses to manage her digital life. 
</p>

<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">prevented from acting by their anemic natures</a>. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online</a>. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become digitally embodied to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.
</p>

 Notes 

 
     Alice's SSI wallet is like other wallets she has on her phone with several important differences. First, it is enabled by open protocols and second, it is entirely under her control. I'm using the term "wallet" fairly loosely here to denote not only the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> but also the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agent</a> necessary for the interactions in an SSI ecosystem. For purposes of this post, delineating them isn't important. In particular, Alice may not be aware of the agent, but she will know about her wallet and see it as the tool she uses.  
     Note that Bob doesn't have a relationship with any of the organizations shown. Each participant has the set of relationships they choose to have to meet their differing circumstances and needs. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     Enterprise wallets speak the same protocols as the wallets people use, but are adapted to the increased scale an enterprise would likely need and are designed to be integrated with the enterprise's other administrative systems.

The show is over. Biden won. Trump lost.</p>
<p>Sure, there is more to be said, details to argue. But the main story—Biden vs. Trump, the 2020 Presidential Election, is over. So is the Trump presidency, now in the lame duck stage.</p>
<p>We’re in the epilogue now.</p>
<p>There are many stories within and behind the story, but this was the big one, and it had to end. Enough refs calling it made the ending official. President Trump will continue to fight, but the outcome won’t change. Biden will be the next president. The story of the Trump presidency will end with Biden’s inauguration.</p>
<p>The story of the Biden presidency began last night. Attempts by Trump to keep the story of his own presidency going will be written in the epilogue, heard in the coda, the outro, the postlude.</p>
<p>Fox News, which had been the Trump administration’s house organ, concluded the story when it declared Biden the winner and moved on to covering him as the next president.</p>
<p>This is how stories go.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that the story was right in every factual sense. Stories aren’t.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has covered much and has been covered as well, I can vouch for the inevitability of inaccuracy, of overlooked details, of patches, approximations, compressions, misquotes and summaries that are more true to story, arc, flow and narrative than to all the facts involved, or the truths that might be told.</p>
<p>Stories have loose ends, and big stories like this one have lots of them. But they are ends. And The End is here.</p>
<p>We are also at the beginning of something new that isn’t a story, and does not comport with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">the imperatives of journalism</a>: of storytelling, of narrative, of characters with problems struggling toward resolutions.</p>
<p>What’s new is the ground on which all the figures in every story now stand. That ground is digital. Decades old at most, it will be with us for centuries or millennia. Arriving on digital ground is as profound a turn in the history of our species on Earth as the one our distant ancestors faced when they waddled out of the sea and grew lungs to replace their gills.</p>
<p>We live in the digital world now now, in addition to the physical one where I am typing and you are reading, as embodied beings.</p>
<p>In this world we are not just bodies. We are something and somewhere else, in a place that isn’t a place: one without distance or gravity, where the only preposition that applies without stretch or irony is&nbsp;with. (Because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/prepositions-list.htm">the others</a>—over, under, beside, around, though, within, upon, etc.—pertain too fully to positions and relationships in the physical world.)</p>
<p>Because the digital world is ground and not figure (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)">here’s the difference</a>), it is as hard for us to make full sense of being there as it was for the first fish to do the same with ocean or for our amphibian grandparents to make sense of land. (For some help with this, dig David Foster Wallace’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water">This is water</a>.)</p>
<p>The challenge of understanding digital life will likely not figure in the story of Joe Biden’s presidency. But nothing is more important than the ground under everything. And this ground is the same as the one without which we would not have had an Obama or a Trump presidency. It will at least help to think about that.</p>

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating.

<p>For many decades, one of the landmark radio stations in Washington, DC was WMAL-AM (now re-branded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN">WSPN</a>), at 630 on (what in pre-digital times we called) the dial. As AM listening faded, so did WMAL, which moved its talk format to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAL-FM">105.9 FM</a> in Woodbridge and its signal to a less ideal location, far out to the northwest of town.</p>
<p>They made the latter move because the 75 acres of land under the station’s four towers in Bethesda had become far more valuable than the signal. So, like many other station owners with valuable real estate under legacy transmitter sites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_Media">Cumulus Media</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insideradio.com/free/cumulus-closes-74-million-sale-of-maryland-tower-site/article_9f233cbc-b70a-11ea-af89-eb5e61f8fbba.html#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20it%20struck%20a%20%2475%20million,%2474.1%20million%2C%20including%20%245%20million%20paid%20in%202019.">sold sold the old site for $74 million</a>. Nice haul.</p>
<p>I’ve written at some length about this&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/02/10/will-wmal-survive-losing-its-transmitter/">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/11/01/wmal630am-2-0/">here</a> in 2015, and&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/01/05/the-slow-sidelining-of-over-the-air-radio/">here in 2016</a>. I’ve also covered the whole topic of radio and its decline&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I only bring the whole mess up today because it’s a five-year story that ended this morning, when WMAL’s towers were demolished. The Washington Post wrote about it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/demolition-of-bethesda-radio-towers-will-take-a-piece-of-history-rare-open-space/2020/11/02/238b4bc4-1945-11eb-aeec-b93bcc29a01b_story.html">here</a>, and provided the video from which I pulled the screen-grab above.&nbsp;<a href="http://Pedestrians.org" title="http://Pedestrians. ">Pedestrians.org</a> also has a much more complete video on YouTube, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>. WRC-TV, channel 4, has a chopper view (best I’ve seen yet) <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/watch-400-foot-towers-in-maryland-demolished-with-explosives/2463073/?fbclid=IwAR1uLKwtW06wQVlgamKybJLSIeQI6RHfh8GEyLemi-kbwPf2E13BeA0ROmg">here</a>. Spake the&nbsp;Post,</p>
<blockquote><p>When the four orange and white steel towers first soared over Bethesda in 1941, they stood in a field surrounded by sparse suburbs emerging just north of where the Capital Beltway didn’t yet exist. Reaching 400 feet, they beamed the voices of WMAL 630 AM talk radio across the nation’s capital for 77 years.</p>
<p>As the area grew, the 75 acres of open land surrounding the towers became a de facto park for runners, dog owners and generations of teenagers who recall sneaking smokes and beer at “field parties.”</p>
<p>Shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday, the towers came down in four quick controlled explosions to make way for a new subdivision of 309 homes, taking with them a remarkably large piece of privately owned — but publicly accessible — green space. The developer, Toll Brothers, said construction is scheduled to begin in 2021.</p>
<p>Local radio buffs say the Washington region will lose a piece of history. Residents say they’ll lose a public play space that close-in suburbs have too little of.</p></blockquote>
<p>After seeing those towers fall, I posted this to a private discussion among broadcast engineers (a role I once played, briefly and inexpertly, many years ago):</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s like watching a public execution.</p>
<p>I’m sure that’s how many of who have spent our lives looking at and maintaining these things feel at a sight like this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that the AM band is a century old, and that nearly all listening today is to other media. We know how these towers make waves that spread like ripples across the land and echo off invisible mirrors in the night sky. We know from experience how the inverse square law works, how nulls and lobes are formed, how oceans and prairie soils make small signals large and how rocky mountains and crappy soils are like mud to a strong signal’s wheels. We know how and why it is good to know these things, because we can see an invisible world where other people only hear songs, talk and noise.</p>
<p>We also know that, in time, all these towers are going away, or repurposed to hold up antennas sending and receiving radio frequencies better suited for carrying data.</p>
<p>We know that everything ends, and in that respect AM radio is no different than any other medium.</p>
<p>What matters isn’t whether it ends with a bang (such as here with WMAL’s classic towers) or with a whimper (as with so many other stations going dark or shrinking away in lesser facilities). It’s that there’s still some good work and fun in the time this old friend still has left.</p></blockquote>

<p>Travel always has its ups and downs but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced both at the same time as intensely as right now.</p>
<p>I’m at Moonstone Beach in Cambria, just south of San Simeon, in a rented camper van. After a walk on the beach I hop in, reverse, clip a rock, blow a tire, and come to rest alongside the guard rail facing the ocean.</p>
<p>I call roadside assistance; they can deliver a tire but not until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I may be about to win the road trip breakdown lottery. I’m snuggled in my two-sleeping-bag nest on the air mattress in the back of the van, on a bluff about 25 feet above the beach, with the van’s big side door open, watching and hearing the tide roll in.</p>
<p>The worst and best parts of my trip are happening at the same time. I screwed up, am stuck, cannot go anywhere. But of all the places I could have been stuck on this trip, I’m stuck in the place I most want to be.</p>
<p>The sign says the gate closes at 6, but nobody has shown up by 7 when everyone else is gone. I can’t reach the authorities. This would be the campsite of my dreams if I’m allowed to stay.</p>
<p>The suspense is killing me. </p>
<p>Eventually a cop shows up, agrees that I can’t go anywhere, and gives me permission to stay for the night. I win the lottery! Nobody ever gets to stay here overnight. But here I am.</p>
<p>We’re all stuck in many ways for many reasons. A road trip during the final week before the election seemed like a way to silence the demons. Roaming around the state didn’t really help. But this night on the bluff over Moonstone Beach most certainly will.</p>
<p>In the light of the full moon, the crests of the waves are sometimes curls of silver, sometimes wraiths of foam that drift slowly south, continually morphing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how we’re all going to get through this winter. I don’t know what comes next. I don’t even have a plan for tomorrow. But I am so grateful to be here now.</p>

   I made a chocolate cake to use up sourdough starter discard. 

 It’s not a pretty cake, and making an entire sheet cake to use up a little sourdough is perhaps overkill, but I’m happy with how it turned out.

<p>
 Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail. For my previous build, I used Gatsby to build a static site which I hosted on Netlify. The dynamic content of the site was stored in an instance of Ghost which was then pulled in at build-time.
</p>
<p>
 Overall, I was quite disappointed with Gatsby. I found the framework to be quite over-engineered. At one point, I found myself trying to resize a photo or something and it required some (to me at least) very complex configuration and some fancy graphQL query just to get the image to load. Another issue I have is with the offline plugin. Gatsby uses service workers to cache your entire site offline which can then be served by a service worker in case your users have spotty internet. Or no internet. The problem comes with removing this service worker once you move away from the framework. I needed to do quite a bit of research to figure out how to delete the service worker once I moved over to the new site since Gatsby chooses to use caching very aggressively which is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
 I understand why Gatsby makes these choices. Their goal is to make websites load insanely fast which I think they accomplish at a great cost of complexity. And they work hard to ensure that Gatsby sites score highly on the Google Lighthouse test. I have two issues with these goals. First, I'm not sure pursuing a high score on Lighthouse is a good goal to optimize for. Making a website load quickly is important, but Lighthouse will ding you for things using a particular Javascript library instead of their recommended smaller library. This is a game of cat-and-mouse which has little benefit beyond speeding up your website (which is important). Second, the amount of complexity that Gatsby introduces will likely slow down the development of your site and stifle your creativity. I can't comment on the experience of using Gatsby in the context of a larger team, but for me I know it led to making fewer improvements to the site because of the complexity.
</p>
<p>
 As for Ghost as a headless CMS – I think there are some limitations there. Overall, Ghost is a great platform. It's reliable and usable and has a good writing experience. I do think that their push into the JAMStack fad was mostly a marketing play since some limitations were never addressed even after several years. I would definitely use Ghost again, just not as a headless CMS. I would use it how it was primarily designed to be used.
</p>
<p>
 So why did I choose Django and Wagtail? Well, I've been using Django on and off for a long time. Probably 7 years at this point. The framework is reliable and seriously productive. Wagtail is built as a Django "app" so it's very familiar to me and it's very powerful. Overall, I'm content with the developer experience so far. I think the admin interface that is used to publish content could use some work. It's functional but frankly it's pretty ugly. Especially compared to something like Statamic which has been getting some attention lately.
</p>
<p>
 It's been a while since I've run my blog with server-rendered pages with dynamic content as opposed to a static site published to a CDN. I think the fact that I can log into a dashboard and publish content is so much more ergonomic from a writing and publishing perspective that I'm more likely to write more. Compared to the process of building a static site and deploying an update, it's quite nice. The downside, obviously, is that I need to worry again about load on the site and downtime during traffic spikes. I'm hopeful that this is something that I can avoid by using caching and a CDN. The site now has virtually no javascript. Compared to Gatsby this is a big change. We'll see how it turns out but my theory is that I should be able to achieve similar speeds (good enough anyway) using some clever caching and a CDN. Browsers are pretty good at rendering plain HTML after all.

For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After a cup of menstrual blood went flying across the Senate floor, I had assumed 2019 would be California’s wildest legislative session for a while. Covid-19 proved me unfortunately wrong. The Legislative process, calendar and agenda was quickly thrown into the dumpster fire of March and everyone turned back to the white&nbsp;board.</p><p>When the Legislature returned from its two-month long “stay at home” recess in May, it passed a stripped-down state budget which reflected lower revenues given the pandemic-induced recession. They then began prioritizing and shelving hundreds of bills that would no longer make the cut in the truncated legislative calendar. Faced with less time to hold hearings and less money to spend on new proposals, legislators shelved an estimated three-quarters of the bills introduced at the beginning of the two-year&nbsp;session.</p><p>Here’s what happened for BAC’s blockchain/crypto sponsored bills:</p><p>AB 953 (Ting, San Francisco), which would have allowed state and local taxes to be paid with stablecoins, was sadly withdrawn, lacking a clear Covid-19&nbsp;nexus.</p><p>AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next&nbsp;year.</p><p>AB 2150 (Calderon, Whittier) spun through several dizzying iterations. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition worked closely with Assemblymember Calderon’s office to suggest amended language that would have directed the Department of Business Oversight to study the applicability of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce’s Proposal to an intrastate safe harbor. An idea that in previous years seemed far fetched suddenly had political legs and was well received by the agency and several committees. It died in the Senate Appropriations Committee along with nearly everything else that had a significant price tag or wasn’t urgently related to the pandemic.</p><p>Fruitful discussions with the DBO about crypto regulation were well timed, however. Given the microscope on consumer protections due to the economic distress caused by the pandemic, the agency received a $19.2 million allocation and a new name: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (CDFPI- much worse acronym&nbsp;imo).</p><p>HERE’S THE PART YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO:</p><p>With this new agency budget/mission, comes a very likely change in the way cryptocurrency is regulated in <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1864">CA. AB 1864</a> does a few&nbsp;things:</p>  Establishes a Financial Technology Innovation Office based in San Francisco  Requires the department to promulgate rules regarding registration requirements  Charges this department with regulating currently unregulated financial services including issuers of stored value or such&nbsp;business  <p>This marks a departure from the agency’s previous approach. Virtual currency businesses did not have any separate registration requirements or the need to apply for a money transmitter license. BAC participated in stakeholder calls this summer about the agency’s expansion and we are continuing to engage with the agency about how these registration requirements will be created. Cryptocurrency businesses need to understand that the agency has been given the authority to create these standards without going back to the legislature, so early engagement is&nbsp;key.</p><p>Interested in joining our coalition and having a seat at the table? Contact: <a href="mailto:ally@blockadvocacy.org">ally@blockadvocacy.org</a></p><p>BAC has previously facilitated educational workshops with the Department of Business Oversight and hosted roundtables with Gov. Newsom, Treasurer Ma and the Legislature to build an understanding of the importance of the blockchain industry in&nbsp;CA.</p>

<p>How to enable the Enterprise to move from existing centralized or federated identity access management systems to a decentralized model was the topic in the 15th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup*. &nbsp;In both the private and public sector the capital investments in IAMs runs into the billions of dollars, for decentralized identity models to make serious inroads in this sector providing a of roadmap or transition journey that both educates and enables the enterprise to make the move is required. </p><p>In our 15th event we discussed the routes &nbsp;being taken by Raonsecure and IdRamp. &nbsp;Both Raonsecure and IdRamp are being successful in making the introduction of &nbsp;decentralized identity concepts to the market and helping their customers start on this transition journey. </p><p>Alex David (Senior Manager, Raonsecure) started with brief update on the forces driving decentralized identifiers in the Korean market and then presented Raonsecure’s Omnione product. &nbsp;In keeping with the theme on the ‘bridging’ to bring DIDs and VCs into the market Alex went through six different pilots, &nbsp;and proof of concept solutions that Omnione has implemented in the Korean market. &nbsp;These include working with the Korean Military Manpower Association on DID based authentication and issuing of verifiable credentials (VCs) to Korean veterans to the use of DIDs for driverless car identification in an autonomous vehicle pilot in Sejong, Korea. </p><p>Mike Vesey (CEO, IdRamp) introduced IdRamp and discussed their core objective of bringing DIDs and VCs into the enterprise market by creating a ’non-frightening’ educational path to adoption of decentralized identity. &nbsp;IdRamp is a session based transactional gateway (no logging) to all things identity, providing common service delivery and compliance and consent management across identity platforms. &nbsp;They are not an identity service provider but resemble more closely as a digital notary in the generation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. &nbsp;The service integration capability of IdRamp was demonstrated with the use of employee issued verifiable credentials to authenticate to a enterprise service (in this case a Zoom session login). &nbsp; </p><p>Finally, the seed of an upcoming event was planted. &nbsp;As with any new technology market breaking through the ’noise’ of everyday life is very difficult. &nbsp;This is no different for DIDs and VCs. &nbsp;You will have to watch the recording to get the topic….&nbsp; </p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/472937478">https://vimeo.com/472937478</a> </p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:05:04 - State of DIDs in South Korea</p>  <p>0:13:29 - Introducing Omnione</p>  <p>0:24:00 - DIDs and VCs in action in South Korea</p>  <p>0:51:18 - Introduction to IdRamp </p>  <p>1:04:00 - Interactive demo on IdRamp </p>  <p>1:08:00 - Wallets and compatibility</p>  <p>1:11:00 - Service integration demo &amp; discussion</p>  <p>1:31:57 - Upcoming events</p>  <p>For more information on Raonsecure Omnione:&nbsp;<a href="https://omnione.net/en/main">https://omnione.net/en/main</a> </p><p>For more information on IdRamp:&nbsp;<a href="https://idramp.com/">https://idramp.com/</a> </p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

 MyData Canada Privacy Law Reform Submission <p>MyData Canada recently submitted a report to the Government of Ontario in response to its <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">consultation</a> for strengthening privacy protections in Ontario. You can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g03gwjdh76wllt9/MyData%20Canada%20Ontario%20Privacy%20Reform%20Submission%20%28Final%29.pdf?dl=0">download the submission</a> from the <a href="https://mydatacanada.webflow.io/">MyData Canada</a> site. I am a board member of MyData Global and a member of the MyData Canada hub. This is a brief summary of some of the recommendations in that report.</p><p>Part of what MyData Canada would like the province of Ontario to address is the current ‘gatekeeper model’ where each of us cede control to information about us under terms or privacy policies based on a flawed consent model. As the report puts it,</p><blockquote>Behind each of the gate-keepers (“data controllers” in GDPR terms) in the centralized model are thousands of intermediaries and data brokers invisible to the individuals whose data they process. Individuals’ personal data is used in ways they could not anticipate, and often without their awareness or even the opportunity to meaningfully consent.</blockquote><p>This needs to be fixed.</p> Background <p>Canada has a multi-jurisdictional privacy environment. That means that both levels of government have privacy commissioners and privacy laws. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, does not have a private sector privacy law. This leaves a number of categories of persons and organizations uncovered; don’t ask why, it’s a constitutional jurisdictional thing. Thus the consultation and submission. MyData Canada believes that,</p><blockquote>…our proposed approach will help accelerate the development and uptake of privacy- focused, human-centric innovation and ultimately serve to regain public trust and confidence in the digital economy.</blockquote> 2-Branch Privacy Reform <p>MyData Canada proposes a two branch approach to privacy law reform; a harmonization branch, and a transformation branch.</p>  The harmonization branch proposes an incremental approach to enable any new Ontario law to work harmoniously with other regimes, both in Canada and in the rest of the world. This branch is intended to ensure that Ontario is a low friction end point for cross border data flows with other data protection data. At the same time this branch will introduce a regulatory framework with a functional equivalency to the CCPA in the US and to the GDPR in the EU. In essence, this broad framework skates to where the puck will be with respect to global data protection laws.  The digital transformation branch proposes to simultaneously create a ‘next-generation’ regulatory space within Ontario. This space will allow Ontario based companies or organization to create new forward looking and individually centred solutions. To continue the metaphor, this branch will allow breakaway solutions that will disrupt the current platform information gatekeepers and return autonomy to individuals.   Harmonize Up <p>Rather than seeking a lowest common denominator or participating in a race to the bottom, MyData recommends harmonizing ‘up’ including the following:</p>  Adopting a principled and risk based approach to privacy regulation;  Coordinating with other provinces and the federal government, perhaps including a pan-Canadian council of information and privacy commissioners;  Aligning with Convention 108 and 108+;  Increased enforcement powers; and  Implementation support for businesses and organizations for compliance.   Digital Transformation <p>Create a regulatory environment to reward first movers with privacy enhancing technologies that put people at the centre of their own data. Recommendations include:</p>  Creating a privacy technology incubator;  Host regulatory sandboxes and hackathons;  Grants and other incentives for privacy ‘retrofits’;  Create and support a regime for seals, badges, and privacy trust marks;  Foster interoperability by requiring api or similar means to prevent or counter ‘platform dominance’ and network affects; and  Create up-skilling programs for a multi-disciplinary privacy engineering centre of excellence in Ontario.   Summing up <p>The above is just a summary of the first recommendations of the report. It includes further recommendations on:</p>  Taking a comprehensive approach to move beyond compliance;  Adopting a Consumer Protection and Human Rights oriented regulatory enforcement model  Adopting a multi-stakeholder and inclusive model to spur innovation and open data  <p>If you find this interesting please download and share the report.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

    name: Release on GitHub and PGXN
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    env:
      # Required to create GitHub release and upload the bundle.
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Bundle the Release
      id: bundle
      run: pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      env:
        # Required to release on PGXN.
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
      run: pgxn-release
    - name: Create GitHub Release
      id: release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body: |
          Changes in this Release
          - First Change
          - Second Change          
    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        # Reference the upload URL and bundle name from previous steps.
        upload_url: ${{ steps.release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should look like this, with
<code>$filename</code> representing the name of the release file, usually
<code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>::set-output name=bundle::$filename
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

  This is a flight of fancy written a week and a half before the US election. I hope it proves to be bad speculation.

 What if? <p>Here’s a speculative fiction plot, NOT a prediction, prompted by the news frenzy of US presidential politics, influenced by my own contrarian nature. If you read history and science fiction we live in an interesting time. Whether it will be a historical turning point in US and global history is not something that we are privileged to know at the time. But if this is a historic turning point I would like to plot out a story based on where we are, not much more than a week before the US election between President Trump and former Vice-President Biden. Let’s ignore that reality strains credulity, and proceed from there. Nothing below should be read as representative of my own views or preferences.</p> Biden wins? <p>The Democrats win the House and the Senate. Joe Biden wins the popular vote but the electoral college remains unclear pending delayed counts for mail-in ballots. Election night ends with both candidates being declared the victor by different media outlets.</p> Taking it to the streets <p>On the day after the election Trump claims to be the legitimate President based on claims of a rigged election. From the White House he asks his supporters to come out to defend his victory. Activists from both sides take to the streets in every major American city. The national guard takes sides, but on different sides in different states or cities, and civic order breaks down.</p> COVID confusion <p>The electoral college convenes and declares Biden to be the winner. Trump and his staff leave the White House under political pressure. President elect Biden is then revealed to be ill with COVID, increasing uncertainty. Before the inauguration Biden dies in hospital, and Kamala Harris is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, with Pete Buttigieg as her vice-president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are prominently on display at the inauguration even as conflict rages on the streets of America.</p> Consolidation <p>President Harris deploys the military, aided by private military contractors, to establish order on the streets. Former President Trump flees the country to Moscow, declaring a government in exile. The Harris administration declares a continuing state of military emergency with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The state of emergency delays elections until the ‘emergency is over’.</p> Epilogue <p>10 years after the start of the Harris dynasty, the United States has become the Democratic Republic of America, run by the United Democratic Party under Grand President Harris. The former Republican Party has been absorbed into the United Democratic Party. Wall Street has become a financial back-water. The US overseas military presence has been dramatically reduced because of domestic military requirements. There is an underground resistance, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most wanted fugitive in American. Climate change is at 2.5 degrees and increasing. China has become the dominant global power, dominating the United Nation, based on its Belt and Road initiative.</p> End note <p>I hope that this will prove to be really bad speculation. The past is prologue but it is our job to create the history we want to inhabit. I wish my American friends a successful and well-run election with a successful and peaceful transition of power if the Biden-Harris ticket wins.</p>

<p>You don’t walk around wearing a name badge.&nbsp; Except maybe at a conference, or some other enclosed space where people need to share their names and affiliations with each other. But otherwise, no.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because you don’t need a name badge for people who know you—or for people who don’t.</p>
<p>Here in civilization we typically reveal information about ourselves to others on a need-to-know basis: “I’m over 18.” “I’m a citizen of Canada.” “Here’s my Costco card.” “Hi, I’m Jane.” We may or may not present credentials in these encounters. And in most we don’t say our names. “Michael” being a common name, a guy called “Mike” may tell a barista his name is “Clive” if the guy in front of him just said&nbsp;his name is “Mike.” (My given name is David, a name so common that another David re-branded me Doc. Later I learned that his middle name was David and his first name was Paul. True story.)</p>
<p>This is how civilization works in the offline world.</p>
<p>Kim Cameron wrote up how this ought to work, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Laws of Identity</a>, first published in 2004. The Laws include&nbsp;personal control and consent,&nbsp;minimum disclosure for a constrained use,&nbsp;justifiable parties, and&nbsp;plurality of operators. Again, we have those in here in the offline world where your body is reading this on a screen.</p>
<p>In the online world behind that screen, however, you have a monstrous mess. I won’t go into why. The results are what matter, and you already know those anyway.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d like to share what (at least for now) I think is the best approach to the challenge of presenting verifiable credentials in the digital world. It’s called KERI, and you can read about it here:&nbsp;<a href="https://keri.one/">https://keri.one/</a>. If you’d like to contribute to the code work, that’s here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/</a>.</p>
<p>I’m still just getting acquainted with it, in sessions at <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a>. The main thing is that I’m sure it matters. So I’m sharing that sentiment, along with those links.</p>

 Filling in the&nbsp;GNAP <p>About a year ago I wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">arguing for creating the next generation of the OAuth protocol</a>. That article, and some of the other writing around it, has been picked up recently, and so people have been asking me what’s the deal with XYZ, TxAuth, OAuth 3.0, and anything else mentioned there. As you can imagine, a lot has happened in the last year and we’re in a very different place.</p><p>The short version is that there is now a new working group in the IETF: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/about/">Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (gnap)</a>. The mailing list is still at <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/txauth/">txauth</a>, and the first WG draft is available online now as <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00</a>.</p> How Are These All&nbsp;Related? <p>OK, so there’s GNAP, but now you’re probably asking yourself what’s the difference between GNAP and XYZ, or TxAuth, or OAuth 3.0. With the alphabet soup of names, it’s certainly confusing if you haven’t been following along the story in the last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">XYZ project</a> started as a concrete proposal for how a security protocol could work post-OAuth 2.0. It was based on experience with a variety of OAuth-based and non-OAuth-based deployments, and on conversations with developers from many different backgrounds and walks. This started out as a test implementation of ideas, which was later written down into a website and even later incorporated into an IETF individual draft. The most important thing about XYZ is that it has always been implementation-driven: things almost always started with code and moved forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>This led to the project itself being called OAuth.XYZ after the website, and later just XYZ. When it came time to write the specification, this document was named after a core concept in the architecture: Transactional Authorization. The mailing list at IETF that was created for discussing this proposal was named after this draft: TxAuth. As such, the draft, project, and website were all referred to as either XYZ or TxAuth depending on who and when you&nbsp;asked.</p><p>After months of discussion and debate (because naming things is really hard), the working group settled on GNAP, and GNAP is now the official name of both the working group and the protocol the group is working on publishing.</p><p>As for OAuth 3.0? Simply put, it <a href="https://oauth.net/3/">canonically does not exist</a>. The GNAP work is being done by many members of the OAuth community, but not as part of the OAuth working group. While there may be people who refer to GNAP as OAuth 3.0, and it does represent a similar shift forward that OAuth 2.0 did, GNAP is not part of the OAuth protocol family. It’s not out of the question for the OAuth working group decides to adopt GNAP or something else in the future to create OAuth 3.0, but right now that is not on the&nbsp;table.</p> The GNAP&nbsp;Protocol <p>Not only is GNAP an official working group, but the GNAP protocol has also been <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">defined in an official working group draft document</a>. This draft represents the output of several months of concerted effort by a design team within the GNAP working group. The protocol in this document is not exactly the same as the earlier XYZ/TxAuth protocol, since it pulled from multiple sources and discussions, but there are some familiar&nbsp;pieces.</p><p>The upshot is that GNAP is now an official draft protocol.</p><p>GNAP is also not a final protocol by any stretch. If you read through the draft, you’ll notice that there are a large number of things tagged as “Editor’s Notes” and similar commentary throughout, making up a significant portion of the page count. These represent portions of the protocol or document where the design team identified some specific decisions and choices that need to be made by the working group. The goal was to present a set of initial choices along with rationale and context for&nbsp;them.</p><p>But that’s not to say that the only flexible portions are those marked in the editor’s notes. What’s important about the gnap-00 document is that it’s a starting point for the working group discussion. It gives the working group something concrete to talk about and debate instead of a blank page of unknown possibilities (and monsters). With this document in hand, the working group can and will change the protocol and how it’s presented over the specification’s lifecycle.</p> The Immediate Future <p>Now that GNAP is an active standard under development, XYZ will shift into being an open-source implementation of GNAP from here out. As of the time of publication, we are actively working to implement all of the changes that were introduced during the design team process. Other developers are gearing up to implement the gnap-00 draft as well, and it will be really interesting to try to plug these into each other to test interoperability at a first&nbsp;stage.</p><p>TxAuth and Transactional Authorization are functionally retired as names for this work, though the mailing list at IETF will remain txauth so you might still hear reference to that from time to time because of&nbsp;this.</p><p>And as stated above, OAuth 3.0 is not a real thing. Which is fine, since OAuth 2.0 isn’t going anywhere any time soon. The work on GNAP is shifting into a new phase that is really just starting. I think we’ve probably got a couple years of active work on this specification, and a few more years after that before anything we do really sees any kind of wide adoption on the internet. These things take a long time and a lot of work, and it’s my hope to see a diverse and engaged group building things&nbsp;out!</p>

As a byproduct of the pandemic, the world is collectively facing persistent supply chain disruption and unpredictability. This coupled with increasing traceability regulations is driving an urgency for importers to fortify their supply chains. COVID-19 especially has highlighted the need for preventing counterfeit goods and having certainty about your suppliers (and their suppliers).</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/"></a>Transmute Co-founders, Karyl Fowler &amp; Orie Steele @ SXSW&nbsp;2019<p>Transmute’s software is upgrading trade documentation today to give importers a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic, global marketplace. Leveraging decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) tech with existing cloud-based systems, Transmute is able to offer digital product and supplier credentials that are traceable across an entire logistics ecosystem. From point of origin to end customer, we are unlocking unprecedented visibility into customers’ supplier networks.</p><blockquote>Disrupting a highly regulated and old-fashioned industry is complex, and an intentional first step in our go-to-market strategy has been balancing both the needs of regulators and commercial customers.</blockquote><p>This is why we’re incredibly proud to join forces with our lead investors at <a href="https://medium.com/leadership-prevails">Moonshots Capital</a>, a VC firm focused on investing in extraordinary leaders. We look forward to growing alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyperdew/">Kelly Perdew</a> (our newest Board of Directors member) and his founding partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unleashcraig/">Craig Cummings</a>. They’re a team of military veterans and serial entrepreneurs with extensive success selling into government agencies and enterprises.</p><p>We are equally proud to be joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-hadjipateras-64614670/">Marina Hadjipateras</a> and the team at <a href="http://www.trailmix.vc/">TMV</a>, a New York-based firm focused on funding pioneering, early-stage founders. Between their commitment to diverse teams, building sustainable futures and their deep expertise in global shipping and logistics, we feel more than ready to take on global trade with this&nbsp;firm.</p><p>The support of Kerr Tech Investments, led by Josh and Michael Kerr, further validates our company’s innovative approach to data exchange. <a href="https://joshkerr.com/">Josh</a> is a seasoned entrepreneur, an e-signature expert and has been advising us since Transmute’s inception.</p><p>Closing our seed round coincides with another exciting announcement: our recent launch of Phase II work with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science &amp; Technology’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) to enhance “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/08/news-release-dhs-awards-198k-raw-material-import-tracking">transparency, automation and security in processing the importation of raw materials</a>” like&nbsp;steel.</p><p>Our vision is more broad than just improving how trade gets done, and steel imports are just the beginning. We’re inserting revolutionary changes into the fabric of how enterprises manage product and supplier identity, effectively building a bridge — or a fulcrum, rather — towards new revenue streams and business models across industries.</p><p>Last — but absolutely not least — I want to give a personal shoutout to my core teammates; startups are a team sport, and our team is stacked! Tremendous congratulations as these backers will accelerate our progress in a huge way. And finally, thanks also to our stellar team of advisors who commit significant time coaching us through blind spots as we bring Transmute’s product to&nbsp;market.</p> Also, we’re&nbsp;Hiring! <p>Expanding our capacity to meet customer demand is our top nearterm priority. We’re adding a few <a href="https://angel.co/company/transmute-industries-1/jobs/1021940-senior-full-stack-engineer">engineering</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/company/transmute-industries-1/jobs/1022038-product-manager">product</a> roles to our core team in Austin, TX, so <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">please apply</a> or spread the&nbsp;word!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-closes-2m-seed-round-a0a2e6c90467">Transmute Closes $2M Seed Round</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The goal here is to obsolesce this brilliant <a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice">poster</a> by <a href="https://despair.com/">Despair.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice"></a></p>
<p>I got launched on that path a couple months ago, when I&nbsp;got this email from &nbsp;<a href="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:" title="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:">The_New_Yorker at e-mail.condenast.com:</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why did they “need” a “confirmation” to a subscription which, best I could recall, was last renewed early this year?</p>
<p>So I looked at the links.</p>
<p>The “renew,” Confirmation Needed” and “Discounted Subscription” links all go to a page with a URL that began with&nbsp;<a href="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp" title="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp">https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs…</a>, followed by a lot of tracking cruft. Here’s a screen shot of that one, cut short of where one filled in a credit card number. Note the price:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was sure I had been paying $80-something per year, for years. As I also recalled, this was a price one could only obtain by calling the 800 number at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">NewYorker.com</a>.</p>
<p>Or somewhere. After digging around, I found it at<br>
&nbsp;<a href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp" title="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp">https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/accoun…</a>, which is where the link to Customer Care under My Account on the NewYorker website goes. It also required yet another login.</p>
<p>So, when I told the representative at the call center that I’d rather not “confirm” a year for a “discount” that probably wasn’t, she said I could renew for the $89.99 I had paid in the past, and that the deal would be good&nbsp; through February of 2022. I said fine, let’s do that. So I gave her my credit card, said this was way too complicated, and added that a single simple subscription price would be better.&nbsp;She replied,&nbsp; “Never gonna happen.” Let’s repeat that:</p>
<p>Never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Then I got this by email:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This appeared to confirm the subscription I already had. To see if that was the case, I went back to the&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> website and looked under the Account Summary tab, where it said this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this means that I last renewed on February 3 of this year, and what I did on the phone in August was commit to paying $89.99/year until February 10 of 2022.</p>
<p>If that’s what happened, all my call did was extend my existing subscription. Which was fine, but why require a phone call for that?</p>
<p>And WTF was that “Account Confirmation Required” email about? I assume it was&nbsp;bait to switch existing subscribers into paying $50 more per year.</p>
<p>Then there was this, at the bottom of the Account summary page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This might explain why I stopped getting Vanity Fair, which I suppose I should still be getting.</p>
<p>So I clicked on”Reactivate&nbsp;and got a login page where the login I had used to get this far didn’t work.</p>
<p>After other failing efforts that I neglected to write down, I decided to go back to the New Yorker site and work my way back through two logins to the same page, and then click Reactivate one more time.&nbsp;Voila! ::::::</p>
<p></p>
<p>So now I’ve got one page that tells me I’m good to March 2021 next to a link that takes me to another page that says I ordered 12 issues last December and I can “start” a new subscription for $15 that would begin nine months ago. This is how one “reactivates” a subscription?&nbsp; OMFG.</p>
<p>I’m also not going into the hell of moving the print subscription back and forth between the two places where I live. Nor will I bother now, in October, to ask why I haven’t seen another copy of Vanity Fair. (Maybe they’re going to the other place. Maybe not. I don’t know, and I’m too weary to try finding out.)</p>
<p>I want to be clear here that I am not sharing this to complain. In fact, I don’t want&nbsp;The New Yorker,&nbsp; Vanity Fair, Wred, Condé Nast (their parent company) or&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> to do a damn thing. They’re all <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fubar">FUBAR</a>. By design. (<a href="https://www.gapingvoidart.com/gallery/dinosaur/">Bonus link.</a>)</p>
<p>Nor do I want any action out of Spectrum, SiriusXM, Dish Network or the other subscription-based whatevers whose customer disservice systems have recently soaked up many hours of my life.</p>
<p>See, with too many subscription systems (especially ones for periodicals), FUBAR is the norm. A matter of course. Pro forma. Entrenched. A box outside of which nobody making, managing or working in those systems can think.</p>
<p>This is why, when an alien idea appears, for example from a loyal customer just wanting a single and simple damn price, the response is “Never gonna happen.”</p>
<p>This is also why the subscription fecosystem can only be turned into an ecosystem from the outside. Our side. The subscribers’ side.</p>
<p>I’ll explain how at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, which we created for <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/">exactly that purpose</a>. Stay tuned for that.</p>

 Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraud 



<p>Digital Identity in an Online WorldThe isolation of worldwide lockdowns this year have presented criminals with new opportunities for phishing, and this only adds to already existing trends in the rise of synthetic IDs, account takeover and SIM swap fraud. This panel will explore solutions which utilise digital identity to fight back against the fraudsters.</p>

<p>The data on this site is super interesting. Whatever is running the site is not great. It’s some sort of out of the box Microsoft thing including default loading animations.</p>

<p>But! It aims to be a sort of Wikipedia. I’ve signed up to be a contributor and I hope that this can be built on and be licensed for re-use.</p>

<p>I did a search for “Vancouver” and found only one entry, so my used cookbook collection may be able to add a handful more. It does say it only wants pre-1940 cookbooks, but it’s unclear why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It provides a bird’s-eye view of long-term trends in European and American cuisines, from shifting trade routes and dining habits to culinary fads. Search “cupcakes,” for example, and you’ll find the term may have first popped up in Mrs. Putnam’s Receipt Book And Young Housekeeper’s Assistant, a guide for ladies running middle-class households in the 1850s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Super interesting to me. Looking forward to see how this evolves.</p>

<p>IIF Annual Membership Meeting – Digital Identity panel</p>



<p>In the accelerated move to a digitalized world, new technology is changing how people are identified and what we know about them, in an environment where trust has to be built differently from physical interactions. As well as presenting opportunities for efficiency and access, this also drives debate about roles, responsibilities, standards, and privacy. These issues will grow as new technologies in data, sensors, 5G connected devices, and biometrics come online with platforms of systemic scale. This session will discuss how technology and market trends are changing the costs, responsibilities, business models, and opportunities in identity and authentication, and how financial services firms can build on compliance capabilities to create new services and revenue streams.</p>



<p>Tuesday, October 13,&nbsp;from&nbsp;1:00pm London / 2:00pm Madrid / 8:00pm Singapore / 9:00pm Tokyo (55 minutes)</p>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the Python Package Index so that others can install and use your work.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

 <p>
 In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  
   Py
  
  thon
  
   P
  
  ackage
  
   I
  
  ndex
 </a>
 so that others can install and use your work. Once the package is available on PyPI, anyone will be able to run
 <code>
  pip install
 </code>
 to install the package on their machine. This allows people to import your code into their own modules as a library, but you can also release command-line tools via PyPI; I will show you how to do both.
</p>
<p>
 
  note
 
 : these instructions are Mac and Linux centric. I don't think they would be much different, but I don't do much development work on Windows so I don't know the nuances of that platform.
</p>
 
 The Code
 
<p>
 This first thing you need is some code to publish! I have created a minimal project that you can use as a starting point. You can find the code
 <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/python-package-boilerplate">
  here
 </a>
 . Let's take a look.
</p>
<p>
 First let's walk through the folder structure:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9 
     
   
   
     
      <code>├── README.md
├── package_boilerplate
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── importable.py
├── requirements.txt
├── scripts
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── boilerplate-cli
├── setup.py
└── version.py
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 These are all of the files inside of the python package. First, we have a directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 . This directory contains all of the code for our module. All of the files outside of this directory are metadata for the package itself and are used in the package publishing process, for installing dependencies, and stuff like that. We'll go through the other files shortly.
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 is
 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">
  markdown
 </a>
 formatted text containing details about the package. This content is usually rendered as HTML and made visible in places like GitHub and PyPI.
</p>
<p>
 If we look inside of
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages">
  <code>
   __init__.py
  </code>
 </a>
 , we see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

def main():
        print(f"{fg('dark_orange')}{attr('bold')}You called me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 We're doing a couple of things here: &nbsp;first, we import a library called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colored/">
  colored
 </a>
 . Colored is a tool to colourize your program's terminal output. It's fun!
</p>
<p>
 So basically, this file will print some coloured text to the terminal if
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 is called. If you continue reading, you will see how we can publish this as a command-line tool through
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 !
</p>
<p>
 Next, let's look inside of
 <code>
  importable.py
 </code>
 :
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

print(f"{fg('orchid')}{attr('bold')}You imported me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Again, we're just print some coloured text to the terminal but this time we can import this code in an external module. The text will be printed as soon as the file is imported since the code is not contained in a function.
</p>
<p>
 Ok, so that is the logic of our program. Let's continue down the folder structure to see what else is needed to make this publishable.
</p>
<p>
 The next file is
 <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">
  requirements.txt
 </a>
 . If you've ever written a python module that depends on other external python packages, then you may be familiar with this file. The file is used to tell
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 which versions of which modules it should install all at once if you run
 <code>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 </code>
 . Python packages are no different; if they rely on dependencies,
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 needs to know what to install. We'll reference this file in
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Next, we have the
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 directory. The folder name doesn't matter and isn't required, but I prefer to keep things separate and organized. Inside of this folder we have a file called
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 . Notice how we don't give the file an extension like
 <code>
  .py
 </code>
 and we used the naming convention
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 instead of
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli
 </code>
 . This is because this is the file that will be installed as a command-line program in the users
 <code>
  PATH
 </code>
 . We want the the user to be able to invoke the program by running
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 and not
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli.py
 </code>
 because that is the expected convention for command-line programs.
</p>
<p>
 Inside of this file we have this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5 
     
   
   
     
      <code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from package_boilerplate import main

main()
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The first line is important because we have to tell the user's operating system what kind of code this it because it doesn't have a file extension. This is called a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">
  shebang
 </a>
 . Next we import the entrypoint into the program from
 <code>
  __init__.py
 </code>
 that we named
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 and we run the function.
</p>
<p>
 Calling this function kicks off our program! Right now it only prints text to the terminal, but it could be the entrypoint into a more complicated program. We will reference this file in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 section to make it available as a command-line program for the user.
</p>
<p>
 The most important part of this process is the
 <code>

                long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
        )
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 First we import a few utilities called
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 .
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 is built into python, but
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 needs to be installed which we will go over in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next, we get the python metadata out of the file
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 and obtain the current version number
 <code>
  VERSION
 </code>
 . This file just contains the current version number of the package you are publishing. We'll go over why it's split into its own file in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next,
 <code>
  long_description
 </code>
 is pulled out of the content from
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 . Using the content from the readme means that this description only needs to live in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Then, I've added a helper function called
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 . The python
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 format expects that
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 property contains a list of dependencies that this package relies on. Since it's burdensome to maintain a
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 file with your dependencies as well as the dependencies in a list here, this
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 function simple imports the dependencies from
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 so that you only need to maintain them in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, we call
 <code>
  setup
 </code>
 with some values to define the package. The section that specifies
 <code>
  packages=find_packages()
 </code>
 is pointing to the directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 and is discovered automatically by this function. Name and version are used in the PyPI directory listing and also are what people reference when they want to install the package.
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 pulls in the list of requirements from the
 <code>
  requirement.txt
 </code>
 file.
 <code>
  python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3"
 </code>
 is the version of python that the user must have installed. And finally,
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 is where you specify the command line program that should be installed for the user.
</p>
<p>
 There are other values that you should set as well such as
 <code>
  description
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  author
 </code>
 . You can read more about the setup values available
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html">
  here
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The last file,
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 is quite small. This file is used for two things: first, it is imported in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 module above to use as the package version; and second, the version value is stored in the
 <code>
  __version__
 </code>
 attribute.
 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification">
  This is recommend
 </a>
 so that the package version can be discovered programatically.
</p>
<p>
 
  A tip
 
 : as you are working, you can install your package locally before you even publish it. This way, you will know that it works before submitting it to PyPI. To install the package locally, you can run
 <code>
  pip install -e .
 </code>
 in the package directory.
</p>
 
 Publishing Your Package
 
<p>
 So you've written your package and you want to publish it! We're almost there. There are just a few more steps to publish your package.
</p>
<p>
 The first thing will want to do is install a tool called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">
  twine
 </a>
 by running
 <code>
  pip install twine
 </code>
 . Twine is a tool for publishing Python packages on PyPI. Then, we also need to install
 <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
  setuptools
 </a>
 since we are using it in our setup script:
 <code>
  pip install setuptools
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Now, we need to create a
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package">
  distribution package
 </a>
 that we will publish. To do this, run: &nbsp;
 <code>
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
 </code>
 which will create
 <code>
  build
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  dist
 </code>
 directories.
</p>
<p>
 Once the build has completed, we can check for any errors or warnings using
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 . Run
 <code>
  twine check dist/*
 </code>
 &nbsp;to check the distribution package for errors. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Checking distribution dist/package_boilerplate-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl: Passed
Checking distribution dist/package-boilerplate-1.0.0.tar.gz: Passed
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Once this is done, we want to publish our package to the PyPI test site. We can publish to
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org">
  test.pypi.org
 </a>
 before we publish to the real index to make sure everything looks good! To do this, we can instruct
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 to use a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
 </code>
</p>
<p>
 If we run this now, we will see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Enter your username:
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Looks like we need to create an account! So head over to the
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org/account/register/">
  registration page
 </a>
 for the PyPI test site and create an account. If you run the command again and enter your username and password hopefully you should see:
</p>

5

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 If you do, congratulations! You have successfully published your package!
</p>
<p>
 
  Note:
 
 make sure your package name is unique!
</p>
<p>
 All that remains is to publish your package to the official
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  pypi.org
 </a>
 . To do this, you just need to create another account there and publish your package without specifying a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload dist/*
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Installing Your Package
 
<p>
 Now that your package is installed, I bet you want to install it to see how it works! Let's install our package from the PyPI test index:
 <code>
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . In the future, if we don't provide the
 <code>
  --index-url
 </code>
 parameter, then we would be requesting a package from the official index. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

6

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 If so, then the package is installed! So let's use it. Remember that command-line program we created? Well now we should be able to run it from anywhere by calling invoking the name of the script:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>$ boilerplate-cli
</code>

 </a>
 It works! And we even get the coloured text.
</p>
<p>
 Once you publish your package to the official PyPI index, you will be able to install the package by running
 <code>
  pip install package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . Of course, you would want to choose a different name for the package throughout the process and use that here.
</p>
 
<p>
 I hope this guide is helpful. If something doesn't make sense, please let me know.

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.jonudell.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

Happening in parallel, Ethereum’s decentralized financial protocols are maturing from lofty experiments, to hardened primitives. The opportunity for cross-chain collaboration is immense. As I’ve said, <a href="https://sepia.substack.com/p/on-defi-frontends">DeFi and DWeb are complementary revolutions</a>. The budding symbiosis between Handshake and Ethereum is a powerful one worth continually exploring in detail.</p><p>I’ve already touched on how Handshake namespace strengthens decentralized finance through cryptographically secure frontends. </p><blockquote><p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) movement contends to offer open and permissionless markets. But DeFi does not operate in a vacuum. In practice, frontend websites and applications remain centralized choke points to backend protocols. Decentralized finance is not truly decentralized until the whole stack is.</p><p><a href="https://sepia.substack.com/p/on-defi-frontends">On DeFi Frontends</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s now explore the flipside of this relationship — how decentralized finance enhances Handshake’s namespace economy. Decentralized exchanges unlock greater liquidity for the HNS currency. Meanwhile, smart contracts introduce openness and programmability into Handshake registrars. In both areas, efforts are underway to implement Handshake tooling on Ethereum.</p>    HNS on Ethereum <p>HNS is the currency of the Handshake blockchain. It is money for the namespace economy. And in order to scale in this role, HNS needs highly liquid markets. Liquidity begets price discovery and price discovery begets speculative investment, all of which is necessary for sustaining public blockchains.</p><p>Siloed on its own chain, the path to liquidity entails bootstrapping its own on-ramps and market makers. While Namebase is a known brand and simple interface for buying and trading HNS, all centralized exchanges suffer from the same regulatory and UX frictions; as well as the classic chicken and egg problem of also needing to grow its userbase as a new startup. Larger centralized exchanges will not even list HNS until there is sufficient liquidity to do so. Price discovery is held back by the need to roll your own exchanges.</p><p>On the other hand, Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges like Uniswap are uniquely suited to source liquidity for nascent crypto assets. Regulatory and UX burdened order books are replaced with open and incentivized liquidity pools. Ethereum assets can be traded by anyone, anywhere. Wrapped and trustless HNS are two ERC-20 implementations of Handshake. Both versions act like file formats of HNS that make the currency legible to the Ethereum network. Ethereum-legible HNS can leverage existing DeFi infrastructure to become a more liquid money. We are seeing the early stages of this as the first HNS was wrapped just this week through&nbsp;<a href="http://wrapply.io/">Wrapply</a>.</p><p>Once inside the Ethereum arena, HNS becomes a more useful asset. Earn yield on HNS by supplying it to liquidity pools. Borrow against your HNS position. Coordinate Handshake-focused DAOs around HNS treasuries. The list goes on.</p>    Namespace on Ethereum <p>The internet makes everyone a publisher. Ethereum makes everyone an investor. Now, Handshake makes everyone a name registrar as well.</p><p>For the first time, anyone can own their own top level domain and distribute subdomain space as they see fit. It is first worth considering emergent namespace patterns on Handshake. Top level domains may represent market categories, specific networks, or individual brands. Accordingly, some TLDs will open up subdomains to the public, some will allocated subdomains to users of their network, while others will reserve subdomains for themselves.</p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325425d2-f69a-48a5-8df3-ecb73153c919_1530x770.png"></a><p>A free market of TLDs that disrupts ICANN’s monopoly is in itself a feat of decentralization. Though, we can go further. Ethereum offers tooling that will make ‘fiat’ registrars feel antiquated in comparison. Smart contract registrars — that is, Handshake TLDs that manage subdomain markets on Ethereum — stand to be transparent, autonomous, and programmable.</p><p>The sophistication of Ethereum-based markets juxtaposed with the manual nature of simple name transfers for websites or social handles is staggering.</p><p>Consider how,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/blockchannel/on-foundation-markets-6405c30d071d">on Foundation</a>, a fraction of a tokenized t-shirt can be resold with correct profit splits distributed to the seller and creator programmatically. But I can’t even manage to contact the owner of a desired name on a top social network, let alone trust they would transfer it upon receipt of my payment.</p><p>The gap between fiat and crypto markets will only widen as the tools available to crypto-related applications make the UX increasingly more fluid and attractive for consumers.</p><p>Smart contract registrars can also trustlessly escrow payments for names. With this more secure foundation, registrars can build in added complexities. Dynamically priced registrars could sell subdomains across factors such as character length or order of name registration. Or top level domains could offer namedrops for users to claim their permanent, permissionless corner of a network.</p><p>Ethereum can not only iterate on how registrars sell subdomains, it can reshape the structure of registrars altogether.TLD ownership can be fractionalized, leaving names (and rights to subdomain renewal fees) to be owned by communities of users.&nbsp;Just as governance tokens are distributed to decentralize ownership of network backends, domain tokens can similarly be distributed to decentralize ownership of network frontends.&nbsp;<a href="http://realtydao.com/">RealtyDAO</a>&nbsp;is one project scratching the surface of what’s possible surrounding a tokenized namespace melding with the programmability of Ethereum.</p><p>We implicitly understand the value of namespace. More than mere legibility to a network, names carry a sense of social status, identity, and brand. We haven’t been able to act on this value and these ideas in meaningful ways. The interplay between Handshake and Ethereum unlocks a world of possibility.</p>    Symbiotic Protocols <p>Handshake and Ethereum are, yes, a symbiotic relationship, but more specifically a mutualistic one. Like species interactions, protocol interactions can fall into one of several symbiotic classifications — mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, or mimicry.</p><p>In&nbsp;mutualism, both species / protocols benefit. Decentralized namespace on Handshake benefits decentralized finance on Ethereum, and vice versa.</p><p>In&nbsp;commensalism, one benefits and the other is not significantly helped or harmed. Wrapped Bitcoin gains access to DeFi while Ethereum is largely unaffected.</p><p>In&nbsp;parasitism, one benefits while the other is harmed. “Ethereum-killers” accumulate liquidity (or don’t…) at the detriment of Ethereum.</p><p>In&nbsp;mimicry, one adopts distinct characteristics of the other, sometimes to provide mutual benefit and other times to exploit. ZCash and Bitcoin Cash are planned and contentious forks of Bitcoin, respectively.</p><p>I look at Handshake, Ethereum, and other public blockchains and see self-interested networks vying for survival in the cryptoverse. I may be overplaying the analogy of protocols and species. You don’t have to view liquidity as the lifeblood of cryptonetworks used to carry out their programming. Biological mental models or not, the point is we’re moving towards an interchain world. Protocol relationships are becoming increasingly intertwined. </p>

 <p>
 If you’ve ever worked on a large piece of software, I’m sure you’ve endured the pain of setting up a complex development environment. Installing and configuring a database, message broker, web server, worker processes, local smtp server, (and who knows what else!) is time consuming for every developer starting on a project. This guide will show you how to set up a docker development environment which will enable you and new developers to get up and running in minutes with even the most complex system. This will make your life much easier in the long run and get new developers up and running on the project much more quickly.
</p>
<p>
 In this guide, we’ll be using
 <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition">
  Docker Community Edition
 </a>
 and
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">
  Docker Compose
 </a>
 . You may want to read up on these tools a bit before proceeding.
</p>
<p>
 The code for the guide is available

 Installing Docker
 
<p>
 Grab Docker for your operating system
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community">
  here
 </a>
 . Docker is available for all modern operating systems. For most users, this will also include Docker Compose. Once installed, keep Docker running in the background to use Docker commands!
</p>
 
 Dockerfile Example
 
<p>
 Your
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">
  Dockerfile
 </a>
 is the blueprint for your container. You’ll want to use your Dockerfile to create your desired environment. This includes installing any language runtimes you might need and installing any dependencies your project relies on. Luckily, most languages have a
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from">
  base image
 </a>
 that you can inherit. We’ll get dig into this further with the Dockerfile example below.
</p>
<p>
 Your Dockerfile doesn’t need to include any instructions for installing a database, cache server, or other tools. Each container should be built around a single process. Other processes would normally be defined in other Dockerfiles but you don’t even need to worry about that; in this example, we use 3 readymade containers for our databases and message broker.

  that image’s Dockerfile
 </a>
 (including whatever base image it inherits from). Second, I install the
 <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">
  Yarn
 </a>
 package manager since I prefer it over the default NodeJs package manager. Note that while my preferred language here is NodeJs, this guide is language independent. Set up your container for whatever language runtime you prefer to work in.
</p>
<p>
 Give it a try and run
 <code>
  docker-compose build
 </code>
 and see what happens.
</p>
 
 Docker Compose Example
 
<p>
 A few sections ago, I mentioned Docker Compose which is a tool to declaratively define your container formation. This means that you can define multiple different process types which all run concurrently in different containers and communicate with one another via http. Docker makes exposing interfaces between containers easier by using what they call
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/service-links/">
  links
 </a>
 . The beauty here is that it’s as simple as working with multiple processes on single machine but you can be sure that there are no tightly coupled components that might not work in a production environment!

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Let’s walk through this example:
</p>
<p>
 We have 7 different containers in our formation:
 
  web
 
 ,
 
  clock
 
 ,
 
  worker
 
 ,
 
  shell
 
 ,
 
  postgres
 
 ,
 
  rabbitmq
 
 , and
 
  redis
 
 . That’s a lot! In a production environment, these processes might each run on separate physical servers; or, the processes all might run on a single machine.
</p>
<p>
 Notice how the web, clock, worker, and shell containers are all built from the current directory. So each of those 4 processes all run on the container that we defined in our Dockerfile. The postgres, rabbitmq, and redis containers, on the other hand, are built from prebuilt images which are found on the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/">
  Docker Store
 </a>
 . Building containers for these tools from images is much quicker than installing each of the tools on your local machine.
</p>
<p>
 Take a look at the
 <code>
  volumes
 </code>
 key. Here, we mounted our current directory at
 <code>
  /app
 </code>
 . Then the
 <code>
  working_dir
 </code>
 key indicates that all commands shall be run relative to this directory.
</p>
<p>
 Ok. Now, take a look at the
 <code>
  links
 </code>
 key present on the locally built containers. This exposes a network interface between this container and the containers listed. Notice how we use the name of the link as the hostname in our environment variables. In this example, we link the containers and then we expose the uri for each of our linked services as environment variables.
</p>
<p>
 Try running one of the services: run the command
 <code>
  docker-compose up web
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Write your application code
 
<p>
 Ok, our server architecture includes 3 process types that run your application code; we have our web process that is responsible for serving web requests and pushing work to a job queue; we have our worker process that is responsible for pulling jobs off the queue and doing the work; and we have our clock process is effectively a cron runner that pushes work onto our job queue.
</p>
<p>
 Our architecture also includes 3 other services that you commonly see in web server architecture: a Postgres database, a Redis datastore, and a RabbitMQ message broker.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s a minimal implementation of the 3 aforementioned processes that also showcase the usage of our 3 data backends:

<p>
 There are example endpoints for each of the different components of our architecture. Visiting
 <code>
  /postgres/:something
 </code>
 will insert something into the postgres database and render a view containing all of the contents. Visiting
 <code>
  /redis
 </code>
 will count the number of visits to that page and display the count. Visiting
 <code>
  /rabbit/:msg
 </code>
 will send a message to the worker process and you can check the terminal logs to see the message. The clock process will also run continuously and send a message to the worker process once every minute. Not bad for a 1 minute set up!
</p>
 
 Pull it all together with a bash script
 
<p>
 I like to write a simple script so I don’t have to memorize as many commands:
</p>
 
 manage.sh

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Done! Now, we don’t need to worry about remembering docker-compose commands. To run our entire server stack we now simply run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh start
 </code>
 . If we need to build our containers again because we changed our Dockerfile or we need to install new dependencies, we can run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh build
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Our shell container exists so that we can shell into our container or run one-off commands in the context of our container. Using the script above, you can run
 <code>
  ./manage shell
 </code>
 to start a terminal session in the container. If you want to run a single command in your container, you can use
 <code>
  ./manage run &lt;command&gt;
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If you’re familiar with the difficulty caused by complex development environments running on your local machine, then investigating a Docker powered development environment could save you time. There is a bit of set up involved but the productivity gained in the long term by using a tool like Docker pays for itself.

We will explore how power, agency and influence in a constructive cycle lead to better outcomes and conversely how power, agency and influence in a destructive cycle lead to worse outcomes.  <br>  We love the analogy about peeling an onion. We peel back one layer to reveal a new similar layer, each layer enabling us to offer a new idea or thinking and adding complexity. Often we use this model for ourselves to get to our inner core and what values drive us.  <br>    <br>   As we peel back each layer of power, agency and influence, we will find there more complexity and interconnectedness; much we cannot grasp in the context of decision making and governance.  As we peel back more layers of interconnections, we will find there are more dependencies which give rise to layers of uncertainty, ambiguity and remaining is increased risk and uncertainty. No one single outcome is possible; there are always at least two.  <br>  We find we are not peeling an onion but unpicking different ideals, beliefs and connectedness. Peeling the onion does not pick up the relationship and interconnectedness between the layers it does “just removing” layers.  Further, even with different layers, it does not highlight the dynamic and relational processes between different onions.  Power, Agency, and Influence  <br>  <br>    <br>  Figure 1 power, agency and influence  <br>  Power, in the context of figure 1, is that someone/ thing has mastery and is be able to exercise control. Control can be exercised by muscle, state (through policy and legislation), through the mind, through societal norms or state law. There are enormous bodies of work which explore the vast varieties of types of power. The purpose is not to write an essay on power but rather to understand power, in a context of agency and influence.  <br>  We do not consider by whose authority power is sort, taken or given in any situation, only that someone has control, neither are we exploring the links to sovereignty.  <br>  Agency in the context of figure 1, specifically human agency, can be defined as an actor who has the capacity to act. Individual agency is framed by our views on responsibility and accountability. Agency in terms of our action depends on our motivation, capacity, and experience. Given that agency is defined by an actor who has the capacity, there is a deep link to biochemistry and nutrition. Agency on its own, without understanding the brain-gut axis alongside traditional capacities, means we don't fully appreciate why we might do act in a certain way.  <br>  Influence in the context of figure 1, is the “person” in this case who can help determine an outcome. The influencer can affect the character, development, or behaviour of someone or something. Influence and influencers can use incentives, skills and tools on those with Agency and Power. Incentives may be economic in terms of more power, more agency or money and the influencer has changed behaviour in the system, player or actors such that they have created the outcome they wanted. To influence, they may use skills such as creating doubt, forgetting to pass on information, inducing guilt, shame, research, presentation of risk or creating/ ignoring bias. The influencer who uses these kinds of skills is like Machiavelli, where the outcome happens using any means. The tools which an influencer can use include: education, knowledge, facts, access, nudge, behavioural economics and science.  <br>  With power, agency and influence, we have to consider who, in and given context the actors are.  In the vast majority of cases, the actor will come with a bias towards a political agenda, an economic/commerce agenda or a personal agenda.  It is self-evident when we discuss power agency and influence that power might rest with a politician, the actor with agency might be represented as a business, and the influencer could be individual. While all the other combinations are possibilities, this paper is not going to explore all scenarios. Still, we want to think through what leads to a constructive relationship or a destructive relationship and how we might understand it. As this helps inform the future of governance.  <br>  The scenario below explores starts from the influencer, which in this case is the prime mover. Again it would be entirely possible that we could start from power or agency as the prime mover.  The scenario is summarised in Figure 2, destructive relationships.  <br>  Consider an influencer, a regulator, whose primary role is to write and provide regulation. [In many cases the regulator has power to enforce regulation, but consider the power in this case rests with those who provide the legislative framework for the regulator to exist, act and as such have teeth[powers.]) As an influencer of the market, you wish to have the most significant regulatory body possible. The larger your staff and reach of your regulatory body, the more kudos and job opportunities will come to the senior leadership team. You will win more<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#"> awards</a> and be paid more. As the influencer, you propose rules, regulation and law to the person in power. Of note, power is shifting in this relationship as a regulator has both delegated authority to create more regulation and take on more power. The relationship between the influencer and the person with power is such that the influencer persuades the body with power that the more rules and regulations they have the more power the person who holds power will have. In this scenario, we can see that the person with power is the government. The government, through its economic policy, believes that rules, regulation and law provides the right degree of control and restriction over the people with agency. The government interpretation of what is best for the market leads them to believe that control and restriction will end up with a more efficient and effective market than one left to run on its own.  The person with agency and a free market position now face a barrage of red tape, rules, regulation and law in which they can operate. The person with agency treats the person with influence with suspicion, and they are unwilling to share data or information openly. The person with the influence has to write more rules to create enforcement and reporting. The relationship between the person with agency and the person with influence is one driven by secrecy and trying to avoid the overly restrictive regulatory environment. This scenario creates a very destructive loop, one that we see in highly regulated markets. Each of the players is unable to break their behaviour. The person with influence wants more rules and regulation, the person with power enjoys the control and probably a conflict of interest with tax income, the person with agency finds every way to ensure there is not more regulation by sharing the least information possible and complying to tick box compliance.  <br>    <br>  Figure 2 Destructive Relationships  <br>  What this scenario starts to set out is that is when each of the players in a destructive loop behaves destructively it is a near-impossible cycle to escape. What may be less evident is that if one player acts destructively, and in their own interests, all the players will start to work in their own interests, and a destructive cycle will evolve. The player who kicks starts a destructive cycle can be the influencer wanting a more significant role, the person in power wanting more control over the agents, or the person with agency who wants to hide and not be transparent. When we look at the constructive cycle next, we can see that if all the players act constructively, there's a very different outcome, but it does require all of the players to continue to act constructively to keep the cycle going. A diversion into game theory would be prudent here if this were a book&nbsp;  <br>  Starting with the same prime mover who is the ‘influencer’ let's now consider a constructive cycle. This is summarised in Figure 3 constructive Relationships.  <br>  In this scenario, the influencer believes in a smaller lighter regulator doing the right thing; they believe in education and rights. The influencer can approach the person with power and rather than demanding more rules and regulations, they suggest that the person with power should educate and give more freedom to the person with agency.  In this case, the person with the agency can respond by effectively giving the person with power more power through the freedom that's been granted to them. By example, highly competitive markets in capitalist based economies (transport, entertainment, leisure, utilities) have become less regulated. Still, aspects of the delivery and operations, such as health and safety, remain highly regulated.  <br>  Further, in a constructive cycle, the person with agency will likely have an open and trusting relationship with the person with influence. It could be likely, but the agency/influencer relationship is one of the relevant transparency. The influencer, because they can determine what the person with agency is doing by, say API access to the dataset can instruct the person with power on the right types of education that the market needs.  Further, considering “<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/#">Rights</a>” to be offered to various people with agency in the market who can use freedom constructively for a better society, which builds more trust relationships.  <br>    <br>  Figure 3 Constructive Relationships  <br>  Contrasting the two cycles,  constructive and destructive, the obvious question is what leads to a constructive or a destructive outcome. Further, in the destructive cycle, do the consequences get worse for all the players and in the constructive cycle, do the outcomes get better? In the destructive cycle, it could be argued that the outcome for the influencer is hugely beneficial as they end up with the larger regulatory body, more market kudos and an increase in their income. Equally, the person with power may believe this route enables them to raise more tax income. So if we look purely at outcomes it depends on which outcomes for whom as how we make the judgement if the cycle is constructive or destructive. Do we want better outcomes for humanity and society or a few players?  <br>  This framework is to set oversight and governance in a different context. The current governance thinking for a regulated industry is biased towards more rules, regulation and law. Given this political design, driven by a desire to change those with agencies behaviour?  We may not end up with the outcome we intended, better banking, better transport or better utilities. The current government thinking on unregulated Industries is more liberal. Still, that thinking has not generated better outcomes for society as we have seen from climate change and the broken supply chain model as a result of the pandemic. The reason for presenting this framework is to reflect on the question; “is this working for us”. As shown in the opening pages of this paper, it is clear that the current cycles of governance and oversight are not working for regulated or unregulated Industries. Therefore, we need to think about the future of governance that can take us forward from where we are and does not just do more of the same.  <br>  Using the model to consider the set of relationships between shareholders, director, and the executive team.  This is set out in Figure 4 Board Relationships  <br>  Whilst the diagram shows power rests with the shareholder, equally, power can be the directors or exec team, agency can with the shareholders and exec team and influence with the shareholder or directors.  Every combination is possible.  The point here is less about the possible scenarios and relationships but the special case where a founder is a Director, major shareholder and CEO.  <br>    <br>  Figure 4 Board Relationships  <br>  In the special cases where a team is able to hold power, agency and influence there is a significant increase in the need for better governance and oversight to outside parties that decisions are fair, reasonable, explainable and have wider benefits.  <br>  It is worth drawing a personal view of a commercial, charity or health situation you are aware of, using the power, agency and influence framework to think about how the actors act to create better outcomes for say the capital providers.

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t this! I’ve heard that
red-tailed hawks<a>1</a> live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t news, Kellyanne.</p>
<p>Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so
we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to
address the planetary crisis at our feet.</p>
<p>Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! Let’s do this thing.</p>

There are some serious consequences for those who are Directors with responsibly.  How do you know when someone presenting to you is trying to bluff, mislead, guide, lie, direct or nudge you to a particular outcome. Over time individuals who serve on boards learn the skills of emotional maturity to help determine if they are being guided to a decision or a decision made for them. In truth, unpicking intent was hard anyway even when we all met up in one room, but it is far harder now with video. We have lost access to the face-to-face skills and the experiences we have built up as we are not in the same room. How do we detect the signals again? <br><br>We need to recognise that we have not (yet) developed all the essential skills for a digital life. This is never more true than when we are making judgement or decisions that matter as they have consequences. We have no eye contact (we look at screens and not the camera), everything is in reverse, poor video quality and block images take away our concentration, I look at my stream far too much, I am easily distracted by other inbound messages, I cannot look round and see how others are reacting, there is no body language ( are they hot, are they sweating, are they nervous, are they ….) and no sense of gut or instinct.<br><br>Technology could help, but we are not sure it is the right answer. We can detect heart rate variance, changes in skin resistance (sweat), we can monitor blood pressure, we can follow eye movement, we can monitor breathing rates and indeed we can sense movement. Voice, language, words choice, pitch and tone can also be captured and analysed. All the basic physiological signals we as humans pick up can be detected and captured in a digital scenario. However, all these sensors will be owned by someone else who will have control over your data, your emotions and what I am told about your reaction will be based on an algorithm and not on my own sense. How do we know the sensors to analysis is right and not biased? <br><br>Alternatively, we could improve the provenance and lineage of data we receive in a board pack, we can utilise API’s to gain data and reports directly from the system with no-human intervention but is this really the role of the board to verify and check everything. Such a remit driven by FUD becomes control, the loss of trust prevails and there is a change in culture to the detriment of the stakeholders. <br><br>It is an interesting crossroads, do we learn new skills, new ways of doing things, new ways of sensing and monitoring or do we delegate our capacity to an algorithm to help us?  <br>   Who decides?   <br>

<p>I tried to sign up for phone banking and I just couldn’t see doing it, I don’t answer unknown calls and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to right now. I wound up with the Vote Forward letter-writing system, <a href="http://votefwd.org/?fbclid=IwAR2gJSKcIqL4prkZJPZ72oPvOxOnabufWkKxojLL0lRm2NlydSZye2ZQI_8">votefwd.org</a>, which I like for a variety of reasons. </p>



<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Lists can help solve some of Twitter’s major pain&nbsp;points <p>“Unfollowing everyone on Twitter and switching to lists for better control of my feed. Nothing personal, love you all! “ — Github CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=03">Nat Friedman&nbsp;9/19/20</a></p><p>Twitter is my favorite social&nbsp;network.</p><p>It is a treasure trove of enlightening blog posts, news articles, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmorieBeck/status/1303800700829392902">research papers</a>, and video content that I would never see in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795110">the stagnant echo chamber</a> that is my Facebook news feed; a place filled with content posted primarily by former classmates who seem to have frighteningly homogenous political opinions and little apparent interest in seriously engaging with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>On Twitter, I have the freedom to engage with a heterogeneous network of thinkers from diverse geographical and ideological backgrounds. The platform has vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current events and trends. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/">A 2018 study</a> found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf">compelling evidence</a> that Twitter isn’t very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209">the abundance</a> of content comes at a high psychological cost:</p>  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9">Information overload</a> makes me feel like I’m drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds. Finding the signal that I’m searching for in a sea of noise takes&nbsp;work.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922">Fear</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629">missing out</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html">fear of not knowing</a> compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may have missed. “Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling…”  <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a> are an under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform’s potential to facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues&nbsp;by:</p>  Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to manage lists provides a much smoother Twitter user experience.  Providing raw data, via the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list">Twitter API</a>, that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling.  <p>Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic discourse that transcends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">left/right paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en">focuses</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728">addressing</a> systemic <a href="https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995">issues</a> rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.</p><p>Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help citizens fulfill their obligation to be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html">well informed</a> and perhaps even allow us to escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us&nbsp;in.</p><p>Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum">recently announced</a> plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists and drastically increase Twitter’s potential to serve the common&nbsp;good.</p><p>You can get started with exploring lists by checking out a few that I’ve&nbsp;made:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086059106874474496">AI</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/197289909">Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153">Blockchain Gaming</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1202739597286854656">Cryptofunds</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576">Cryptogurus</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276220409445101568">Decentralized Finance</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1054920788019572736">Ethereum</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1306382711196590081">Gen Z&nbsp;Mafia</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584">Systems Thinkers</a>  <p>And some great public lists that others have&nbsp;created:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460429">Astronomers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/967118678205505536">Bitcoin Developers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/875371355570487296">Crypto</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295245028386918402">Cryptoart</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/93883642">Congress</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/128331">Digital and Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/5158212">Economics</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/55356059">Financial News</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/84693025">Futurists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/73010929">Health Innovators</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/7450">Investors/VC/Angel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1023884">Machine Learning</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226161844793966593">Media \\&nbsp;Content</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/222800557">Neuroscience</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215437668">Philosophers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460480">Physicists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/68365941">Wall Street Influencers</a>  <p>Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/shingaithornton">@shingaithornton</a> with any thoughts on lists or suggestions for how to improve the ones I’m working&nbsp;on.</p><p>This piece was originally posted <a href="https://blog.shingaithornton.com/twitter-lists-are-underrated/">on my personal&nbsp;blog</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, hello!  <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/">Spritely's website</a> has
finally launched!  Whew... it's been a lot of work to get it to this
state!  Plus check out our new logo:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not bad, eh?  Also with plenty of cute characters on the Spritely site
(thank you to <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/">David Revoy</a> for taking
my loose character sketches and making them into such beautiful
paintings!)</p>
<p>But those cute characters are there for a reason!  Spritely is quite
ambitious and has quite a few subprojects.  Here's a
<a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/18aa2f92-36cc-4424-9a4f-6f2de946fbd2">video that explains how they all fit together</a>.
Hopefully that makes things more clear!</p>
<p>Actually that video is from <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub Conference 2020</a>,
the <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#talks">talks</a> of which have now
<a href="https://conf.tube/video-channels/apconf_channel/videos">all have their videos live</a>!
I also moderated the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/6289920f-4e35-4141-ab6f-379b357849ec">intro keynote panel about ActivityPub authors/editors</a>.
Plus there's an easter egg, the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">ActivityPub Conference Opening Song</a>! :)</p>
<p>But I can't take credit for APConf 2020... organization and support are thanks to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Sebastian Lasse, and <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">FOSSHost</a> for hosting the website and BigBlueButton instance and <a href="https://conf.tube/">conf.tube</a> for generously hosting all the videos.  There's a <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/87bc99dd-b1b8-4fc3-b034-dca805388179">panel about the organization of APConf</a> you can watch if you're interested in more of that!  (And of course, all the other great videos too!)</p>
<p>So... what about that week I was going to work on Terminal Phase?
Well... I'm still planning on doing it but admittedly it hasn't
happened yet.  All of the above took more time than expected.
However, today I am working on my talk about Spritely Goblins for
RacketCon, and as it turns out, extending Terminal Phase is a big part
of that talk.  But I'll announce more soon when the Terminal Phase
stuff happens.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>

   <p></p>  <br> <br> <p>I wrote about the original reactions to COVID <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/entering-the-3rd-phase-of-the-business-response-to-covid19-burnout-a75174fa220a">here</a>, in that post I reviewed how we had responded and the cost to human by examining Burnout and Breakdown.&nbsp; These are the first two B’s.&nbsp; Burnout being the rising at 6 AM walking 23.5 steps to the computer, 12 hours of zoom calls. 37 steps via the fridge back to bed and repeat.&nbsp; A few unable to escape the workload and demands of being able to work from home.&nbsp; Breakdown being two working adults in a one bed flat with young children, desperate to work but unable. Lacking private space and with a burden or threat of losing their paid role, breakdown becomes a reality for far too many families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Blue-collar workers have done the same job, the same role, having the same breakfast and lunch, driving the same route to the same office for 20 years.&nbsp; The repetitive nature leads to call centre levels of boredom.&nbsp; White-collar workers have lost travel, flexibility, meeting people and all aspects that gave them a spark. We are now all repeating the same role, at the same screen with the same people and life has become boring and there is no end in sight.&nbsp;Thrid B</p><p>A few with capital and have assets are Blessed by this lockdown.&nbsp; The 4th B. This came from a chat with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian-tett/">Gillian Tett</a> whom I have known since growing up and those formation days.&nbsp; Blessed being we have space and assets and that the change in lifestyle has had a positive impact.&nbsp; A (re)discovery of family, friends, the outside and sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>The 5th B is that we don’t want a “new normal” or the “old normal.”&nbsp; The old normal was rubbish when we look back.&nbsp; A new normal build on the old will not be better.&nbsp; I really want something Better.&nbsp; I am not sure what Better looks like right now, but I know what it does not look like.&nbsp; It is clear that Better will have a more equal view about space, time and humanity.&nbsp;We might value things that don't have a cost or price.</p><p>The 6th B is a major worry for me - this is the "Bottom of the market". Again something Gillain and I explored.  The students, those who left school, those in their early career, those left adrift from the loss of the travel, entertainment and retail markets.&nbsp; We have saddled this generation with debts, both in the form of capital and emotional. Right now we have also removed hope.&nbsp; We have to find a way to care for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last B is one that affects all of us. It is a loss of community, a loss of togetherness, a loss of connection, and a loss of connectedness.&nbsp; We have lost #belonging.&nbsp; I belonged to groups from the office to friends on the train,my sports club, the coffee shop all the way to meeting new people.&nbsp; We have become individuals by the nature of our policies, politics and capital which means I am now personalised in everything, but I now realise I want to belong.&nbsp; </p> <br>

  <p>Summary: The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>



	<a></a>

<p>
    Introductory note: I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>, that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a used model for thinking about identity online.
</p>

<p>
    John Locke was an English philosopher who thought a lot about power: who had it, how it was used, and how it impacted the structure of society. Locke’s theory of mind forms the foundation for our modern ideas about identity and independence. Locke argued that "sovereign and independent" was man’s natural state and that we gave up freedom, our sovereignty,  in exchange for something else, protection, sociality, and commerce, among others. This grand bargain forms the basis for any society. 
</p>

<p>
    This question of power and authority is vital in identity systems. We can ask "what do we give up and to whom in a given identity system?" More succinctly we ask: who controls what? In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> I made the argument that self-sovereign identity, supporting heterarchical (peer-to-peer) interaction, enables rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents. I argued that the architecture of SSI, its structure, made those relationships more authentic.
</p>

<p>
    In this post, I intend to explore the details of that architecture so we can better understand the legitimacy of SSI as an identity system for online interaction. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)">defines legitimacy</a> as 
</p>
<blockquote>the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.</blockquote>
<p>
    While the idea of legitimacy is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that function in an authoritative manner and have large impacts on people and society.  Without legitimacy, people and organizations using an identity system will be unable to act because anyone they interact with will not see that action as authorized. My thesis is that SSI provides a more legitimate basis for online identity than administrative identity systems of the past. 
</p>


 Terminology 
<p>
    While we properly talk of identity systems, identity systems do not manage identities, but rather relationships. Identity systems provide the means necessary for remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered. Identifiers are unique within some namespace. The namespace gives context to the identifiers since the same string of characters might be a phone number in one system and a product ID in another. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller who by virtue of knowing the authentication factors can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claiming it by logging in). The controller might be a person, organization, or software system. The controller might be the subject that the identifier refers to, but not necessarily. The authentication factors might be a password, key fob, cryptographic keys, or something else. The strength and nature of the bindings between the controller, authentication factors, and identifier determine the strength and nature of the relationships built on top of them. 
</p>

<p>
    To understand why that's so, we introduce the concept of a root of trust1. A root of trust is a foundational component or process in the identity system that is relied on by other components of the system and whose failure would compromise the integrity of the bindings. A root of trust might be primary or secondary depending on whether or not it is replaceable. Primary roots of trust are irreplaceable. Together, the roots of trust form the trust basis for the system.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis enabled by the identity system underlies a particular trust domain. The trust domain is the set of digital activities that depend on the binding of the controller to the identifier. For example, binding a customer to an identifier allows Amazon to trust that the actions linked to the identifier are authorized by the controller. Another way to look at this is that the strength of the binding between the identifier and customer (controller) determines the risk that Amazon assumes in honoring those actions.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of the controller-identifier binding depends on the strength of the binding between the controller and the authentication factors and between the authentication factors and the identifier. Attacking either of those bindings reduces the trust we have in the controller-identifier binding and increases the risk that actions taken through a particular identifier are unauthorized.
</p>


 Identity Architectures 

<p>
    We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust: 
</p>
 
     Administrative
     
     Algorithmic
     
     Autonomic
     
 

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic are SSI systems. They are distinguished by their trust bases. Some SSI systems use one or the other and some (like Sovrin) are hybrid, employing each for different purposes. We'll discuss the properties of the trust basis for each of these in an effort to understand the comparative legitimacy of SSI solutions to traditional administrative ones. 
</p>

<p>
    These architectures differ in who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. We call this control authority. The entity with control authority takes action through operations that affect the creation (inception), updating, rotation, revocation, deletion, and delegation of the authentication factors and their relation to the identifier. How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Administrative Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an administrative architecture rely on an administrator to bind the identifier to the authentication factors. The administrator is the primary root of trust for any domain with an administrative architecture. Almost every identity system in use today has an administrative architecture and their trust basis is founded on the administrator.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: The trust basis in administrative identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the interactions between the controller, identifier and authentication factors in an administrative identity system, the role of the administrator, and the impact these have on the strength of the bindings. The controller usually generates the authentication factors by choosing a password, linking a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism, or generating keys.
</p>

<p>
    Even though the identifier might be the controller's email address, phone number, public key, or other ID, the administrator "assigns" the identifier to the controller because it is their policy that determines which identifiers are allowed, whether they can be updated, and their legitimacy within the identity system's domain. The administrator "owns" the identifier within the domain. The administrator also asserts the binding between the identifier and the authentication factors. An employee's mistake, a policy change, or a hack could affect the binding between the identifier and authentication factors or the identifier and the controller. Consequently, these bindings are relatively weak. Only the binding between the controller and authentication factors is strong because the controller generates them.
</p>

<p>
    The administrator's primary duty is to authoritatively assert the controller-identifier binding. Authoritative control statements about the identifier are recorded in the administrator's database, the source of truth in the system, subject to change by employees and hackers. The administrator might be an ecommerce site that maintains an identity system as the basis for its customer's account. In this case the binding is private, and its integrity is of interest only to the web site and the customer. Alternatively, the administrator might provide federated login services. In this case the administrator is asserting the controller-identifier binding in a semi-public manner to anyone who relies on the federated login. A certificate authority is an example of an administrator who publicly asserts the controller-identifier binding, signing a certificate to that effect.
</p>

<p>
    Because the administrator is responsible for binding the identifier to both the authentication factors and the controller, the  administrator is the primary root of trust and thus the basis for trust in the overall system. Regardless of whether the binding is private, semi-public, or public, the integrity of the binding is entirely dependent on the administrator and the strength of their infrastructure, policies, employees, and continued existence. The failure of any of those can jeopardize the binding, rendering the identity system unusable by those who rely on it.
</p>

<a></a>
 Algorithmic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems that rely on a ledger have an algorithmic architecture. I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others. Of course, it's not just algorithms. Algorithms are embodied in code, written by people, running on servers. How the code is written, its availability to scrutiny, and the means by which it is executed all impact the trust basis for the system. "Algorithmic" is just shorthand for all of this. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: The trust basis in algorithmic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 3 shows how the controller, authentication factors, identifier, and ledger are bound in an identity system with an algorithmic architecture. As in the administrative identity system, the controller generates the authentication factors, albeit in the form of a public-private key pair. The controller keeps and does not share the private key. The public key, on the other hand, is used to derive an identifier (at least in well-designed SSI systems) and both are registered on the ledger. This registration is the inception of the controller-identifier binding since the controller can use the private key to assert her control over the identifier as registered on the ledger. Anyone with access to the ledger can determine algorithmically that the controller-identifier binding is valid.
</p>

<p>
    The controller makes authoritative control statements about the identifier. The events marking these operations are recorded on the ledger which becomes the source of truth for anyone interested in the binding between the identifier and authentication factors.
</p>

<p>
    In an identity system with an algorithmic trust basis, computer algorithms create a ledger that records the key events. The point of the ledger is that no party has the power to unilaterally decide whether these records are made, modified, or deleted and how they're ordered. Instead, the system relies on code executed in a decentralized manner to make these decisions. The nature of the algorithm, the manner in which the code is written, and the methods and rules for its execution all impact the integrity of the algorithmic identity system and consequently any bindings that it records.
</p>


<a></a>
 Autonomic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an autonomic architecture function similarly to those with an algorithmic architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the controller generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with anyone.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 4: Trust basis in autonomic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The controller uses her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log2. One of the important realizations that make autonomic identity systems possible is that the key event log must only be ordered in the context of a single identifier, not globally. So, a ledger is not needed for recording operations on identifiers that are not public. The key event log can be shared with and verified by anyone who cares to see it.
</p>

<p>
    The controller also uses the private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means of cryptographically responding to challenges to prove her control of the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for the controller to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier. Thus anyone (any entity) can create and establish control over an identifier namespace in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority. 
</p>

<p>
    Autonomic identifiers have a number of advantages: 
</p>
 
     Self-Certification—autonomic identifiers are self-certifying so there is no reliance on a third party.
     
     Self-Administration—autonomic identifiers can be independently administered by the controller.  
      Cost—autonomic identifiers are virtually free to create and manage. 
     
     Security—because the keys are decentralized, there is no trove of secrets that can be stolen. 
     
     Regulatory—since autonomic identifiers need not be publicly shared or stored in an organization’s database, regulatory concern over personal data can be reduced.
     
     Scale—autonomic identifiers scale with the combined computing capacity of all participants, not some central system. 
     
     Independent—autonomic identifiers are not dependent on any specific technology or even being online. 
     
 

<a></a>
 Algorithmic and Autonomic Identity In Practice 

<p>
    We are all familiar with administrative identity systems. We use them all the time. Less familiar are algorithmic and autonomic identity systems. Their use is emerging under the title of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There are several parallel development efforts supporting algorithmic and autonomic identifiers. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier specification</a> is the primary guide to algorithmic identifiers that live on a ledger. The DID specification provides for many DID methods that allow DIDs to live on a variety of data stores. There's nothing in the DID specification itself that requires that the data store be a blockchain or ledger, but that is the primary use case.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">written about the details of decentralized identifiers</a> before. DIDs have a number of important properties that make them ideal as algorithmic identifiers. Specifically, they are non-reassignable, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized.
</p>

<p>
    As algorithmic identifiers, DIDs allow the controller to cryptographically make authoritative statements about the identifier and the keys it is bound to. Those statements are recorded on a ledger or blockchain to provide a record of the key events that anyone with access to the ledger can evaluate. The record is usually public since the purpose of putting them on a ledger is to allow parties who don't have an existing relationship to evaluate the identifier and its linkage to the controller and public keys. 
</p>

<p>
    There are two related efforts for autonomic identifiers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> is a general-purpose self-certifying system for autonomic identifiers. KERI identifiers are strongly bound at inception to a public-private key pair. All operations on the identifier are recorded in a cryptographic key event log. KERI has strong security and accountability properties. Drummond Reed has made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_564J1B3LfBHc_FQnO8jUMiYEx084LVUsHsY1mYPa6U/edit#slide=id.g9398465ffb_33_0">proposal that would allow KERI autonomic identifiers to be used with any DID method</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The second option is <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">Peer DIDs</a>. The vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things need not be public and thus have no need for the ability to publicly resolve the DID. Peer DIDs fill this need with the benefits of autonomic identifiers listed above. 
</p>

<p>
    Like KERI, Peer DIDs maintain a key event log (called "deltas") that records the relevant operations on the keys in a cryptographic manner. The Peer DID key event log can be shared with other parties in the relationship over <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a>, a protocol that allows parties to a relationship to securely and privately share authenticated messages. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">security and authority of a DIDComm channel</a> are rooted in DIDs and their associated authentication factors. DIDComm can be used over a wide variety of transports.
</p>

<p>
    The vast majority of digital relationships are peer to peer and should use autonomic identifiers. Algorithmic identifiers allow for public discovery of identifier properties when relationships are not peer to peer. In the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>3, the ledger records public DIDs for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential</a> issuers. But people, organizations, and things form relationships using peer DIDs without need for the ledger. This hybrid use of both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems was designed so that credential exchange would be practical, secure, and private while reducing the correlation that might occur if individuals used a few DIDs on a ledger.
</p>


 Comparing Identity Architectures 
<p>
    Table 1 summarizes the architectural properties of identity systems with administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic bases of trust. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Table 1: Architectural properties of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The table shows how the locus of control, source of truth, root of trust, and trust basis differ for each of our three architectures. For Administrative systems, the administrator is directly in control of all four of these. In an algorithmic architecture, the controller is the locus of control because the ledger is set up to allow the controller to be in charge of all key operations. Sometimes this is done using special administrative keys instead of the keys associated with the identifier. The organizations or people operating nodes on the ledger <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">never have access to the keys necessary to unilaterally change the record of operations</a>. No third party is involved in autonomic identity systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Table 2 summarizes the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems4.
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Table 2: Summarizing the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We can see from the evaluation that algorithmic and autonomic architectures are decentralized while the administrative system has a single point of failure—the third party administrator. As a result administrative systems are less secure since an attack on one party can yield a trove of valuable information. Administrative systems also rely on privacy by policy rather than having privacy preserving features built into the architecture. And, as we've seen, all too often privacy is in direct conflict with the administrator's profit motive leading to weak privacy policies. 
</p>

 Power and Legitimacy 

<p>
    I started this post by talking about power and legitimacy. From our discussion and the summary tables above, we know that power is held very differently in these three systems. In an administrative system, the administrator holds all the power. I argued in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> that the architecture of our identity systems directly impacts the quality and utility of the digital relationships they support. Specifically, the power imbalance inherent in administrative identity systems yields anemic relationships. In contrast, the balance of power engendered by SSI systems (both algorithmic and autonomic) yields richer relationships since all parties can contribute to it.  
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, administrative identity systems have legitimacy—if they didn't, no one would use or trust them.  As new architectures, algorithmic and autonomic systems have yet to prove themselves through usage. But we can evaluate each architecture in terms of the promises it makes and how well it does in the purposes of an identity system: recognizing, remembering, and relying on other parties in the relationship. These are largely a function of the trust basis for the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems promise an account for taking actions that the administrator allows. They also promise these accounts will be secure and private. But people and organizations are increasingly concerned with privacy and seemingly non-stop security breaches are chipping away at that legitimacy. As noted above, the privacy promise is often quite limited. Since the administrator is the basis for trust, administrative systems allow the administrator to recognize, remember, and rely on the identifier depending on their security. But the account holder does not get any support from the administrative system in recognizing, remembering, or relying on the administrator. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship is strictly one-way and anemic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    SSI systems promise to give anyone the means to securely and privately create online relationships and trustworthily share self-asserted and third-party-attested attributes with whoever they chose. These promises are embodied in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">property I call fidelity</a>. To the extent that algorithmic and autonomic identity systems deliver on these promises, they will be seen as legitimate. 
</p>

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems provide strong means for recognizing, remembering, and relying on the identifiers in the relationship. For an algorithmic system, we must trust the ledger as the primary root of trust and the trust basis. Clearly our trust in the ledger will depend on many factors, including the code and the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">governance that controls its operation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis for an autonomic identity system is cryptography. This implies that digital key management will become an important factor in its legitimacy. If people and organizations cannot easily manage the keys in such a system, then it will not be trusted. There is hope that key management can be solved since the primary artifacts that people using an SSI system manipulate are relationships and credentials, not keys and secrets. By supporting a consistent user experience rooted in familiar artifacts from the physical world, SSI promises to make cryptography a usable technology by the majority of people on the Internet.
</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>
    In this article, we've explored the high-level architectures for the identity systems in use today as well as new designs that promise richer, more authentic online relationships, better security, and more privacy. By exploring the trust bases that arise from these architectures we've been able to explore the legitimacy of these architectures as a basis for online identity. My belief is that a hybrid system that combines algorithmic public identifiers with autonomic private identifiers can provide a universal identity layer for the Internet, increasing security and privacy, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">reducing friction</a>, and providing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">new</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">better</a> online experiences.

 Notes 
 
     Often the term root of trust is used to a hardware device or some trusted hardware component in the computer. The usage here is broader and refers to anything that is relied on for trust in the identity system. Trust anchor is a term that has sometimes been used in the cryptography community to refer to this same concept.   
     A number of cryptographic systems are trivially self-certifying (e.g. PGP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). What sets the autonomic identity systems described here apart is the key event log. Sam Smith calls these identifiers “autonomic identifiers” to set them apart from their less capable counterparts and emphasize their ability to self-manage keys without recourse to a third party system.

<p>Understanding the harms caused from datism </p>



 <p>Musings on dataism. Image adapted from <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/pixel2013-2364555/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4031973">S. Hermann &amp; F. Richter</a></p> 
<p>Yesterday was a big day, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™ released their <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>See my related post and <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/09/25/the-release-of-the-humanity-power-action-kit-and-the-30-day-challenge/">my personal testimonial</a> on the value of the Humanity Power framework.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I reflect on the powerful framework and message that Humanity Power has built, I’ve not been able to not stop considering how it relates to the emerging personal information economy and the role that data plays, both positively and negatively, throughout society.</p>



<p>I believe that datism, data’s dark side, is one of the many ‘ism that we must strive to eradicate if we are to truly be free to thrive in today’s data-driven society.</p>



 What is an ‘ism 



<p>Lets first start with understanding what an ‘ism is and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?</p>



 
<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>

<blockquote>
<p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>
Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>




<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 Identity Praxis is a proponent of Humanity Power and looks to add one more ‘ism to the conversation: dataism 



<p><a href="https://www.identitypraxis.com">Identity Praxis</a> is a proponent of Humanity Power, it is through unity that we can all find balance, joy, and achievement of purpose. Also, it is the perfect platform to discuss another ‘ism that is plaguing society, dataism.</p>



<p>David Brooks in his 2013&nbsp;article “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html">The Philosophy of Data</a>,” considers dataism an ethical system. And, Yuval Noah Harari, in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537994938&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=homo+deus">Homo Deus</a>, suggested dataism is a new form of religion that reveres big data. I see it as something more sinister. I see it to be more in the light of the other ‘isms, in that is divides and segregates more than drives unity.</p>




<blockquote>
<p>Dataism, as an economic and social movement, relates to how people’s data, their identity and personal information, is being used by society’s private and public actors for gain to the detriment of the society-at-large and the individual who is the data subject.</p>
</blockquote>




<p>Today, data is being used and co-opted by public (aka government) and private (aka organizations) for economic, political, and social gain, a situation often referred to as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">surveillance capitalism</a>. People, individual data subjects, are being left out of the data flow equation, they don’t have a seat at the table.</p>



<p>While the flow of data throughout the world brings significant good to our societies and economies, and to the individual in many contexts, the fact that individuals have largely been left out of the decision-making process as to how their data is collected and used is a problem.</p>



<p>As with the other isms, dataism is causing harm to individuals and society at large, impart and due to, among other things, an imbalance of the flow of data, the value derived from the flow of data, and the risks generated by the flow of data; and, sadly, most people don’t even know this is happening or comprehend the long-term implications.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that dataism is both independent and interdependent in relation to the other ‘isms. It stands alone, as well as influences and is influenced by the other ‘isms.</p>



<p>At a micro level, dataism is causing harm, both <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue3/Solove154U.Pa.L.Rev.477(2006).pdf">legally recognized data harm</a>, such as identity left, as well as <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">other data harms</a> that are not strictly measured or recognized, such as increased anxiety, loss of time, money, reputation, discrimination, opportunity (personal, economic, social, influence), and death.</p>



<p>At a macro level, dataism can create class wars, generate division, stimulate distrust, discriminate, silence free speech, suppress minorities, and more. Why, because dataism is causing a disequilibrium of power (money, resources, and influence), opportunity, social good, risk, and externalities among society’s actors. The lion share of the externalities are being born by people (you, me, and everyone around us), and the majority of the value is going to private institutions, aka “Big Tech”.</p>



<p>Data has power. Used properly data can create great prosperity. Used improperly it can create great harm.</p>



 
 
 
<a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/"></a>
A screen shot of The Opportunity Atlas

 



 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know a single data point, a child’s zip code, can predict their future success? See <a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/">The Opportunity Atlas</a> and learn more.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
 
 



<p>How does The Opportunity Atlas fit into dataism? Here is just one example. It is quite common for marketers to use geofencing to target their ads. If marketers know that a particular zip code is populated by the economically disadvantaged, for instance, they will hold back their advertising and not reach out to people in those areas. Individuals in those areas, that may otherwise value seeing the ad are being lumped in with the “poor,” and are hurt by this application of data. While I’m not putting forth a moral judgment to this practice, this is a form of dataism.</p>



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism, including dataism. It is time to give people, the data subject, agency and control over their data, and to bring unity to our phygital lives.</p>



<p>It is through unity, the eradication of datism, and all the other ‘isms, that we’ll achieve and sustain The Identity Nexus™, the equilibrium point where the value, risk, social good, and externalities of identity and personal information exchange within society are equitably and fairly shared among public institutions, private organizations, and people.</p>



<p>How can we eradicate dataism. We can empower people and start giving them agency over their identity and personal information. We can start giving them tools–personal information management solutions–so that they can be in control of the flow of their information and determine for themselves, who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose their identity and personal information can be used. And, if they’re so inclined they should be able to charge for their data. They should be able to require organizations to have to accept their terms of access rather than only being forced to accept the organization’s terms of service.</p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living, working, and playing in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings prosperity and joy without causing harm to others. It is time we end dataism.</p>

<p>Putting an end to the ‘isms that plague humanity</p>



<p>Today is a big day at <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™, and for all.  </p>



<p>Charisse and the team at Humanity Power have launched the <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<p>I encourage you to take the leap into Humanity Power. Follow the six-actions outlined in the action kit, and personally contribute, in your own unique way, to bring joy, prosperity, and purpose to your life and those around you, and afar.  </p>



 What are humanity’s ‘isms 



<p>So, what is an ‘ism and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?   </p>



 <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanities ‘isms 



<blockquote><p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>



<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 The Six Actions for Claiming Your Humanity Power  



<p>The Humanity Power action kit lays out six actions, steps, you can take to claim your humanity and to help bring prosperity to yourself and the world. </p>



<p>Humanity Power Action List</p>



  Learn the ‘isms, start by building awareness of the ‘isms and what they mean and who they affect.  Learn about high-vibration Humanity, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">learn</a> what it means to use your high-vibration Humanity.  Buy a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">wear the message</a> of Humanity Power, and support the mission (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Gift a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">give the gift of unity</a> and spread the message of Humanity (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Take the 30-day Humanity Power challenge, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">put your humanity to action</a> and practice high-vibrational activities to help end the ‘isms.  Subscribe and Stay connected, we’re just getting started and you are a big part in that. Let’s stay connected so we can experience mpact together.  



<p>Oh, and be sure to keep an eye you for future actions that you can engage in, like </p>



  sharing the Humanity the Manatee™ stuffy and book that teaches kids about humanity  supporting the Humanity Power “3rd Thursday” community enrichment events that provide people in need with a free meal while supporting local small businesses  taking part in action-based education. More on all of these later  



 Personal Testimonial 



<p>As for my part, I’m a walking billboard for the impact that Humanity Power can have on your life. Humanity Power has brought me positivity, joy, energy, friends, connections, commercial opportunity, prosperity, and more. </p>



Image by author: <br>Becker wearing Humanity Power T-Shirt

<p>I am using Humanity Power to change my attitude, providing self-care. This has lead to me being more positive. I’m writing more. I am more protective and am finding renewed interest in my work. </p>



<p>I’ve finished all but one of the six actions. Action 5 of the action kit, the one I’m most excited about. It is next on my plate. I won’t give away the surprise as to what is in the daily challenge, you can take action yourself and download the kit. </p>



<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanity Power 30 Day Challenge



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism. </p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings property and joy without causing harm to others.</p>



<p>If you’re not ready to start the Humanity Power journey just yet, that’s ok. Humanity Power attests that there is unity in humanity. Well, guess what, there is unity in community as well. As a first step, I encourage you to at least join the community, start with action 6, and stay connected with the movement and the mission. If you are ready, jump right in. I encourage you to <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">join</a> the Humanity Power community and take part. You won’t regret it. </p>



<p>For our part at Identity Praxis, we’re focused on helping public institutions, private organizations, and people find an equitable balance as it relates to the exchange of identity and personal information throughout society. After reflecting on the Humanity Power framework, this brings another ‘ism to mind, dataism. We’ll reflect on Datism in a future post. </p>

Atlanta Innovation Forum Live Event



 Program Abstract 



<p>Keeping Pace with the Explosion of Online Traffic… and the Surge of Online Threats Technology has always moved at an accelerating pace. But, since the start of the global pandemic, Internet usage has exploded at a never-before-seen pace, creating an equally explosive opportunity for cybercrime and online security risks. </p>



<p>In 2020: </p>



  Internet traffic has increased by 70% this year; streaming has increased by more than 12%  Ecommerce during the first six months increased more than 30% over online sales from the same time period last year (compared to the previous year to year same period growth of 13%)  Ecommerce sales for June 2020 were up 76% over June 2019 sales; for July 2020, they were up 56% from July 2019   10% of shoppers are making an online purchase for the first time this year, due to social distancing concerns  



<p>The increase is great news for Internet retailers and online service providers. But, it’s also a great opportunity for online criminals. It’s estimated that online crime in 2020 could result in over $6 trillion in losses this year. So what’s being done to address this? What steps are being taken to make online use by businesses and consumers more secure, to keep pace for with the bad guys? What new tech is being employed? How are businesses and technology vendors – many who are competitors – working together to protect their consumer and business customers to reduce losses, protect privacy and confidential data and to keep the ever-smarter bad guys from getting ahead? Join us as a panel of experts from B2B, B2C, Security and InfoSec explore what “high tech” is doing to thwart “high crime”</p>

<p>For my part, I’m going to speak about The Identity Nexus. The Identity Nexus is the elusive equilibrium point where mutual and equitable personal information value exchange between people, public, and private institutions can be had. I’ll discuss the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/08/26/iapp-releases-us-state-comprehensive-privacy-law-comparison-why-this-is-relevant-to-the-identity-nexus/">trinity of self-sovereignty</a> (Privacy, Security, Compliance) and the solutions needed to help us all thrive in the emerging personal information economy.</p>

<p>Katherine Eban, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">deeply reported piece</a>, for Vanity Faire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
government’s strategy?</p>
<p>According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
“Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
states to figure out what they want to do.”</p>
<p>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
leadership and direction.</p>
<p>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
role of government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
about New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his desperate call for supplies.</p>
<p>“That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told Vanity
Fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed we sure have been. Nearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-09-19-2020-11600512793" title="Wall Street Journal: “U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Near 200,000”">200,000 have died</a> from Covid-19 in the
United States to date, with close to 400,000 deaths <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/briefing_US_091820.pdf" title="Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Pandemic Forecast for September 17">forecast by January 1</a>.</p>
<p>I’m restraining myself from quoting more; the reporting is impeccable, and the
truth of the situation deeply alarming. Read <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">the whole thing</a>, then
maybe go for a long walk and practice deep breathing.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>In my never-ending quest to come up with super-simple models I came up with this diagram. This post is a slight editorial refactoring of my recent Twitter thread found&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1305852608087756802?s=20">here</a>.</p>A simple ecosystem model<p>The above illustration is not intended to be an architectural diagram — rather, it helps to 1) clarify conflations, 2) help define scope (the dotted box) and 3) understand motivations — of the parties that exist ‘outside of the&nbsp;system’</p><p>For example, ‘Issuer” usually gets conflated with ‘Authority’ — an authority merely ‘Attests’ — if you recognize it, then you can assume it is authoritative.</p><p>Anyone can attest to anything and issue something. The point of this model is that everything inside the box is neutral to that and solely focused on specific properties everyone needs regardless of intent or&nbsp;role.</p><p>The “Verifier” usually gets conflated with Relying Party. But a Verifier could be an off-the-shelf black box with the firmware baked in to verify against the right DIDs, challenging the holder with Bluetooth or NFC. The “Acceptor” could be logic that simply throws a switch to open a secure door. All done on behalf of a Relying&nbsp;Party.</p><p>The Holder can be anyone outside the system. An individual, organization or device, that is the ultimate ‘holder’ of secrets or cryptographic keys that is the basis of their power to convey intention.</p><p>Finally, the Registrar, is anyone or anything that is responsible for integrity of the ledger (doesn’t have to be blockchain). This ledger is responsible for two fundamental interactions: validation and transfer. In the case of a permissionless system, the ‘Registrar’ is actually an agreed-on set of rules, and proven (or not yet disproven) cryptographic primitives. For permissioned, or centralized systems, it could be a group of people, or even a single person in the back room with an Excel spreadsheet (not blockchain).</p><p>As for the dotted box — you need to determine who/what sits inside or outside of the box. For many outside the box, they may only care about a black box that they trust. This dotted box is also useful when you start thinking about the non-functional properties of the system — black or grey, should it be permissioned, permissionless, restricted access, globally available?</p><p>In the end, what I am trying to achieve is the expression of a simple conceptual model to help me express what could serve the wide range of use cases e.g.: opening a door, applying for university, letting someone across the border, etc. The model could also be used to express simply what we need to start building as a new digital infrastructure.</p><p>As always, this is a work-in-progress. Constructive comments&nbsp;welcome.</p>

And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

<p>The <a href="https://info.braze.com/rs/367-GUY-242/images/BrazeDataPrivacyReport.pdf">Braze Privacy Data Report</a> provides useful insights toward understanding U.S. consumers’ (n=2,000) and marketer executives’ (n=500) opinions regarding personal data usage and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are insightful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marketers should start to take action now, and prepare themselves for the rise of the self-sovereign individual.&nbsp;</p>



 Individuals expect transparency 



<p>According to the study, individuals want transparency. They want to know,&nbsp;</p>



  
  how their data will be used (94%)  who it will be shared with (74%)  what will be done with it (74%)  what data has been collected (70%)  how long it will be retained (59%)  who is storing it (56%)  
  



<p>Marketers agree (99%), but what consumers and marketers don’t agree on is the value exchange and who should be in control of the policies and rules for privacy and personal information management &amp; oversight.</p>



 Ignoring privacy concerns will hurt the bottom line 



<p>Marketers beware!</p>



<p>The Braze report notes that 84% of U.S. adults have decided against engaging a brand due to personal information requests, and 71% did so more than once; and, 75% stopped engaging with a company all together over privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message is clear, properly handling privacy will have a positive impact on the bottom line, and not doing so will be detrimental.&nbsp;</p>



 Value exchange is possible 



<p>People are open to exchanging their personal information, but they want something in return; 71% of consumers will share their personal information in exchange for value:&nbsp;</p>



  60% in exchange for cash; a 2018 study by SYZYGY suggested this could be as much as $150 USD (The Price of Personal Data, 2018)  26% for product and incentives  21% for free content.&nbsp;  



<p>We see a gap here between consumers and marketing executives, as only 31% of marketing executives believe consumers should receive cash in exchange for personal data.&nbsp;</p>



 The privacy expectation gap 



<p>Again, we have a privacy expectations gap in the U.S.; the report finds that 82% of U.S. adults say privacy is important to them, while only 29% of marketing executives hold the same opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is time for the market to listen and begin to respect the sovereignty of the individual.</p>



 Rules and regulations 



<p>As for who should set the rules and regulations for personal information management &amp; oversight and exchange and privacy protection, it’s not clear.</p>



<p>Marketing executives (88%) find the state-by-state sectoral approach in the US burdensome and believe that federal direction could provide clearer directions. And yet, just 52% of marketers and consumers believe the Federal governments should do more.&nbsp;</p>



 The Bottom line 



<p>The bottom line is clear. People are waking up to the fact that their personal information has value. They’re open to exchange, but they expect transparency and compensation. Clearly, from a consumer attitudinal perspective, the personal information economy is at hand, but it is also clear there are industry and regulatory gaps that must first start to close; moreover, we need to develop and deploy the tools to help people safely and securely engage in the exchange of their personal information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Proactively managing your privacy is no longer a luxury, it is a must and it takes conscious effort. One step you may not have considered is blurring your house, face, car or license plate, or some other object on Google Maps? </p>



<p>Why would you want to do this, you might ask? Well, here are a few reasons; I’m sure there are more.</p>



  You have street-facing windows from your bedroom or living room  You’ve been a victim and want to minimize your digital footprint  You generally want to maintain your privacy&nbsp;  



<p>If you decide to do it, it is surprisingly easy. &nbsp;</p>



 Steps to Blur your house on Google Maps 



<p>You can follow the steps below to blur your house on Google Maps.</p>



<p>Warning: According to Google, the blurring of an image on Google Maps is permanent; you can’t reverse it. So, be sure this is what you want to do before you proceed.&nbsp;</p>







  Go to <a href="http://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and enter your home address  Click on the picture of your house to enter Street View mode  Click “Report a problem” link in the bottom-right corner of the screen  Center the red box on the object you want to blur, like your car or home  Click on the object type in the “Request blurring” list  Provide an explanation of why you want to blur the object, in the filed that appears  Enter your email address and hit Sumit.  



<p>Google will evaluate your request. The team (or systems) at Google will consider your request; it is not clear how long this will take. Once they’ve finished reviewing your request, they will let you know if it has been approved or rejected.&nbsp;</p>

Spritely Goblins
v0.7
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
CapTP support
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project! 
 Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can …

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

They matter to the government, they matter much less to the Internet. What matters to the Internet are the names of our websites, our emails, our profiles, our wallets. These names are useful — we can host stuff with them, share with them, and pay with them. These name are fluid — they can be pseudonyms, we can have multiple, and they can change on a whim.</p><blockquote><p>The more our lives happen on the internet, the more our internet names take precedent. And the more we rely on internet names, the more the architecture of that namespace matters.</p></blockquote> What is Handshake? <p>In the current DNS system, top-level domains like .com and .org are awarded by ICANN. Select governments, non-profits, and for-profit companies are given TLDs and can issue sub-domains like google.com. ICANN and these TLD owners are the gatekeepers of our namespace.</p><p>Handshake is a decentralized naming protocol. It replaces the root zone file where top-level domain ownership is stored with a blockchain that anyone can use. Handshake domains are uncensorable, permissionless, and free of gatekeepers. Anyone can register and own a top-level domain. They can be used like traditional TLDs (i.e blog.blockchannel/) or by themselves (i.e blockchannel/). You can be your own registrar that sells subdomains or you can&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/roneilr/status/1281714771729907712?s=20">gift subdomains to users of your network</a>.</p><p>You can name more than just web pages, too — you can name social handles, profiles, digital wallets, or smart contracts. Handshake collapses all the various naming use cases into one thing. Domains that name more can do more. Handshake domains can host frontends, accept payments, run financial protocols, or receive encrypted messages all with cryptographic assurances of the endpoints you are interacting with. Handshake is sound namespace. It serves as a foundation for more secure domains with far more programmable use cases.</p> What is HNS? <p>HNS is the currency of the Handshake network; effectively now, the Internet has&nbsp;become&nbsp;money.</p><p>HNS is used to pay for names. Initially, top-level domains are released into circulation through auctions. HNS is used to place bids in TLD auctions. TLD owners can then sell subdomain space in HNS.</p><p>HNS is also used as gas to pay transaction fees. Every auction bid, name transfer, or subsequent economic transaction on Handshake requires a fee denominated in HNS. In seven months, users have submitted 1.7M+ transactions.</p><blockquote><p>A namespace economy is emerging, and it runs on&nbsp;dollarydoos.</p></blockquote><a href="https://hnscan.com/charts/totaltransactions"></a> Fig 1. Total Transactions on Handshake via <a href="https://hnscan.com/charts/totaltransactions">HNScan</a>.   <br>The Moneyness of HNS <p>All blockchains have native cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is not inherently money, it must earn its moneyness. In order to assess the moneyness of a cryptocurrency, we must first define the properties of money, of which there are three.</p><p>(1) Money is a store of value. In order to maintain its value over time, money should be scarce, hard to produce, and desired.</p><p>(2) Money is a medium of exchange. It should be widely accepted as a means of payment in the market for goods or services.</p><p>(3) Money is a unit of account. It is the ruler by which other things of value are measured.</p><p>Handshake has two native assets — its currency and its namespace. The use of HNS to engage with Handshake domains satisfies all three properties of money. As a result, HNS achieves an inherent moneyness for the namespace economy.</p><p>HNS is a store of value.</p><p>HNS is locked in TLD auctions. Being locked refers to its use as escrow for users’ auction bids. In order for users to lock up HNS, it must maintain its value for the duration of an auction. Total HNS locked, today at over 27M, is a measure of HNS as a store of value asset.</p><p>Store of value assets should be provably scarce and HNS is increasingly so. Auction lockups temporarily constrain HNS supply. Winning bid amounts are burned from circulation, permanently constraining HNS supply. Nearly 10M HNS have been&nbsp;<a href="https://hnscan.com/charts/burned">burned to date</a>.</p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d43fb10-3aa0-45f7-9308-2e57d8fa1d09_2466x1080.png"></a> Fig. 2 Total HNS Locked on Handshake via <a href="https://hnscan.com/charts/locked">HNScan</a>.  <p><br>HNS is a medium of exchange. </p><p>HNS is traded for namespace on Handshake. Without a native asset, cryptocurrency must compete with fiat currencies as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin can be a good store of value but it’s not clear what assets are worth parting ways with your BTC for. ETH over time has attracted a set of digital assets to trade with, though it still competes as a medium of exchange with stablecoins on Ethereum. Namespace, as a native asset to the chain, creates an inherent medium of exchange quality to HNS.</p><p>HNS is a unit of account. </p><p>Names are priced in HNS. Bids are placed and measured in HNS. Emergent HNS pricing patterns for top-level and subdomains, uncorrelated to USD or BTC denominated values, will reinforce HNS as its own unit of account over time.</p><p>In meatspace, money is location specific. In cyberspace, money is application specific. BTC, ETH, and HNS can all achieve moneyness in their own application-specific jurisdictions. HNS is money for the namespace economy.</p> Namespace Scalability <p>The birth of cryptocurrency taught us how&nbsp;<a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html">scalable markets require scalable money</a>. With Ether’s base layer, we now have decentralized financial markets sourcing, automating, and allocating&nbsp;<a href="https://defimarketcap.io/">billions of dollars in capital</a>. Well, a scalable web requires a scalable namespace.</p><p>A name makes you legible to a network and there’s a growing set of networks online. But not all namespace is created equal. When we move from a system secured by ICANN to one secured by code, we go from a system that is manual and inconsistent in security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure.</p><p>Decentralized naming is a step towards the vision for a decentralized web (DWeb). Steven McKie of Amentum taught us why a focus on securing domain names is actually a foundation for scaling to a wider set of tooling for identity, login, social networking, and more.</p><blockquote><p>[Low level technologies] that are built to be more generalized from the start will many times fail to gain necessary traction… it’s only those protocols that are app-specific which will find a niche to scale and&nbsp;then&nbsp;generalize overtime. The DWeb will be no different. Its innate generalizability allows rich experimentation (with public chain incentives), and when we get to that phase, that’s when we will see the app cycle of decentralized apps be taken seriously.</p><p>- Steven McKie,&nbsp;<a href="https://amentum.substack.com/p/the-decentralized-web">The Decentralized Web</a></p></blockquote><p>Namespace is an Internet primitive. Once you look for it, it’s everywhere. And its reinvention is the foundation for a better, more decentralized web.</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>Today in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/creepy-geofence-finds-anyone-near-crime-scene/?bxid=5cc9e0b124c17c766aabcf24&amp;cndid=52111978&amp;esrc=Wired_etl_load&amp;source=EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_TRANSPORTATION_ZZ&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_mailing=WIR_FastForwardTopClickers%202020-09-07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=nl&amp;utm_term=WIR_TopClickers_EXCLUDE_Transportation">Wired</a>, I read about geofencing warrants. </p>



<p>Geofence Warrants&nbsp;are a law enforcement practice. Law enforcement submits a request to tech companies, notably Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, for a list of all the devices in, at, or near a location during a specific period of time. The objective of this practice is to identify people to be interviewed as part of an investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example,</p>



  To identify devices within a few hundred yards to a mile of a murder scene, or accident.   



<p>As of the summer of 2020, this practice is coming under scrutiny, as some have raised privacy concerns about the practice; the practice could cause harm. It could have an adverse effect on individuals’ right to privacy and civil liberties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, it could be used</p>



  
  to identify people during a protest in violation of the protesters’<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">&nbsp;First Amendment rights</a>, i.e. the right to free speech.  in densely populated areas in violation of individuals’&nbsp;<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth Amendment rights</a>, namely their right to “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizure.”  



<p>I’m all for the development of technology and the use of technology to maintain societal safety and democracy, but I do have my concerns. I want to believe that most people and organizations have well-meaning intentions, that they want to create value for people and themselves, but capabilities like geofencing have so many applications that can be used for malign purposes. We need to be careful.</p>



<p>I think it is crucial that we develop a wide range of technology that leverages personal data, like an individual’s location, to generate value for both society and for the individual, but it is imperative that we find ways to ensure individual users of this technology have the ability to maintain their agency and self-sovereignty.  </p>

   Are KPI’s innovations nemesis?  Apple’s underlying philosophy is about “better.” It is likely that if Apple’s executives were leading the response to COVID19, they would not be planning for a “Return to Normal” or creating a “New Normal,” they would be focussed on how to make what we have better! <p>The demands of complex judgment, coupled with changing requirements in a volatile environment, determine that stability is prioritised over change, as risk is already difficult enough to explain and manage.&nbsp; Outstanding leadership in 2020 is to focus on making one thing better; it must make a difference whilst adjusting other concerns for better outcomes.&nbsp; Therefore, what is the one stand out priority that demands attention and focus that delivers “better?”</p><p>Throughout lockdown, I have remained focused on how to provide data that has provenance and lineage to the Board, the aim to improve decisions and get to better outcomes.&nbsp; Central to the thinking was a linkage between measurement, performance, management and judging if the outcome was better.&nbsp; The insights shared below are independent of company size, structure or leadership. The prime recommendations are 1. Discover and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ incentives. 2. Find and modify reinforcement linkages between outcomes and culture so that all questions can be rewarded.</p><p>The focus of this article is on the application of #data for #growth through #innovation. The insights are independent of company structure or leadership.&nbsp; The challenge is if you can only make one thing better, as you will read, HR is a strong contender.</p><p>+ + + + + +&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 1 details the blocks that are used in the diagrams which will describe the systems of innovation. The blue circle is a choice or a decision point; the grey squares are where people are involved in the system, and the oval shape is the beginning or end of a process.</p><p></p><p>Figure 1: explaining the blocks</p><br><p>Figure 2 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation process in startups. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all startups, but to identify critical differences to the corporate world and why innovation feels easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 2: Innovation process in startups</p><p>Explaining figure 2. Starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram,&nbsp; “Hypothesis or Thesis”.&nbsp;</p><p>Typically a team will come together with an idea, and the Hypothesis Or Thesis determines the data required for the Data Lake. There is a flow from a Data Lake to Knowledge and Insights on the left. The process tests the Thesis the team created through analysis using the available data. The analysis process generates Knowledge and Insight, which closes an agile feedback system as knowledge and Insight refines what data we need in a Data Lake to complement the analysis which tests the team’s Thesis or Hypothesis. Knowledge and Insights give rise to recommendations which leads to Decisions. Decisions over time, become Outcomes, which we measure. Knowing and measuring Outcomes help us refine and define better the requirements we have for the data in our Data Lake, thus creating a second slower iterative improvement system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our Data Lake has a relationship or correlation to the Bias and Assumptions we have as a team.&nbsp; There is a closed-loop system between Bias and Assumptions and the Data Lake that further helps inform the Data Lake and reminds us of our Bias and Assumptions. A second influence on Bias and Assumption is the team’s Beliefs and Culture. Open cultures enable teams to question their Bias and Assumptions, whilst other cultures may avoid questions. A culture that encourages questioning will enable open-minded teams to continually check if they have the correct thesis and data in a Data Lake, and undertake the analysis without creating an outcome that was forecast. There is a link between Bias and Assumptions, which helps us in our decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><p>In a collaborative, open and free-thinking system, being able to check assumptions will enlighten decisions, leading to better outcomes. In an early-stage company, Reward and Motivation structure are not coupled to Outcomes as there is no revenue or direct causal correlation. The Reward and Motivation is fundamentally the team and individuals driven to do their best, as the team is there to prove their Hypothesis or Thesis, and to grow a company based on their collective thinking. Reward and Motivation structures create Patterns and Alignments. When the team’s perception of Patterns and Alignments are open, the loop is responsive and adaptive to questions and problems. We know our behaviours link Patterns and Alignments with the Knowledge and Insights we search for. We see this linkage in the methods and priorities that are created and focussed on. Priorities will give rise to recommendations which lead to decisions where outcomes help us refine a data Lake to improve continually and hypothesis. An agile loop of continual improvement.</p><p>In startups, this system leads to rapid development, creative thinking within an adaptive self-improving process.&nbsp; The improvement is creating a refinement of the hypothesis, the data, the analysis and witnessed as outcomes which create change. In a system driven by data, and the ability to challenge and question everything, we find outcomes and culture focus on refining a hypothesis/thesis and the team strives to refine continually and improve which supports innovation and drives growth. It feels easy as the system enables flow.</p><p>Moving our attention to mature businesses,&nbsp; before the actions are presented.&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 3 presents a generic &amp; simplified innovation cycle in mature businesses. The purpose is not to explain all innovation in all enterprises, but to identify critical differences to the startup world and why innovation feels harder. More dependencies are immediately noticeable.</p><p></p><p>Figure 3: Innovation process in mature businesses&nbsp;</p><p>In figure 3, starting from the white block positioned bottom middle of the diagram, “Memory and/or Processes”.&nbsp; This block was a “Hypothesis or Thesis” in startups.&nbsp; In the corporate world, trading history has provided experience, teams, revenue and methodology, which includes memory and processes that deliver barriers to entry, IP and often the core value of the company.</p><p>A critical link is already established between Memory and/or Processes and, Beliefs and Culture.&nbsp; Often this is visible in recruiting people who already adhere to the Beliefs and Culture of the company (search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=organisational+fit">organisational fit</a>). An influential culture determines that this is the way we do things, based on Memory and Processes, which usually removes the ability to question Bias and Assumptions (this is how we do it.)&nbsp; We retain the same Bias and Assumptions which taints/ colours or distorts Decisions.&nbsp; Decisions over time, become Outcomes.&nbsp; In mature businesses, everything is measured (what does not get measured cannot be managed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We measure the success of our Outcomes. Successful Outcomes re-enforces that our Beliefs and Culture are right so we should not change.&nbsp; Unsuccessful outcomes are seen as an error in the model, data or analysis and that we need more of the right data.&nbsp; The Outcome tends to favour or aligns to Rewards and Motivations as incentives and bonuses are linked directly to the outcome.&nbsp; With Outcomes measures and aligned to Rewards and Motivations, we have a confirmational bias towards certain Patterns and Alignments, that favours individual success.&nbsp; This restricts the options and learning from outcomes and will direct our priorities, meaning we will search for certain Knowledge and Insights in our data set, especially ones that we can recommend as a decision, that creates an outcome which aligns to our personal performance metrics, established by the memory in the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Central in the diagram in Figure 3 is Delta in Risk.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; When an organisation is finance-led, risk is modelled, defined and understood. Financial data and controls ensure that processes are designed to control risk at the agreed level.&nbsp; Data creates many dynamic changes within an organisation.&nbsp; Critically data introduces clarity and understanding of risks that could not be seen through the pure lens of finance. Ignoring cyber attacks and loss of data as a systemic risk, the data risk of interest here is the identification of new insights about products, services, teams, partners, processes that data brings to the attention of employees and Directors—a delta in risk.&nbsp; Many of the closed-loop reinforcement and confirmational biased feedback loops can be identified, but are structured to ignore this new risk. Where risk is identified, it creates instability in memory, bias, assumptions and decision making. Still, because of the strength of existing processes, the tension may not lead to change but rather a higher level of frustration, denial and protectionism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Existing processes have memory and efficiency of flow that can improve incrementally what already exists. The same memory is designed to resist flow-oriented towards a change of the process itself.</p><p>In a complicated closed-loop system driven by data; where outcomes drive rewards and culture removes the ability to challenge and question, our memory and processes continually re-enforce the same patterns. We find we are unable to adapt to the new vulnerabilities and risks that data adds, which is destabilising. We unpack that our processes are not set to support disruptive innovation or iteration at scale. Data can define a set of possibilities and constraints&nbsp;located in the past. Data has and is biased, and those biases are different and unique. Data has no imagination or creativity, and it will keep doing the same thing.&nbsp; Data cannot create a solution on its own.</p> Comparing the models <p>In mature business's innovation appears more difficult, my experience shows innovation itself is not more difficult, however, the willingness to accept, create change, adapt, steer to a new course that innovation brings is more difficult due to closed-loop feedback systems. The take away is that in start-up land there is less measurement and that means there are fewer linkages to confirmational loops.&nbsp; Are KPI’s innovations nemesis?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Figure 4: Simplified models compared</p><p>By example, from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesmith9/">Mike Smith,</a> here are three measurements that create continual frustration for innovation teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As a legal representative for this company, it’s my job to make sure we don’t sign any contracts that put us in a perilous position, and to make sure that we’re abiding by all local laws and regulations”. I am a Fellow of my legal institution and am professionally bound by their code of conduct, and I am measured by how few lawsuits we are involved in, both with other companies and with other institutions. I am incentivised to avoid that risky innovative contract.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“As the lead for HR in this company, and being responsible for employee retention and well-being, it’s my responsibility to make sure we recruit carefully following appropriate laws (no discrimination etc), and ideally minimize employee dismissals as they are disruptive and represent risk to the company. “ I am measured on the avoidance of claims, and really don't want to recruit that brilliant and outspoken evangelist who has 1,000,000 followers on BLM.</p>  <p>“As CFO, I need to make sure our books balance and are fiscally responsible. When it comes to the product team needing money for research and development, we need to balance investment with income, and ensure that the solvency of the company isn’t in question.” I am a member of a professional body and my reputation is my next job. It will count against me if as the CFO I agree to a large loan to accomplish some critical work that others view as essential for company growth and it goes wrong. My bonus is based on avoiding risky financial transactions.</p>  <p>Often the system we have created for stability, measurement and risk avoidance which rewards key individuals for doing their job well, but this can stand counter to innovation.</p> People in the Loop&nbsp; <p>Whilst the model recognises the processes that surround our peers, teams, people and staff, it does not wholly recognise the agency of individuals.&nbsp; Our company may have ethics but our divisions, functions and eco-systems all have their own unique moral codes, which changes.&nbsp; Our company often thinks about culture rather than seeing the 100 cultures by clusters of our stakeholders and wider dependent communities, including extended family.&nbsp; What is driving an individual at this moment and how they make a choice which will have implications is not seen by the systems, as our systems are crafted for efficiency and stability.&nbsp; Humans are both in the loop, but more often are the loop.&nbsp; Humans are the workforces and feedback loops with their creativity, reluctance and behaviour creating colour in a very grey scale process driven organisation.&nbsp; This simple model would be a 100 page book, just by adding people's behaviour and attitude to innovation at each point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Recommendations for becoming more innovative by breaking something? <p>My recommendation based on experience and experiment is that innovation, disruption and transformation are difficult but not impossible. They all start from knowing what to transform.&nbsp; Therefore if innovation is what you are seeking in mature businesses, here are some ideas:-</p>  <p>Find and break the right number of critical links between outcomes and rewards/ motivations. This means taking a critical view of reward calculations, annual reviews, remuneration packages and incentive programs.

   <p>Organisational fitness is being capable to do the job efficiently and creating growth but fitness does not equally deliver effectiveness, sustainability or long-term survivability.&nbsp; The latter being characteristics of organisational wellness.&nbsp; Best outcomes require both fitness and wellness, however, fitness is easier to deliver, measure and reward. Balancing the ease of short-term measurement with long-term consequences is a critical task for leadership.</p><p></p><p>“Fitness” in human terms is a means of doing repetitive exercises with the aim of maintaining or improving physical condition, it is focused on physical health. We can measure a person’s level of fitness. “Organisational Fitness” is an approach to understanding current efficiency and performance of the company based on qualitative measurement. Organisational fitness provides metrics for the critical areas of systems and processes and through KPI’s enable management and reporting by comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>Fitness is seen as physical exercise to gain strength. Strength is gained from repetition but we know that strength gained by repetition can it can equally result in the reduction or loss of flexibility. Indeed strength may be gained only in a single dimension.&nbsp; Elite sportspersons are specialists and know that they train to be the best for the demands of their sport, which does not mean they perform well in all sports. Companies with highly automated and repetitive processes can be fit for purpose, highly efficient and outperform others but equally be brittle, fragile and stiff.&nbsp; Being an elite company in one sector does not mean your processes translate well to other sectors.</p><p>“Wellness” in humans terms, has a complex dependency on combining body health, mental health and a current emotional state. The determination of wellness or well-being takes into account how these concepts are balanced for good outcomes, based on experience and expertise.&nbsp; Whilst measurement of fitness is understood, measurement of body health,&nbsp; mental health and emotional state are subjective and less quantifiable. Trying to determine “Organisational Wellness” has the same subjective qualification. Organisation-wellness unpicks team, culture and behaviours to determine if when combined together the company has the capacity, capability and focus to continue to succeed in the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;  Human Wellness is not Fitness! <p>Fitness is focussed on being physically well (healthy), however, there is no assessment of your mental state or stress level.&nbsp; Wellness determines how you cope with all your mental issues and can help define a lifestyle that invigorates your soul. Wellness is more of a translation of your internal states in coping with the situations of life but does not mean you are fit.</p><p>When a person puts in physical efforts or any kind of physical activity that helps them stay in shape; this is fitness. Fitness programs solely indulge individuals in achieving the marked standards of a physically fit body like weight, fat content or BMI.&nbsp; It should include a specific diet planform a proper nutritionist to maintain and improve the physical health of a person. Wellness being about raising a person’s self-esteem, driving the person to find motivation within themselves. A <a href="https://www.nimba.in/packages/">Wellness program</a> helps improve the intellectual abilities of a person which in turn encourages the sense of being physically fit.</p><p>Fitness often becomes performance based on measurement of the weight, reputation or time, the higher the efficiency the more brittle or fragile the person becomes to anything outside of the demanded routine.&nbsp;</p><p>Wellness can become a defence, protection and the ability to cope.&nbsp; The measure of wellness is judged externally by others as happiness, contentedness or peace as we have no ability to grasp what is actually going on in the mind. We determine that actions are a correlation to the state of the mind.&nbsp; But coping and appearing content is not a true sign of wellness and wellness is not a sign of fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Organisational Fitness is not Wellness</p><p>Fitness for purpose is the concept in which a company, product or service is adequate for the purpose for which the stakeholder, buyer, user, consumer selected the offer. Achieving fit-for-purpose in each context is difficult but can be measured and improved. Business owners and creators of products and services need system and processes for understanding needs and to be able to deliver.&nbsp; Being fit for purpose does not determine anything beyond the short term demand or alignment.&nbsp; Organisation-wellness focusses on the team, culture and behaviours to determine the company has the capacity, capability and focus to continue to succeed in the long term.&nbsp; Organisational fitness is efficiency or efficacy whereas, wellness is effectiveness or purpose.</p><p>Organisational wellness determines how the company will cope with externalities that bring stress and strains. Wellness is more of a translation of your internal states in coping with the situations, complexities and market changes that you are unable to control.</p><p>When an organisation puts in the effort to become more efficient; this is improving organisational fitness. Efficiency programs indulge companies in achieving the best industry metrics and standards and focus teams to raise the bar that drives better outcomes for certain parties.&nbsp; Wellness being about an organisations purpose, mission and values drive the team to find a north star and then guide the organisation towards it. An organisational w<a href="https://www.nimba.in/packages/">ellness program</a> helps improve the abilities of leadership and staff to cope with market conditions, determine better outcomes and be better ancestors, which in turn encourages the sense of balancing a drive for efficiency and effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisational Fitness often becomes purely performance-based and dependent on the measurement to program KPI’s, often without any consideration of the unintended consequences of any KPI or a combination fo KPI to drive behaviours. Higher efficiency demands better integration and this increased the brittleness/ dependency on other parties. As we move to more automation and an increasing dependency on data, ML and AL efficiency is a target, however, this same drive can be seen to make the system and processes more fragile to systemic shocks, which were so rare we discounted the risk to zero. Enter a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisation wellness can become a defence mechanism and self-repairing protection, setting-up the ability of a company to cope with significant externality shocks.&nbsp; The measure of wellness is beyond tricky, highly subjective and often driven by a particular political/ personal agenda but that does not mean we should not try. We can determine wellness over time and from past experience, but determining it right now is hard. This is where leadership and governance come into focus as skills. Critically is why some senior executives often fail to cross the chasm from being top of their game in the efficiency and KPI measurement world to the governance and oversight demand that a board requires.</p> Leadership for “organisational-fitness” is different from leadership required for “organisational- wellness” <p>There is a change in focus and requirements between being a senior team member and a director which is illustrated below, the Director being on the right and senior leadership on the left.</p><p></p><p>The behaviour of management is described by the blue diamond. The is a task to be completed, and there is an incentive to complete it and do it in the most efficient way. The motivation is a reward (money, profile), and we have a look of a driven professional who delivers the KPI’s. In this blue cycle, the outcome is achieved by the people in the system backed by the process.</p><p>The green diamond represents a system where everything is connected, each creating a dynamic dependency on everything else. Whilst the blue diamond orients towards employees, the green towards Directors. The point is that the blue diamond operating system trains for efficiency and does not train or develop skills for operating in the green diamond environment, effectiveness.&nbsp;</p> Back to skills needed for directors <p>The chart below shows how skills should be formed over a period to create individuals who can work together with other professionals who can deal with highly complex decision making (judgment). The grey areas are where the “<a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/the-accumulation-of-an-executives-successfulness-with-kpi-measures-is-not-an-indicator-of-a-future-a170409a0c8a">Peters Principle</a>” can be seen in practice; individuals act outside of their capacity and/or are not given sufficient responsibility and become disruptive.</p><p>The yellow/ mustard zone is where many senior executives get trapped as they are unable to adapt from acting in their own interests (blue diamond) to acting in the best interests of the organisation and eco-system (green diamond) as all their training is how to perform better in the blue.</p><p></p>  <br>   Organisational Wellness&nbsp; <p>Organisational fitness is hard but relatively simple to measure, an organisations wellness is far more difficult. However, in human wellness, we have determined that our actions are a correlation to the state of the mind.&nbsp; Perhaps the takeaway from this is how we measure and report on Board decisions is far more critical than just another data set, but is rather an indicator of the wellness of the organisation and its ability to continue in the future. If we measure wellness we can also measure sickness and highlight decisions that prevent the organisation from becoming sick.&nbsp;</p><br>

   <p>The unimagined: unimagined&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your mind will have already assumed that this chapter, from its title, is presenting the unimagined outcomes, a discourse to overly optimistic viewpoints.&nbsp; It is reasonable that anyone reading a book on Pathways to General AI will have interrupted the word, “unimagined” within this context. Before you skip this chapter as you are a believer that AI is the future or don’t need another comfort blanket chapter speaking to the fearful of AI,&nbsp; this chapter is neither. It is not a wild fantasy of the possible nor is a negative chapter of the unknown risks and likely machine run apocalyptics. This chapter presents a matrix which enables the holder of either viewpoint to debate and discuss the unimagined together.&nbsp;</p><p>However, to reach the matrix we have to create a framework first, which gives the reader a clear and coherent communication tool to position imagined AI initiatives.&nbsp;</p> THE SIMPLEST ECONOMIC MODEL <p>Figure 1 presents a straightforward process. Raw materials are inputs to a process called gain, which creates an output. This simple model describes any process of adding value and a central core of a business. Indeed, applying the same model to our daily human life where the inputs are food and water, the gain is our process of living, and the output is our activity.</p><br><p></p> Figure 1. A simple model <p>This simple model is an open-loop system, and it is unstable. It cannot exist in isolation as it exists in a complex world where single processes are continually interacting with other processes, all affecting each other. To create stability systems depend on feedback loops, where the output is fed back to create an input.</p><p>The most straightforward stable control system is termed a negative feedback loop. Figure 2 presents how you take the output after a process of gain and SUBTRACT (take is away) from the input. (the green loop.) If we took all of the gain away, there would be no value created [output — input*gain = 0], so we attenuate the output (reduce it by a factor) before the closing the loop. This negative feedback loop allows the output to track the input. Imagine the input increases, after a gain process, the output increases, however as the output is feedback and taken away from the higher input, the actual input into the process is corrected and controlled. Significant changes are avoided and small modifications are tracked. It is stable but enables innovation, agile changes and minor adjustments.</p><p></p> Figure 2. A simple negative feedback loop <p>This is a control system. The negative feedback loop (subtracting the output from the input) delivers stability and control. It has stood the test of time. Technically the system control order of response [1st, 2nd, 3rd or higher orders] will depend on internal dependencies and external complexities; but give rise to different response times and the accuracy in tracking changes.</p><p>As a business function, we like this negative feedback loop, using planning and controls to keep businesses stable but iterating and growing in a controlled manner; innovation is incremental. In psychology think Nudge. In human terms this loop of control is happening all the time in our cells and is called homeostasis. Our body temperature remains at c.37oC irrespective of environment, food, clothing and activity. Society, politics and economics thrive on this stability cycle, continually making small adjustments to maintain order. In perspective; our lives, societies, businesses and environment remain in this stable loop for over 90% of the time.</p><p>Another control loop is presented in Figure 3, and it is a positive feedback loop. In this case, you take the output after a process of gain and ADD it to the input. (the yellow loop.) In this case, we take the output after the process of gain and amplify (make it bigger) then add this to the input. In audio terms, this type of feedback loop creates that loud ringing sound or in business planning, it is the magical hockey curve or exponential growth for a unicorn. It establishes fundamental accelerating change.</p><br><p></p> Figure 3. A simple positive feedback loop <br><p>Positive feedback loops create instability, at the end of each cycle round the loop a new level is achieved. This positive feedback loop creates disruptive innovation and change. The control loop order (how quickly something changes and how much change) will depend on complexity, time and the resources available.</p><p>In the human terms, the negative feedback cycle delivered stability which is seen as homeostasis; this positive feedback loop delivers mitosis (cell division and growth) and meiosis (having children) or death when it gets out of control (cancer and virus).&nbsp;</p><p>In business terms, negative feedback loops are times of stability and slow growth, positive feedback loops exist in times of rapid change, disruption and high growth. In perspective; our lives, societies and environment can only remain in unstable change loops for a brief period, less than 10% as it is as destructive as well as creative.</p><p>It is possible to show change by attenuating the output and adding it to the input, rather than amplifying; however, often you can’t control the amplification or attenuation.</p> THE CONNECTED MODEL <p>Combining these two models (positive and negative feedback loops) is obvious, we need both to understand our world of stability and change. We see this in our bodies every day at a cell level every day or when the disruption of when we are ill or a child arrives. We see the history of societies change across the passing of centuries, and at an environmental/ecology level across the millennium.</p><p>In business, the negative feedback loop allows us to be increasingly smart at one thing in the short term driven through continuous improvement yielding efficiency and getting to the best or optimal solution. In contrast, the positive feedback loop allows us to change, do radical innovation to create new products or markets, buy companies, and sustain high growth over a long period.</p><p>There is much evidence that our behaviours swop between these different loops. In Jonathan Haidt’s book “The Righteous Mind” he looks into the psychology of human beings and why they believe what they believe. In his studies, he’s found that humans generally think of themselves and are selfish. They mostly behave like their ancestors, chimpanzees. They’ll take care of their own needs first, then think of others — stability. However, Haidt also explains that humans, in certain instances, also behave like bees with a hive mind. At times, a switch can be flipped, which causes a human to think of the group before him or herself. When this mental state is achieved, one will even die for the group they care for. They become a part of something much larger than themselves.</p> COMPLICATED COLLABORATIVE MODELS <p>To bring the two feedback loop models together we need to introduce a third idea, the choice selector, Figure 4. The Choice selector picks which feedback loop, stable or unstable, we should currently be in. How we get to choose which loop we are in now and how to move from stable to change (different) and back to stable at a new level is “complex.” This choice selector is either where intelligence (learning &amp;/or experience) is applied to change the cycle, meaning you are in control of the choice, or it is where you are reactive and forced to change. For humans we can see we can choose to change using a positive feedback loop two ways, we can choose to have a child (intelligence) or become ill (forced). In business, we can choose to be disruptive (intelligence) or react (forced) to the disruption.</p><br><p></p> Figure 4 Choice Selector  THE APPLICATION TO AI <p>Building on the feedback loops of stability and change with a choice selector it is possible to explore where Machine (AI) is best and where Human is best and if there are scenarios where Human + machine (AI) would be a better outcome.&nbsp; This becomes the AI matrix, figure 5.</p><p></p><p>Figure 5. The AI matrix</p> EXPLAINING THE AI MATRIX <p>Walking down the Stability column in Figure 5. In the stable loop (negative feedback loop/ green) without a doubt, AI can deliver. AI will be transformative in terms of getting to the best solution, fast. Why: because in stable loops there is lots of data and it has been and will likely remain stable. The past data is an excellent indicator of future outcomes, training data works. Be careful as it is not that easy. The data can be biased and corrupt, but the application of AI in this loop is a winning strategy. If the human is in this loop, we will probably get it wrong (motivations, bias and politics). If Human + AI, the human still likely get things wrong. However, as proven in gaming (chess and Go), human + machine does work well and can lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Walking down the Change column in Figure 5.&nbsp; In the change loop (positive feedback loop/ yellow) AI is just not up to it. The base reason is that we don’t know where we are starting from or where we are going, and there is no or very little data. What the machine determines to do and why will be random and unknown. If a project is being presented to you asking for funding to use AI to change anything, walk away. Putting the human as the lead for change (it is what we do today) but we know it is sub-optimal as humans have issues and limits. Human and machine (AI) is a fascinating solution as we can eliminate the worst human characterises that leads to bad decision making but getting the AI to support the decision but not take them.</p><p>The final column, the choice selector, picking which loop to follow. It is where we allow the AI/ machine to choose for us. Fear, uncertainty and doubt are outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>What this means is that if someone is presenting to you, an AI to make choices for you for which loop, probably right now the best action is to AVOID and run for the hills. The human leads on choice, and we have spent the past 5,000 years getting to rules, regulations, governance and government. We and our system have a few problems, but we (should be) are in control. Transparency is increasingly essential in choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Human and AI together to make choices highlights a critical issue, who decides and “who decides, who decides.”&nbsp; Who polices the police? How do you ever know what someone else has put in an AI that is helping you decide? Currently asking a machine to help you choose for stability or change does not feel right.</p> THE UNIMAGINED: UNIMAGINED&nbsp; <p>The previous framework gets us to a point where someone, somewhere has imagined something to do with AI, but without us all understanding how it fits into the systems of life which mean we struggle to make a judgment call if the outcome is favourable or not.&nbsp; This last section expands to the unimagined: unimagined and how we can discuss and debate what AI means for humanity and where AI may take us.</p><p></p> Figure 6: The unimagined: unimagined&nbsp; <p>Expanding on figure 6, starting from the top right corner.&nbsp; Two highly experienced professionals are problem-solving. They share a common understanding of the problem as it is imagined to them both.&nbsp; It is possible to grasp that they can easily and quickly get to a common language, agreement and a shared sense of what to do next.&nbsp; The majority of day-to-day problem solving is reaching through a shared and collective understanding and communication.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of AI, the imagined: imagined space is Machine Learning, Deep Learning, algorithms and data.&nbsp; Variance is acceptable but there is an appreciation of what the methods do and how they work. It embraces the concept that new methodologies will be created.</p><p>More difficult is when something is imagined to one expert as a clear route ahead based on deep insight and analysis. The expert has clarity based on their framing, bias, time to think and data, but this is the first time for another professional. In this situation, perfect clarity can look like madness to someone else. &nbsp; Similarly, if the expert and professional swopped positions an imaged a solution become obvious to the professional and foolish to an expert.&nbsp; In both these cases, the is no substitute for time and the sharing of facts, insight and knowledge. Over time and with compromise, the two should be able to agree on the route ahead as it becomes imagined to both of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Imagined to one expert and rejected by other experts is a wide range of topics around AI, based on bias, life expectation and experience. Elon Musk and Bill Gates talk to their fears where we allow the AI/ machine to choose which loop (stable or change) for us.&nbsp; To them, it is clear, to others, it is madness. With time, advancement and more data points positions will change, and we will come to agree on how to deliver governance, oversight and stewardship that allows for the better outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, unimagined: unimagined, the bottom right quadrant. It is where we can come together to consider beauty and systemic risk.&nbsp; We can park all imagined to any party and explore the unimagined. In this case, it is no longer about a decision based on interruption of available data or facts but the requirement for complex judgment.&nbsp; We have to work together to determine the bias that we each bring and to find a way to articulate what scenarios looks like so others can also imagine it.&nbsp; The unimagined: unimagined is not about the solution, but what the problem is and how to determine what an impact will be. It is right now that we realise that our words fail us in our ability to shared what is already imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Undoubtedly, the first step would be to accept that parts of all imagined scenarios will play out. We should stop arguing or rejecting models believing that we have foresight into highly dependent, emergent, complex and adaptive ecosystems.&nbsp;</p><p>A second step is to create new names, words and language that doesn’t have an immediate bias, but where we can explore what the ontology of our latest thinking would mean.&nbsp; We distort what we imagine to create outcomes that we favour in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p>The unimagined is long term, which is where we need to go for general AI, not the superficial imagined, not the next 1 or 10 years, but the forthcoming century and millennium.&nbsp; Let’s have fun creating new words such as “Onama” that means, “leave all the imagined ideas about sci-fi,&nbsp; cyborgs, robots and augmented reality outside.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With new names or words, that don’t have an immediate bias or expectation, we can turn our thinking to governance, stewardship and oversight, exploring who has power, agency or influence in the previously unimagined scenarios.&nbsp;</p> <br>

We are accelerating our collection and use of data.&nbsp; Boards need to get deep and dirty with data and the ethics of judgement based on data, it is complex and often requires new skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Boards are biased towards professionals who represent experience in finance, legal, operations, marketing and sales.&nbsp; These “core functions” are supported by professionals with information, innovation, technology and HR expertise.&nbsp; Boards will typically have a deep appreciation of and for the expertise in each of the core functions and will have their own experience in each core area to draw on as a reference point.&nbsp; Members feel comfortable understanding and questioning strategy, ratios, metrics, margins and returns. Often the supporting functions are represented by a single professional and there is little broader expertise amongst the other Board members. When data and ethics enter the room, most members feel uncomfortable. Still, there is a chorus of opinions backed from well known academic institutes, leading consultancies, articles and journals but little practical grounding. This paragraph is an observation on the current status and not a criticism, data, ethics and data ethics are new and this chapter details questions we should be reflecting on and asking, as data is now fundamentally a core function.</p><p>Lies, damn lies and statistics is an unattributed quote but helpful in the context of discussing data and ethics. The use of statistics to bolster weak arguments is now followed by the use of data to create the outcome you want. Like statistics which can back any opinion, data can be found to support any recommendation. The most fundamental question a board needs to wrestle with; “How do we know if the decision we are being asked to approve is only based on data that creates that recommendation?”&nbsp; Data is no different to any question a board has been asked to approve previously, however according to Mckinsey 95% of decisions made in business are based on financial data, which represents, according to Google Cloud, 3% of the data available.&nbsp; We accept that there is bias in the data that presented a board paper that came from this financial 3% of data but as the remaining 97% of data becomes available to the board for decision making, it is not going to get any easier to unpick if we are being asked to make the right “ethical” decision.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that data is not easy to understand and in many situations, not understood even by experts and professionals. Data is not oil, sunshine, time, labour or any other of the analogies which all fail. Data is Data.&nbsp; Data is closer to the discovery of a new element or quantum particle which has its own unique characteristics.&nbsp; Data itself creates data, and everything is data. Insight, knowledge and wisdom built on data, just create more data.&nbsp; Decisions are just more data.&nbsp; Data means that bias is amplified, which can hide ethical problems. Our systems are built on discrimination.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Data, Ethics is equally not easy to understand and in many situations not understood.&nbsp; However, as we study and gain a better understanding of human behaviour from more data, it becomes increasingly evident that determining an ethical outcome for two people is complicated, for society it is complex, and for everyone it is impossible. We must be able to explain and justify the rationale for any decisions which affect others. However linking our judgement and decision-making to a framework that our ethics or culture can be applied at scale, is a delusional claim.&nbsp; We have to get comfortable that our judgement and decisions, based on any ethical code, hold us to a standard by which we must be prepared to be judged by.&nbsp; If we are deemed to be lacking by professional standard, law or society, Directors must be willing to accept the consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data in this context is all data. All data embraces data that comes from the market, customers, partners, supply chain and internal data from all systems, as shown in the figure below. Data is collected and stored, analysed, and this creates value, insights and margin, which we observe as an outcome. More data comes from understanding how our actions, which are measured outcomes, effect and affect each of the data collection points. Governance and oversight cover how we manage the entire system and process from the collection of data to understand how our decisions impact outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Data enables a leadership team to qualify and quantify new risks beyond the obvious of data security, cyber-attacks and poor processes.&nbsp; Data enables leadership to enquire about any and every aspect of the business that can be measured, which means that whilst once we were unable to determine the impact of a decision, a Board can receive the direct feedback from the data that supported a decision, to the outcome and determine if the delta needs to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially all ethical and moral thinking has the same goal, and there are several diverse ways to help reach a positive impact by considering what is best for others and seeking mutual benefit. Selecting a model for a specific context increases the chances of a successful outcome, which is a positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous books in which moral philosophy and philosophers are categorised; however, there are three core schools: virtue ethics, consequentialist ethics, and deontological or duty-based ethics. Each approach provides a different way to understand ethics and has implications on the decision marking process.&nbsp; If I asked the question “What is the best way to achieve a healthy life?” you can respond with one of three approaches: good nutrition, through exercise, and through spiritual discipline. Each being vital but inadequate by itself. It is bringing these and other strategies together that we can make create better outcomes from a complex decision.&nbsp;</p><p>In ethics, no one school answers all the issues, concerns and problems raised by a diverse society; therefore many schools need to be considered to reach an ethical decision.&nbsp;</p><br> Questions  Data Ethics   <p>Do we have a data ontology and/or data dictionary. What standard does it meet?</p>  <p>What confidence do we have in the lineage and provenance of data?</p>  <p>What bias could be in the data, what bias is in the data set, what are the implications?</p>  <p>What data do you get from third parties, what is their model and have you asked q2&nbsp;

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.
