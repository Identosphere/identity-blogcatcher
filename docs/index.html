   Summary:      An SSI wallet provides a place for people to stand in the digital realm. Using the wallet, people can operationalize their digital relationships as peers with others online. The result is better, more authentic, digital relationships, more flexible online interactions, and the preservation of human freedom, privacy, and dignity.

<p>
    Recently, I've been making the case for self-sovereign identity and why it is the correct architecture for online identity systems.
</p>

 
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a>, I discuss why identity systems are really built to manage relationships rather than identities. I also show how the architecture of the identity system affects the three important properties relationships must have to function effectively: integrity, lifespan, and utility.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> I introduced a classification scheme that broadly categorized identity systems into one of three broad architectures: administrative, algorithmic, or autonomic.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>, I discuss how the architecture of an identity system affects the authenticity of the relationships it manages. 
 

<p>
   This post focuses how people can operationalize the relationships they are party to and become full fledged participants online. Last week, Doc Searls posted <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">What SSI Needs</a> where he recalls how the graphical web browser was the catalyst for making the web real. Free (in both the beer and freedom senses) and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>, browsers provided the spark that gave rise to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">generative</a> qualities that ignited an explosion of innovation.  Doc goes on to posit that the SSI equivalent of the web browser is what we have <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">called a "wallet"</a> since it holds, analogously to your physical wallet, credentials.
</p>

<p>
    The SSI wallet Doc is discussing is the tool people use to operationalize their digital relationships. I created the following picture to help illustrate how the wallet fulfills that purpose.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in Sovrin Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This figure shows the relationships and interactions in SSI networks enabled by the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> protocols. The most complete example of these protocols in production is the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the figure, Alice has an SSI wallet1. She uses the wallet to manage her relationships with Bob and Carol as well as a host of organizations. Bob and Carol also have wallets. They have a relationship with each other and Carol has a relationship with Bravo Corp, just as Alice does2.  These relationships are enabled by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a> in the form of peer DIDs (blue arrows).  The SSI wallet each participant uses provides a consistent user experience, like the browser did for the Web. People using wallets don't see the DIDs (identifiers) but rather the connections they have to other people, organizations, and things. 
</p>

<p>
    These autonomic relationships are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-certifying</a> meaning they don't rely on any third party for their trust basis. They are also mutually authenticating: each of the parties in the relationship can authenticate the other. Further, these relationships create a secure communications channel using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm protocol</a>. Because of the built-in mutual authentication, DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml"> batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication. As a result, Alice has trustworthy communication channels with everyone with whom she has a peer DID relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, as mentioned, also has a relationship with various organizations. One of them, Attester Org, has issued a verifiable credential to Alice. They issued the credential (green arrows) using the Aries credential exchange protocol that runs on top of the DIDComm-based communication channel enabled by the peer DID relationship Alice has with Attester. The credential they issue is founded on the credential definition and public DID (an algorithmic identifier) that Attester Org wrote to the ledger.
</p>

<p>
    When Alice later needs to prove something (e.g. her address) to Certiphi Corp, she presents the proof over the DIDComm protocol, again enabled by the peer DID relationship she has with Certiphi Corp. Certiphi is able to validate the fidelity of the credential by reading the credential definition from the ledger, retrieving Attester Org's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attester Org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, Certiphi can use cryptography to know that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked.
</p>

     Alice has relationships with five different entities: her friends Bob and Carol as well as three different organizations. These relationships are based on autonomic identifiers in the form of peer DIDs. All of the organizations use enterprise wallets to manage autonomic relationships4.  

   As a credential issuer, Attester Org has an algorithmic identifier in the form of a public DID that has been recorded on the ledger. The use of  algorithmic identifiers on a ledger3 allows public discovery of the credential definition and the public DID by Certiphi Corp when it validates the credential. The use of a ledger for this purpose is not optional unless we give up the loose coupling it provides. Loose coupling provides scalability, flexibility, and isolation. Isolation is critical to the privacy protections that verifiable credential exchange via Aries promises.  

   Each company will keep track of attributes and other properties they need for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">relationship to provide the needed utility</a>. These are administrative systems since they are administered by the organization for their own purpose and their root of trust is a database managed by the organization. The difference between these administrative systems and those common in online identity today is that only the organization is depending on them. People have their own autonomic root of trust in the key event log that supports their wallet.  
 

<p>
    Alice's SSI wallet allows her to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. Alice's wallet is also the place where specific, protocol-enabled interactions like credential exchange happen. The wallet is flexible tool that Alice uses to manage her digital life. 
</p>

<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">prevented from acting by their anemic natures</a>. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online</a>. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become digitally embodied to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.
</p>

 

 
     Alice's SSI wallet is like other wallets she has on her phone with several important differences. First, it is enabled by open protocols and second, it is entirely under her control.  
     Note that Bob doesn't have a relationship with any of the organizations shown. Each participant has the set of relationships they choose to have to meet their differing circumstances and needs. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     Enterprise wallets speak the same protocols as the wallets people use, but are adapted to the increased scale an enterprise would likely need and are designed to be intergrated with the enterprise's other administrative systems.

  <p>Summary:      We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>

<p>
    The most problematic word in the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> isn't "sovereign" but "identity" because whenever you start discussing identity, the conversation is rife with unspoken assumptions. Identity usually conjures thoughts of authentication and various federation schemes that purport to make authentication easier. I frequently point out that even though SSI has "identity" in it's name, there's no artifact in SSI called an "identity." Instead the user experience in an SSI system is based on forming relationships and using credentials.
</p>

<p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the role of relationships in digital identity systems and have come to the conclusion that we've been working on building building systems that support digital relationships without acknowledging the importance of relationships or using them in our designs and architectures.  The reason we build identity systems isn't to manage identities, it's to support digital relationships. 
</p>
<p>
    I recently read and then reread a 2011 paper called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163241">Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done</a> from <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>. Despite being almost ten years old, the paper is still relevant, full of good analysis and interesting ideas. Among those is the idea that the goal of using federation schemes to create a few identities that serve all purposes is deeply flawed. Steve's point is that we have so many identities because we have lots of relationships. The identity data for a given relationship is contextual and highly evolved to fit its specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
    Steve's discussion reminded me of a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/samramji/darwins-finches-20th-century-business-and-apis/119">talk Sam Ramji used to give about speciation of APIs</a>. Sam illustrated his talk with a picture from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory/Adaptive-radiation">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to show adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches in response to evolutionary pressure. These 14 different finches all share a common ancestor, but ended up with quite different features because of specialization for a particular niche.
</p>

	<a></a>

<p>
    In the same way, each of us have hundreds, even thousands, of online relationships. They each have a common root but are highly contextualized. Some are long-lived, some are ephemeral. Some are personal, some are commercial. Some are important, some are trivial. Still, we have them. The information about ourselves, what many refer to as identity data, that we share with each is just as adapted to the specific niche that the relationship represents as the Galapagos finches are to their niches. Once you realize this, the idea of creating a few online identities to serve all needs becomes preposterous. 
</p>

<p>
    Not only is each relationship evolved for a particular niche, but it is also constantly changing. Often those changes are just more of what's already there. For example, my Netflix account represents a relationship between me and Netflix. It's constantly being updated with my viewing data but not changing dramatically in structure. But some changes are larger. For example, it also allows me to create additional profiles which makes the relationship specialized for the specific members of my household. And when Netflix moved from DVDs only to streaming, the nature of my relationship with Netflix changed significantly.
</p>

<p>
    I'm convinced that identity systems would be better architected if we were more intentional about their need to support specialized relationships spanning millions of potential relationship types. This article is aimed at better understanding the nature of digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationships 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">fundamental problems of internet identity</a> is proximity. Because we're not interacting with people physically, our natural means of knowing who we're dealing with are useless. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu defines identity</a> as "how we recognize, remember, and respond" to another entity. These three activities correspond to three properties digital relationships must have to overcome the proximity problem: 
</p>
 
     Integrity—we want to know that, from interaction to interaction, we're dealing with the same entity we were before. In other words, we want to identify them. 
     Lifespan—normally we want relationships to be long-lived, although we also create ephemeral relationships for short-lived interactions.  
     Utility—we create online relationships in order to use them within a specific context. 
 

<p>
    We'll discuss each of these in detail below, followed by a discussion of risk in digital relationships.
</p>

<a></a>
 Relationship Integrity 

<p>
    Without integrity, we cannot recognize the other party to the relationship. Consequently, all identity systems manage relationship integrity as a foundational capability. Federated identity systems improve on one-off, often custom identity systems by providing integrity in a way that reduces user management overhead for the organization, increases convenience for the user, and increases security by eliminating the need to create one-off, proprietary solutions. SSI aims to establish integrity with the convenience of the federated model but without relying on an intervening IdP in order to provide autonomy and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
    A relationship has two parties, let's call them P1 and P2.1 P1 is connecting with P2 and, as a result, P1 and P2 will have a relationship. P1 and P2 could be people, organizations, or things represented by a website, app, or service. Recognizing the other party in an online relationship relies on being able to know that you're dealing with the same entity each time you encounter them. 
</p>

<p>
    In a typical administrative identity system, when P1 initiates a relationship with P2, P2 typically uses usernames and passwords to ensure the integrity of the relationship. By asking for a username to identify P1 and a password to ensure that it's the same P1 as before, P2 has some assurance that they are interacting with P1. In this model, P1 and P2 are not peers. Rather P2 controls the system and determines how and for what it is used. 
</p>

<p>
    In a federated flow, P1 is usually called the subject or consumer and P2 is called the relying party (RP). When the consumer visits the RP's site or opens their app, they are offered the opportunity to establish a relationship through an identity provider (IdP) whom the RP trusts. The consumer may or may not have a relationship with an IdP the RP trusts. RPs pick well-known IdPs with large numbers of users to reduce friction in signing up. The consumer chooses which IdP they want to use from the relying party's menu and is redirected to the IdP's identity service where they present a username and password to the IdP, are authenticated, and redirected back to the RP. As part of this flow, the RP gets some kind of token from the IdP that signifies that the IdP will vouch for this person. They may also get attributes that the IdP has stored for the consumer.2  
</p>

<p>
    In the federated model, the IdP is identifying the person and attesting the integrity of the relationship to the RP. The IdP is a third party, P3, who acts as an intervening administrative authority. Without their service, the RP may not have an alternative means of assuring themselves that the relationship has integrity over time. On the other hand, the person gets no assurance from the identity system about relationship integrity in this model. For that they must rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which is visible in a web interaction, but largely hidden inside an app on a mobile device.  P1 and P2 are not peers in the federated model. Instead, P1 is subject to the administrative control of both the IdP and the RP. Further, the RP us subject to the administrative control of the IdP. 
</p>

<p>
    In SSI, a relationship is initiated when P1 and P2 exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID). For example, when a person visits a web site or app, they are presented with a connection invitation. When they accept the invitation, they use a software agent to share a DID that they created. In turn, they receive a DID from the web site, app, or service.  We call this a "connection" since DIDs are cryptographically based and thus provide a means of both parties mutually authenticating. The user experience does not necessarily surface all this activity to the user. To get a feel for the user experience, run through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a>3.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the federated model, the participants in SSI mutually authenticate and the relationship has integrity without the intervention of a third party due to the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">self-certifying nature of the identifiers</a>. By exchanging DIDs both parties have also exchanged public keys. They can consequently use cryptographic means to ensure they are interacting with the party who controls the DID they received when the relationship was initiated. Mutual authentication, based on self-certifying DIDs provides SSI relationships with inherent integrity. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">P1 and P2 are peers in SSI</a> since they both have equal control over the relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to removing the need for intermediaries to vouch for the integrity of the relationship, the peer nature of relationships in SSI also means that neither party has access to the authentication credentials of the other. Mutual authentication means that each party manages their own keys and never shares the private key with another party. Consequently, attacks, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">recent attack on Twitter accounts</a> can't happen in SSI because there's no administrator who has access to the credentials of everyone using the system. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Relationship Lifespan 

<p>
    Whether in the physical world or digital, relationships have lifespans. Some relationships are long-lived, some are short-term, and others are ephemeral, existing only for the duration of a single interaction. We typically don't think of it this way, but every interaction we have in the physical world, no matter for what purpose or how short, sets up a relationship. So too in the digital world, although our tools, especially as people online, have been sorely lacking. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe one of the biggest failings of modern digital identity systems is our failure to recognize that people often want, even need, short-lived relationships. Think about your day for a minute. How many people and organizations did you interact with in the physical world4 where you established a permanent relationship? What if whenever you stopped in the convenience store for a cup of coffee, you had to create a permanent relationship with the coffee machine, the cashier, the point of sale terminal, and the customers in line ahead and behind you? Sounds ridiculous. But that's what most digital interactions require. At every turn we're asked to establish permanent accounts to transact and interact online. 
</p>

<p>
    There are several reasons for this. The biggest one is that every Web site, app, or service wants to send you ads, at best, or track you on other sites, at worst. Unneeded, long-lived relationships are the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance economy</a> that has come to define the modern online experience. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of services I want a long-lived relationship with. I value my relationships with Amazon and Netflix, for example. But there are many things I just need to remember for the length of the interaction. I ordered some bolts for a car top carrier from a specialty place a few weeks ago. I don't order bolts all the time, so I just want to place my order and be done. I want an ephemeral relationship. The Internet of Things will increase the need for ephemeral relationships. When I open a door with my digital credential, I don't want the hassle of creating a long-term relationship with it; I just want to open the door and then forget about it. 
</p>

<p>
    Digital relationships should be easy to set up and tear down. They should allow for the relationship to grow over time, if both parties desire. While they exist, they should be easily managable while providing all the tools for the needed utility. Unless there's long term benefit to me, I shouldn't need to create a long term relationship. And when a digital relationship ends, it should really be over. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Relationship Utility 

<p>
    Obviously, we don't create digital relationships just so we can authenticate the other party. Integrity is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for an identity system.  This is where most identity models fall short. We can understand why this is so given the evolution of the modern Web. For the most part, user-centric identity really took off when the web gave people reasons to visit places they didn't have a physical relationship with, like an ecommerce web site. Once the identity system had established the integrity of the relationship, at least from the web site's perspective, we expected HTTP would provide the rest.
</p>

<p>
    Most Identity and Access Management systems don't provide much beyond integrity except possibly access control. Once Facebook has established who you are, it knows just what resources to let you see or change.  But as more and more of our lives are intermediated by digital services, we need more utility from the identity system than simple access control. The most that an IdP can provide in the federated model is integrity and, perhaps, a handful of  almost-always-self-asserted attributes in a static, uncustomizable schema. But rich relationships require much more than that.
</p>

<p>
    Relationships are established to provide utility. An ecommerce site wants to sell you things. A social media site wants to show you ads. Thus, their identity systems, built around the IAM system, are designed to do far more than just establish the integrity of the relationship. They want to store data about you and your activities. For the most part this is welcome. I love that Amazon shows me my past orders, Netflix remembers where I was in a series, and Twitter keeps track of my followers and past tweets. 
</p>

<p>
    The true identity system is much, much larger and specialized than the IAM portion. All of the account or profile data these companies use is properly thought of as part of the identity system that they build and run. Returning to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern [the] information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regardless of whether or not they outsource the integrity of their relationships (and notice that none of the companies I list above do), companies still have to keep track of the relationships they have with customers or users in order to provide the service they promise. They can't outsource this to a third party because the data in their identity system has evolved to suit the needs of the specific relationship. We'll never have a single identity that serves all relationships because they are unique contexts that demand their own identity data. Rip out the identity system from a Netflix or Amazon and it won't be the same company anymore.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to a simple, but important conclusion: You can't outsource a relationship. Online apps and services decorate the relationship with information they observe, and use that information to provide utility to the relationships they administer. Doing this, and doing it well is the foundation of the modern web. 
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, the bad news is that SSI is not going to reduce the need for companies to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">build, manage, and use identity systems</a>. Their identity systems are what make them what they are—there is no "one size fits all" model. The good news is that SSI makes online relationships richer. Relationships are easier and less expensive to manage, not just for companies, but for people too. Here's some of the ways SSI will enhance the utility of digital relationships:
</p>

 
     Richer, more trustworthy data—Relationships change over time because the parties change. We want to reliably ascertain facts about the other party in a relationship, not just from direct observation, but also from third parties in a trustworthy manner to build confidence in the actions of the other party within a specific context. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a>, self-issued or from others, allow relationships to be enhanced incrementally as the relationships matures or changes. 
     
     Autonomy and choice through peer relationships—Peer relationship give each party more autonomy than traditional administrative identity systems have provided. And, through standardization and substitutability, SSI gives participants choice in what vendors and agents they employ to manage their relationships. The current state of digital identity is asymmetric, providing companies with tools that are difficult or unwieldy for people to use. People like <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and organizations like <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2019/05/13/me2b-2/">Project VRM</a> and the <a href="https://www.me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a> argue that people need tools for managing online relationships too. SSI provides people with tools and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy</a> to manage their online relationships with companies and each other. 
     
     Better, more secure communications—DID exchange provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">private, secure messaging channel</a> using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm protocol</a>. This messaging channel is mutually recognized, authenticated, and encrypted. 
     Unifying, interoperable protocol for data transmission—DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, and DIDComm provides a standardized, secure means of interaction. Just like URLs, HTML, and HTTP provided for an interoperable web that led to an explosion of uses, the common protocol of SSI will ensure everyone benefits from the network effects. 
     
     Consistent user experience—Similarly, SSI provides a consistent user experience, regardless of what digital wallet people use. SSI's user experience is centered on relationships and credentials, not arcane addresses and keys. The user experience mirrors the experience people have of managing credentials in the physical world. 
     
     Support for ad hoc digital interactions—The real world is messy and unpredictable. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">SSI is flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios</a> that the world presents us and supports sharing multiple credentials from various authorities in the ways the scenario demands.
     
 

<p>
    These benefits are delivered using an architecture that provides a common, interoperable layer, called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a>, upon with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">anyone can build the identity systems they need</a>. A ubiquitous identity layer for the internet must be a metasystem that provides the building blocks and protocols necessary for others to build identity systems that meet the needs of any specific context or domain. An identity metasystem is a prerequisite for an online world where identity is as natural as it is in the physical world. An identity metasystem can remove friction, decrease cognitive overload, and make online interactions more private and secure.
</p>

<a>
     Relationships, Risk, and Trust 
</a>

<p>
    Trust is a popular term in the SSI community. People like Steve Wilson and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/">Kaliya Young</a> rightly ask about risk whenever someone in the identity community talks about trust. Because of the proximity problem, digital relationships are potentially risky. One of the goals of an identity system is to provide evidence that can be used in the risk calculation. 
</p>

<p>
    In their excellent paper, <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/NICTAR-2">Risk and Trust</a>, Nickel and Vaesen define trust as the "disposition to willingly rely on another person or entity to perform actions that benefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given domain." From this definition, we see why crypto-proponents often say "To trust is good, but to not trust is better." The point being that not having to rely on some other human, or human-mediated process is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome because it reduces the risk of non-performance. 
</p>

<p>
    Relationships imply a shared domain, context, and set of activities. We often rely on third parties to tell us things relevant to the relationship. Our vulnerability, and therefore our risk, depends on the degree of reliance we have on another party's performance.  Relationships can never be "no trust" because of the very reasons we create relationships. Bitcoin, and similar systems, can be low or no trust precisely because the point of the system is to reduce the reliance on any relationship at all. The good news, is the architecture of the SSI stack significantly limits the ways we must rely on external parties for the exchange of information via verifiable credentials and thus reduces the vulnerability of parties inside and outside of the relationship. The SSI identity metasystem clearly delineates the parts of the system that are low trust and those where human processes are still necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    The exchange of verifiable credentials can be split into two distinct parts as shown in the following diagram. SSI reduces risk in remote relationships using the properties of these two layers to combine cryptographic processes with human processes. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	SSI Stack (click to enlarge)



<p>
    The bottom layer, labeled Identity Metasystem, comprises two components: a set of verifiable data repositories for storing metadata about credentials and a processing layer supported by protocols and practices for the transport and validation of credentials. Timothy Ruff <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">uses the analogy of shipping containers</a> to describe the identity metasystem. Verifiable credentials are analogous to shipping containers and the metasystem is analogous to the shipping infrastructure that makes intermodal shipping so efficient and secure. The Identity Metasystem provides a standardized infrastructure that similarly increases the efficiency and security of data interchange via credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    The top layer, labeled Identity Systems, is where people and organizations determine what credentials to issue, determine what credentials to seek and hold, and determine which credentials to accept. This layer comprises the individual credential exchange ecosystems that spring up and the governance processes for managing those credential ecosystems. In Timothy's analogy to shipping containers, this layer is about the data—the cargo—that the credential is carrying.
</p>

<p>
    The Identity Metasystem allows verifiable credentials can be cryptographically checked to ensure four key properties that relate to the risk profile. 
</p>
 
     Who issued the credential? 
     Was the credential issued to the party presenting it? 
     Has the credential been tampered with? 
     Has the credential been revoked? 
 
<p>
    These checks show the fidelity of the credential and are done without the verifier needing a relationship with the issuer. And because they're automatically performed by the Identity Metasystem, they significantly reduce the risk related to using data transferred using verifiable credentials. This is the portion of credential exchange that could be properly labeled "low or no trust" since the metasystem is built on standards that ensure the cryptographic verifiability of fidelity without reliance on humans and human-mediated processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The upper, Identity Systems, layer is different. Here we are very much relying on the credential issuer. Some of the questions we might ask include:
</p>
 
     Is the credential issuer, as shown by the identifier in the credential, the organization we think they are? 
     Is the organization properly accredited in whatever domain they're operating in?  
     What data did the issuer include in the credential? 
     What is the source of that data? 
     How has that data been processed and protected?  
 

<p>
    These questions are not automatically verifiable in the way we can verify the fidelity of a credential. They are different for each domain and perhaps different for each type of relationship based on the vulnerability of the parties to the data in the credential and their appetite for risk. Their answers depend on the provenance of the data in the credential. We would expect to see credential verifier's perform provenance checks by answering these and other questions during the process they use to establish trust in the issuer. Once the verifier has established this trust, the effort needed to evaluate the provenance of the data in a credential should cease or be greatly reduced.  
</p>

<p>
    As parties in a relationship share data with each other, the credential verifier will spend effort evaluating the provenance of issuers of credentials they have not previously evaluated. Once that is done, the metasystem will provide fidelity checks on each transaction. For the most part, SSI does not impose new ways of making these risk evaluations. Rather, most domains already have processes for establishing the provenance of data. For example, we know how to determine if a bank is a bank, the accreditation status of a university, and the legitimacy of a business. Companies with heavy reliance on properties of their supply chain, like pharmaceuticals, already have processes for establishing the provenance of the supply chain. For the most part, verifiable credential exchange will faithfully present digital representations of the kinds of physical world processes, credentials, and data we already know how to evaluate.  Consequently, SSI promises to significantly reduce the cost of reducing risk in remote relationships without requiring wholesale changes to existing business practices. 
</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>
    Relationships have always been the reason we created digital identity systems. Our historic focus on relationship integrity and IAM made modern Web 2.0 platforms and services possible, but has limited use cases, reduced interoperability, and left people open to privacy and security breaches. By focusing on peer relationships supported by an Identity Metasystem, SSI not only improves relationships integrity but also better supports flexible relationship lifecycles, more functional, trustworthy relationship utility, and provides tools for participants to correctly gauge, respond to, and reduce risks inherent in remote relationships. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     For simplicity, I'm going to limit this discussion to two-party relationships, not groups. 
     I've described federation initialization very generally here and left out a number of details that distinguish various federation architectures.  
     Connect.me is just one of a handful of digital wallets that support the same SSI user experience. Others vendors include <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a>, and <a href="https://self-ssi.com/en/">eSatus AG</a>.

  <p>Summary: The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>



	<a></a>

<p>
    Introductory note: I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>, that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a used model for thinking about identity online.
</p>

<p>
    John Locke was an English philosopher who thought a lot about power: who had it, how it was used, and how it impacted the structure of society. Locke’s theory of mind forms the foundation for our modern ideas about identity and independence. Locke argued that "sovereign and independent" was man’s natural state and that we gave up freedom, our sovereignty,  in exchange for something else, protection, sociality, and commerce, among others. This grand bargain forms the basis for any society. 
</p>

<p>
    This question of power and authority is vital in identity systems. We can ask "what do we give up and to whom in a given identity system?" More succinctly we ask: who controls what? In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> I made the argument that self-sovereign identity, supporting heterarchical (peer-to-peer) interaction, enables rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents. I argued that the architecture of SSI, its structure, made those relationships more authentic.
</p>

<p>
    In this post, I intend to explore the details of that architecture so we can better understand the legitimacy of SSI as an identity system for online interaction. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)">defines legitimacy</a> as 
</p>
<blockquote>the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.</blockquote>
<p>
    While the idea of legitimacy is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that function in an authoritative manner and have large impacts on people and society.  Without legitimacy, people and organizations using an identity system will be unable to act because anyone they interact with will not see that action as authorized. My thesis is that SSI provides a more legitimate basis for online identity than administrative identity systems of the past. 
</p>


 Terminology 
<p>
    While we properly talk of identity systems, identity systems do not manage identities, but rather relationships. Identity systems provide the means necessary for remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered. Identifiers are unique within some namespace. The namespace gives context to the identifiers since the same string of characters might be a phone number in one system and a product ID in another. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller who by virtue of knowing the authentication factors can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claiming it by logging in). The controller might be a person, organization, or software system. The controller might be the subject that the identifier refers to, but not necessarily. The authentication factors might be a password, key fob, cryptographic keys, or something else. The strength and nature of the bindings between the controller, authentication factors, and identifier determine the strength and nature of the relationships built on top of them. 
</p>

<p>
    To understand why that's so, we introduce the concept of a root of trust1. A root of trust is a foundational component or process in the identity system that is relied on by other components of the system and whose failure would compromise the integrity of the bindings. A root of trust might be primary or secondary depending on whether or not it is replaceable. Primary roots of trust are irreplaceable. Together, the roots of trust form the trust basis for the system.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis enabled by the identity system underlies a particular trust domain. The trust domain is the set of digital activities that depend on the binding of the controller to the identifier. For example, binding a customer to an identifier allows Amazon to trust that the actions linked to the identifier are authorized by the controller. Another way to look at this is that the strength of the binding between the identifier and customer (controller) determines the risk that Amazon assumes in honoring those actions.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of the controller-identifier binding depends on the strength of the binding between the controller and the authentication factors and between the authentication factors and the identifier. Attacking either of those bindings reduces the trust we have in the controller-identifier binding and increases the risk that actions taken through a particular identifier are unauthorized.
</p>


 Identity Architectures 

<p>
    We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust: 
</p>
 
     Administrative
     
     Algorithmic
     
     Autonomic
     
 

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic are SSI systems. They are distinguished by their trust bases. Some SSI systems use one or the other and some (like Sovrin) are hybrid, employing each for different purposes. We'll discuss the properties of the trust basis for each of these in an effort to understand the comparative legitimacy of SSI solutions to traditional administrative ones. 
</p>

<p>
    These architectures differ in who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. We call this control authority. The entity with control authority takes action through operations that affect the creation (inception), updating, rotation, revocation, deletion, and delegation of the authentication factors and their relation to the identifier. How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Administrative Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an administrative architecture rely on an administrator to bind the identifier to the authentication factors. The administrator is the primary root of trust for any domain with an administrative architecture. Almost every identity system in use today has an administrative architecture and their trust basis is founded on the administrator.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: The trust basis in administrative identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the interactions between the controller, identifier and authentication factors in an administrative identity system, the role of the administrator, and the impact these have on the strength of the bindings. The controller usually generates the authentication factors by choosing a password, linking a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism, or generating keys.
</p>

<p>
    Even though the identifier might be the controller's email address, phone number, public key, or other ID, the administrator "assigns" the identifier to the controller because it is their policy that determines which identifiers are allowed, whether they can be updated, and their legitimacy within the identity system's domain. The administrator "owns" the identifier within the domain. The administrator also asserts the binding between the identifier and the authentication factors. An employee's mistake, a policy change, or a hack could affect the binding between the identifier and authentication factors or the identifier and the controller. Consequently, these bindings are relatively weak. Only the binding between the controller and authentication factors is strong because the controller generates them.
</p>

<p>
    The administrator's primary duty is to authoritatively assert the controller-identifier binding. Authoritative control statements about the identifier are recorded in the administrator's database, the source of truth in the system, subject to change by employees and hackers. The administrator might be an ecommerce site that maintains an identity system as the basis for its customer's account. In this case the binding is private, and its integrity is of interest only to the web site and the customer. Alternatively, the administrator might provide federated login services. In this case the administrator is asserting the controller-identifier binding in a semi-public manner to anyone who relies on the federated login. A certificate authority is an example of an administrator who publicly asserts the controller-identifier binding, signing a certificate to that effect.
</p>

<p>
    Because the administrator is responsible for binding the identifier to both the authentication factors and the controller, the  administrator is the primary root of trust and thus the basis for trust in the overall system. Regardless of whether the binding is private, semi-public, or public, the integrity of the binding is entirely dependent on the administrator and the strength of their infrastructure, policies, employees, and continued existence. The failure of any of those can jeopardize the binding, rendering the identity system unusable by those who rely on it.
</p>

<a></a>
 Algorithmic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems that rely on a ledger have an algorithmic architecture. I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others. Of course, it's not just algorithms. Algorithms are embodied in code, written by people, running on servers. How the code is written, its availability to scrutiny, and the means by which it is executed all impact the trust basis for the system. "Algorithmic" is just shorthand for all of this. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: The trust basis in algorithmic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 3 shows how the controller, authentication factors, identifier, and ledger are bound in an identity system with an algorithmic architecture. As in the administrative identity system, the controller generates the authentication factors, albeit in the form of a public-private key pair. The controller keeps and does not share the private key. The public key, on the other hand, is used to derive an identifier (at least in well-designed SSI systems) and both are registered on the ledger. This registration is the inception of the controller-identifier binding since the controller can use the private key to assert her control over the identifier as registered on the ledger. Anyone with access to the ledger can determine algorithmically that the controller-identifier binding is valid.
</p>

<p>
    The controller makes authoritative control statements about the identifier. The events marking these operations are recorded on the ledger which becomes the source of truth for anyone interested in the binding between the identifier and authentication factors.
</p>

<p>
    In an identity system with an algorithmic trust basis, computer algorithms create a ledger that records the key events. The point of the ledger is that no party has the power to unilaterally decide whether these records are made, modified, or deleted and how they're ordered. Instead, the system relies on code executed in a decentralized manner to make these decisions. The nature of the algorithm, the manner in which the code is written, and the methods and rules for its execution all impact the integrity of the algorithmic identity system and consequently any bindings that it records.
</p>


<a></a>
 Autonomic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an autonomic architecture function similarly to those with an algorithmic architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the controller generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with anyone.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 4: Trust basis in autonomic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The controller uses her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log2. One of the important realizations that make autonomic identity systems possible is that the key event log must only be ordered in the context of a single identifier, not globally. So, a ledger is not needed for recording operations on identifiers that are not public. The key event log can be shared with and verified by anyone who cares to see it.
</p>

<p>
    The controller also uses the private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means of cryptographically responding to challenges to prove her control of the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for the controller to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier. Thus anyone (any entity) can create and establish control over an identifier namespace in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority. 
</p>

<p>
    Autonomic identifiers have a number of advantages: 
</p>
 
     Self-Certification—autonomic identifiers are self-certifying so there is no reliance on a third party.
     
     Self-Administration—autonomic identifiers can be idependently administered by the controller.  
      Cost—autonomic identifiers are virtually free to create and manage. 
     
     Security—because the keys are decentralized, there is no trove of secrets that can be stolen. 
     
     Regulatory—since autonomic identifiers need not be publicly shared or stored in an organization’s database, regulatory concern over personal data can be reduced.
     
     Scale—autonomic identifiers scale with the combined computing capacity of all participants, not some central system. 
     
     Independent—autonomic identifiers are not dependent on any specific technology or even being online. 
     
 

<a></a>
 Algorithmic and Autonomic Identity In Practice 

<p>
    We are all familiar with administrative identity systems. We use them all the time. Less familiar are algorithmic and autonomic identity systems. Their use is emerging under the title of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There are several parallel development efforts supporting algorithmic and autonomic identifiers. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier specification</a> is the primary guide to algorithmic identifiers that live on a ledger. The DID specification provides for many DID methods that allow DIDs to live on a variety of data stores. There's nothing in the DID specification itself that requires that the data store be a blockchain or ledger, but that is the primary use case.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">written about the details of decentralized identifiers</a> before. DIDs have a number of important properties that make them ideal as algorithmic identifiers. Specifically, they are non-reassignable, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized.
</p>

<p>
    As algorithmic identifiers, DIDs allow the controller to cryptographically make authoritative statements about the identifier and the keys it is bound to. Those statements are recorded on a ledger or blockchain to provide a record of the key events that anyone with access to the ledger can evaluate. The record is usually public since the purpose of putting them on a ledger is to allow parties who don't have an existing relationship to evaluate the identifier and its linkage to the controller and public keys. 
</p>

<p>
    There are two related efforts for autonomic identifiers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> is a general-purpose self-certifying system for autonomic identifiers. KERI identifiers are strongly bound at inception to a public-private key pair. All operations on the identifier are recorded in a cryptographic key event log. KERI has strong security and accountability properties. Drummond Reed has made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_564J1B3LfBHc_FQnO8jUMiYEx084LVUsHsY1mYPa6U/edit#slide=id.g9398465ffb_33_0">proposal that would allow KERI autonomic identifiers to be used with any DID method</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The second option is <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">Peer DIDs</a>. The vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things need not be public and thus have no need for the ability to publicly resolve the DID. Peer DIDs fill this need with the benefits of autonomic identifiers listed above. 
</p>

<p>
    Like KERI, Peer DIDs maintain a key event log (called "deltas") that records the relevant operations on the keys in a cryptographic manner. The Peer DID key event log can be shared with other parties in the relationship over <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a>, a protocol that allows parties to a relationship to securely and privately share authenticated messages. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">security and authority of a DIDComm channel</a> are rooted in DIDs and their associated authentication factors. DIDComm can be used over a wide variety of transports.
</p>

<p>
    The vast majority of digital relationships are peer to peer and should use autonomic identifiers. Algorithmic identifiers allow for public discovery of identifier properties when relationships are not peer to peer. In the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>3, the ledger records public DIDs for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential</a> issuers. But people, organizations, and things form relationships using peer DIDs without need for the ledger. This hybrid use of both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems was designed so that credential exchange would be practical, secure, and private while reducing the correlation that might occur if individuals used a few DIDs on a ledger.
</p>


 Comparing Identity Architectures 
<p>
    Table 1 summarizes the architectural properties of identity systems with administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic bases of trust. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Table 1: Architectural properties of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The table shows how the locus of control, source of truth, root of trust, and trust basis differ for each of our three architectures. For Administrative systems, the administrator is directly in control of all four of these. In an algorithmic architecture, the controller is the locus of control because the ledger is set up to allow the controller to be in charge of all key operations. Sometimes this is done using special administrative keys instead of the keys associated with the identifier. The organizations or people operating nodes on the ledger <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">never have access to the keys necessary to unilaterally change the record of operations</a>. No third party is involved in autonomic identity systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Table 2 summarizes the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems4.
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Table 2: Summarizing the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We can see from the evaluation that algorithmic and autonomic architectures are decentralized while the administrative system has a single point of failure—the third party administrator. As a result administrative systems are less secure since an attack on one party can yield a trove of valuable information. Administrative systems also rely on privacy by policy rather than having privacy preserving features built into the architecture. And, as we've seen, all too often privacy is in direct conflict with the administrator's profit motive leading to weak privacy policies. 
</p>

 Power and Legitimacy 

<p>
    I started this post by talking about power and legitimacy. From our discussion and the summary tables above, we know that power is held very differently in these three systems. In an administrative system, the administrator holds all the power. I argued in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> that the architecture of our identity systems directly impacts the quality and utility of the digital relationships they support. Specifically, the power imbalance inherent in administrative identity systems yields anemic relationships. In contrast, the balance of power engendered by SSI systems (both algorithmic and autonomic) yields richer relationships since all parties can contribute to it.  
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, administrative identity systems have legitimacy—if they didn't, no one would use or trust them.  As new architectures, algorithmic and autonomic systems have yet to prove themselves through usage. But we can evaluate each architecture in terms of the promises it makes and how well it does in the purposes of an identity system: recognizing, remembering, and relying on other parties in the relationship. These are largely a function of the trust basis for the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems promise an account for taking actions that the administrator allows. They also promise these accounts will be secure and private. But people and organizations are increasingly concerned with privacy and seemingly non-stop security breaches are chipping away at that legitimacy. As noted above, the privacy promise is often quite limited. Since the administrator is the basis for trust, administrative systems allow the administrator to recognize, remember, and rely on the identifier depending on their security. But the account holder does not get any support from the administrative system in recognizing, remembering, or relying on the administrator. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship is strictly one-way and anemic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    SSI systems promise to give anyone the means to securely and privately create online relationships and trustworthily share self-asserted and third-party-attested attributes with whoever they chose. These promises are embodied in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">property I call fidelity</a>. To the extent that algorithmic and autonomic identity systems deliver on these promises, they will be seen as legitimate. 
</p>

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems provide strong means for recognizing, remembering, and relying on the identifiers in the relationship. For an algorithmic system, we must trust the ledger as the primary root of trust and the trust basis. Clearly our trust in the ledger will depend on many factors, including the code and the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">governance that controls its operation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis for an autonomic identity system is cryptography. This implies that digital key management will become an important factor in its legitimacy. If people and organizations cannot easily manage the keys in such a system, then it will not be trusted. There is hope that key management can be solved since the primary artifacts that people using an SSI system manipulate are relationships and credentials, not keys and secrets. By supporting a consistent user experience rooted in familiar artifacts from the physical world, SSI promises to make cryptography a usable technology by the majority of people on the Internet.
</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>
    In this article, we've explored the high-level architectures for the identity systems in use today as well as new designs that promise richer, more authentic online relationships, better security, and more privacy. By exploring the trust bases that arise from these architectures we've been able to explore the legitimacy of these architectures as a basis for online identity. My belief is that a hybrid system that combines algorithmic public identifiers with autonomic private identifiers can provide a universal identity layer for the Internet, increasing security and privacy, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">reducing friction</a>, and providing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">new</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">better</a> online experiences.

 Notes 
 
     Often the term root of trust is used to a hardware device or some trusted hardware component in the computer. The usage here is broader and refers to anything that is relied on for trust in the identity system. Trust anchor is a term that has sometimes been used in the cryptography community to refer to this same concept.   
     A number of cryptographic systems are trivially self-certifying (e.g. PGP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). What sets the autonomic identity systems described here apart is the key event log. Sam Smith calls these identifiers “autonomic identifiers” to set them apart from their less capable counterparts and emphasize their ability to self-manage keys without recourse to a third party system.

The show is over. Biden won. Trump lost.</p>
<p>Sure, there is more to be said, details to argue. But the main story—Biden vs. Trump, the 2020 Presidential Election, is over. So is the Trump presidency, now in the lame duck stage.</p>
<p>We’re in the epilogue now.</p>
<p>There are many stories within and behind the story, but this was the big one, and it had to end. Enough refs calling it made the ending official. President Trump will continue to fight, but the outcome won’t change. Biden will be the next president. The story of the Trump presidency will end with Biden’s inauguration.</p>
<p>The story of the Biden presidency began last night. Attempts by Trump to keep the story of his own presidency going will be written in the epilogue, heard in the coda, the outro, the postlude.</p>
<p>Fox News, which had been the Trump administration’s house organ, concluded the story when it declared Biden the winner and moved on to covering him as the next president.</p>
<p>This is how stories go.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that the story was right in every factual sense. Stories aren’t.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has covered much and has been covered as well, I can vouch for the inevitability of inaccuracy, of overlooked details, of patches, approximations, compressions, misquotes and summaries that are more true to story, arc, flow and narrative than to all the facts involved, or the truths that might be told.</p>
<p>Stories have loose ends, and big stories like this one have lots of them. But they are ends. And The End is here.</p>
<p>We are also at the beginning of something new that isn’t a story, and does not comport with <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/07/23/where-journalism-fails/">the imperatives of journalism</a>: of storytelling, of narrative, of characters with problems struggling toward resolutions.</p>
<p>What’s new is the ground on which all the figures in every story now stand. That ground is digital. Decades old at most, it will be with us for centuries or millennia. Arriving on digital ground is as profound a turn in the history of our species on Earth as the one our distant ancestors faced when they waddled out of the sea and grew lungs to replace their gills.</p>
<p>We live in the digital world now now, in addition to the physical one where I am typing and you are reading, as embodied beings.</p>
<p>In this world we are not just bodies. We are something and somewhere else, in a place that isn’t a place: one without distance or gravity, where the only preposition that applies without stretch or irony is&nbsp;with. (Because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/prepositions-list.htm">the others</a>—over, under, beside, around, though, within, upon, etc.—pertain too fully to positions and relationships in the physical world.)</p>
<p>Because the digital world is ground and not figure (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)">here’s the difference</a>), it is as hard for us to make full sense of being there as it was for the first fish to do the same with ocean or for our amphibian grandparents to make sense of land. (For some help with this, dig David Foster Wallace’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Water">This is water</a>.)</p>
<p>The challenge of understanding digital life will likely not figure in the story of Joe Biden’s presidency. But nothing is more important than the ground under everything. And this ground is the same as the one without which we would not have had an Obama or a Trump presidency. It will at least help to think about that.</p>

 Consortium 

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C’s mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.</p>
</blockquote>

 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">Mission</a> 

<blockquote>
  <p>On 29 August 2012 five leading global organizations jointly signed an agreement to affirm and adhere to a set of Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards; an open and collectively empowering model that will help radically improve the way people around the world develop new technologies and innovate for humanity. Learn more about OpenStand: the modern paradigm for standards.</p>
</blockquote>

 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts.html">Facts</a> 

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal). He coined the term “World Wide Web,” wrote the first World Wide Web server, “httpd,” and the first client program (a browser and editor), “WorldWideWeb,” in October 1990. He wrote the first version of the “HyperText Markup Language” (HTML), the document formatting language with the capability for hypertext links that became the primary publishing format for the Web. His initial specifications for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>
</blockquote>

 <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">Standards</a> 

<blockquote>
  <p>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p>

      <p>Identifiers - what is identified?<br>
When XML is used to represent a directed laballed graph which is used to represent information about things, then one must be able to make statements about parts of an XML document, parts of the DLG (such as RDF nodes) and of course the objects described.

    <blockquote>
      <p>TimBL’s diagram at TPAC2012Over the years many different authentication systems have been developed. Each one proposes a method for an agent to prove his relation to an identifier - called a Principal. A Principal is a string that can be mapped to a URI, that usually refers to some network resource, which itself can then be linked to a subject. An LDP authorization system may authenticate agents that are allowed access to a resource using different types of Principals. This page lists a number of ways Authorization agents can prove identity of an agent using one Principal, with an ACL that may be using a different type of Principal. The aim is to gather such examples together in order to find an general theory that underpins these proofs.</p>

      <p>This is the specification of the Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.1 (P3P 1.1). This document, along with its normative references, includes all the specification necessary for the implementation of interoperable P3P 1.1 applications. P3P 1.1 is based on the P3P 1.0 Recommendation and adds some features using the P3P 1.0 Extension mechanism. It also contains a new binding mechanism that can be used to bind policies for XML Applications beyond HTTP transactions.</p>

      <p>Abstract: While decentralized, user-centric identity systems provide hope that useful, secure identity systems may be possible on the Internet, ensuring that user data is protected in these system requires more than a technical solution. In this paper, we describe a project underway at Identity Commons to create a framework within which users can express their protection preferences (called identity rights agreements). Part of this project will establish a reputation system for identity providers and relying parties that engenders trust and lowers user risk.</p>

   <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/identity-ws/report.html">W3C Workshop on Identity in the Browser</a> 24/25th May 2011, Mountain View (USA)
    <blockquote>
      <p>Over the last ten years, for most end-users there has been no visible progress beyond cookie-managed usernames and passwords entered via HTML forms. Current password-based logins offers little value to the end-user, as they are forced to bear the onerous responsibility of remembering too many passwords or simply re-using low-security passwords. As passwords and cookies are easily compromised, both web-site operators and users then expose themselves to massive security breaches. Despite the large amount of valuable standardization work on identity, it is unclear how user agents such as Web browsers can interact with both identity-consuming applications and server-side federated identity services, and many current identity specifications either assume or underspecify secure authentication in the browser. The key missing component to enable trusted identity on the Web is likely then to be found in user-centric cross-browser standards for secure authentication and session management.</p>

      <p>The W3C has prepared Web Identity working group and make a draft charter. As following is main track for works.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://www.w3.org/Social/track/issues/17">ISSUE-17: Identity, Agent, Person, Persona, Account etc. need clarifications</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>As for today we don’t seem to have clear strategy on how to define and use Online Identity related concepts.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebID">WebID</a> - W3C Wiki
    <blockquote>
      <p>The W3C is still exploring better ways to do authentication, for example in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/webcrypto-next-workshop/Overview.html">2014 workshop on authentication</a>. The WebID is a Community Group, and anyone can start a Community Group. A Community Group does not necessarily reflect the endorsement of the W3C, but we encourage grassroots communities to experiment with technology that may become a future standard.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3id/">USER IDENTITY ON THE WEB COMMUNITY GROUP</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Currently, more and more services are created on the web and require information about you, me, all of us. Therefore, users have to give away a lot of information about themselves to many different services. The point is that the users lose control of their identity on the web, by filling a lot of forms (e.g., through subscriptions). Privacy on the Internet is extremely important and must remain. Personal information is used by services we, sometimes, don’t even know about, and it is a real problem. The aim of this group would be to think about new ways to identify individuals over the internet using trusted web based identities embedded directly into the core protocols of the web. At the same time it is important to maintain equilibrium between total privacy and providing information when needed, which means, when the user wants to.</p>

This is in part why the industry has seen an explosion of traditional and alternative providers that are experimenting with new credential formats appropriate for the information age. One of the questions we most frequently encounter at Learning Machine from these providers is: What are the differences between different credentials formats? The implicit question behind that one is: When should I use different types of digital credentials, and why?</p>

 unlike every other sector (media, communications, engineering, finance, etc.), official records largely rely on old formats like paper, wax, and PDF for certification, all of which are hard to verify and easy to fake. This is big reason why public blockchains are exciting, because they have the power to prove the authenticity, ownership, and integrity of a natively digital record. The combination of strong cryptography and public blockchains provide a new technical infrastructure that gives people the ability to manage their own records of achievement in a format that is digital, easily shared, and instantly verifiable using a global verification network.</p>

The innovation that makes this possible is blockchain-enabled networks that synchronize around a single truth. While digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI) are important pieces of a secure credentialing solution, it is the addition of a decentralized verification network that adds the highest level of security, longevity, and recipient ownership to digital records.</p>

   <a href="https://trinsic.id/interactive-connections/">Trinsic Introduces Interactive Connections in Trinsic Wallet &amp; Platform</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p>

      <p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own.

      <p>Interoperability has always been of paramount importance to Trinsic. That story begins at an&nbsp;<a href="https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook">IIW #28 demo</a>&nbsp;with the Government of British Columbia where we demonstrated the first mobile app and enterprise SSI platform to comply with the Hyperledger Aries RFCs, achieving interoperability with the open source ariescloudagent-python.

      <p>If you’ve interacted with Trinsic much, you know we issue credentials for all sorts of things. Many of those workflows, including the Stripe, Calendly, and Zoom integrations, were done using Zapier and took less than 15 minutes to set up. We even issued our employees an Employee ID credential using Zapier! But we’re not the only ones who love this feature—see how other innovators are using Trinsic and Zapier to make self-sovereign identity a reality.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p>

      <p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”<br>

Why do you need to see my bank history to verify I have sufficient income, or see my name and address on my ID to verify I’m over 21? Why do we still rely on physical documents to prove something about us in this age of technological advancement?</p>

  <p>Natalie and I decided to escape San Francisco for election week, and have been holed up in Fort Bragg on the Northern California coast. I've mostly been on vacation, but I did find time to make some significant changes to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>. Plus notes on an exciting Git scraping project.</p>
 Better search in the sqlite-utils 3.0 alpha 
<p>I practice <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=cus2&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=semver">semantic versioning</a> with sqlite-utils, which means it only gets a major version bump if I break backwards compatibility in some way.</p>
<p>My goal is to avoid breaking backwards compatibility as much as possible, and I was proud to have made it all the way to <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-23">version 2.23</a> representing 23 new feature releases since the 2.0 release without breaking any documented features!</p>
<p>Sadly this run has come to an end: I realized that the <code>table.search()</code> method was poorly designed, and I also needed to grab back the <code>-c</code> command-line option (a shortcut for <code>--csv</code> output) to be used for another purpose.</p>
<p>The chances that either of these changes will break anyone are pretty small, but semantic versioning dictates a major version bump so here we are.</p>
<p>I shipped a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases/tag/3.0a0">3.0 alpha</a> today, which should hopefully become a stable release very shortly (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/milestone/4">milestone here</a>).</p>
<p>The big new feature is <code>sqlite-utils search</code> - a command-line tool for executing searches against a full-text search enabled table:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils search 24ways-fts4.db articles maps -c title
[{"rowid": 163, "title": "Get To Grips with Slippy Maps", "rank": -10.028754920576421},
 {"rowid": 220, "title": "Finding Your Way with Static Maps", "rank": -9.952534352591737},
 {"rowid": 27, "title": "Putting Design on the Map", "rank": -5.667327088267961},
 {"rowid": 168, "title": "Unobtrusively Mapping Microformats with jQuery", "rank": -4.662224207228984},
</code> 
<p>Here's <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#cli-search">full documentation</a> for the new command.</p>
<p>Notably, this command works against both FTS4 and FTS5 tables in SQLite - despite FTS4 not shipping with a built-in ranking function. I'm using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts4">sqlite-fts4</a> package for this, which I described back in January 2019 in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-relevance-algorithms-sqlite/">Exploring search relevance algorithms with SQLite</a>.</p>
 Git scraping to predict the election 
<p>It's not quite over yet but the end is in sight, and one of the best tools to track the late arriving vote counts is <a href="https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html">this Election 2020 results site</a> built by Alex Gaynor and a growing cohort of contributors.</p>
<p>The site is a beautiful example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git scraping</a> in action, and I'm thrilled that it links to my article in the README!</p>
<p>Take a look <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper">at the repo</a> to see how it works. Short version: this <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/01060c06c35442c0654e18b84e22394ef3ef5a9c/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">GitHub Action workflow</a> grabs the latest snapshot of this <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/elections-assets/2020/data/api/2020-11-03/votes-remaining-page/national/president.json">undocumented New York Times JSON API</a> once every five minutes and commits it to the repository. It then runs <a href="https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/01060c06c35442c0654e18b84e22394ef3ef5a9c/print-battleground-state-changes">this Python script</a> which iterates through the Git history and generates an HTML summary showing the different batches of new votes that were reported and their impact on the overall race.</p>
<p>The resulting report is published to GitHub pages - resulting in a site that can handle a great deal of traffic and is updated entirely by code running in scheduled actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a perfect use-case for Git scraping: it takes a JSON endpoint that represents the current state of the world and turns it into a sequence of historic snapshots, then uses those snapshots to build a unique and useful new source of information to help people understand what's going on.</p>

<p>For many decades, one of the landmark radio stations in Washington, DC was WMAL-AM (now re-branded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSBN">WSPN</a>), at 630 on (what in pre-digital times we called) the dial. As AM listening faded, so did WMAL, which moved its talk format to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAL-FM">105.9 FM</a> in Woodbridge and its signal to a less ideal location, far out to the northwest of town.</p>
<p>They made the latter move because the 75 acres of land under the station’s four towers in Bethesda had become far more valuable than the signal. So, like many other station owners with valuable real estate under legacy transmitter sites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_Media">Cumulus Media</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.insideradio.com/free/cumulus-closes-74-million-sale-of-maryland-tower-site/article_9f233cbc-b70a-11ea-af89-eb5e61f8fbba.html#:~:text=Five%20years%20after%20it%20struck%20a%20%2475%20million,%2474.1%20million%2C%20including%20%245%20million%20paid%20in%202019.">sold sold the old site for $74 million</a>. Nice haul.</p>
<p>I’ve written at some length about this&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/02/10/will-wmal-survive-losing-its-transmitter/">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/11/01/wmal630am-2-0/">here</a> in 2015, and&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/01/05/the-slow-sidelining-of-over-the-air-radio/">here in 2016</a>. I’ve also covered the whole topic of radio and its decline&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>&nbsp;and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I only bring the whole mess up today because it’s a five-year story that ended this morning, when WMAL’s towers were demolished. The Washington Post wrote about it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/demolition-of-bethesda-radio-towers-will-take-a-piece-of-history-rare-open-space/2020/11/02/238b4bc4-1945-11eb-aeec-b93bcc29a01b_story.html">here</a>, and provided the video from which I pulled the screen-grab above.&nbsp;<a href="http://Pedestrians.org" title="http://Pedestrians. ">Pedestrians.org</a> also has a much more complete video on YouTube, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/category/radio/">here</a>. WRC-TV, channel 4, has a chopper view (best I’ve seen yet) <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/watch-400-foot-towers-in-maryland-demolished-with-explosives/2463073/?fbclid=IwAR1uLKwtW06wQVlgamKybJLSIeQI6RHfh8GEyLemi-kbwPf2E13BeA0ROmg">here</a>. Spake the&nbsp;Post,</p>
<blockquote><p>When the four orange and white steel towers first soared over Bethesda in 1941, they stood in a field surrounded by sparse suburbs emerging just north of where the Capital Beltway didn’t yet exist. Reaching 400 feet, they beamed the voices of WMAL 630 AM talk radio across the nation’s capital for 77 years.</p>
<p>As the area grew, the 75 acres of open land surrounding the towers became a de facto park for runners, dog owners and generations of teenagers who recall sneaking smokes and beer at “field parties.”</p>
<p>Shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday, the towers came down in four quick controlled explosions to make way for a new subdivision of 309 homes, taking with them a remarkably large piece of privately owned — but publicly accessible — green space. The developer, Toll Brothers, said construction is scheduled to begin in 2021.</p>
<p>Local radio buffs say the Washington region will lose a piece of history. Residents say they’ll lose a public play space that close-in suburbs have too little of.</p></blockquote>
<p>After seeing those towers fall, I posted this to a private discussion among broadcast engineers (a role I once played, briefly and inexpertly, many years ago):</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s like watching a public execution.</p>
<p>I’m sure that’s how many of who have spent our lives looking at and maintaining these things feel at a sight like this.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that the AM band is a century old, and that nearly all listening today is to other media. We know how these towers make waves that spread like ripples across the land and echo off invisible mirrors in the night sky. We know from experience how the inverse square law works, how nulls and lobes are formed, how oceans and prairie soils make small signals large and how rocky mountains and crappy soils are like mud to a strong signal’s wheels. We know how and why it is good to know these things, because we can see an invisible world where other people only hear songs, talk and noise.</p>
<p>We also know that, in time, all these towers are going away, or repurposed to hold up antennas sending and receiving radio frequencies better suited for carrying data.</p>
<p>We know that everything ends, and in that respect AM radio is no different than any other medium.</p>
<p>What matters isn’t whether it ends with a bang (such as here with WMAL’s classic towers) or with a whimper (as with so many other stations going dark or shrinking away in lesser facilities). It’s that there’s still some good work and fun in the time this old friend still has left.</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating and accessing unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. Joel Thorstensson is the founder and CTO of 3Box and the primary author of the ceramic protocol as well as several Ethereum standards for identity and will provide a conceptual and technical intro to Ceramic.<br>
[…]<br>
Ceramic uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data), signed messages, and blockchain anchoring to create a trusted and shared graph of verifiable documents. While flexible, these documents are especially well-suited for self-sovereign identity systems, user-centric data ecosystems, and open web services.\</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Technical Specification</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation of mutable, tamper-resistant, smart documents on a worldwide public network. Smart documents are achieved through a combination of digital signatures, document update rules, and blockchain anchoring. A Ceramic document is a flexible data structure that can be used to represent a wide variety of things such as self-sovereign identities, specific pieces of data or content, media files, schemas, policies for data access control, verifiable credentials, agreements between multiple parties, etc. The protocol doesn’t rely on any particular blockchain system, instead it utilizes <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> to encode document changes into a hash linked data structure, called a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and anchors those updates into a blockchain which provides strict ordering to the content of a given document. As a result, Ceramic can be conceptualized as network of individual “doc-chains.” Verifying the state of a particular document only requires a user to sync the data of the given document, and the user does not need to sync the state of the entire network as is the case with all blockchain networks that maintain a global state (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum). A node in the Ceramic network can thus choose to only pin the documents it cares about. This means that there is no global ledger of documents.</p>

      <p>Transmute has been working on a solution: tying DIDs to Tangem NFC Cards, which carry a passport-grade secure chip, which implements public key cryptography. Near Field Communication (NFC) is the technology that enables things like contactless payments (e.g. Apple or Android pay), but it’s also being more increasingly used in supply chains for things like inventory and warehouse management [via contactless counting of products on shelves]. Much like DIDs, they provide unique identification for the objects they represent (like your cell phone), but they’re notoriously limited when it comes to data storage and as such have long been outpaced by other web-enabled identification technologies like the QR code.</p>

<p>Travel always has its ups and downs but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced both at the same time as intensely as right now.</p>
<p>I’m at Moonstone Beach in Cambria, just south of San Simeon, in a rented camper van. After a walk on the beach I hop in, reverse, clip a rock, blow a tire, and come to rest alongside the guard rail facing the ocean.</p>
<p>I call roadside assistance; they can deliver a tire but not until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I may be about to win the road trip breakdown lottery. I’m snuggled in my two-sleeping-bag nest on the air mattress in the back of the van, on a bluff about 25 feet above the beach, with the van’s big side door open, watching and hearing the tide roll in.</p>
<p>The worst and best parts of my trip are happening at the same time. I screwed up, am stuck, cannot go anywhere. But of all the places I could have been stuck on this trip, I’m stuck in the place I most want to be.</p>
<p>The sign says the gate closes at 6, but nobody has shown up by 7 when everyone else is gone. I can’t reach the authorities. This would be the campsite of my dreams if I’m allowed to stay.</p>
<p>The suspense is killing me. </p>
<p>Eventually a cop shows up, agrees that I can’t go anywhere, and gives me permission to stay for the night. I win the lottery! Nobody ever gets to stay here overnight. But here I am.</p>
<p>We’re all stuck in many ways for many reasons. A road trip during the final week before the election seemed like a way to silence the demons. Roaming around the state didn’t really help. But this night on the bluff over Moonstone Beach most certainly will.</p>
<p>In the light of the full moon, the crests of the waves are sometimes curls of silver, sometimes wraiths of foam that drift slowly south, continually morphing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how we’re all going to get through this winter. I don’t know what comes next. I don’t even have a plan for tomorrow. But I am so grateful to be here now.</p>

   <a href="https://mattr.global/introducing-the-mattr-platform/">Introducing the MATTR Platform</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Here at MATTR, we have been hard at work building a suite of products to serve the next generation of digital trust. We’ve designed our products based on a few key principles: extensible data formats, secure authentication protocols, a rigorous semantic data model, industry-standard cryptography, and the use of drivers and extensions to allow modular and configurable use of the platform over time. By combining our core capabilities with extensions and drivers, our platform offers developers convenience without compromising flexibility or choice.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/ssi-what-we-really-need-is-full-data-portability/">SSI? What we really need is full data portability</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Governments and other stakeholders exploring SSI are less interested in ideology and more interested in improving the user experience for their customers and constituents. They want to increase access to services, improve service delivery, and safely digitalize interactions, while mitigating privacy and data security-related risks. The key to these objectives lies in full data portability—this means granting individuals robust legal rights, as well as straightforward technical tools and capabilities, to manage and use identity credentials and other personal data with more trust, confidence and ease, so that they can share medical records with a new doctor, port professional credentials to a new employer, and the like.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials/">A solution for privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Here at MATTR, we are piloting an approach to ZKPs based on BBS+ signatures. Beyond the privacy and security benefits of ZKPs in general, this approach has a number of additional benefits compared to the ZKP implementations that exist today.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/jwt-vs-linked-data-proofs-comparing-verifiable-credentials/">JWT vs Linked Data Proofs: comparing Verifiable Credentials</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Linked Data Proofs offer more flexibility and are thus more scalable for global decentralized networks. Plus, because they natively work with JSON-LD, they encourage adoption of an open-world data model and re-usage of schemas that makes JSON-LD so powerful.</p>

      <p>JWTs, in contrast, offer a simple and straightforward way to express data with a limited semantic vocabulary. Using JWTs with JSON-LD provides a potential compromise between the two approaches, but loses much of the flexibility provided by Linked Data Security.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform/">Using privacy-preserving ZKP credentials on the MATTR Platform</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>By leveraging pairing-friendly elliptic-curve cryptography in the context of Linked Data Proofs, our approach provides an unprecedented way to perform zero-knowledge proofs using the semantics of JSON-LD. This allows credential issuers to tap into vast data vocabularies that exist on the web today, such as schema.org and Google Knowledge Graph, making user data more context-rich without sacrificing security and privacy of the user in the process. Not only is this approach more interoperable with existing implementations of the VC data model and semantic web technologies, it also doesn’t rely on any external dependencies to operate (like a distributed ledger), meaning it’s far more efficient than other approaches based on CL-signatures and zk-SNARKs. We’ve open-sourced our LD-Proofs suite for VCs including performance benchmarks so you can check it out yourself.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform/">DID Extensibility on the MATTR Platform</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>DID Web helps to bridge the gap between the way that trust is established on the internet today, namely using domains, and new and emerging ecosystems using DIDs. When using DID Web, rather than anchoring a DID to a decentralized ledger such as a blockchain, the DID is instead associated with a specific domain name, and subsequently anchored to the web host registered with that domain via DNS resolution. Effectively, this allows a DID using this scheme to be resolved as simply as one resolves a web URL, every time they click on a link. For example, we’ve set up a DID Web using our own domain, which can be resolved at did:web:mattr.global.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/new-to-json-ld-introducing-json-ld-lint/">New to JSON-LD? Introducing JSON-LD Lint</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The rise in popularity of javascript (due to its natural language monopoly in web-browsers) led to a mass exile from XML and shift over to JSON as the prefered data representation format. In the process, certain valuable features of XML were lost, in particular those that provide a standardised semantic syntax. JSON-LD defines this missing layer of syntax, which improves semantic reasoning around data. This is critical for maintaining data quality and trust in data, which is particularly important as we increase our reliance on digital infrastructure, IOT and AI.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://mattr.global/adding-support-for-revocation-of-verifiable-credentials/">Adding support for revocation of Verifiable Credentials</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Integrating revocation into our platform brings us one step closer to building a fully realized verifiable data ecosystem, an environment where verifiers can have more confidence and trust in the decisions they’re making and people can participate in the sharing and exchange of information without eroding their basic privacy. We look forward to continuing to collaborate with the community and gathering feedback from industry to enhance and extend different ways to accomplish revocation while respecting users’ digital rights.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>MATTR is currently building an extensive set of foundational capabilities in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for verifiable credential issuance, verification, and storage. An essential worker or a person performing an essential task would receive various credentials and attestations from many issuers containing relevant assertions about their essential work or task status. Their solution also offers the option to validate the information further by using either public or private registries of authoritative verifiable information.</p>

<p>It’s that most magical time of year in Central Park: Autumn. I spent a lot of
time wandering around <a href="https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/the-pool" title="Central Park Conservancy: The Pool">The Pool</a> yesterday. Lots of folks were about, taking in
the views, shooting photos. The spectacular foliage photographed best backlit
by the sun. Here’s another one.</p>

<p>This is my monthly roundup of the tech and media I consumed and found interesting. Here's my list for October.</p><p>This month I've changed my process a little: I save my links to a <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> database, export them at the end of the month, and convert them into a blog post using <a href="https://github.com/benwerd/notion-links-to-blog-post">a small script</a>. Instead of taking a couple of hours at the end of the month to put the post together, I save my thoughts on each link as I read it, and collation at the end (in <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>) takes much less time.</p> Streaming <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304">The Queen's Gambit</a>. A beautifully written, impeccably acted drama with gorgeous cinematography and superb attention to detail. I'm still working through it, but I can't recommend it enough.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borat-Subsequent-Moviefilm-Sacha-Baron/dp/B08K3SDZJ9">Borat Subsequent Moviefilm</a>. It's been pretty controversial, and it's often in hugely bad taste, but I found the broad humor at the expense of American bigotry to be cathartic. And yes, "that" Giuliani scene is everything it's been reported to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80117555">Seven Seconds</a>. This new-to-me police drama based on a Russian movie is really well done: a story about police corruption and how our criminal justice system fails the people who need it the most.</p><p><a href="https://tv.apple.com/show/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy">Ted Lasso</a>. Sure, it's ostensibly about sports, which isn't usually my thing. But it's also a really optimistic, funny comedy that mines a lot of humor from the cultural differences between the US and UK, which is really my thing. Very occasionally it goes broader than it needs to, particularly in its first few minutes, but there's something here for everyone.</p> Notable Articles  Business <p><a href="https://canny.io/blog/how-we-built-a-1m-arr-saas-startup/">How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup</a>.

As the platforms that dominate it become more internationally-based, it becomes less of a monoculture.</p><p><a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0">Why the Survival of the Airlines Depends on Frequent Flyer Programs</a>. “The Financial Times pegs the value of Delta’s loyalty program at a whopping $26 billion, American Airlines at $24 billion, and United at $20 billion. All of these valuations are comfortably above the market capitalization of the airlines themselves — Delta is worth $19 billion, American $6 billion, and United $10 billion. In other words, if you take away the loyalty program, Delta’s real-world airline operation — with hundreds of planes, a world-beating maintenance operation, landing rights, brand recognition, and experienced executives — is worth roughly negative $7 billion.”</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7g5ga/facebook-just-forced-its-most-powerful-critics-offline">Facebook Just Forced Its Most Powerful Critics Offline</a>. “The <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3epva/an-outside-oversight-group-is-forcing-facebook-to-get-its-shit-together-for-the-election">Real Facebook Oversight Board</a>, a group established last month in response to the tech giant’s failure to get its actual Oversight Board up and running before the presidential election, was forced offline on Wednesday night after Facebook wrote to the internet service provider demanding the group’s website — realfacebookoversight.org — be taken offline.” Ridiculously petty.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists">How Clubhouse brought the culture war to Silicon Valley’s venture capital community</a>.

  <p>I shipped <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-51">Datasette 0.51</a> today, with a new visual design, plugin hooks for adding navigation options, better handling of binary data, URL building utility methods and better support for running Datasette behind a proxy. It's a lot of stuff! Here are the annotated release notes.</p>
 New visual design 
<blockquote>
<p>Datasette is no longer white and grey with blue and purple links! <a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie Downe</a> has been working on a visual refresh, the first iteration of which is included in this release. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/pull/1056">#1056</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's about time Datasette grew beyond its clearly-designed-by-a-mostly-backend-engineer roots. Natalie has been helping me start adding some visual polish: we've started with an update to the colour scheme and will be continuing to iterate on the visual design as the project evolves towards the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>The new design makes the navigation bar much more obvious, which is important for this release since the new navigation menu (tucked away behind a three-bar icon) is a key new feature.</p>
<p></p>
 Plugins can now add links within Datasette 
<blockquote>
<p>A number of existing Datasette plugins add new pages to the Datasette interface, providig tools for things like <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">uploading CSVs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema">editing table schemas</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-configure-fts">configuring full-text search</a>.</p>
<p>Plugins like this can now link to themselves from other parts of Datasette interface. The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-menu-links">menu_links(datasette, actor)</a> hook (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1064">#1064</a>) lets plugins add links to Datasette's new top-right application menu, and the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-table-actions">table_actions(datasette, actor, database, table)</a> hook (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1066">#1066</a>) adds links to a new "table actions" menu on the table page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feature has been a long time coming. I've been writing an increasing number of plugins that add new pages to Datasette, and so far the main way of using them has been to memorise and type in their URLs!</p>
<p>The new navigation menu (which only displays if it has something in it) provides a global location to add new links. I've already released several plugin updates that take advantage of this.</p>
<p>The new "table actions" menu imitates Datasette's existing column header menu icon - it's a cog. Clicking it opens a menu of actions relating to the current table.</p>
<p>Want to see a demo?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The demo at <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/">latest.datasette.io</a> now includes some example plugins. To see the new table actions menu first <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/login-as-root">sign into that demo as root</a> and then visit the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">facetable</a> table to see the new cog icon menu at the top of the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an animated GIF demo showing the new menus in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Binary data 
<blockquote>
<p>SQLite tables can contain binary data in <code>BLOB</code> columns. Datasette now provides links for users to download this data directly from Datasette, and uses those links to make binary data available from CSV exports. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/binary_data.html#binary">Binary data</a> for more details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1036">#1036</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1034">#1034</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I spent a ton of time on this over the past few weeks. The initial impetus was a realization that Datasette CSV exports included ugly Python <code>b'\x15\x1c\x02\xc7\xad\x05\xfe'</code> strings, which felt like the worst possible way to display binary in a CSV file, out of universally bad options.</p>
<p>Datasette's main interface punted on binary entirely - it would show a <code>&lt;Binary data: 7 bytes&gt;</code> label which didn't help much either.</p>
<p>The only way to get at binary data stored in a Datasette instance was to request the JSON version and then manually decode the Base-64 value within it!</p>
<p>This is now fixed: binary columns can be downloaded directly to your computer, using a new <code>.blob</code> output renderer. The approach is described on <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/binary_data.html#binary">this new page in the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Security was a major consideration when building this feature. Allowing the download of arbitrary byte payloads from a web server is dangerous business: it can easily result in XSS holes where HTML with dangerous <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> content can end up hosted on the primary domain.</p>
<p>After some research, I decided to serve up binary content for download using the following headings:</p>
 <code>content-type: application/binary
x-content-type-options: nosniff
content-disposition: attachment; filename="data-f30889.blob"
</code> 
<p><code>application/binary</code> is a safer Content-Type option than the more common <code>application/octet-stream</code>, according to Michal Zalewski's renowned web application security book The Tangled Web (<a href="https://neexee.github.io/posts-en/the-tangled-web/">quoted here</a>)</p>
<p><code>x-content-type-options: nosniff</code> disables the XSS-tastic content sniffing feature in older versions of Internet Explorer, where IE would helpfully guess that you intended to serve HTML based on the first few bytes of the response.</p>
<p>The <code>content-disposition: attachment</code> header causes the browser to show a "download this file" dialog, using the suggested filename.</p>
<p>If you know of a reason that this isn't secure enough, please <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw">let me know</a>!</p>
 URL building 
<blockquote>
<p>The new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-urls">datasette.urls</a> family of methods can be used to generate URLs to key pages within the Datasette interface, both within custom templates and Datasette plugins. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html#writing-plugins-building-urls">Building URLs within plugins</a> for more details. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/904">#904</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/config.html#config-base-url">base_url</a> configuration setting was the forcing factor around this piece of work.</p>
<p>It allows you to configure Datasette to serve content starting at a path other than <code>/</code> - for example:</p>
 <code>datasette --config base_url:/path-to-datasette/
</code> 
<p>This will serve all Datasette pages at locations starting with <code>/path-to-datasette/</code>.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? It's useful if you are proxying traffic to Datasette from within the URL hierarchy of an existing website.</p>
<p>The feature didn't work properly, and enough people care about it that I had a steady stream of bug reports. For 0.51 I gathered them all into a single giant <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1023">tracking issue</a> and worked through them all one by one.</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that the key challenge was building URLs within Datasette - not just within HTML template pages, but also for things like HTTP redirects.</p>
<p>Datasette itself needed to generate URLs that took the <code>base_url</code> setting into account, but so do Datasette plugins. So I built <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-urls">a new datasette.urls</a> collection of helper methods and made them part of the documented internals API for plugins. The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html#building-urls-within-plugins">Building URLs within plugins</a> documentation shows how these should be used.</p>
<p>I also added documentation on <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-proxy">Running Datasette behind a proxy</a> with example configs (tested on my laptop) for both nginx and Apache.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#datasette-client">datasette.client</a> mechanism from Datasette 0.50 allows plugins to make calls to Datasette's internal JSON API without the overhead of an HTTP request. This is another place where plugins need to be able to construct valid URLs to internal Datasette pages.</p>
<p>I added this example to the documentation showing how the two features can work together:</p>
 table_json = (
    await datasette.client.get(
        datasette.urls.table("fixtures", "facetable", format="json")
    )
).json() 
<p>One final weird detail on this: Datasette now has various methods that automatically add the <code>base_url</code> prefix to a URL. I got worried about what would happen if these were applied more than once (as above, where <code>datasette.urls.table()</code> applies the prefix so does <code>datasette.client.get()</code>).</p>
<p>I fixed this using the same trick that Django and Jinja use to avoid appliying auto-escaping twice to content that will be displayed in HTML: the <code>datasette.urls</code> methods actually return a <code>PrefixedUrlString</code> object which is a subclass of <code>str</code> that knows that the prefix has been applied! Code for that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/main/datasette/utils/__init__.py#L1015">lives here</a>.</p>
 Smaller changes 
<p>A few highlights from the "smaller changes" in Datasette 0.51:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Wide tables shown within Datasette now scroll horizontally (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/998">#998</a>). This is achieved using a new <code>&lt;div class="table-wrapper"&gt;</code> element which may impact the implementation of some plugins (for example <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/commit/fcb4abbe7df9071c5ab57defd39147de7145b34e">this change to datasette-cluster-map</a>). 
 
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a big improvement: if your database table is too wide, it now scrolls horizontally on the page (rather than blowing the entire page out to a wider width). You can see that in action on the <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants">global-power-plants demo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html#permissions-debug-menu">debug-menu</a> permission. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1068">#1068</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>If you are signed in as <code>root</code> the new navigation menu links to a whole plethora of previously-undiscoverable Datasette debugging tools. This new permission controls the display of those items.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>Link:</code> HTTP header pagination. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1014">#1014</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by GitHub and WordPress, which both use the HTTP <code>Link</code> header in this way. It's an optional extra though: Datasette will always offer in-JSON pagination information.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Edit SQL button on canned queries, (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">#1019</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Suggested by Jacob Fenton <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">in this issue</a>. The implementation had quite a few edge cases since there are certain categories of canned query that can't be executed as custom SQL by the user. See the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019#issuecomment-708128286">issue comments</a> for details and a demo.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>--load-extension=spatialite</code> shortcut. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1028">#1028</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/136">a similar feature</a> in <code>sqlite-utils</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette -o</code> option now opens the most relevant page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/976">#976</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fun little feature. If your Datasette only loads a single database, and that database only has a single table (common if you've just run a single CSV import) then running this will open your browser directly to that table page:</p>
 <code>datasette data.db -o

<p>Recommendations for plugin authors, inspired by a question <a href="https://twitter.com/kanedr/status/1320653434895347713">from David Kane</a> on Twitter. David has been building <a href="https://github.com/drkane/datasette-reconcile">datasette-reconcile</a>, a Datasette plugin that offers a reconciliation API endpoint that can be used with <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>. What a brilliant idea!</p>
 datasette-edit-templates (almost) 
<p>Inspired by a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/obra">Jesse Vincent</a>, I also spent some time experimenting with the idea of a plugin that can load and edit templates from the database - which would turn a personal Datasette into a really fun interface hacking environment. I nearly got this working, and even shipped a preview of a <code>load_template()</code> plugin hook in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.51a2">Datasette 0.51a2</a> alpha... before crashing into a road block when I realized that it also needed to work with Jinja's <code>{% extends %}</code> and <code>{% include %}</code> template tags and loaders for those <a href="https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1304">don't currenty support async functions</a>.</p>
<p>In exploring this I also realized that my <code>load_template()</code> plugin hook wasn't actually necessary - if I'm going to solve this problem with Jinja loaders I can do so using the existing <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#prepare-jinja2-environment-env">prepare_jinja2_environment(env)</a> hook.</p>
<p>My not-yet-functional prototype for this is caled <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-templates">datasette-edit-templates</a>. I'm pretty confident I can get it working against the old plugin hook with a little more work.</p>

  Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail.

<p>
 Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail. For my previous build, I used Gatsby to build a static site which I hosted on Netlify. The dynamic content of the site was stored in an instance of Ghost which was then pulled in at build-time.
</p>
<p>
 Overall, I was quite disappointed with Gatsby. I found the framework to be quite over-engineered. At one point, I found myself trying to resize a photo or something and it required some (to me at least) very complex configuration and some fancy graphQL query just to get the image to load. Another issue I have is with the offline plugin. Gatsby uses service workers to cache your entire site offline which can then be served by a service worker in case your users have spotty internet. Or no internet. The problem comes with removing this service worker once you move away from the framework. I needed to do quite a bit of research to figure out how to delete the service worker once I moved over to the new site since Gatsby chooses to use caching very aggressively which is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
 I understand why Gatsby makes these choices. Their goal is to make websites load insanely fast which I think they accomplish at a great cost of complexity. And they work hard to ensure that Gatsby sites score highly on the Google Lighthouse test. I have two issues with these goals. First, I'm not sure pursuing a high score on Lighthouse is a good goal to optimize for. Making a website load quickly is important, but Lighthouse will ding you for things using a particular Javascript library instead of their recommended smaller library. This is a game of cat-and-mouse which has little benefit beyond speeding up your website (which is important). Second, the amount of complexity that Gatsby introduces will likely slow down the development of your site and stifle your creativity. I can't comment on the experience of using Gatsby in the context of a larger team, but for me I know it led to making fewer improvements to the site because of the complexity.
</p>
<p>
 As for Ghost as a headless CMS – I think there are some limitations there. Overall, Ghost is a great platform. It's reliable and usable and has a good writing experience. I do think that their push into the JAMStack fad was mostly a marketing play since some limitations were never addressed even after several years. I would definitely use Ghost again, just not as a headless CMS. I would use it how it was primarily designed to be used.
</p>
<p>
 So why did I choose Django and Wagtail? Well, I've been using Django on and off for a long time. Probably 7 years at this point. The framework is reliable and seriously productive. Wagtail is built as a Django "app" so it's very familiar to me and it's very powerful. Overall, I'm content with the developer experience so far. I think the admin interface that is used to publish content could use some work. It's functional but frankly it's pretty ugly. Especially compared to something like Statamic which has been getting some attention lately.
</p>
<p>
 It's been a while since I've run my blog with server-rendered pages with dynamic content as opposed to a static site published to a CDN. I think the fact that I can log into a dashboard and publish content is so much more ergonomic from a writing and publishing perspective that I'm more likely to write more. Compared to the process of building a static site and deploying an update, it's quite nice. The downside, obviously, is that I need to worry again about load on the site and downtime during traffic spikes. I'm hopeful that this is something that I can avoid by using caching and a CDN. The site now has virtually no javascript. Compared to Gatsby this is a big change. We'll see how it turns out but my theory is that I should be able to achieve similar speeds (good enough anyway) using some clever caching and a CDN. Browsers are pretty good at rendering plain HTML after all.

For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After a cup of menstrual blood went flying across the Senate floor, I had assumed 2019 would be California’s wildest legislative session for a while. Covid-19 proved me unfortunately wrong. The Legislative process, calendar and agenda was quickly thrown into the dumpster fire of March and everyone turned back to the white&nbsp;board.</p><p>When the Legislature returned from its two-month long “stay at home” recess in May, it passed a stripped-down state budget which reflected lower revenues given the pandemic-induced recession. They then began prioritizing and shelving hundreds of bills that would no longer make the cut in the truncated legislative calendar. Faced with less time to hold hearings and less money to spend on new proposals, legislators shelved an estimated three-quarters of the bills introduced at the beginning of the two-year&nbsp;session.</p><p>Here’s what happened for BAC’s blockchain/crypto sponsored bills:</p><p>AB 953 (Ting, San Francisco), which would have allowed state and local taxes to be paid with stablecoins, was sadly withdrawn, lacking a clear Covid-19&nbsp;nexus.</p><p>AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next&nbsp;year.</p><p>AB 2150 (Calderon, Whittier) spun through several dizzying iterations. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition worked closely with Assemblymember Calderon’s office to suggest amended language that would have directed the Department of Business Oversight to study the applicability of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce’s Proposal to an intrastate safe harbor.

Virtual currency businesses did not have any separate registration requirements or the need to apply for a money transmitter license. BAC participated in stakeholder calls this summer about the agency’s expansion and we are continuing to engage with the agency about how these registration requirements will be created.

<p>I took this week off so I could spend a little more time with my mother. Originally, it was also because I was in danger of burning out, and because I wanted to help get out the vote.</p><p>Today I was going to gently take her to the ocean - she can't walk far, but at least she could see the waves. It would have been a nice day for it.</p><p>Instead, this week she's had a medical procedure of some kind every single day, for five days running. She's about to have a multi-unit blood transfusion because her hemoglobin levels have plummeted. Afterwards, she'll likely want to sleep, in the same way she does after the dialysis sessions she has three times a week.</p><p>I'm very glad I'm here with my parents: I've been sheltering in place with them throughout the pandemic, which has allowed me to spend more time with them, and do what I can to help my dad, who is my mother's primary carer. This month alone events have included evacuating from a fire that miraculously stopped a block away from the house, and a mix of emergency and planned hospital visits. It's a lot, and I'm exhausted.</p><p>This is all quality time, but not the kind I was hoping for: there are fewer long talks, and far more feeding tube flushes and wound cleanings. I really hope it's not too late for those conversations. I'll be here regardless; I'm grateful for my family, and I'll take all the time I can get.</p><p>I could, however, use another vacation.</p>

<p></p><p>Like many people, 2020 has creatively consumed me. It's hard to give your undivided attention to something, or put yourself in a truly creative flow, when so much is going on. The sheer onslaught of new information - some newly jaw-dropping story seems to be showing up four to six times a day - puts my brain in a reactive mode. Instead of being inventive and generative, I'm constantly aghast. I'm hopeful that it will be possible to re-find a sort of mental peace once the election has been and gone, but I'm also a realist. The pandemic will continue; the political clown show will continue; children have been permanently separated from their parents, creating an entire, lost Trump generation; we will not right all the wrongs of the last four years overnight.</p><p>I've been thinking it would be an interesting exercise to force myself into a generative mode about the future. Instead of reacting to the onslaught of awfulness and saying this is what I don't want, which is almost a default biological reaction, what if we deliberately and proactively painted a picture of a possible future and said this is what I want?</p><p>It's a surprisingly hard thing to do. Even thinking about the form of it - is it a manifesto? a short story? - brings difficult choices. But if we're to be truly successful at building a better world, we need to have a strong idea of what that vision for the future really is.</p><p>I think speculative fiction can carry us a long way. But even in this creative realm, it's commonplace to paint dystopias: Black Mirror warnings of what could be rather than optimistic visions of what we might aspire to. I would love to read explorations of utopia, but aside from some facets of Star Trek (which, let's call it out, is united by a militaristic Federation), I don't know where to begin to look.</p><p>Rather than a complete imagining of this better future, perhaps it's helpful to start with principles. What is the guiding North Star that will help us make decisions about which paths to take?</p><p>I've long had a professional mission: I want to work on products that make the world more equal, informed, and kind. But that's a different exercise to defining principles that guide a positive vision of the future.</p><p>This is my attempt to define those - or at least, my representation of how I'm thinking about principles for the future today. I would love to read yours.</p> Principles for the future: Life, Fairness, Autonomy, and Forward Motion  Life <p>Everyone - regardless of their background, character, geography, and context - should be able to live a good life.</p><p>Not every American, or every person in whichever nation you happen to be reading this from; every person.</p><p>Nobody should experience poverty; everyone should have a home; everyone should have enough food to eat; everyone should have the opportunity to receive a great education; nobody should succumb to curable disease; everyone should have mobility. This is the foundation of a society that can provide a good life for all.</p><p>These things should not be provided by private businesses. I believe we need private businesses, but ability to make a profit at scale is not the same thing as being able to provide a fundamental societal foundation. Those things should be provided by a democratically elected government and upheld by an implicit social contract.</p><p>Taxation as part of this social contract is a reasonable funding mechanism. Societies with higher levels of progressive taxation turn out to result in a higher quality of life, in part because basic human rights are taken care of. The important thing is not the money you have in your pocket; it's your experience of living.</p><p>Wealth is not a shorthand for well-being.</p><p>The progress of the world should be measured by the experience of the people living in it rather than their wealth. In turn, we should measure the success of our nations by the quality of the experience of living in them, rather than their output. GDP, which has become a sort of shorthand for national success, was designed to be a measure of wartime productivity and <a href="https://www.theigc.org/blog/is-gdp-an-adequate-measure-of-development/">is far less well-suited to domestic life</a>. We need a better model, and a better measure.</p><p>For example, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/gdp-is-not-a-measure-of-human-well-being">Human Development Index and Gross National Happiness</a> are great steps in this direction. <a href="https://ethical.net/politics/gdp-alternatives-7-ways-to-measure-countries-wealth/">There are other alternative indexes that are worth considering</a>, although I suspect there will need to be a new, humanist measure to guide us. We do need some measure in order to gauge our successes and failures. This measure must be developed in an inclusive way, with ownership shared by communities across society, so as not to privilege one group over another.</p><p>Take the climate crisis: GDP doesn't disincentivize pollution, or directly incentivize cleaning up the environment. (It will, later on, when it is much too late.) A quality of life index would take into account the billions of people who are already feeling the effects of climate change.</p><p>It would incentivize public art, and underwriting culture, and providing amazing services, and help for people who need it.</p><p>Finally, GDP incentivizes building economic markets, whereas quality of life is method agnostic. All that matters is that we are continually improving the experience of being a human.</p> Fairness <p>Equity is a fundamental human value. Everyone should have equitable access to opportunities and resources.</p><p>Equity is giving everyone what they need to be successful; equality is treating everyone the same regardless of their context. In other words, mere equality perpetuates existing inequities. It isn't always enough.</p><p>Imagine if government was truly representative: not just geographically, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination">intersectionally</a>.</p><p>Imagine if everyone had access to the same level of education, regardless of their context. Then imagine if people who didn't come from generational educational success could receive extra help with the implicit ideas and skills, as well as baseline financial resources, that some people arrive at an institution already possessing. All for free. Imagine if everyone could have the opportunity to do well. Imagine how this wider gene pool of ideas would, in turn, benefit all of us.</p><p>I believe strongly that private schools and universities shouldn't exist. Finland, which has one of the highest test scores in the world (as well as one of the highest quality of life rankings), does so well <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/12/what-americans-keep-ignoring-about-finlands-school-success/250564/">precisely because it prioritizes equity</a>. (There are independent schools, but they're state subsidized, too.)</p><p>Imagine if everyone had the same opportunities once they entered the workforce. Imagine if maternity and paternity leave were equalized, eliminating tired old arguments for not promoting women. Imagine if the collective paid parental leave was 480 days, as it is in Sweden, allowing for healthier relationships within families with less economic hardship.</p><p>Imagine if salaries were required to be published ahead of time, eliminating both the need for negotiation and the possibility of women and people of color being paid less for the same job. (Finland goes a step further and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/finland-taxable-income-salary-transparency_n_5bdc520fe4b01ffb1d0170ec">publishes everyone's taxable income</a> once a year.) Imagine if company boards reflected societal diversity. Imagine if conversations about justice were permitted and encouraged at work.</p><p>Imagine if businesses did not depend on workers earning poverty-level wages, in any country. Imagine if resources were fairly traded.</p><p>Black Lives Matter is needed to undo centuries of generational, institutional discrimination. Likewise, feminism is a crucial ideology of restorative justice. Imagine if these ideas - restorative justice, generational healing, compassion - were core societal values. Imagine, in turn, if misogyny, racism, colonialism, and the broad spectrum of bigotry that has held so many people back were finally thrown to the fire.</p><p>In short, imagine if we built our institutions, systems, and processes to uphold fairness for all, rather than to uphold profit or benefit for some. It's not about ensuring equality of outcome (although, of course, everyone has the right to live a good life); it's about ensuring equity of opportunity.</p><p>Imagine if we all punched up instead of down.</p> Autonomy <p>Everyone has the right to make decisions for themselves and act on them, subject to the social contract we all make with each other.</p><p>That means women have the right to choose what they do with their bodies. Abortion must be legal.</p><p>That means rather than criminalizing drug addicts, we should provide help.</p><p>That means free speech and creative human expression are imperatives - until my speech is in service of rallying others to harm. It means that the right to protest is also an imperative. Sedition is always a bogus charge; government is never a protected group.</p><p>That means privacy and freedom from surveillance are human rights.</p><p>That means sex workers should be protected rather than demonized.</p><p>That means there should be complete freedom of religion (or freedom to practice no religion) - until that religion is used to invade someone else's autonomy, or to create unfair rules elsewhere in society, or to diminish someone else's quality of life.</p><p>That means what consenting adults do with each other is not your business, whether in private or public; nor is their decision to marry, for example.</p><p>That means you should wear a mask, as it protects others, just as you should wear a seatbelt, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117053&amp;page=1">because it protects others</a>.</p><p>That means building participative, inclusive, democratic governments rather than authoritarian institutions.</p><p>That means everyone should have the opportunity and ability to own and maintain property.</p><p>That means valuing diversity and inclusion.</p><p>That means allowing broad immigration between countries. Ideally you should be able to choose to live in the country whose values most closely align with your own.</p><p>That means enacting peaceful, globally democratic foreign policy.</p><p>That means accepting that some people will do things that you will not like - and, as long as it does not cause harm, upholding this as an important value by which we can all live.</p><p>It also means ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to make their own decisions and act on them. It implies a non-aggressive approach to policing, and a community-orientated approach to justice.</p> Forward motion <p>We should use our resources, creativity, and expertise to rapidly improve quality of life, fairness, and autonomy.</p><p>Basic human needs should be the responsibility of an intersectionally inclusive, democratically-elected government so we can concentrate on advancing human society rather than providing the basics.</p><p>By effectively measuring quality of life, inclusive teams should receive support to perform rapid, human-centered experiments within their communities in order to quickly determine how that quality of life can be improved.</p><p>Universities and research centers should be well-funded - not just for STEM activities, but also for humanities and cultural research. As this research is publicly funded, it should then be made publicly available, so everyone can benefit from its findings.</p><p>Exploration of the universe, and of our own planet, should similarly be owned by all of us. By making the fruits of human endeavor public, we can allow everyone to build on it, snowballing human progress.</p><p>Entrepreneurship has an important part to play. Innovation is a driver for progress. We should create a world where everyone has the ability to be an entrepreneur (not just the rich and well-connected), can be supported in doing so, and can build on a rich body of public research to help them succeed.</p><p>We should all own the process and the fruits of our communal progress. We should react to harms quickly, and continuously work to improve everyone's quality of life. We should have the space to seek our own individual goals, while valuing the goals of our communities. We should be there for each other.</p><p>We should tell stories about the future and try to make them real.</p> What's next? <p>This is clearly an incomplete set of principles. They're mine, as written over a set of days in October, 2020. But I think my next step is to stress test them by building a set of possible futures; to tell those utopian stories.</p><p>Perhaps your next step could be to build your own set of principles, and use them to tell your own stories. We can build on each other's ideas, as well as the ideas of diverse authors and futurists, to envision the world we want.</p><p>And then, of course, we build it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@stereophototyp?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sara Kurfeß</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

 MyData Canada Privacy Law Reform Submission <p>MyData Canada recently submitted a report to the Government of Ontario in response to its <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">consultation</a> for strengthening privacy protections in Ontario. You can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g03gwjdh76wllt9/MyData%20Canada%20Ontario%20Privacy%20Reform%20Submission%20%28Final%29.pdf?dl=0">download the submission</a> from the <a href="https://mydatacanada.webflow.io/">MyData Canada</a> site. I am a board member of MyData Global and a member of the MyData Canada hub. This is a brief summary of some of the recommendations in that report.</p><p>Part of what MyData Canada would like the province of Ontario to address is the current ‘gatekeeper model’ where each of us cede control to information about us under terms or privacy policies based on a flawed consent model. As the report puts it,</p><blockquote>Behind each of the gate-keepers (“data controllers” in GDPR terms) in the centralized model are thousands of intermediaries and data brokers invisible to the individuals whose data they process. Individuals’ personal data is used in ways they could not anticipate, and often without their awareness or even the opportunity to meaningfully consent.</blockquote><p>This needs to be fixed.</p> Background <p>Canada has a multi-jurisdictional privacy environment. That means that both levels of government have privacy commissioners and privacy laws. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, does not have a private sector privacy law. This leaves a number of categories of persons and organizations uncovered; don’t ask why, it’s a constitutional jurisdictional thing. Thus the consultation and submission. MyData Canada believes that,</p><blockquote>…our proposed approach will help accelerate the development and uptake of privacy- focused, human-centric innovation and ultimately serve to regain public trust and confidence in the digital economy.</blockquote> 2-Branch Privacy Reform <p>MyData Canada proposes a two branch approach to privacy law reform; a harmonization branch, and a transformation branch.</p>  The harmonization branch proposes an incremental approach to enable any new Ontario law to work harmoniously with other regimes, both in Canada and in the rest of the world. This branch is intended to ensure that Ontario is a low friction end point for cross border data flows with other data protection data. At the same time this branch will introduce a regulatory framework with a functional equivalency to the CCPA in the US and to the GDPR in the EU. In essence, this broad framework skates to where the puck will be with respect to global data protection laws.  The digital transformation branch proposes to simultaneously create a ‘next-generation’ regulatory space within Ontario. This space will allow Ontario based companies or organization to create new forward looking and individually centred solutions. To continue the metaphor, this branch will allow breakaway solutions that will disrupt the current platform information gatekeepers and return autonomy to individuals.   Harmonize Up <p>Rather than seeking a lowest common denominator or participating in a race to the bottom, MyData recommends harmonizing ‘up’ including the following:</p>  Adopting a principled and risk based approach to privacy regulation;  Coordinating with other provinces and the federal government, perhaps including a pan-Canadian council of information and privacy commissioners;  Aligning with Convention 108 and 108+;  Increased enforcement powers; and  Implementation support for businesses and organizations for compliance.   Digital Transformation <p>Create a regulatory environment to reward first movers with privacy enhancing technologies that put people at the centre of their own data. Recommendations include:</p>  Creating a privacy technology incubator;  Host regulatory sandboxes and hackathons;  Grants and other incentives for privacy ‘retrofits’;  Create and support a regime for seals, badges, and privacy trust marks;  Foster interoperability by requiring api or similar means to prevent or counter ‘platform dominance’ and network affects; and  Create up-skilling programs for a multi-disciplinary privacy engineering centre of excellence in Ontario.   Summing up <p>The above is just a summary of the first recommendations of the report. It includes further recommendations on:</p>  Taking a comprehensive approach to move beyond compliance;  Adopting a Consumer Protection and Human Rights oriented regulatory enforcement model  Adopting a multi-stakeholder and inclusive model to spur innovation and open data  <p>If you find this interesting please download and share the report.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Bundle the Release
      id: bundle
      run: pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      env:
        # Required to release on PGXN.

      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        # Reference the upload URL and bundle name from previous steps.
        upload_url: ${{ steps.release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should look like this, with
<code>$filename</code> representing the name of the release file, usually
<code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>::set-output name=bundle::$filename
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN

  This is a flight of fancy written a week and a half before the US election. I hope it proves to be bad speculation.

 What if? <p>Here’s a speculative fiction plot, NOT a prediction, prompted by the news frenzy of US presidential politics, influenced by my own contrarian nature. If you read history and science fiction we live in an interesting time. Whether it will be a historical turning point in US and global history is not something that we are privileged to know at the time. But if this is a historic turning point I would like to plot out a story based on where we are, not much more than a week before the US election between President Trump and former Vice-President Biden. Let’s ignore that reality strains credulity, and proceed from there. Nothing below should be read as representative of my own views or preferences.</p> Biden wins? <p>The Democrats win the House and the Senate. Joe Biden wins the popular vote but the electoral college remains unclear pending delayed counts for mail-in ballots. Election night ends with both candidates being declared the victor by different media outlets.</p> Taking it to the streets <p>On the day after the election Trump claims to be the legitimate President based on claims of a rigged election. From the White House he asks his supporters to come out to defend his victory. Activists from both sides take to the streets in every major American city. The national guard takes sides, but on different sides in different states or cities, and civic order breaks down.</p> COVID confusion <p>The electoral college convenes and declares Biden to be the winner. Trump and his staff leave the White House under political pressure. President elect Biden is then revealed to be ill with COVID, increasing uncertainty. Before the inauguration Biden dies in hospital, and Kamala Harris is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, with Pete Buttigieg as her vice-president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are prominently on display at the inauguration even as conflict rages on the streets of America.</p> Consolidation <p>President Harris deploys the military, aided by private military contractors, to establish order on the streets. Former President Trump flees the country to Moscow, declaring a government in exile. The Harris administration declares a continuing state of military emergency with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The state of emergency delays elections until the ‘emergency is over’.</p> Epilogue <p>10 years after the start of the Harris dynasty, the United States has become the Democratic Republic of America, run by the United Democratic Party under Grand President Harris. The former Republican Party has been absorbed into the United Democratic Party. Wall Street has become a financial back-water. The US overseas military presence has been dramatically reduced because of domestic military requirements. There is an underground resistance, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most wanted fugitive in American. Climate change is at 2.5 degrees and increasing. China has become the dominant global power, dominating the United Nation, based on its Belt and Road initiative.</p> End note <p>I hope that this will prove to be really bad speculation. The past is prologue but it is our job to create the history we want to inhabit. I wish my American friends a successful and well-run election with a successful and peaceful transition of power if the Biden-Harris ticket wins.</p>

  <p>I've been writing my talk for <a href="https://eventos.python.org.ar/events/pyconar2020/">PyCon Argentina</a> this week, which has proved surprisingly time consuming. I hope to have that wrapped up soon - I'm pre-recording it, which it turns out is much more work than preparing a talk to stream live.</p>
<p>I've made bits and pieces of progress on a whole bunch of different projects. Here are my notes on Datasette, plus an annotated version of my other releases-this-week.</p>
 Datasette 0.51a0 
<p>Datasette's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/config.html#base-url">base_url</a> configuration option is designed to help run Datasette behind a proxy - so you can configure Apache or nginx to proxy <code>/my-datasette/</code> to a Datasette instance and have every internal link work correctly.</p>
<p>It doesn't completely work. I gathered all of the bugs with it in a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1023">tracking issue</a>, addressed as many of them as I could and released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.51a0">Datasette 0.51a0</a> as a testing alpha.</p>
<p>if you run Datasette behind a proxy please try out this new alpha and tell me if it works for you! Testing help <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/838#issuecomment-712604364">is requested here</a>.</p>
<p>Also in the alpha:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 New <code>datasette.urls</code> URL builder for plugins, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/writing_plugins.html#writing-plugins-building-urls">Building URLs within plugins</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/904">#904</a>) 
 Removed <code>--debug</code> option, which didn't do anything. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/814">#814</a>) 
 
<code>Link:</code> HTTP header pagination. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1014">#1014</a>) 
 
<code>x</code> button for clearing filters. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1016">#1016</a>) 
 Edit SQL button on canned queries, (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">#1019</a>) 
 
<code>--load-extension=spatialite</code> shortcut. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1028">#1028</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
 Other releases this week 
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/sphinx-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.1a1">sphinx-to-sqlite 0.1a1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sphinx-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.1a">0.1a</a></p>
<p>One of the features I'm planning for the official Datasette website is combined search across issues, commits, releases, plugins and documentation - powered by my <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> search engine.</p>
<p>This means I nead to load Datasette's documentation into a SQLite database. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sphinx-to-sqlite">sphinx-to-sqlite</a> is my new tool for doing that: it uses the optional XML output from Sphinx to create a SQLite table populated with sections from the documentation, since these seem like the right unit for executing search against.</p>
<p>I'm now using this to build a Datasette instance at <a href="https://latest-docs.datasette.io/docs/sections">latest-docs.datasette.io</a> with the latest documentation on every commit.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/releases/tag/0.14">datasette-cluster-map 0.14</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map/releases/tag/0.13">0.13</a></p>
<p>The default marker popup for <code>datasette-cluster-map</code> is finally a human readable window, not a blob of JSON! You can see that in action on the <a href="https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants">global-power-plants</a> demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/inaturalist-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.2.1">inaturalist-to-sqlite 0.2.1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/pocket-to-sqlite/releases/tag/0.2.1">pocket-to-sqlite 0.2.1</a></p>
<p>I tried out <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-2-2020">the new PyPI resolver</a> and found that it is a lot less tolerant of <code>~=</code> v.s. <code>&gt;=</code> dependencies, so I pushed out new releases of these two packages.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-json-preview/releases/tag/0.2">datasette-json-preview 0.2</a></p>
<p>I'm using this plugin to preview the new default JSON representation I'm planning for Datasette 1.0. Carl Johnson provided <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/782#issuecomment-712569695">some useful feedback</a> leading to this new iteration, which now looks <a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/fixtures/roadside_attractions.json-preview">like this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/releases/tag/2.7">github-to-sqlite 2.7</a></p>
<p>Quoting the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>github-to-sqlite repos</code> command now takes options <code>--readme</code> and <code>--readme-html</code>, which write the README or rendered HTML README into the <code>readme</code> or <code>readme_html</code> columns, respectively. <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/issues/52">#52</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another feature I need for the Datasette website search engine, described above.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta/releases/tag/0.9">dogsheep-beta 0.9</a></p>
<p>My personal search engine, described in <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/dogsheep-personal-analytics-with">the latest Datasette Weekly newsletter</a>. This release added facet by date, part of ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta/issues/16">a timeline view</a>.</p>
<p>I also updated it to take advantage of the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-client">datasette.client internal API mechanism</a> introduced in Datasette 0.50.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/healthkit-to-sqlite/releases/tag/1.0">healthkit-to-sqlite 1.0</a></p>
<p>Another project bumped to 1.0. Only a small bug fix here: this can now import Apple HealthKit data from devices that use languages other than English.</p>
 TIL this week 
 
 <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/javascript_javascript-that-responds-to-media-queries.md">Writing JavaScript that responds to media queries</a> 
 
<p>I finally upgraded this blog to show recently added "Elsewhere" content (bookmarks and quotations) interspersed with my main entries in mobile view. I worte up <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/javascript_javascript-that-responds-to-media-queries.md">this TIL</a> to explain what I did.</p>

   Project LightSpeed: Rewriting the Messenger codebase for a faster, smaller, and simpler messaging app 
 Facebook rewrote their iOS messaging app earlier this year, dropping it from 1.7m lines of code to 360,000 and reducing the binary size to a quarter of what it was.

<p>Facebook rewrote their iOS messaging app earlier this year, dropping it from 1.7m lines of code to 360,000 and reducing the binary size to a quarter of what it was. A key part of the new app's architecture is much heavier reliance on SQLite to coordinate data between views, and to dynamically configure how different views are displayed. They even built their own custom system to add stored procedures to SQLite so they could execute portable business logic inside the database.</p>

<p>You don’t walk around wearing a name badge.&nbsp; Except maybe at a conference, or some other enclosed space where people need to share their names and affiliations with each other. But otherwise, no.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Because you don’t need a name badge for people who know you—or for people who don’t.</p>
<p>Here in civilization we typically reveal information about ourselves to others on a need-to-know basis: “I’m over 18.” “I’m a citizen of Canada.” “Here’s my Costco card.” “Hi, I’m Jane.” We may or may not present credentials in these encounters. And in most we don’t say our names. “Michael” being a common name, a guy called “Mike” may tell a barista his name is “Clive” if the guy in front of him just said&nbsp;his name is “Mike.” (My given name is David, a name so common that another David re-branded me Doc. Later I learned that his middle name was David and his first name was Paul. True story.)</p>
<p>This is how civilization works in the offline world.</p>
<p>Kim Cameron wrote up how this ought to work, in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Laws of Identity</a>, first published in 2004. The Laws include&nbsp;personal control and consent,&nbsp;minimum disclosure for a constrained use,&nbsp;justifiable parties, and&nbsp;plurality of operators. Again, we have those in here in the offline world where your body is reading this on a screen.</p>
<p>In the online world behind that screen, however, you have a monstrous mess. I won’t go into why. The results are what matter, and you already know those anyway.</p>
<p>Instead, I’d like to share what (at least for now) I think is the best approach to the challenge of presenting verifiable credentials in the digital world. It’s called KERI, and you can read about it here:&nbsp;<a href="https://keri.one/">https://keri.one/</a>. If you’d like to contribute to the code work, that’s here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/</a>.</p>
<p>I’m still just getting acquainted with it, in sessions at <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a>. The main thing is that I’m sure it matters. So I’m sharing that sentiment, along with those links.</p>

 Filling in the&nbsp;GNAP <p>About a year ago I wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">arguing for creating the next generation of the OAuth protocol</a>. That article, and some of the other writing around it, has been picked up recently, and so people have been asking me what’s the deal with XYZ, TxAuth, OAuth 3.0, and anything else mentioned there. As you can imagine, a lot has happened in the last year and we’re in a very different place.</p><p>The short version is that there is now a new working group in the IETF: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/about/">Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (gnap)</a>. The mailing list is still at <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/txauth/">txauth</a>, and the first WG draft is available online now as <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00</a>.</p> How Are These All&nbsp;Related? <p>OK, so there’s GNAP, but now you’re probably asking yourself what’s the difference between GNAP and XYZ, or TxAuth, or OAuth 3.0. With the alphabet soup of names, it’s certainly confusing if you haven’t been following along the story in the last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">XYZ project</a> started as a concrete proposal for how a security protocol could work post-OAuth 2.0. It was based on experience with a variety of OAuth-based and non-OAuth-based deployments, and on conversations with developers from many different backgrounds and walks. This started out as a test implementation of ideas, which was later written down into a website and even later incorporated into an IETF individual draft. The most important thing about XYZ is that it has always been implementation-driven: things almost always started with code and moved forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>This led to the project itself being called OAuth.XYZ after the website, and later just XYZ. When it came time to write the specification, this document was named after a core concept in the architecture: Transactional Authorization. The mailing list at IETF that was created for discussing this proposal was named after this draft: TxAuth. As such, the draft, project, and website were all referred to as either XYZ or TxAuth depending on who and when you&nbsp;asked.</p><p>After months of discussion and debate (because naming things is really hard), the working group settled on GNAP, and GNAP is now the official name of both the working group and the protocol the group is working on publishing.</p><p>As for OAuth 3.0? Simply put, it <a href="https://oauth.net/3/">canonically does not exist</a>. The GNAP work is being done by many members of the OAuth community, but not as part of the OAuth working group. While there may be people who refer to GNAP as OAuth 3.0, and it does represent a similar shift forward that OAuth 2.0 did, GNAP is not part of the OAuth protocol family. It’s not out of the question for the OAuth working group decides to adopt GNAP or something else in the future to create OAuth 3.0, but right now that is not on the&nbsp;table.</p> The GNAP&nbsp;Protocol <p>Not only is GNAP an official working group, but the GNAP protocol has also been <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">defined in an official working group draft document</a>. This draft represents the output of several months of concerted effort by a design team within the GNAP working group. The protocol in this document is not exactly the same as the earlier XYZ/TxAuth protocol, since it pulled from multiple sources and discussions, but there are some familiar&nbsp;pieces.</p><p>The upshot is that GNAP is now an official draft protocol.</p><p>GNAP is also not a final protocol by any stretch. If you read through the draft, you’ll notice that there are a large number of things tagged as “Editor’s Notes” and similar commentary throughout, making up a significant portion of the page count. These represent portions of the protocol or document where the design team identified some specific decisions and choices that need to be made by the working group. The goal was to present a set of initial choices along with rationale and context for&nbsp;them.</p><p>But that’s not to say that the only flexible portions are those marked in the editor’s notes. What’s important about the gnap-00 document is that it’s a starting point for the working group discussion. It gives the working group something concrete to talk about and debate instead of a blank page of unknown possibilities (and monsters). With this document in hand, the working group can and will change the protocol and how it’s presented over the specification’s lifecycle.</p> The Immediate Future <p>Now that GNAP is an active standard under development, XYZ will shift into being an open-source implementation of GNAP from here out. As of the time of publication, we are actively working to implement all of the changes that were introduced during the design team process. Other developers are gearing up to implement the gnap-00 draft as well, and it will be really interesting to try to plug these into each other to test interoperability at a first&nbsp;stage.</p><p>TxAuth and Transactional Authorization are functionally retired as names for this work, though the mailing list at IETF will remain txauth so you might still hear reference to that from time to time because of&nbsp;this.</p><p>And as stated above, OAuth 3.0 is not a real thing. Which is fine, since OAuth 2.0 isn’t going anywhere any time soon. The work on GNAP is shifting into a new phase that is really just starting. I think we’ve probably got a couple years of active work on this specification, and a few more years after that before anything we do really sees any kind of wide adoption on the internet. These things take a long time and a lot of work, and it’s my hope to see a diverse and engaged group building things&nbsp;out!</p>

 Interesting new project from SQLite creator D. Richard Hipp. Pikchr is a new mini language for describing visual diagrams, designed to be embedded in Markdown documentation. It's already enabled for the SQLite forum. Implementation is a no-dependencies C library and output is SVG.

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the close of <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/transmute_closes_2m_seed_round_from_moonshots_capital_tmv_kerr_tech_investments/prweb17487962.htm">Transmute’s $2 million series seed round</a> led by Moonshots Capital, and joined by TMV, Kerr Tech Investments and several strategic angels.</p><p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> has gained momentum on our mission to be the trusted data exchange platform for global trade. As a byproduct of the pandemic, the world is collectively facing persistent supply chain disruption and unpredictability. This coupled with increasing traceability regulations is driving an urgency for importers to fortify their supply chains. COVID-19 especially has highlighted the need for preventing counterfeit goods and having certainty about your suppliers (and their suppliers).</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/"></a>Transmute Co-founders, Karyl Fowler &amp; Orie Steele @ SXSW&nbsp;2019<p>Transmute’s software is upgrading trade documentation today to give importers a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic, global marketplace. Leveraging decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) tech with existing cloud-based systems, Transmute is able to offer digital product and supplier credentials that are traceable across an entire logistics ecosystem. From point of origin to end customer, we are unlocking unprecedented visibility into customers’ supplier networks.</p><blockquote>Disrupting a highly regulated and old-fashioned industry is complex, and an intentional first step in our go-to-market strategy has been balancing both the needs of regulators and commercial customers.</blockquote><p>This is why we’re incredibly proud to join forces with our lead investors at <a href="https://medium.com/leadership-prevails">Moonshots Capital</a>, a VC firm focused on investing in extraordinary leaders. We look forward to growing alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyperdew/">Kelly Perdew</a> (our newest Board of Directors member) and his founding partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unleashcraig/">Craig Cummings</a>. They’re a team of military veterans and serial entrepreneurs with extensive success selling into government agencies and enterprises.</p><p>We are equally proud to be joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-hadjipateras-64614670/">Marina Hadjipateras</a> and the team at <a href="http://www.trailmix.vc/">TMV</a>, a New York-based firm focused on funding pioneering, early-stage founders. Between their commitment to diverse teams, building sustainable futures and their deep expertise in global shipping and logistics, we feel more than ready to take on global trade with this&nbsp;firm.</p><p>The support of Kerr Tech Investments, led by Josh and Michael Kerr, further validates our company’s innovative approach to data exchange. <a href="https://joshkerr.com/">Josh</a> is a seasoned entrepreneur, an e-signature expert and has been advising us since Transmute’s inception.</p><p>Closing our seed round coincides with another exciting announcement: our recent launch of Phase II work with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science &amp; Technology’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) to enhance “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/08/news-release-dhs-awards-198k-raw-material-import-tracking">transparency, automation and security in processing the importation of raw materials</a>” like&nbsp;steel.</p><p>Our vision is more broad than just improving how trade gets done, and steel imports are just the beginning. We’re inserting revolutionary changes into the fabric of how enterprises manage product and supplier identity, effectively building a bridge — or a fulcrum, rather — towards new revenue streams and business models across industries.</p><p>Last — but absolutely not least — I want to give a personal shoutout to my core teammates; startups are a team sport, and our team is stacked! Tremendous congratulations as these backers will accelerate our progress in a huge way. And finally, thanks also to our stellar team of advisors who commit significant time coaching us through blind spots as we bring Transmute’s product to&nbsp;market.</p> Also, we’re&nbsp;Hiring! <p>Expanding our capacity to meet customer demand is our top nearterm priority. We’re adding a few <a href="https://angel.co/company/transmute-industries-1/jobs/1021940-senior-full-stack-engineer">engineering</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/company/transmute-industries-1/jobs/1022038-product-manager">product</a> roles to our core team in Austin, TX, so <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">please apply</a> or spread the&nbsp;word!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-closes-2m-seed-round-a0a2e6c90467">Transmute Closes $2M Seed Round</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The goal here is to obsolesce this brilliant <a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice">poster</a> by <a href="https://despair.com/">Despair.com</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://despair.com/products/customer-disservice"></a></p>
<p>I got launched on that path a couple months ago, when I&nbsp;got this email from &nbsp;<a href="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:" title="mailto:The_New_Yorker@e-mail.condenast.com:">The_New_Yorker at e-mail.condenast.com:</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why did they “need” a “confirmation” to a subscription which, best I could recall, was last renewed early this year?</p>
<p>So I looked at the links.</p>
<p>The “renew,” Confirmation Needed” and “Discounted Subscription” links all go to a page with a URL that began with&nbsp;<a href="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp" title="https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs/N3/NYR/ob_renewal_prem.jsp">https://subscriptions.newyorker.com/pubs…</a>, followed by a lot of tracking cruft. Here’s a screen shot of that one, cut short of where one filled in a credit card number. Note the price:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was sure I had been paying $80-something per year, for years. As I also recalled, this was a price one could only obtain by calling the 800 number at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">NewYorker.com</a>.</p>
<p>Or somewhere. After digging around, I found it at<br>
&nbsp;<a href="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp" title="https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/account_summary.jsp">https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/N3/NYR/accoun…</a>, which is where the link to Customer Care under My Account on the NewYorker website goes. It also required yet another login.</p>
<p>So, when I told the representative at the call center that I’d rather not “confirm” a year for a “discount” that probably wasn’t, she said I could renew for the $89.99 I had paid in the past, and that the deal would be good&nbsp; through February of 2022. I said fine, let’s do that. So I gave her my credit card, said this was way too complicated, and added that a single simple subscription price would be better.&nbsp;She replied,&nbsp; “Never gonna happen.” Let’s repeat that:</p>
<p>Never gonna happen.</p>
<p>Then I got this by email:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This appeared to confirm the subscription I already had. To see if that was the case, I went back to the&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> website and looked under the Account Summary tab, where it said this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this means that I last renewed on February 3 of this year, and what I did on the phone in August was commit to paying $89.99/year until February 10 of 2022.</p>
<p>If that’s what happened, all my call did was extend my existing subscription. Which was fine, but why require a phone call for that?</p>
<p>And WTF was that “Account Confirmation Required” email about? I assume it was&nbsp;bait to switch existing subscribers into paying $50 more per year.</p>
<p>Then there was this, at the bottom of the Account summary page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This might explain why I stopped getting Vanity Fair, which I suppose I should still be getting.</p>
<p>So I clicked on”Reactivate&nbsp;and got a login page where the login I had used to get this far didn’t work.</p>
<p>After other failing efforts that I neglected to write down, I decided to go back to the New Yorker site and work my way back through two logins to the same page, and then click Reactivate one more time.&nbsp;Voila! ::::::</p>
<p></p>
<p>So now I’ve got one page that tells me I’m good to March 2021 next to a link that takes me to another page that says I ordered 12 issues last December and I can “start” a new subscription for $15 that would begin nine months ago. This is how one “reactivates” a subscription?&nbsp; OMFG.</p>
<p>I’m also not going into the hell of moving the print subscription back and forth between the two places where I live. Nor will I bother now, in October, to ask why I haven’t seen another copy of Vanity Fair. (Maybe they’re going to the other place. Maybe not. I don’t know, and I’m too weary to try finding out.)</p>
<p>I want to be clear here that I am not sharing this to complain. In fact, I don’t want&nbsp;The New Yorker,&nbsp; Vanity Fair, Wred, Condé Nast (their parent company) or&nbsp;<a href="http://buysub.com" title="http://buysub. ">buysub.com</a> to do a damn thing. They’re all <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fubar">FUBAR</a>. By design. (<a href="https://www.gapingvoidart.com/gallery/dinosaur/">Bonus link.</a>)</p>
<p>Nor do I want any action out of Spectrum, SiriusXM, Dish Network or the other subscription-based whatevers whose customer disservice systems have recently soaked up many hours of my life.</p>
<p>See, with too many subscription systems (especially ones for periodicals), FUBAR is the norm. A matter of course. Pro forma. Entrenched. A box outside of which nobody making, managing or working in those systems can think.</p>
<p>This is why, when an alien idea appears, for example from a loyal customer just wanting a single and simple damn price, the response is “Never gonna happen.”</p>
<p>This is also why the subscription fecosystem can only be turned into an ecosystem from the outside. Our side. The subscribers’ side.</p>
<p>I’ll explain how at <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, which we created for <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/">exactly that purpose</a>. Stay tuned for that.</p>

  <p>This week I built <code>evernote-to-sqlite</code> (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/16/building-evernote-sqlite-exporter/">Building an Evernote to SQLite exporter</a>), launched the <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/">Datasette Weekly newsletter</a>, worked on some scrapers and pushed out some small improvements to several other projects.</p>
 The Datasette Weekly newsletter 
<p>After procrastinating on it for several months I finally launched the new <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/">Datasette Weekly</a> newsletter!</p>
<p>My plan is to put this out once a week with a combination of news from the Datasette/Dogsheep/sqlite-utils ecosystem of tools, plus tips and tricks for using them to solve data problems.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/p/datasette-050-git-scraping-extracting">the first edition here</a>, which covers <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50">Datasette 0.50</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">git scraping</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/">sqlite-utils extract</a> and features <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> as the plugin of the week.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> because people I trust use it for their newsletters and I decided that picking an option and launching was more important than spending even more time procrastinating on picking the best possible newsletter platform. So far it seems fit for purpose, and it provides an export option should I decide to move to something else.</p>
 Writing scrapers with a Python+JavaScript hybrid 
<p>I've been writing some scraper code to help out with a student journalism project at Stanford. I ended up using <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">Selenium Python</a> running in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Historically I've avoided Selenium due to how weird and complex it has been to use in the past. I've now completely changed my mind: these days it's a really solid option for browser automation driven by Python thanks to <code>chromedriver</code> and <code>geckodriver</code>, which I recently learned can be <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/selenium_selenium-python-macos.md">installed using Homebrow</a>.</p>
<p>My preferred way of writing scrapers is to do most of the work in JavaScript. The combination of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector">querySelector()</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll">querySelectorAll()</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> and the new-to-me <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser">DOMParser</a> class makes light work of extracting data from any shape of HTML, and browser DevTools mean that I can interactively build up scrapers by pasting code directly into the console.</p>
<p>My big break-through this week was figuring out how to write scrapers as a Python-JavaScript hybrid. The Selenium <code>driver.execute_script()</code> and <code>driver.execute_async_script()</code> (<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/selenium_async-javascript-in-selenium.md">TIL</a>) methods make it trivial to feed execute chunks of JavaScript from Python and get back the results.</p>
<p>This meant I could scrape pages one at time using JavaScript and save the results directly to SQLite via <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html">sqlite-utils</a>. I could even run database queries on the Python side to skip items that had already been scraped.</p>
 csv-diff 1.0 
<p>I'm trying to get more of my tools past the 1.0 mark, mainly to indicate to potential users that I won't be breaking backwards compatibility without bumping them to 2.0.</p>
<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff">csv-diff</a> for my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/#csvdiff_18">San Francisco Trees project</a> last year. It produces human-readable diffs for CSV files.</p>
<p>The version 1.0 release notes are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff/releases/tag/1.0">as follows</a>:</p>
 
 New <code>--show-unchanged</code> option for outputting the unchanged values of rows that had at least one change. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff/issues/9">#9</a>
 
 Fix for bug with column names that contained a <code>.</code> character. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff/issues/7">#7</a>
 
 Fix for error when no <code>--key</code> provided - thanks, @MainHanzo. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff/issues/3">#3</a>
 
 CSV delimiter sniffer now <code>;</code> delimited files. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff/issues/6">#6</a>
 
 
 sqlite-utils 2.22 
<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-22">sqlite-utils 2.22</a> adds some minor features - an <code>--encoding</code> option for processing TSV and CSV files in encodings other than UTF-8, and more support for loading SQLite extensions modules.</p>
<p>Full release notes:</p>
 
 New <code>--encoding</code> option for processing CSV and TSV files that use a non-utf-8 encoding, for both the <code>insert</code> and <code>update</code> commands. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/182">#182</a>) 
 The <code>--load-extension</code> option is now available to many more commands. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/137">#137</a>) 
 
<code>--load-extension=spatialite</code> can be used to load SpatiaLite from common installation locations, if it is available. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/136">#136</a>) 
 Tests now also run against Python 3.9. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/184">#184</a>) 
 Passing <code>pk=["id"]</code> now has the same effect as passing <code>pk="id"</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/181">#181</a>) 
 
 Datasette 
<p>No new release yet, but I've landed some small new features to the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
<p>Inspired by the GitHub and WordPress APIs, Datasette's JSON API now supports <code>Link:</code> HTTP header pagination (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1014">#1014</a>).</p>
<p>This is part of my ongoing effort to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/782">redesign the default JSON format</a> ready for Datasette 1.0. I started a new plugin called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-json-preview">datasette-json-preview</a> to let me iterate on that format independent of Datasette itself.</p>
<p>Jacob Fenton suggested an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019">"Edit SQL" button on canned queries</a>. That's a great idea, so I built it - <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1019#issuecomment-708139822">this issue comment</a> links to some demos, e.g. <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/neighborhood_search?text=ber">this one here</a>.</p>
<p>I added an "x" button for clearing filters to the table page (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1016">#1016</a>) demonstrated by this GIF:</p>

   I've been using Evernote for over a decade, and I've long wanted to export my data from it so I can do interesting things with it. 
 Ideally I'd use their API for that, so I could continually export new notes via a cron. Unfortunately the API is implemented using Thrift (the only public API I've seen to use that) and my attempts to speak to it from Python have so far failed to get anywhere.

  <p>I've been using Evernote for over a decade, and I've long wanted to export my data from it so I can do interesting things with it.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd use their API for that, so I could continually export new notes via a cron. Unfortunately the API is implemented <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/so-api-together-evernote-and-thrift/">using Thrift</a> (the only public API I've seen to use that) and my attempts to speak to it from Python have so far <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1257743727264595968">failed to get anywhere</a>.</p>
<p>Last weekend I decided to try using their "Export notes" feature instead, and its <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/how-evernotes-xml-export-format-works/">ENEX XML format</a>.</p>
 ENEX - the Evernote XML export format 
<p>Select a note - or multiple notes - in the Evernote macOS desktop app, use the <code>File -&gt; Export Notes</code> menu item and Evernote will create a <code>Notes.enex</code> exported XML file.</p>
<p>These files can get BIG, because any images attached to your notes will be embedded as base64 encoded binary data within the XML. My export is 2.8GB!</p>
<p>When faced with unknown XML like this it's useful to get a high level overview of what tags are present. in 2009 I wrote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/xml-analyser">a Python script</a> for this - as part of this project I updated it for Python 3 and pushed <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xml-analyser/">a release to PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a subset of the output when run against my <code>Notes.enex</code> file (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/eb86bbdd953c2c1dba2007f43e689f2f">full output is here</a>).</p>
  {
    "note": {
        "attr_counts": {},
        "child_counts": {
            "content": 2126,
            "created": 2126,
            "note-attributes": 2126,

        },
        "count": 2126,
        "parent_counts": {
            "en-export": 2126
        }
    },

            "classifications": 51,
            "content-class": 387,
            "latitude": 1480,
            "longitude": 1480,
            "reminder-done-time": 2,
            "reminder-order": 2126,
            "reminder-time": 1,
            "source": 1664,
            "source-application": 423,
            "source-url": 85,
            "subject-date": 10
        },
        "count": 2126,
        "parent_counts": {
            "note": 2126
        }
    }
}  
<p>This shows me that every note is represented as a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element, and crucial metadata lives in children of a <code>&lt;note-attributes&gt;</code> child element.</p>
<p>(I thought I'd need to tweak the script for performance since it works by loading the entire file into memory, but my laptop has 32GB of RAM so it didn't even blink.)</p>
 ENEX limitations 
<p>I ran into some significant limitations while working with my ENEX export.</p>
 
 Notebooks are not represented in the file at all - you just get the notes. So I can't tell which recipes were in my "cooking" notebook. It's possible to work around this by manually exporting the notes from each notebook one at a time and storing them in separate export files. I didn't bother. 
 Some of the data in the file - the note content itself for example - consists of further blocks of XML embedded in CDATA. This means you have to run a nested XML parser for every note you process. 
 The notes XML <code>&lt;en-note&gt;</code> format is mostly XHTML, but includes custom <code>&lt;en-media hash="..."&gt;</code> tags where inline images should be displayed 
 Those inline images are CDATA encoded base64 strings. They don't include a hash, but I figured out that decoding the base64 string and then running it through MD5 generates the hash that is used in the corresponding <code>&lt;en-media&gt;</code> tag. 
 Notes in the export don't have any form of unique ID! 
 
<p>That last limitation - the lack of unique IDs - is a huge pain. It means that any export is by necessity a one-time operation - if you edit a note and attempt a re-export you will get a brand new record that can't be automatically used to update the previous one.</p>
<p>This is particularly frustrating because I know that Evernote assigns a GUID to each note - they just don't include them in the export file.</p>
 Writing an exporter 
<p>My <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools aims to liberate personal data from all kinds of different sources and convert it into SQLite, which means I can explore, query and visualize it using <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite">dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite</a> is my latest entry in that series.</p>
<p>I based it on <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/healthkit-to-sqlite">healthkit-to-sqlite</a> because that, too, has to deal with a multiple GB XML file. Both tools use the Python standard library's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#pull-api-for-non-blocking-parsing">XMLPullParser</a>, which makes XML elements available as a stream without needing to load the entire file into memory at once.</p>
<p>The conversion code <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/evernote-to-sqlite/blob/0.2/evernote_to_sqlite/utils.py">is here</a>. It ended up being relatively straight-forward, using <code>ElementTree</code> to extract data from the XML and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> to write it to a database.</p>
<p>It implements a progress bar by tracking the number of bytes that have been read from the underlying file XML.</p>
<p>One optimization: originally I created a single <code>resources</code> table with the resource metadata and a BLOB column containing the binary image contents.</p>
<p>This table was huge - over a GB - and had very poor performance for operations such as querying and faceting across unindexed columns - because any table scan had to work through MBs of binary data.</p>
<p>My personal Evernote notebook has around 2,000 resources. 2,000 rows of metadata should usually be very fast to query.</p>
<p>So... I split the binary data out into a two column <code>resources_data</code> table - <code>md5</code> primary key and a BLOB for <code>data</code>. This massively sped up queries against that <code>resources</code> table.</p>
<p>And it works! Running the following command produces a SQLite database file containing all of my notes, note metadata and embedded images:</p>
 <code>evernote-to-sqlite enex evernote.db MyNotes.enex
</code> 
 Serving up formatted notes 
<p>Figuring out the best way to serve up the note content in Datasette is still a work in progress - but I've hacked together a delightfully terrible way of doing this using a one-off plugin.</p>
<p>Datasette plugins are usually packaged and installed via PyPI, but there's <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/writing_plugins.html#writing-one-off-plugins">an alternative option</a> for plugins that don't warrant distribution: create a <code>plugins/</code> directory, drop in one or more Python files and start Datasette pointing <code>--plugins-dir</code> at that directory.</p>
<p>This is great for hacking on terrible ideas. Here's the <code>evernote.py</code> plugin I wrote in full:</p>
 from datasette import hookimpl
import jinja2

START = "&lt;en-note"
END = "&lt;/en-note&gt;"
TEMPLATE = """
&lt;div style="max-width: 500px; white-space: normal; overflow-wrap: break-word;"&gt;{}&lt;/div&gt;
""".strip()

EN_MEDIA_SCRIPT = """
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('en-media')).forEach(el =&gt; {
    let hash = el.getAttribute('hash');
    let type = el.getAttribute('type');
    let path = `/evernote/resources_data/${hash}.json?_shape=array`;
    fetch(path).then(r =&gt; r.json()).then(rows =&gt; {
        let b64 = rows[0].data.encoded;
        let data = `data:${type};base64,${b64}`;
        el.innerHTML = `&lt;img style="max-width: 300px" src="${data}"&gt;`;
    });
});
"""

@hookimpl
def render_cell(value, table):
    if not table:
        # Don't render content from arbitrary SQL queries, could be XSS hole
        return
    if not value or not isinstance(value, str):
        return
    value = value.strip()
    if value.startswith(START) and value.endswith(END):
        trimmed = value[len(START) : -len(END)]
        trimmed = trimmed.split("&gt;", 1)[1]
        # Replace those horrible double newlines
        trimmed = trimmed.replace("&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;", "&lt;br&gt;")
        return jinja2.Markup(TEMPLATE.format(trimmed))

@hookimpl
def extra_body_script():
    return EN_MEDIA_SCRIPT 
<p>This uses two <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html">Datasette plugin hooks</a>.</p>
<p><code>render_cell()</code> is called every time Datasette's interface renders the value of a column. Here I'm looking for the <code>&lt;en-note&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/en-note&gt;</code> tags and, if they are present, stripping them off and marking their inner content as safe to display using <code>jinja2.Markup()</code> (without this they would be automatically HTML esacped).</p>
<p><code>extra_body_script()</code> can be used to inject additional JavaScript at the bottom of the page. I'm injecting some particularly devious JavaScript which scans the page for Evernote's <code>&lt;en-media&gt;</code> tags and, if it finds any, runs a <code>fetch()</code> to get the base64-encoded data from Datasette and then injects that into the page as a 300px wide image element using a <code>data:</code> URI.</p>
<p>Like I said, this is a pretty terrifying hack! But it works just fine, and my notes are now visible inside my personal Datasette instance:</p>
<p></p>
 Bonus feature: search by OCR 
<p>An interesting feature of Evernote is that it runs cloud-based OCR against images in your notes, enabling you to search across the text contained within them.</p>
<p>It turns out the output of this OCR process is included in the export XML. It looks like this:</p>
  &lt;recoIndex
  docType="unknown"
  objType="image" objID="76dd28b07797cc9f3f129c4871c5293c" 
  engineVersion="7.0.24.1" 
  recoType="service" 
  lang="en" 
  objWidth="670" 
  objHeight="128"&gt;
  &lt;item x="26" y="52" w="81" h="29"&gt;
    &lt;t w="76"&gt;This&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="134" y="52" w="35" h="29"&gt;
    &lt;t w="79"&gt;is&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="196" y="60" w="37" h="21"&gt;
    &lt;t w="73"&gt;so&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="300" y="60" w="57" h="21"&gt;
    &lt;t w="71"&gt;can&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="382" y="54" w="79" h="27"&gt;
    &lt;t w="77"&gt;test&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="486" y="52" w="59" h="29"&gt;
    &lt;t w="82"&gt;the&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
  &lt;item x="570" y="54" w="59" h="25"&gt;
    &lt;t w="74"&gt;OCR&lt;/t&gt;
    &lt;t w="33"&gt;DeR&lt;/t&gt;
    &lt;t w="15"&gt;OCR!&lt;/t&gt;
    &lt;t w="14"&gt;OCR]&lt;/t&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/recoIndex&gt;  
<p>As far as I can tell an <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> gets multiple <code>&lt;t&gt;</code> elements only if the OCR wasn't 100% sure.</p>
<p><code>evernote-to-sqlite</code> creates a searchable <code>ocr</code> text field using values from that XML, so I can search my images in Datasette.</p>

<p>I been on a number of cruises (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/1104825">here’s one</a>) in the course of my work as a journalist, and I’ve enjoyed them all. I’ve also hung out at a similar number of colleges and universities, and have long found myself wondering how well the former might be a good metaphor for the latter. Both are expensive, well-branded and self-contained structures with a lot of specialized staff and overhead. Both are also vulnerable to pandemics, and in doomed cases their physical components turn out to be worth more than their institutional ones. John Naughton also <a href="https://johnnaughton.substack.com/p/monday-5-october-2020?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjQ1NDA1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3NDQ3NDk1LCJfIjoibUp0Q2IiLCJpYXQiOjE2MDIwMDI2MzEsImV4cCI6MTYwMjAwNjIzMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTMxOTk5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.GmIJtENeMvRcf_8fB2n40km_wTzmA63x6MKh1QlL30M">notes the resemblance</a>. But it’s Scott Galloway who runs all the way with it; first with <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/higher-ed-enough-already">Higher Ed: Enough Already</a>, and then with a long and research-filled post titled <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/uss-university/">USS University</a>, featuring this title graphic:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/uss-university/"></a></p>
<p>Those three schools are adrift across&nbsp;<a href="https://api.profgalloway.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/US_Higher_Ed_Update_073020.png">a 2×2</a> with low value&lt;—&gt;high value on the X axis and high vulnerability&lt;—&gt;low vulnerability on the Y axis. At the lower left are the low-value/high vulnerability schools in a quadrant Scott calls “challenged,” meaning “high admit rates, high tuition, low endowments, dependence on international students, and weak brand equity.” Among those are—</p>
 
 Adelphi 
 Brandeis 
 Bard 
 Dickenson 
 Dennison 
 Hofstra 
 Kent State 
 Kenyon 
 LIU 
 Mt. Holyoke 
 Old Dominion 
 Pace 
 Pacific 
 Robert Morris 
 Sarah Lawrence 
 Seton Hall 
 Skidmore 
 Smith 
 St. John’s (Maryland &amp; New Mexico) 
 The New School 
 Union 
 UC Santa Cruz 
 U Mass Dartmouth 
 Valparaiso 
 Wittenberg 
 
<p>— plus a plethora of mostly state-run “directional” schools (e.g. University of Somewhere at Somewhere).</p>
<p>The Hmm here is, How many have more value as real estate than as what they are today?</p>
<p>I started wondering in the same direction in May, when I posted&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/06/figuring-the-future/">Figuring the Future</a> and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/09/choose-one/">Choose One</a>. Both pivoted off&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-economic-outlook/">this 2×2</a> by <a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/">Arnold Kling</a>—</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/the-economic-outlook/"></a></p>
<p>On Arnold’s rectangle, D (Fragile/Inessential) is Scott’s “challenged” quadrant. What I’m wondering, now that school is in session and at least&nbsp;some results should be coming in (or at least trending in a direction), if any colleges or universities in that group (or in the other quadrants) are headed already toward their own&nbsp;Aliağa.</p>
<p>Thoughts? If so, let me know on Twitter (where I am <a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls">@dsearls</a>), Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/docsearls">here</a>) or by email (doc at searls dot com).&nbsp;I hope to have comments working again here soon, but for now they don’t, alas.</p>

 Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraud 



<p>Digital Identity in an Online WorldThe isolation of worldwide lockdowns this year have presented criminals with new opportunities for phishing, and this only adds to already existing trends in the rise of synthetic IDs, account takeover and SIM swap fraud. This panel will explore solutions which utilise digital identity to fight back against the fraudsters.</p>

<p>The data on this site is super interesting. Whatever is running the site is not great. It’s some sort of out of the box Microsoft thing including default loading animations.</p>

<p>But! It aims to be a sort of Wikipedia. I’ve signed up to be a contributor and I hope that this can be built on and be licensed for re-use.</p>

<p>I did a search for “Vancouver” and found only one entry, so my used cookbook collection may be able to add a handful more. It does say it only wants pre-1940 cookbooks, but it’s unclear why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It provides a bird’s-eye view of long-term trends in European and American cuisines, from shifting trade routes and dining habits to culinary fads. Search “cupcakes,” for example, and you’ll find the term may have first popped up in Mrs. Putnam’s Receipt Book And Young Housekeeper’s Assistant, a guide for ladies running middle-class households in the 1850s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Super interesting to me. Looking forward to see how this evolves.</p>

<p>IIF Annual Membership Meeting – Digital Identity panel</p>



<p>In the accelerated move to a digitalized world, new technology is changing how people are identified and what we know about them, in an environment where trust has to be built differently from physical interactions. As well as presenting opportunities for efficiency and access, this also drives debate about roles, responsibilities, standards, and privacy. These issues will grow as new technologies in data, sensors, 5G connected devices, and biometrics come online with platforms of systemic scale. This session will discuss how technology and market trends are changing the costs, responsibilities, business models, and opportunities in identity and authentication, and how financial services firms can build on compliance capabilities to create new services and revenue streams.</p>



<p>Tuesday, October 13,&nbsp;from&nbsp;1:00pm London / 2:00pm Madrid / 8:00pm Singapore / 9:00pm Tokyo (55 minutes)</p>



  Vivienne Artz, Chief Privacy Officer, Refinitiv  Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer, Monetary Authority of Singapore  Nat Sakimura, Chairman, OpenID Foundation  Victoria Roig, Head of Transformation Office, Santander (Moderator)

</h3>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the Python Package Index so that others can install and use your work.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist
   - todo/fix: check why summary can be nil/null
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->
<div class='wrap'>

 <p>
 In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  
   Py
  
  thon
  
   P
  
  ackage
  
   I
  
  ndex
 </a>
 so that others can install and use your work. Once the package is available on PyPI, anyone will be able to run
 <code>
  pip install
 </code>
 to install the package on their machine. This allows people to import your code into their own modules as a library, but you can also release command-line tools via PyPI; I will show you how to do both.
</p>
<p>
 
  note
 
 : these instructions are Mac and Linux centric. I don't think they would be much different, but I don't do much development work on Windows so I don't know the nuances of that platform.
</p>
 
 The Code
 
<p>
 This first thing you need is some code to publish! I have created a minimal project that you can use as a starting point. You can find the code
 <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/python-package-boilerplate">
  here
 </a>
 . Let's take a look.
</p>
<p>
 First let's walk through the folder structure:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9 
     
   
   
     
      <code>├── README.md
├── package_boilerplate
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── importable.py
├── requirements.txt
├── scripts
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── boilerplate-cli
├── setup.py
└── version.py
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 These are all of the files inside of the python package. First, we have a directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 . This directory contains all of the code for our module. All of the files outside of this directory are metadata for the package itself and are used in the package publishing process, for installing dependencies, and stuff like that. We'll go through the other files shortly.
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 is
 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">
  markdown
 </a>
 formatted text containing details about the package. This content is usually rendered as HTML and made visible in places like GitHub and PyPI.
</p>
<p>
 If we look inside of
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages">
  <code>
   __init__.py
  </code>
 </a>
 , we see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

def main():
        print(f"{fg('dark_orange')}{attr('bold')}You called me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 We're doing a couple of things here: &nbsp;first, we import a library called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colored/">
  colored
 </a>
 . Colored is a tool to colourize your program's terminal output. It's fun!
</p>
<p>
 So basically, this file will print some coloured text to the terminal if
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 is called. If you continue reading, you will see how we can publish this as a command-line tool through
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 !
</p>
<p>
 Next, let's look inside of
 <code>
  importable.py
 </code>
 :
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

print(f"{fg('orchid')}{attr('bold')}You imported me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Again, we're just print some coloured text to the terminal but this time we can import this code in an external module. The text will be printed as soon as the file is imported since the code is not contained in a function.
</p>
<p>
 Ok, so that is the logic of our program. Let's continue down the folder structure to see what else is needed to make this publishable.
</p>
<p>
 The next file is
 <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">
  requirements.txt
 </a>
 . If you've ever written a python module that depends on other external python packages, then you may be familiar with this file. The file is used to tell
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 which versions of which modules it should install all at once if you run
 <code>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 </code>
 . Python packages are no different; if they rely on dependencies,
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 needs to know what to install. We'll reference this file in
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Next, we have the
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 directory. The folder name doesn't matter and isn't required, but I prefer to keep things separate and organized. Inside of this folder we have a file called
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 . Notice how we don't give the file an extension like
 <code>
  .py
 </code>
 and we used the naming convention
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 instead of
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli
 </code>
 . This is because this is the file that will be installed as a command-line program in the users
 <code>
  PATH
 </code>
 . We want the the user to be able to invoke the program by running
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 and not
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli.py
 </code>
 because that is the expected convention for command-line programs.
</p>

      <code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from package_boilerplate import main

main()
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The first line is important because we have to tell the user's operating system what kind of code this it because it doesn't have a file extension. This is called a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">
  shebang
 </a>
 . Next we import the entrypoint into the program from
 <code>
  __init__.py
 </code>
 that we named
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 and we run the function.
</p>
<p>
 Calling this function kicks off our program! Right now it only prints text to the terminal, but it could be the entrypoint into a more complicated program. We will reference this file in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 section to make it available as a command-line program for the user.
</p>
<p>
 The most important part of this process is the
 <code>
  [setup.py](https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html)
 </code>
 file. This tells pip how to bundle the package and what all the settings and dependencies are.

        lineiter = (line.strip() for line in open(filename))
        return [line for line in lineiter if line and not line.startswith("#")]


if __name__ == "__main__":
        setup(
                name=PACKAGE_NAME,
                version=VERSION,
                packages=find_packages(),
                install_requires=parse_requirements("requirements.txt"),
                python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3",
                scripts=["scripts/boilerplate-cli"],
                description="This is a description.",
                long_description=long_description,
                long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
        )
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 First we import a few utilities called
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 .
 <code>
  runpy
 </code>
 is built into python, but
 <code>
  setuptools
 </code>
 needs to be installed which we will go over in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next, we get the python metadata out of the file
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 and obtain the current version number
 <code>
  VERSION
 </code>
 . This file just contains the current version number of the package you are publishing. We'll go over why it's split into its own file in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next,
 <code>
  long_description
 </code>
 is pulled out of the content from
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 . Using the content from the readme means that this description only needs to live in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Then, I've added a helper function called
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 . The python
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 format expects that
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 property contains a list of dependencies that this package relies on. Since it's burdensome to maintain a
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 file with your dependencies as well as the dependencies in a list here, this
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 function simple imports the dependencies from
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 so that you only need to maintain them in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, we call
 <code>
  setup
 </code>
 with some values to define the package. The section that specifies
 <code>
  packages=find_packages()
 </code>
 is pointing to the directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 and is discovered automatically by this function. Name and version are used in the PyPI directory listing and also are what people reference when they want to install the package.
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 pulls in the list of requirements from the
 <code>
  requirement.txt
 </code>
 file.
 <code>
  python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3"
 </code>
 is the version of python that the user must have installed. And finally,
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 is where you specify the command line program that should be installed for the user.
</p>
<p>
 There are other values that you should set as well such as
 <code>
  description
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  author
 </code>
 . You can read more about the setup values available
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html">
  here
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The last file,
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 is quite small. This file is used for two things: first, it is imported in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 module above to use as the package version; and second, the version value is stored in the
 <code>
  __version__
 </code>
 attribute.
 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification">
  This is recommend
 </a>
 so that the package version can be discovered programatically.
</p>
<p>
 
  A tip
 
 : as you are working, you can install your package locally before you even publish it. This way, you will know that it works before submitting it to PyPI. To install the package locally, you can run
 <code>
  pip install -e .
 </code>
 in the package directory.
</p>
 
 Publishing Your Package
 
<p>
 So you've written your package and you want to publish it! We're almost there. There are just a few more steps to publish your package.
</p>
<p>
 The first thing will want to do is install a tool called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">
  twine
 </a>
 by running
 <code>
  pip install twine
 </code>
 . Twine is a tool for publishing Python packages on PyPI. Then, we also need to install
 <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
  setuptools
 </a>
 since we are using it in our setup script:
 <code>
  pip install setuptools
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Now, we need to create a
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package">
  distribution package
 </a>
 that we will publish. To do this, run: &nbsp;
 <code>
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
 </code>
 which will create
 <code>
  build
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  dist
 </code>
 directories.
</p>
<p>
 Once the build has completed, we can check for any errors or warnings using
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 . Run
 <code>
  twine check dist/*
 </code>
 &nbsp;to check the distribution package for errors. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Checking distribution dist/package_boilerplate-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl: Passed
Checking distribution dist/package-boilerplate-1.0.0.tar.gz: Passed
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Once this is done, we want to publish our package to the PyPI test site. We can publish to
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org">
  test.pypi.org
 </a>
 before we publish to the real index to make sure everything looks good! To do this, we can instruct
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 to use a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
 </code>
</p>
<p>
 If we run this now, we will see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Enter your username:
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Looks like we need to create an account! So head over to the
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org/account/register/">
  registration page
 </a>
 for the PyPI test site and create an account. If you run the command again and enter your username and password hopefully you should see:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Uploading distributions to https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 If you do, congratulations! You have successfully published your package!
</p>
<p>
 
  Note:
 
 make sure your package name is unique!
</p>
<p>
 All that remains is to publish your package to the official
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  pypi.org
 </a>
 . To do this, you just need to create another account there and publish your package without specifying a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload dist/*
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Installing Your Package
 
<p>
 Now that your package is installed, I bet you want to install it to see how it works! Let's install our package from the PyPI test index:
 <code>
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . In the future, if we don't provide the
 <code>
  --index-url
 </code>
 parameter, then we would be requesting a package from the official index. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5
6 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Looking in indexes: https://test.pypi.org/simple/

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 If so, then the package is installed! So let's use it. Remember that command-line program we created? Well now we should be able to run it from anywhere by calling invoking the name of the script:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>$ boilerplate-cli
</code>

 </a>
 And the text is orange like we wanted! What if we wanted to import the module in a different project? Let's try:

 </a>
 It works! And we even get the coloured text.
</p>
<p>
 Once you publish your package to the official PyPI index, you will be able to install the package by running
 <code>
  pip install package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . Of course, you would want to choose a different name for the package throughout the process and use that here.
</p>
 
<p>
 I hope this guide is helpful. If something doesn't make sense, please let me know.

 In building evernote-to-sqlite I dusted off an ancient (2009) project I built that scans through an XML file and provides a summary of what elements are present in the document and how they relate to each other. I've now packaged it up as a CLI app and published it on PyPI.

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.jonudell.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

   I released Datasette 0.50 this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50">Datasette 0.50</a> this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.</p>
 The column actions menu 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>The key new feature in this release is the column actions menu on the table page (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/891">#891</a>). This can be used to sort a column in ascending or descending order, facet data by that column or filter the table to just rows that have a value for that column.</p></blockquote>
<p>The table page is the most important page within Datasette: it's where users interact with database tables.</p>
<p>Prior to 0.50 users could sort those tables by clicking on the column header. If they wanted to sort in descending order they had to click it, wait for the table to reload and then click it a second time.</p>
<p>In 0.50 I've introduced a new UI element which I'm calling the column actions menu. Here's an animation showing it in action on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">facetable</a> demo table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now the menu can be used to sort ascending, sort descending or add the column to the current set of select facets. If a column has any blank values on the current page a menu option to "Show not-blank rows" appears too - you can try that out on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/sortable">sortable</a> table.</p>
<p>I plan to extend this with more options in the future. I'd also like to make it a documented plugin extension point, so plugins can add their own column-specific actions. I need to figure out a JavaScript equivalent of the Python pluggy plugins mechanism first though, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983">issue 983</a>.</p>
 datasette.client 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>Plugin authors can use the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-client">datasette.client</a> object to make internal HTTP requests from their plugins, allowing them to make use of Datasette's JSON API. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/943">#943</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>In building the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin I ran into an interesting requirement. I wanted to provide efficient <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/#Keyset_pagination">keyset pagination</a> within the GraphQL schema, which is actually quite a complex things to implement.</p>
<p>Datasette already has a robust implementation of keyset pagination, but it's tangled up in the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.50/datasette/views/table.py#L742-L770">the internal TableView class</a>.</p>
<p>It's not available as a documented, stable Python API... but it IS available via the Datasette JSON API.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if Datasette plugins could make direct calls to the same externally facing, documented HTTP JSON API that Datasette itself exposes to end users?</p>
<p>That's what the new <code>datasette.client</code> object does. It's a thin wrapper around <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/async/">HTTPX AsyncClient</a> (the excellent new Python HTTP library which takes the Requests API and makes it fully asyncio compliant) which dispatches requests internally to Datasette's ASGI application, without any of the network overhead of an external HTTP request.</p>
<p>One of my goals for Datasette 1.0 is to bring the externally facing JSON API to full, documented, stable status.</p>
<p>The idea of Python plugins being able to efficiently use that same API feels really elegant to me. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of this in my own plugins.</p>

 Deploying Datasette documentation 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying">Deploying Datasette</a> documentation with guides for deploying Datasette on a Linux server <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-systemd">using systemd</a> or to hosting providers <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-buildpacks">that support buildpacks</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">#514</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/997">#997</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The buildpack documenation was inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/digitalocean_datasette-on-digitalocean-app-platform.md">my experiments</a> with the new <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/">DigitialOcean App Platform</a> this week. App Platform is a Heroku-style PaaS hosting platform that implements the <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> standard which emerged based on Heroku's architecture a few years ago.</p>

<p>I hadn't realized quite how easy it is to run a custom Python application (such as Datasette) using buildpacks - it's literally just a GitHub repository with two single-line files in it, requirements.txt and Procfile - the buildpacks mechanism detects the requirements.txt and configures a Python environment automatically.</p>

<p>I deployed my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo">simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo</a> repo on DigitalOcean, Heroku and <a href="https://scalingo.com/">Scalingo</a> to try this out. It worked on all three providers with no changes - and all three offer continuous deployment against GitHub where any changes to that repository automatically trigger a deployment (optionally guarded by a CI test suite).</p>

<p>Since I was creating a deployment documenatation page I decided to finally address <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">issue 514</a> and document how I've used systemd to deploy Datasette on some of my own projects. I'm very keen to hear from people who try out this recipe so I can continue to improve it over time.</p>
<p>This is part of a series: see also the annotated release notes for Datasette <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">0.44</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">0.45</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/">0.49</a>.</p>

  <p>Git scraping is the name I've given a scraping technique that I've been experimenting with for a few years now. It's really effective, and more people should use it.</p>
<p>The internet is full of interesting data that changes over time. These changes can sometimes be more interesting than the underlying static data - The <a href="https://twitter.com/nyt_diff">@nyt_diff Twitter account</a> tracks changes made to New York Times headlines for example, which offers a fascinating insight into that publication's editorial process.</p>
<p>We already have a great tool for efficiently tracking changes to text over time: Git. And <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> (and other CI systems) make it easy to create a scraper that runs every few minutes, records the current state of a resource and records changes to that resource over time in the commit history.</p>
<p>Here's a recent example. Fires continue to rage in California, and the <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE website</a> offers an <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">incident map</a> showing the latest fire activity around the state.</p>
<p>Firing up the Firefox Network pane, filtering to requests triggered by XHR and sorting by size, largest first reveals this endpoint:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents">https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents</a></p>
<p>That's a 241KB JSON endpoints with full details of the various fires around the state.</p>
<p>So... I started running a git scraper against it. My scraper lives in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">simonw/ca-fires-history</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Every 20 minutes it grabs the latest copy of that JSON endpoint, pretty-prints it (for diff readability) using <code>jq</code> and commits it back to the repo if it has changed.</p>
<p>This means I now have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commits/main">commit log</a> of changes to that information about fires in California. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commit/7b0f42d4bf198885ab2b41a22a8da47157572d18">example commit</a> showing that last night the Zogg Fires percentage contained increased from 90% to 92%, the number of personnel involved dropped from 968 to 798 and the number of engines responding dropped from 82 to 59.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the scraper is entirely contained in a single GitHub Actions workflow. It's in a file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">.github/workflows/scrape.yml</a> which looks like this:</p>
  name: Scrape latest data

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '6,26,46 * * * *'

jobs:
  scheduled:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out this repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Fetch latest data
      run: |-
        curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents | jq . &gt; incidents.json
    - name: Commit and push if it changed
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git push  
<p>That's not a lot of code!</p>
<p>It runs on a schedule at 6, 26 and 46 minutes past the hour - I like to offset my cron times like this since I assume that the majority of crons run exactly on the hour, so running not-on-the-hour feels polite.</p>
<p>The scraper itself works by fetching the JSON using <code>curl</code>, piping it through <code>jq .</code> to pretty-print it and saving the result to <code>incidents.json</code>.</p>
<p>The "commit and push if it changed" block uses a pattern that commits and pushes only if the file has changed. I wrote about this pattern in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/github-actions_commit-if-file-changed.md">this TIL</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of repositories running git scrapers now. I've been labeling them with the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping topic</a> so they show up in one place on GitHub (other people have started using that topic as well).</p>
<p>I've written about some of these <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gitscraping/">in the past</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Sep/10/scraping-irma/">Scraping hurricane Irma</a> back in September 2017 is when I first came up with the idea to use a Git repository in this way. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/10/fires-in-the-north-bay/">Changelogs to help understand the fires in the North Bay</a> from October 2017 describes an early attempt at scraping fire-related information. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/">Generating a commit log for San Francisco’s official list of trees</a> remains my favourite application of this technique. The City of San Francisco maintains a frequently updated CSV file of 190,000 trees in the city, and I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history/find/master">a commit log</a> of changes to it stretching back over more than a year. This example uses my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff">csv-diff</a> utility to generate human-readable commit messages. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/">Tracking PG&amp;E outages by scraping to a git repo</a> documents my attempts to track the impact of PG&amp;E's outages last year by scraping their outage map. I used the GitPython library to turn the values recorded in the commit history into a database that let me run visualizations of changes over time. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jan/21/github-actions-cloud-run/">Tracking FARA by deploying a data API using GitHub Actions and Cloud Run</a> shows how I track new registrations for the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in a repository and deploy the latest version of the data using Datasette. 
 
<p>I hope that by giving this technique a name I can encourage more people to add it to their toolbox. It's an extremely effective way of turning all sorts of interesting data sources into a changelog over time.</p>

<p></p><p>In California, anyone can put an initiative on the ballot that amends the state constitution, proposes a bond measure, or even changes legislation - as long as you <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/how-qualify-initiative">acquire the minimum number of signatures of support</a>. As a result, there are always an eclectic set of propositions on every California statewide ballot. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_2020_ballot_propositions">This year, there are twelve</a>.</p><p>Particularly because there are a few ballot initiatives this year that touch on my areas of expertise, I thought it might be useful to discuss how I'm thinking about each one in public. This is one progressive technologist's voter guide; if you have alternative opinions, I'd love to hear them.</p> Proposition 14 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote authorizes $5.5 billion in bonds earmarked for stem cell research in the state, extending previous funding that was created by an initiative in 2004.</p><p>Critics say that the original initiative was created when there was a ban on federal stem cell research, and this has now outlived its usefulness. I disagree. The existing funding was mostly used across UC campuses, including UCSF, and has funded ground-breaking research and treatments, including for spina bifida and Parkinson's disease.</p><p>UCSF is one of the most important medical research institutions in the world, and I believe we should continue to allow this funding.</p> Proposition 15 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote increases funding for schools, public colleges, and local government services by increasing taxes on certain kinds of commercial and industrial property. The taxes are limited in scope and will mostly be paid by large, wealthy corporations, while providing tax exemptions for small businesses. This seems like a broadly positive amendment.</p> Proposition 16 - Yes <p>In 1996, affirmative action when hiring for public employment, public education, and public contracting was banned through another state proposition. This ballot initiative repeals that rule and allows diversity to be considered in the hiring process.</p><p>If this proposition passes, the state will be clear to start enacting affirmative action and diversity-based hiring initiatives, helping to make public positions more representative of the population.</p> Proposition 17 - Yes <p>Currently, people on parole for felony convictions don't have the right to vote. This constitutional amendment would give them that ability by restoring the right to vote once their prison term has been completed.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States">Felony disenfranchisement</a> is one of the most shameful aspects of criminal justice in the United States, which disproportionately affects marginalized people. The right to vote is a crucial part of any democracy. 19 other states return this right once a prison sentence is completed; we should do the same.</p> Proposition 18 - Yes <p>If you're going to be 18 at the time of an election, and therefore can vote in it, but you're only 17 at the time of the primary, this amendment would let you vote in the primary.</p><p>Without this amendment, 18 year olds effectively only get to participate in half of the election. I'm in favor.</p> Proposition 19 - No <p>This amendment would allow residents over 55, with disabilities, or who had to flee natural disasters to transfer their property tax assessments to more expensive properties three times. It also prevents these beneficial tax assessments from being carried over to inherited properties (either from parents or grandparents) when the inheritor doesn't use it as their primary residence.</p><p>On one hand, I'm in favor of closing the inheritance loophole, which disproportionately benefits wealthy families. I also want to help the over 55s, people with disabilities, and victims of natural disasters.</p><p>On the other, it's sponsored by realtor associations. For them, it's a cash windfall. It has the side effect of persisting existing inequalities. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-17/vote-no-on-proposition-19">As the Los Angeles Times editorial board says</a>: "Proposition 19 would just expand the inequities in California’s property tax system. It would grossly benefit those who were lucky enough to buy a home years ago and hold onto it as values skyrocketed. It would give them a huge tax break and greater buying power in an already expensive real estate market. It would skew tax breaks further away from people who don’t own a home or who may be struggling to buy one."</p><p>On balance, I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 20 - No <p>This state statute adds crimes to the list for which early parole is restricted - and removes the incentive to join rehabilitation programs, which is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. My vote is a hard "no".</p> Proposition 21 - Yes <p>This would allow local government to impose rent control on buildings that were first occupied 15 years ago, except when it's owned by a landlord that owns no more than two buildings in total. In other words, small, independent landlords are not affected; large private sector builders are.</p><p>Contrary to a recently-popular narrative, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/rent-control-housing-crisis-affordability-supply">rent control works</a>. It doesn't constrain housing supply and it helps keep rents low, allowing a significant percentage of families to remain in their homes where it is enacted. It protects lower-income people. And it makes our cities more diverse.</p> Proposition 22 - No <p>Uber has spent $50 million to promote this statute; Lyft has spent $48 million; DoorDash $47 million; Instacart $27 million; Postmates $10 million. Allowing their gig workers to be classified as private contractors protects their businesses.</p><p>That's because their businesses heavily depend on paying gig workers poverty pay with no benefits.</p><p>Labor rights were hard-won. At a time when more people are struggling, it's absurd to allow this kind of backslide. In addition to removing protections that these workers are entitled to by law, proposition 22 would also remove their right to organize.</p><p>If a business can only succeed because it treats people badly, it's a bad business. Hard pass.</p> Proposition 23 - No <p>If this statute passes, dialysis clinics will need to have an attending physician or nurse practitioner. They will also need to report information about infections, and won't be able to turn people away based on type of insurance.</p><p>I care deeply about the state of dialysis centers. Three times a week, my mother spends half her day in one. She reports that the staff want to unionize, but are afraid to. They're underpaid and overworked. One of her dialysis technicians lives in a tent.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>I heavily support unionization of dialysis centers. I would support a statute that mandated reporting of infection data. I support not being able to turn people away because of insurance. But I can't back the physician requirement. Despite sounding good, it wouldn't actually result in a meaningful increase to the quality of care.</p><p>Worse than that, it appears to be a tactic by the healthcare workers' union to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Vote-no-on-Prop-23-a-rehash-of-ugly-15544239.php">blackmail dialysis companies into accepting unionization</a>. Unionization is important and could really help these workers! But using the state initiative system as a pressure tactic is an unfortunate tactic. I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 24 - No <p>Privacy is core to a free society. We have accidentally built a global surveillance apparatus as part of building business models that depend on building detailed profiles on each one of us. In the wake of Europe's GDPR, which forced tech companies worldwide to change their practices, California passed the CCPA. It's a great step forward that will be joined by other state laws, and ultimately form the basis of federal protections.</p><p>In contrast, this statute is fundamentally disingenuous. In the guise of increasing protections, it actually makes exemptions and cuts out requirements for companies like Facebook. <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/08/personal-information-measure-on-the-ballot-would-allow-redlining-and-hurt-small-businesses-of-color/">It creates a loophole for credit agencies.</a> It allows for digital redlining, allowing credit agencies and assessors to penalize people of color. And it allows privacy to be demoted to an add-on paid-for service tier, rather than a core right that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>For me, perhaps the most important changes are jurisdictional. Currently, the CCPA applies to any Californian resident, wherever they happen to be. Proposition 24 erodes this protection and allows privacy to be violated as soon as the resident physically leaves the state. It also removes the ability for you to tell your web browser to let every site know not to sell your data; under Prop 24, you would need to manually let every site know.</p><p>I can't endorse it or vote for it.</p> Proposition 25 - No <p>Cash bail is discriminatory. American judges are <a href="https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/08/17/the_bail_system_is_racist_and_unjust_it_needs_to_be_reformed_110764.html">set higher bail amounts for Black individuals</a>, despite their being more likely to come from lower-income backgrounds, meaning they are far more likely to serve pretrial time. Cash bail must go.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's just one symptom of a system that is, in itself, discriminatory. It's not enough to remove cash bail; we also have to make sure it's replaced by a system that also removes the underlying systemic discrimination. The cash requirement is a problem, but our racist criminal justice system is the underlying tragedy.</p><p>For people who don't understand it, software can seem like a magically unbiased system. It's a computer, after all, which doesn't hold its own opinions. How can it possibly be biased?</p><p>Of course, software is written by people, and is a reflection of their biases, beliefs, and blind spots. Additionally, machine learning as popularly implemented is an algorithm that depends on an enormous corpus of information about choices that humans have made in the past. The machine simply extrapolates and makes new decisions based on those choices. It's as biased as the data is - and if that data comes from our criminal justice system, it's very biased indeed.</p><p>So replacing cash bail with a predictive algorithm isn't just a bad idea - it's a spectacularly harmful one that entrenches racist biases in a way that makes them beyond reproach.</p><p>Software must never make judicial decisions. The truth is, it can't: the decisions are instead made with impunity by the people who write it, often unscrutinized, and by the people who are responsible for the underlying data.</p><p>Proposition 25 must not be allowed to pass, and all measures and legislation like it must be soundly defeated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tiffanytertipes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Tiffany Tertipes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/vote?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

   Are we stuck with Surveillance Capitalism?
I hope not. 
 But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and
help rather than hurt our mental health?

  <p>Are we stuck with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>?
I hope not.</p>
<p>But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and
help rather than hurt our mental health?</p>
<p>Here are three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenarios</a> how we could get
out.</p>
 Scenario 1: Regulation Bites 
<p>Building on the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
and buoyed by a growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sovereignty">data sovereignty movement</a>
supported by the political right and left, the European Union intensifies regulating
cyberspace, and in short order:</p>
 
 disallows all businesses to move any personal information pertaining to its residents
to data centers outside of the European Union; 
 broadly disallows user tracking except for very narrow circumstances; in particular,
cross-site and cross-app user tracking becomes prohibited; advertising networks cannot
target audiences smaller than 100,000 members any more; 
 requires all social and communications apps to implement full data portability
(including loss-less transmission to a new provider) similar to phone number portability. 
 
<p>The dominant, American social networking giants focus their efforts in the courts to roll
back these regulations, but in the meantime, nimble European upstarts simply copy the feature
sets of the dominant platforms and implement them consistent with European regulations.
Local politicians mention these apps at every opportunity.</p>
<p>By marketing their products through schools, privacy-conscious German parents switch over
an entire new generation of users to the European apps, and when e-government initiatives
enable citizens to much more easily and securely interact with governments through the new apps,
the network effect starts hurting instead of favoring the American surveillance platforms.</p>
<p>As integration has become easy, a European startup figures out how to game-ify fact checking on this
new open platform, and on-line misinformation drops rapidly. This increases user engagement
and user confidence, and few people ever want to go back to the old apps.</p>
<p>Other countries outside the EU concerned about data sovereignty have been watching
carefully and quickly follow the European model, through regulation and targeted industrial
policy. Facebook and friends are playing catch-up and are forced to play by the new rules
to keep at least some of their user base in those countries.</p>
<p>And when they started to market their apps internationally, even large swathes of the
American population moved over, because they don’t want to be surveilled either.</p>
 Scenario 2: A Global Disinvestment Campaign Leads to a Vibrant Good Technology Market 
<p>With the slogan “Facebook is just as bad as burning oil”, digital rights activists
have partnered with veterans of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment#Divestment_for_social_goals">divestiture campaigns</a>
against South African apartheid, tobacco and fossil fuels for an international
public relations campaign targeting investment and retirement funds that invest in
companies monetizing surveillance.</p>
<p>Being reminded of the impact of previous disinvestment campaigns and sensing a business
opportunity, fund managers globally are rapidly rolling out new niche funds that promise
to only invest in companies that use personal data responsibly. Their initial target markets
are minorities and parents saving for retirement who are concerned about their kids’ safety
when using technology.</p>
<p>Upstart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VCs</a> jump on the opportunity that
this new, focused capital represents and funnel it via special-purpose “Good Tech Only” venture
funds to eager entrepreneurs world-wide to build next-generation social networking,
commerce and virtual/augmented reality companies, without fear that VCs will pressure them
to monetize customer data anyway when the company hits a difficult patch.</p>
<p>Having made a clean break from the surveillance business model, these upstarts are able
to innovate rapidly both on business model and technology. For example, enabled by new
business models, interoperability with other vendors has now become a value driver rather
than a leak in the enterprise’ <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp">moat</a>.
This completely changes the dynamics of the marketplace.</p>
<p>As a result, entirely new product categories no longer prevented by vendors’ data hoarding
strategies explode on the scene, including, for example, much better targeted advertising
because users can volunteer personal data without fear of privacy violations, proactive
maintenance of consumer products by an army of service providers no longer inhibited by
hermetically sealed
<a href="https://upon2020.com/blog/2015/03/lets-create-the-internet-of-our-own-things-indieiot/">cloud castle</a>
products, and far more reuse and upcycle of previously discarded products.</p>
<p>As the Good Tech brand rises, and unprecedented features become available, more and more
technology users are willing to make a clean break with surveillance legacy platforms,
and shame their friends to move from the legacy social networks into moving to Good Tech as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the legacy vendors practicing surveillance capital face shrinking users bases,
less access to capital, and structurally cannot compete with the new generation of
Good Tech companies.</p>
 Scenario 3: Frustrated Users and Open-Source Developers Start Cooperating for Mutual Benefit 
<p>It started small, with a few technically-competent digital rights activists pooling
their expertise and a little bit of money to operate their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> server, so they could stay
in touch just like on Twitter, but without an unaccountable third party in the loop.
(Note: this, of course, already <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">has happened</a>; there are many
Mastodon deployments like this all around the world, some of which have already progressed
further along the lines outlined below.)</p>
<p>As interest and user numbers grew, the previously informal collaborations started to be
formalized: users not contributing their labor would pay a monthly fee, from which systems
administrators would be paid to keep the deployment up and running reliably. Over time,
the initial collaborative decision making process for the project
morphed into a formal cooperative governance structure in which all stakeholders –
users and maintainers – have equal rights. They decided on all matters affecting the
project democratically, although different cooperatives employ different styles of
governance including direct, liquid and representative democracy.</p>
<p>Soon users started to ask for additional tools provided to them in a similar manner,
like document sharing, calendaring, e-mail, and more. Accountants would ask: “Microsoft
charges me $6.99 per month to access Excel. If I pay the same amount to the coop, can’t
we host something like Excel ourselves, and I can be certain that my clients’ financials
stay private instead of whatever Microsoft does?” Some other users in the coop declared
that they had similar needs, and banded together, money in hand, to fund a project.
Which attracted open-source software developers who committed to porting open-source
collaborative document editing software into the cooperative’s environment and keep it
maintained for a monthly fee paid for by its users.</p>
<p>Of course, the apps operated by the various cooperatives always interoperated, because that’s
what users want and no vendor subject to the coop’s rules has the opportunity (or desire)
to lock in anybody. So leaving one cooperative to join another became as simple as moving
banks today, with no money or data lost in the process.</p>
<p>Some projects didn’t work out. Some money was wasted. Some coops imploded. Some users left
because initially, the quality of the coops’ products was below the quality of social
networking products of today’s dominant internet platforms funded by billions of Wall Street
dollars. However, because the cooperative structure
relates the needs and wants of the users directly to the revenue opportunity of the vendors,
with no independent shareholders to satisfy, ultimately the match between needs and
features became much better than in pure capitalistic for-profit models, creating legions
of fanatically happy users and profitable vendors completely outside the need or desire
for surveillance capitalism.</p>
 Some final thoughts 
<p>Of course, there are other scenarios; elements of these scenarios could be combined in
different ways or shake out differently, and predictions are hard, particularly about
the future :-)</p>
<p>But there are people working on each of those scenarios today (myself included!), and it
is not obvious to me that those projects are doomed. In other words, they have promise!
How can we help them be more likely to succeed? Because I want out from surveillance
capitalism, and chances are, you do, too!</p>

 If you’ve ever worked on a large piece of software, I’m sure you’ve endured the pain of setting up a complex development environment. Installing and configuring a database, message broker, web server, worker processes, local smtp server, (and who knows what else!) is time consuming for every developer starting on a project. This guide will show you how to set up a docker development environment which will enable you and new developers to get up and running in minutes with even the most complex system. This will make your life much easier in the long run and get new developers up and running on the project much more quickly.
</p>
<p>
 In this guide, we’ll be using
 <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition">
  Docker Community Edition
 </a>
 and
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">
  Docker Compose
 </a>
 . You may want to read up on these tools a bit before proceeding.

 Installing Docker
 
<p>
 Grab Docker for your operating system
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community">
  here
 </a>
 . Docker is available for all modern operating systems. For most users, this will also include Docker Compose. Once installed, keep Docker running in the background to use Docker commands!
</p>
 
 Dockerfile Example
 
<p>
 Your
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">
  Dockerfile
 </a>
 is the blueprint for your container. You’ll want to use your Dockerfile to create your desired environment. This includes installing any language runtimes you might need and installing any dependencies your project relies on. Luckily, most languages have a
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from">
  base image
 </a>
 that you can inherit. We’ll get dig into this further with the Dockerfile example below.
</p>
<p>
 Your Dockerfile doesn’t need to include any instructions for installing a database, cache server, or other tools. Each container should be built around a single process. Other processes would normally be defined in other Dockerfiles but you don’t even need to worry about that; in this example, we use 3 readymade containers for our databases and message broker.
</p>

      <code># Inherit from node base image

# This is an alternative to mounting our source code as a volume.
# ADD . /app

# Install Yarn repository
RUN curl -sS http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
RUN echo "deb http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Install OS dependencies
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install yarn

# Install Node dependencies
RUN yarn install
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The Dockerfile above does a couple things: first, we inherit from the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/images/node">
  node
 </a>
 base image. This means that it includes the instructions from
 <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/581eebd097343c9f1c1ceb5260cd2ec770410e29/7.10/Dockerfile">
  that image’s Dockerfile
 </a>
 (including whatever base image it inherits from). Second, I install the
 <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">
  Yarn
 </a>
 package manager since I prefer it over the default NodeJs package manager. Note that while my preferred language here is NodeJs, this guide is language independent. Set up your container for whatever language runtime you prefer to work in.
</p>
<p>
 Give it a try and run
 <code>
  docker-compose build
 </code>
 and see what happens.
</p>
 
 Docker Compose Example
 
<p>
 A few sections ago, I mentioned Docker Compose which is a tool to declaratively define your container formation. This means that you can define multiple different process types which all run concurrently in different containers and communicate with one another via http. Docker makes exposing interfaces between containers easier by using what they call
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/service-links/">
  links
 </a>
 . The beauty here is that it’s as simple as working with multiple processes on single machine but you can be sure that there are no tightly coupled components that might not work in a production environment!

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Let’s walk through this example:
</p>
<p>
 We have 7 different containers in our formation:
 
  web
 
 ,
 
  clock
 
 ,
 
  worker
 
 ,
 
  shell
 
 ,
 
  postgres
 
 ,
 
  rabbitmq
 
 , and
 
  redis
 
 . That’s a lot! In a production environment, these processes might each run on separate physical servers; or, the processes all might run on a single machine.
</p>
<p>
 Notice how the web, clock, worker, and shell containers are all built from the current directory. So each of those 4 processes all run on the container that we defined in our Dockerfile. The postgres, rabbitmq, and redis containers, on the other hand, are built from prebuilt images which are found on the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/">
  Docker Store
 </a>
 . Building containers for these tools from images is much quicker than installing each of the tools on your local machine.
</p>
<p>
 Take a look at the
 <code>
  volumes
 </code>
 key. Here, we mounted our current directory at
 <code>
  /app
 </code>
 . Then the
 <code>
  working_dir
 </code>
 key indicates that all commands shall be run relative to this directory.
</p>
<p>
 Ok. Now, take a look at the
 <code>
  links
 </code>
 key present on the locally built containers. This exposes a network interface between this container and the containers listed. Notice how we use the name of the link as the hostname in our environment variables. In this example, we link the containers and then we expose the uri for each of our linked services as environment variables.
</p>
<p>
 Try running one of the services: run the command
 <code>
  docker-compose up web
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Write your application code
 
<p>
 Ok, our server architecture includes 3 process types that run your application code; we have our web process that is responsible for serving web requests and pushing work to a job queue; we have our worker process that is responsible for pulling jobs off the queue and doing the work; and we have our clock process is effectively a cron runner that pushes work onto our job queue.
</p>
<p>
 Our architecture also includes 3 other services that you commonly see in web server architecture: a Postgres database, a Redis datastore, and a RabbitMQ message broker.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s a minimal implementation of the 3 aforementioned processes that also showcase the usage of our 3 data backends:

        });
        console.log("Queuing new job!");
    });
});

cron.run();

<p>
 There are example endpoints for each of the different components of our architecture. Visiting
 <code>
  /postgres/:something
 </code>
 will insert something into the postgres database and render a view containing all of the contents. Visiting
 <code>
  /redis
 </code>
 will count the number of visits to that page and display the count. Visiting
 <code>
  /rabbit/:msg
 </code>
 will send a message to the worker process and you can check the terminal logs to see the message. The clock process will also run continuously and send a message to the worker process once every minute. Not bad for a 1 minute set up!
</p>
 
 Pull it all together with a bash script
 
<p>
 I like to write a simple script so I don’t have to memorize as many commands:

 manage.sh

<p>
 Done! Now, we don’t need to worry about remembering docker-compose commands. To run our entire server stack we now simply run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh start
 </code>
 . If we need to build our containers again because we changed our Dockerfile or we need to install new dependencies, we can run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh build
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Our shell container exists so that we can shell into our container or run one-off commands in the context of our container. Using the script above, you can run
 <code>
  ./manage shell
 </code>
 to start a terminal session in the container. If you want to run a single command in your container, you can use
 <code>
  ./manage run &lt;command&gt;
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If you’re familiar with the difficulty caused by complex development environments running on your local machine, then investigating a Docker powered development environment could save you time. There is a bit of set up involved but the productivity gained in the long term by using a tool like Docker pays for itself.

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t this! I’ve heard that
red-tailed hawks<a>1</a> live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

			</p>
		
	

 

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  The Green New Deal may not be Joe Biden's climate plan, but you better believe he knows it deeply and could dive deep into the details.

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t news, Kellyanne.</p>
<p>Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so
we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to
address the planetary crisis at our feet.</p>
<p>Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! Let’s do this thing.</p>

We have two great updates from Kim Hamilton Duffy (Architect Digital Credentials Consortium, Chair of the W3C CCG and Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force) and Lluis Arińo (convenor of Diplomas Use Case at European Blockchain Service Infrastructure and CIO Rovira i Virgili University, Spain).<br><br>Kim gave a great update on the W3C Verifiable Credentials in Education Task Force is working on, what educational institutions are currently participating on the Task Force and it objectives.  The presentation included some great questions from the event participants, as well as highlighting that the Task Force is interested in participation of institutions, organizations or individuals from Asia Region.  <br><br>Lluis  provided an overview of the goals and current projects (Notarisation of Documents, ESSIF, Diplomas management and Trusted Sharing Data) of EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure).  Lluis then gave a detailed overview of the Diploma Use Case covering, architectural elements, the centrality of verifiable credentials to the Use Case and the paradigm shift from institution centric to user centricity, making EBSI the common underlying building block for lifecycle management of diplomas.  <br><br>Recording of the Event: <a href="https://vimeo.com/464715275">https://vimeo.com/464715275</a></p><p>0:00:00 - Introductions<br>0:06:00 - Kim Hamilton Duffy - Verifiable Education Task Force<br>0:48:31 - Lluis Ariño - EBSI Diploma Use Case<br>1:32:21 - Upcoming schedule</p><p>For more information on Education Task Force: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/</a></p><p>For more information on EBSI: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained</a></p><p><br>Finally we covered the upcoming Vienna Digital identity Events:<br><br>	- October 26 - Bridging to SSI<br>	- November 9 - High Assurance Digital Identity (HADI) and Pharma<br>	- November 23 - Guardianship<br>	- December 14 - GADI</p><p><br>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

<p>I was starting to write this post when we were evacuated from the fire. Miraculously, after a really rough week, we were able to move back in on Friday. The house is still intact, the electricity is back on, and although the air is toxic, air purifiers allow the inside to be comfortable. I feel awful for the thousands of families who were not so lucky.</p><p>I'm now finishing and publishing this post as a way of adding some final punctuation to this terrible week. <a href="http://www.vaguelyinteresting.co.uk/as-i-was-saying-before-i-was-so-rudely-interrupted/">As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted ...</a></p><p>In the spirit of <a href="https://nownownow.com/">Derek Sivers</a>, I thought I'd write a quick update about what I'm doing these days. It's not quite a "now" page in the Sivers model, but it'll do .. for now.</p><p>Where I work:</p><p>I'm Head of Engineering and Sponsor Product at <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a>. Understanding what ForUsAll does, and therefore what I do, requires a little bit of explanation: in the US, rather than traditional pensions, workers tend to get something called a 401(k) plan (memorably named after its tax code). A part of your pre-tax pay is sent to a fund that invests on your behalf; many employers match your contribution up to a certain level. At retirement you get to withdraw those funds; the hope is that your investments have grown in value in the interim.</p><p>They tend to be jargon-laden, badly-run, and offer web interfaces that look like they were built in Microsoft Frontpage in 1998. And that's if you even have access to one: most American workers at smaller businesses don't, and therefore have limited access to decent ways to save for retirement. ForUsAll's web platform makes it cheaper and less time-consuming for employers to run (or "sponsor") a plan. And we're working on other ways for regular people to build financial stability for themselves, even before retirement. It's not about employees at well-funded startups or Fortune 500 companies; it's everyone else.</p><p>So my role is to run the engineering team, as well as product for the employer side of the experience. It's my first fintech company, but that's not why I'm doing it - my personal mission statement continues to be to work on projects that make the world more equal, informed, and inclusive, and this fits the bill.</p><p>I'm bringing a few things to the table here: my experience building products from both an engineering and product strategy perspective, but also my design thinking and cultural development background. I'm finding that those instincts are coming in very useful, and my big self-development project is to second-guess myself less than I often have in the past. I've been given a large role in determining the future strategy of the company, and I'm trying to bring my all to it.</p><p>By the way, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/forusall/3ae887ce-c793-42a6-bf93-4c14f12fb224">I'm hiring front-end engineers</a>.</p><p>Also:</p><p>I continue to sit on the board at <a href="https://latakoo.com">Latakoo</a>, the media startup where I was the CTO and first employee. Its technology - which I helped design and build - allows networks like NBC News to easily plan stories and transmit video from the field using commodity internet connections.</p><p>Latakoo is profitable. Its cloud service is used by many of the news organizations you can think of, and its on-premise servers have found homes in their editing suites. I'm really proud to have been a part of it, and to still be able to help where I can.</p><p>I believe deeply in the importance of media in our democracy, and I'm always excited to find opportunities to help support its future. In February I helped run (with my ex-<a href="https://matter.vc">Matter</a> colleague <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/profile/roxann-stafford/">Roxann Stafford</a>) a session on <a href="https://werd.io/2020/designing-for-equity">designing for equity</a> as part of a <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/training/product-immersion">Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms bootcamp</a> organized by <a href="https://newscatalyst.org/">NewsCatalyst</a> and the <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/">Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism</a> with <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">the Google News Initiative</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, I'm hoping to wind up <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a>'s incorporated corporate entity - and its hosted service, which is still online - this tax year. This doesn't mean Known itself is winding down: the open source community continues apace, and has been <a href="https://opencollective.com/known">funding future development through Open Collective</a>. The Known copyrights and assets will revert to me once the closure is complete.</p><p>Beyond work:</p><p>More of my time has been spent helping to care for my mother. It's been a decade since her diagnosis, and my life has been turned completely upside down in the years since (including some time where I thought I probably had the terminal, genetic condition too). Being able to spend time with both my parents is a privilege. But it's also been very easy to put my personal life on pause. I started this year with a determination to unpause - although 2020 has sometimes had other ideas.</p><p>I'm about to start a <a href="https://www.writingclasses.com/classes/description/zoetrope-fiction-writing">Gotham Writers Workshop course on writing fiction</a>. Writing has always been my first love, and I'm determined to take it more seriously. I took some Stanford writing courses over the summer and found them to be both incredibly useful and motivating. I'd been waitlisted for a two year part-time novel writing certificate, but sadly didn't make the cut. (Who can blame them - who is this tech bro anyway?) No matter; I'm finding other ways to improve my skills and get closer to my goal of actually publishing a long-form fiction book.</p><p>I came first in my group in the NYC Midnight flash fiction competition this summer; I'm waiting to see if I got into the third round.</p><p>I read a lot more than I write, and I've been trying my best to keep off the social networks. They don't, as a whole, improve my life. But the addiction is strong. I just wholesale quit Facebook and Instagram as a protest against that company's actions, and it felt pretty good.</p><p>When I thought I also probably had my mother's dyskeratosis congenita, I gained a lot of weight. I've been trying my best to lose it, through only eating during an eight hour window, improving my diet, and increasing the amount of exercise I do. We bought a treadmill so my mother could walk without having to leave the house (my dad also has mobility issues); I've been using it to regularly run 5Ks. It's nowhere near as impressive as my runner friends, but it's a world away from my last few years. I used to walk 7-8 miles a day in the course of my life in the UK, and my life in California has never worked the same way. I've lost some weight but I've got a very long way to go.</p><p>I've been thinking about how I can help mission-driven founders. I was pretty naive when I founded Known, and more so Elgg; I'd love to help people who are genuinely trying to make the world a better place to avoid some of those same mistakes. Time is limited, though. So maybe an online book and/or community is the way to go.</p><p>What's next:</p><p>In 2021 I want to ...</p><p>... finish a fiction book. Whether it gets published or not is out of my hands, but I want to do the best job I can. And then prepare to do it again.</p><p>... lose that weight and continue to get healthier.</p><p>... re-find the joy in life. It's been a tough year, and I want to find a way to have more time and space that's really mine. Between work and caring it's been hard to carve out room for my own life. I wouldn't change those things for the world, but I'd like to be able to find a healthier balance.</p>

<p>I tried to sign up for phone banking and I just couldn’t see doing it, I don’t answer unknown calls and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to right now. I wound up with the Vote Forward letter-writing system, <a href="http://votefwd.org/?fbclid=IwAR2gJSKcIqL4prkZJPZ72oPvOxOnabufWkKxojLL0lRm2NlydSZye2ZQI_8">votefwd.org</a>, which I like for a variety of reasons. </p>



<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">Social networking</a> websites
categorize the people I might be related to into:</p>
 
 those I am (bi-directional) “friends” with; 
 those that I follow (but they don’t follow me back), and vice versa; 
 those that are related to my friends, but not me directly; 
 those whose stuff the social network overlords think you should know about it
(that includes advertisers) 
 everybody else. 
 
<p>This categorizing seems contrary to the way non-dysfunctional human relationships work.
What is a better categorization? Here is my version:</p>
 
 
<p>My close family and friends. These are the people have the key to my house; they
live in my house or are welcome all the time, and will help out no matter what the time
of night it might be. I’ll call them Family, whether we have common genes or not.</p>
 
 
<p>Next are the people that I know well, but who I wouldn’t normally give a key to my
house. I know them well because I have worked with them, I have had fun with them, I
know a bit about their life history, I have some idea about their families
and what they worry about. Traditionally, that would be an actual village but in
times of the internet, people may live far away. It may include my neighborhood, my
congregation, my political faction, or people I have done projects with. I call
them my Village.</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond that is my Tribe. That’s people with whom I share a clear interest, although
I may know many members of my tribe only by name, or not at all. This would include
people of the same faith or Weltanschauung as I have, people in the same town, of the
same profession or political persuasion with a similar value system.</p>
 
 
<p>And there is everybody else, the World.</p>
 
 
<p>There may be one more tier between tribe and world, sort of on a country level. Other than
by allegiance to the same government (or grudging acceptance of the same government?),
I’m having some difficulties to define this tier, so I’m leaving it out of this post.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that I can be member of several of those groupings. For example, I can be
member of several Villages (my home town vs my college town) or Tribes (say, my
politics and my passion for electronics). Or maybe the better way of looking at it
would be to use this categorization only from my point of view; what is a single Village
to me may not be a single Village to anybody else.</p>
<p>I’m sure social science has lots of categorizations like that. Not being a social
scientist, what am I missing in this home-grown version?</p>

 Lists can help solve some of Twitter’s major pain&nbsp;points <p>“Unfollowing everyone on Twitter and switching to lists for better control of my feed. Nothing personal, love you all! “ — Github CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=03">Nat Friedman&nbsp;9/19/20</a></p><p>Twitter is my favorite social&nbsp;network.</p><p>It is a treasure trove of enlightening blog posts, news articles, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmorieBeck/status/1303800700829392902">research papers</a>, and video content that I would never see in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795110">the stagnant echo chamber</a> that is my Facebook news feed; a place filled with content posted primarily by former classmates who seem to have frighteningly homogenous political opinions and little apparent interest in seriously engaging with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>On Twitter, I have the freedom to engage with a heterogeneous network of thinkers from diverse geographical and ideological backgrounds. The platform has vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current events and trends. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/">A 2018 study</a> found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf">compelling evidence</a> that Twitter isn’t very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209">the abundance</a> of content comes at a high psychological cost:</p>  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9">Information overload</a> makes me feel like I’m drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds. Finding the signal that I’m searching for in a sea of noise takes&nbsp;work.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922">Fear</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629">missing out</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html">fear of not knowing</a> compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may have missed. “Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling…”  <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a> are an under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform’s potential to facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues&nbsp;by:</p>  Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to manage lists provides a much smoother Twitter user experience.  Providing raw data, via the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list">Twitter API</a>, that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling.  <p>Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic discourse that transcends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">left/right paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en">focuses</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728">addressing</a> systemic <a href="https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995">issues</a> rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.</p><p>Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help citizens fulfill their obligation to be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html">well informed</a> and perhaps even allow us to escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us&nbsp;in.</p><p>Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum">recently announced</a> plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists and drastically increase Twitter’s potential to serve the common&nbsp;good.</p><p>You can get started with exploring lists by checking out a few that I’ve&nbsp;made:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086059106874474496">AI</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/197289909">Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153">Blockchain Gaming</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1202739597286854656">Cryptofunds</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576">Cryptogurus</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276220409445101568">Decentralized Finance</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1054920788019572736">Ethereum</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1306382711196590081">Gen Z&nbsp;Mafia</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584">Systems Thinkers</a>  <p>And some great public lists that others have&nbsp;created:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460429">Astronomers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/967118678205505536">Bitcoin Developers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/875371355570487296">Crypto</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295245028386918402">Cryptoart</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/93883642">Congress</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/128331">Digital and Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/5158212">Economics</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/55356059">Financial News</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/84693025">Futurists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/73010929">Health Innovators</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/7450">Investors/VC/Angel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1023884">Machine Learning</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226161844793966593">Media \\&nbsp;Content</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/222800557">Neuroscience</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215437668">Philosophers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460480">Physicists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/68365941">Wall Street Influencers</a>  <p>Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/shingaithornton">@shingaithornton</a> with any thoughts on lists or suggestions for how to improve the ones I’m working&nbsp;on.</p><p>This piece was originally posted <a href="https://blog.shingaithornton.com/twitter-lists-are-underrated/">on my personal&nbsp;blog</a>.</p>

<p>Hello, hello!  <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/">Spritely's website</a> has
finally launched!  Whew... it's been a lot of work to get it to this
state!  Plus check out our new logo:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not bad, eh?  Also with plenty of cute characters on the Spritely site
(thank you to <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/">David Revoy</a> for taking
my loose character sketches and making them into such beautiful
paintings!)</p>
<p>But those cute characters are there for a reason!  Spritely is quite
ambitious and has quite a few subprojects.  Here's a
<a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/18aa2f92-36cc-4424-9a4f-6f2de946fbd2">video that explains how they all fit together</a>.
Hopefully that makes things more clear!</p>
<p>Actually that video is from <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub Conference 2020</a>,
the <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#talks">talks</a> of which have now
<a href="https://conf.tube/video-channels/apconf_channel/videos">all have their videos live</a>!
I also moderated the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/6289920f-4e35-4141-ab6f-379b357849ec">intro keynote panel about ActivityPub authors/editors</a>.
Plus there's an easter egg, the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">ActivityPub Conference Opening Song</a>! :)</p>
<p>But I can't take credit for APConf 2020... organization and support are thanks to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Sebastian Lasse, and <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">FOSSHost</a> for hosting the website and BigBlueButton instance and <a href="https://conf.tube/">conf.tube</a> for generously hosting all the videos.  There's a <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/87bc99dd-b1b8-4fc3-b034-dca805388179">panel about the organization of APConf</a> you can watch if you're interested in more of that!  (And of course, all the other great videos too!)</p>
<p>So... what about that week I was going to work on Terminal Phase?
Well... I'm still planning on doing it but admittedly it hasn't
happened yet.  All of the above took more time than expected.
However, today I am working on my talk about Spritely Goblins for
RacketCon, and as it turns out, extending Terminal Phase is a big part
of that talk.  But I'll announce more soon when the Terminal Phase
stuff happens.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>

  It bums me out that Gail Sheehy passed without much notice—meaning I only heard about it in passing.

<p><a href="https://www.bibliotica.com/2014/09/review-daring-my-passages-by-gail-sheehy-gail_sheehy/"></a>It bums me out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Sheehy">Gail Sheehy</a> passed without much notice—meaning I only heard about it in passing. And I didn’t hear about it, actually; I saw it on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sunday-morning/">CBS’ Sunday Morning</a>, where her face passed somewhere between Tom Seaver’s and John Thompson’s in the September 6 show’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/passage-in-memoriam-9-6-2020/">roster of the freshly dead</a>. I was shocked: She was older than both those guys and far less done. Or done at all, except technically. Death seems especially out of character for her, of all people.</p>
<p>Credit where due: The New York Times did post <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/books/gail-sheehy-dead.html">a fine obituary</a>, and&nbsp;New York, for which she wrote much, has&nbsp;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/gail-sheehy-never-stopped-reporting-a-tribute-from-new-york-magazine.html">an excellent remembrance</a>&nbsp;in the magazine by&nbsp;Christopher Bonanos (<a href="https://twitter.com/heybonanos">@heybonanos</a>). Writes Bonanos,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sheehy had an 18th book in the works, and it would have been — or will be, if someone else takes to the finish line — a fascinating one. Instead of reporting amid her peers (she was a few years older than the boomers, but roughly in their cohort), she set out to write a kind of echo of Passages, but this time about the millennial generation. And I can tell you that she was reveling in the immersion among people 50 and 60 years younger than she. She went to clubs with college guys and got out on the dance floor, and (by her account, at least) they were disarmed and amused by her — which is to say that she’d found every journalist’s sweet spot, where people get loose and comfortable enough to reveal themselves. She was constantly offering bits and pieces of her findings as magazine stories and columns. Some would work as stand-alone pieces and others wouldn’t, but all were tesserae in what was clearly going to be a big ambitious swoop of sociology. At New York, we were so taken with this project that we had also begun work on a profile of her…</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gail_sheehy">@Gail_Sheehy</a> is chronologically uncorrected. Her website, <a href="https://gailsheehy.com/">GailSheehy.com</a>, also still speaks of her in the present tense: “For her new book-in-progress, she’s a woman on a mission to redefine the most misunderstood generation: millennials. They are struggling with the rupture in gender roles and a crisis in mental health. But this generation of 20- and 30-somethings is also inventing radically new passages.”</p>
<p>Gail Sheehy’s writing isn’t just solid; it is enviably good. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/gail-sheehy-quotes">BrainyQuotes has 71 samples</a>, which is&nbsp;far short of sufficient. One goes,&nbsp;It is a paradox that as we reach our prime, we also see there is a place where it finishes. (Tell me about it. I’m only ten years younger than she was.)</p>
<p>As it happens, I’m writing this in the home library of a friend. On its many shelves a single spine stands out:&nbsp;<a href="https://gailsheehy.com/pathfinders">Pathfinders</a>, published in 1981. I pull it down and open it at random, knowing I’ll find something worth sharing from a page there. Here ya go, under the subhead&nbsp;Secrets of Well-being:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like the dance of brilliant reflections on a clear pond, well-being is a shimmer that accumulates from many important life choices, mad over the years by a mind that is not often muddied by pretense or ignorance and a heart that is open enough to sense people in their depths and to intuit the meaning of most situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is an afterlife, I am sure Gail Sheehy is already reporting on it.</p>

<p>Bits don’t leave a fossil record.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. They do persist on magnetic, optical and other media, all easily degraded or erased. But how long will those last?</p>
<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">already asked that question</a>, I’ll set it aside and ask the one in the headline.</p>
<p>Some perspective: depending on when you date its origins, digital life—the one we live <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Living_in_a_Connected_World/Technology_as_an_Extension_of_Self">by extension</a> through our digital devices, and on the Internet (which, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force">The Force</a>, connects nearly all digital things)—is decades old.</p>
<p>It’s an open question how long it will last. But I’m guessing it will be more than a few more decades. More likely we will remain partly digital for centuries or millennia.</p>
<p>So I’m looking for guesses more educated than mine.</p>
<p>Since this blog no longer takes comments from outside of Harvard (and I do want to fix that), please tag your responses, wherever they may be on the Internet with #DigitalLife. Thanks.</p>

<p>Understanding the harms caused from datism </p>



 <p>Musings on dataism. Image adapted from <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/pixel2013-2364555/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4031973">S. Hermann &amp; F. Richter</a></p> 
<p>Yesterday was a big day, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™ released their <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>See my related post and <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/09/25/the-release-of-the-humanity-power-action-kit-and-the-30-day-challenge/">my personal testimonial</a> on the value of the Humanity Power framework.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I reflect on the powerful framework and message that Humanity Power has built, I’ve not been able to not stop considering how it relates to the emerging personal information economy and the role that data plays, both positively and negatively, throughout society.</p>



<p>I believe that datism, data’s dark side, is one of the many ‘ism that we must strive to eradicate if we are to truly be free to thrive in today’s data-driven society.</p>



 What is an ‘ism 



<p>Lets first start with understanding what an ‘ism is and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?</p>



 
<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>

<blockquote>
<p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>
Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>




<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 Identity Praxis is a proponent of Humanity Power and looks to add one more ‘ism to the conversation: dataism 



<p><a href="https://www.identitypraxis.com">Identity Praxis</a> is a proponent of Humanity Power, it is through unity that we can all find balance, joy, and achievement of purpose. Also, it is the perfect platform to discuss another ‘ism that is plaguing society, dataism.</p>



<p>David Brooks in his 2013&nbsp;article “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html">The Philosophy of Data</a>,” considers dataism an ethical system. And, Yuval Noah Harari, in his book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537994938&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=homo+deus">Homo Deus</a>, suggested dataism is a new form of religion that reveres big data. I see it as something more sinister. I see it to be more in the light of the other ‘isms, in that is divides and segregates more than drives unity.</p>




<blockquote>
<p>Dataism, as an economic and social movement, relates to how people’s data, their identity and personal information, is being used by society’s private and public actors for gain to the detriment of the society-at-large and the individual who is the data subject.</p>
</blockquote>




<p>Today, data is being used and co-opted by public (aka government) and private (aka organizations) for economic, political, and social gain, a situation often referred to as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697">surveillance capitalism</a>. People, individual data subjects, are being left out of the data flow equation, they don’t have a seat at the table.</p>



<p>While the flow of data throughout the world brings significant good to our societies and economies, and to the individual in many contexts, the fact that individuals have largely been left out of the decision-making process as to how their data is collected and used is a problem.</p>



<p>As with the other isms, dataism is causing harm to individuals and society at large, impart and due to, among other things, an imbalance of the flow of data, the value derived from the flow of data, and the risks generated by the flow of data; and, sadly, most people don’t even know this is happening or comprehend the long-term implications.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that dataism is both independent and interdependent in relation to the other ‘isms. It stands alone, as well as influences and is influenced by the other ‘isms.</p>



<p>At a micro level, dataism is causing harm, both <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume154/issue3/Solove154U.Pa.L.Rev.477(2006).pdf">legally recognized data harm</a>, such as identity left, as well as <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/459427-privacy-law-needs-privacy-harm">other data harms</a> that are not strictly measured or recognized, such as increased anxiety, loss of time, money, reputation, discrimination, opportunity (personal, economic, social, influence), and death.</p>



<p>At a macro level, dataism can create class wars, generate division, stimulate distrust, discriminate, silence free speech, suppress minorities, and more. Why, because dataism is causing a disequilibrium of power (money, resources, and influence), opportunity, social good, risk, and externalities among society’s actors. The lion share of the externalities are being born by people (you, me, and everyone around us), and the majority of the value is going to private institutions, aka “Big Tech”.</p>



<p>Data has power. Used properly data can create great prosperity. Used improperly it can create great harm.</p>

A screen shot of The Opportunity Atlas

 



 
 
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know a single data point, a child’s zip code, can predict their future success? See <a href="https://www.opportunityatlas.org/">The Opportunity Atlas</a> and learn more.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
 
 



<p>How does The Opportunity Atlas fit into dataism? Here is just one example. It is quite common for marketers to use geofencing to target their ads. If marketers know that a particular zip code is populated by the economically disadvantaged, for instance, they will hold back their advertising and not reach out to people in those areas. Individuals in those areas, that may otherwise value seeing the ad are being lumped in with the “poor,” and are hurt by this application of data. While I’m not putting forth a moral judgment to this practice, this is a form of dataism.</p>



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism, including dataism. It is time to give people, the data subject, agency and control over their data, and to bring unity to our phygital lives.</p>



<p>It is through unity, the eradication of datism, and all the other ‘isms, that we’ll achieve and sustain The Identity Nexus™, the equilibrium point where the value, risk, social good, and externalities of identity and personal information exchange within society are equitably and fairly shared among public institutions, private organizations, and people.</p>



<p>How can we eradicate dataism. We can empower people and start giving them agency over their identity and personal information. We can start giving them tools–personal information management solutions–so that they can be in control of the flow of their information and determine for themselves, who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose their identity and personal information can be used. And, if they’re so inclined they should be able to charge for their data. They should be able to require organizations to have to accept their terms of access rather than only being forced to accept the organization’s terms of service.</p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living, working, and playing in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings prosperity and joy without causing harm to others. It is time we end dataism.</p>

<p>Putting an end to the ‘isms that plague humanity</p>



<p>Today is a big day at <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/">Humanity Power</a>™, and for all.  </p>



<p>Charisse and the team at Humanity Power have launched the <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">Humanity Power action kit</a>, a step-by-step guide for putting the unity that is within our humanity to work. It is a guide to bring joy, peace, and purpose to your life, the lives of everyone around you and afar, and to put an end to the ‘isms (sexism, ageism, ableism, classism, racism) that plague humanity; ‘isms that are the root of so many of our individual and social ills.</p>



<p>I encourage you to take the leap into Humanity Power. Follow the six-actions outlined in the action kit, and personally contribute, in your own unique way, to bring joy, prosperity, and purpose to your life and those around you, and afar.  </p>



 What are humanity’s ‘isms 



<p>So, what is an ‘ism and what are the ‘isms Humanity Power is taking head-on?   </p>



 <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanities ‘isms 



<blockquote><p>An ‘ism origin means “to side with.” While there are many ‘isms out there, Humanity Power focuses on ending these specific ‘isms, sexism, ageism, ableism, colorism, classism, and racism. These are the ‘isms that continue perpetuate discrimination within our society.</p>Charisse Alayna Fontes<br>Founder of Humanity Power<br>September 2020</blockquote>



<p>There is so much we can do with the energy that we’re losing to these ‘isms, energy we can never get back. We need to learn to eradicate these ‘isms that are at work within our society, communities, and ourselves. Lets band together, eradicate these ‘isms and put the reclaimed energy to work so that we can join forces and tackle the challenges and realize the opportunities that lay ahead, together.</p>



 The Six Actions for Claiming Your Humanity Power  



<p>The Humanity Power action kit lays out six actions, steps, you can take to claim your humanity and to help bring prosperity to yourself and the world. </p>



<p>Humanity Power Action List</p>



  Learn the ‘isms, start by building awareness of the ‘isms and what they mean and who they affect.  Learn about high-vibration Humanity, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">learn</a> what it means to use your high-vibration Humanity.  Buy a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">wear the message</a> of Humanity Power, and support the mission (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Gift a Humanity Power T-Shirt, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/shop">give the gift of unity</a> and spread the message of Humanity (T-Shirt proceeds go to the support of the mission).  Take the 30-day Humanity Power challenge, <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">put your humanity to action</a> and practice high-vibrational activities to help end the ‘isms.  Subscribe and Stay connected, we’re just getting started and you are a big part in that. Let’s stay connected so we can experience mpact together.  



<p>Oh, and be sure to keep an eye you for future actions that you can engage in, like </p>



  sharing the Humanity the Manatee™ stuffy and book that teaches kids about humanity  supporting the Humanity Power “3rd Thursday” community enrichment events that provide people in need with a free meal while supporting local small businesses  taking part in action-based education. More on all of these later  



 Personal Testimonial 



<p>As for my part, I’m a walking billboard for the impact that Humanity Power can have on your life. Humanity Power has brought me positivity, joy, energy, friends, connections, commercial opportunity, prosperity, and more. </p>



Image by author: <br>Becker wearing Humanity Power T-Shirt

<p>I am using Humanity Power to change my attitude, providing self-care. This has lead to me being more positive. I’m writing more. I am more protective and am finding renewed interest in my work. </p>



<p>I’ve finished all but one of the six actions. Action 5 of the action kit, the one I’m most excited about. It is next on my plate. I won’t give away the surprise as to what is in the daily challenge, you can take action yourself and download the kit. </p>



<a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere"></a>Courtesy of Humanity Power: Humanity Power 30 Day Challenge



 Get Started Today 



<p>It is time. It is time to eradicate all the ‘ism. </p>



<p>It is upon us all to create a world worth living in, one that helps people follow their path, one that brings property and joy without causing harm to others.</p>



<p>If you’re not ready to start the Humanity Power journey just yet, that’s ok. Humanity Power attests that there is unity in humanity. Well, guess what, there is unity in community as well. As a first step, I encourage you to at least join the community, start with action 6, and stay connected with the movement and the mission. If you are ready, jump right in. I encourage you to <a href="https://www.humanitypower.co/starthere">join</a> the Humanity Power community and take part. You won’t regret it. </p>



<p>For our part at Identity Praxis, we’re focused on helping public institutions, private organizations, and people find an equitable balance as it relates to the exchange of identity and personal information throughout society. After reflecting on the Humanity Power framework, this brings another ‘ism to mind, dataism. We’ll reflect on Datism in a future post. </p>

Atlanta Innovation Forum Live Event



 Program Abstract 



<p>Keeping Pace with the Explosion of Online Traffic… and the Surge of Online Threats Technology has always moved at an accelerating pace. But, since the start of the global pandemic, Internet usage has exploded at a never-before-seen pace, creating an equally explosive opportunity for cybercrime and online security risks. </p>



<p>In 2020: </p>



  Internet traffic has increased by 70% this year; streaming has increased by more than 12%  Ecommerce during the first six months increased more than 30% over online sales from the same time period last year (compared to the previous year to year same period growth of 13%)  Ecommerce sales for June 2020 were up 76% over June 2019 sales; for July 2020, they were up 56% from July 2019   10% of shoppers are making an online purchase for the first time this year, due to social distancing concerns  



<p>The increase is great news for Internet retailers and online service providers. But, it’s also a great opportunity for online criminals. It’s estimated that online crime in 2020 could result in over $6 trillion in losses this year. So what’s being done to address this? What steps are being taken to make online use by businesses and consumers more secure, to keep pace for with the bad guys? What new tech is being employed? How are businesses and technology vendors – many who are competitors – working together to protect their consumer and business customers to reduce losses, protect privacy and confidential data and to keep the ever-smarter bad guys from getting ahead? Join us as a panel of experts from B2B, B2C, Security and InfoSec explore what “high tech” is doing to thwart “high crime”</p>



 My Contribution  



<p>For my part, I’m going to speak about The Identity Nexus. The Identity Nexus is the elusive equilibrium point where mutual and equitable personal information value exchange between people, public, and private institutions can be had. I’ll discuss the <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2020/08/26/iapp-releases-us-state-comprehensive-privacy-law-comparison-why-this-is-relevant-to-the-identity-nexus/">trinity of self-sovereignty</a> (Privacy, Security, Compliance) and the solutions needed to help us all thrive in the emerging personal information economy.</p>

<p>Katherine Eban, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">deeply reported piece</a>, for Vanity Faire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
government’s strategy?</p>
<p>According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
“Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
states to figure out what they want to do.”</p>
<p>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
leadership and direction.</p>
<p>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
role of government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
about New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his desperate call for supplies.</p>
<p>“That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told Vanity
Fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed we sure have been. Nearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-09-19-2020-11600512793" title="Wall Street Journal: “U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Near 200,000”">200,000 have died</a> from Covid-19 in the
United States to date, with close to 400,000 deaths <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/briefing_US_091820.pdf" title="Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Pandemic Forecast for September 17">forecast by January 1</a>.</p>
<p>I’m restraining myself from quoting more; the reporting is impeccable, and the
truth of the situation deeply alarming. Read <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">the whole thing</a>, then
maybe go for a long walk and practice deep breathing.</p>
<p>And then <a href="https://vote.org/">Vote</a>. And make sure everyone you know is registered and ready to
vote.</p>

To see how the Observatory is faring during the ongoing Bobcat fire, check our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WilsonObs/">Facebook link</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/MtWilsonObs">Twitter link</a>, or go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://hpwren.ucsd.edu/cameras/wilson.html">HPWREN Tower Cam</a>&nbsp;and click on the second frame from the left at the top, which looks east towards the fire (also check the south-facing cam and the recently archived timelapse movies below which offer a good look at the latest events in 3-hour segments. Note to media: These images can be used with credit to HPWREN).&nbsp;For the latest updates on the Bobcat fire from U.S. Forest Service, please check out their&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Angeles_NF">Twitter page</a>.</p>
<p>Last night the firefighters set a strategic backfire to make a barrier to the fire on our southern flank. To many of us who did not know what was happening it looked like the end. Click <a href="http://c1.hpwren.ucsd.edu/archive/wilson-s-mobo-c/large/20200917/MP4/Q7.mp4">here</a> to watch the timelapse. The 12 ground crews up there have now declared us safe. They will remain to make sure nothing gets by as the fires tend to linger in the canyons below. They are our heroes and we owe them our existence. They are true professionals, artists with those backfires, and willing to put themselves at considerable risk to protect us. We thank them!!!!</p></blockquote>

<p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>In my never-ending quest to come up with super-simple models I came up with this diagram. This post is a slight editorial refactoring of my recent Twitter thread found&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1305852608087756802?s=20">here</a>.</p>A simple ecosystem model<p>The above illustration is not intended to be an architectural diagram — rather, it helps to 1) clarify conflations, 2) help define scope (the dotted box) and 3) understand motivations — of the parties that exist ‘outside of the&nbsp;system’</p><p>For example, ‘Issuer” usually gets conflated with ‘Authority’ — an authority merely ‘Attests’ — if you recognize it, then you can assume it is authoritative.</p><p>Anyone can attest to anything and issue something. The point of this model is that everything inside the box is neutral to that and solely focused on specific properties everyone needs regardless of intent or&nbsp;role.</p><p>The “Verifier” usually gets conflated with Relying Party. But a Verifier could be an off-the-shelf black box with the firmware baked in to verify against the right DIDs, challenging the holder with Bluetooth or NFC. The “Acceptor” could be logic that simply throws a switch to open a secure door. All done on behalf of a Relying&nbsp;Party.</p><p>The Holder can be anyone outside the system. An individual, organization or device, that is the ultimate ‘holder’ of secrets or cryptographic keys that is the basis of their power to convey intention.</p><p>Finally, the Registrar, is anyone or anything that is responsible for integrity of the ledger (doesn’t have to be blockchain). This ledger is responsible for two fundamental interactions: validation and transfer. In the case of a permissionless system, the ‘Registrar’ is actually an agreed-on set of rules, and proven (or not yet disproven) cryptographic primitives. For permissioned, or centralized systems, it could be a group of people, or even a single person in the back room with an Excel spreadsheet (not blockchain).</p><p>As for the dotted box — you need to determine who/what sits inside or outside of the box. For many outside the box, they may only care about a black box that they trust. This dotted box is also useful when you start thinking about the non-functional properties of the system — black or grey, should it be permissioned, permissionless, restricted access, globally available?</p><p>In the end, what I am trying to achieve is the expression of a simple conceptual model to help me express what could serve the wide range of use cases e.g.: opening a door, applying for university, letting someone across the border, etc. The model could also be used to express simply what we need to start building as a new digital infrastructure.</p><p>As always, this is a work-in-progress. Constructive comments&nbsp;welcome.</p>

And, if it’s time to refactor the Nobel Prize, what does that suggest for the prizes your learned society hands out? Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

<p>The <a href="https://info.braze.com/rs/367-GUY-242/images/BrazeDataPrivacyReport.pdf">Braze Privacy Data Report</a> provides useful insights toward understanding U.S. consumers’ (n=2,000) and marketer executives’ (n=500) opinions regarding personal data usage and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are insightful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marketers should start to take action now, and prepare themselves for the rise of the self-sovereign individual.&nbsp;</p>



 Individuals expect transparency 



<p>According to the study, individuals want transparency. They want to know,&nbsp;</p>



  
  how their data will be used (94%)  who it will be shared with (74%)  what will be done with it (74%)  what data has been collected (70%)  how long it will be retained (59%)  who is storing it (56%)  
  



<p>Marketers agree (99%), but what consumers and marketers don’t agree on is the value exchange and who should be in control of the policies and rules for privacy and personal information management &amp; oversight.</p>



 Ignoring privacy concerns will hurt the bottom line 



<p>Marketers beware!</p>



<p>The Braze report notes that 84% of U.S. adults have decided against engaging a brand due to personal information requests, and 71% did so more than once; and, 75% stopped engaging with a company all together over privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message is clear, properly handling privacy will have a positive impact on the bottom line, and not doing so will be detrimental.&nbsp;</p>



 Value exchange is possible 



<p>People are open to exchanging their personal information, but they want something in return; 71% of consumers will share their personal information in exchange for value:&nbsp;</p>



  60% in exchange for cash; a 2018 study by SYZYGY suggested this could be as much as $150 USD (The Price of Personal Data, 2018)  26% for product and incentives  21% for free content.&nbsp;  



<p>We see a gap here between consumers and marketing executives, as only 31% of marketing executives believe consumers should receive cash in exchange for personal data.&nbsp;</p>



 The privacy expectation gap 



<p>Again, we have a privacy expectations gap in the U.S.; the report finds that 82% of U.S. adults say privacy is important to them, while only 29% of marketing executives hold the same opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is time for the market to listen and begin to respect the sovereignty of the individual.</p>



 Rules and regulations 



<p>As for who should set the rules and regulations for personal information management &amp; oversight and exchange and privacy protection, it’s not clear.</p>



<p>Marketing executives (88%) find the state-by-state sectoral approach in the US burdensome and believe that federal direction could provide clearer directions. And yet, just 52% of marketers and consumers believe the Federal governments should do more.&nbsp;</p>



 The Bottom line 



<p>The bottom line is clear. People are waking up to the fact that their personal information has value. They’re open to exchange, but they expect transparency and compensation. Clearly, from a consumer attitudinal perspective, the personal information economy is at hand, but it is also clear there are industry and regulatory gaps that must first start to close; moreover, we need to develop and deploy the tools to help people safely and securely engage in the exchange of their personal information. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Proactively managing your privacy is no longer a luxury, it is a must and it takes conscious effort. One step you may not have considered is blurring your house, face, car or license plate, or some other object on Google Maps? </p>



<p>Why would you want to do this, you might ask? Well, here are a few reasons; I’m sure there are more.</p>



  You have street-facing windows from your bedroom or living room  You’ve been a victim and want to minimize your digital footprint  You generally want to maintain your privacy&nbsp;  



<p>If you decide to do it, it is surprisingly easy. &nbsp;</p>



 Steps to Blur your house on Google Maps 



<p>You can follow the steps below to blur your house on Google Maps.</p>



<p>Warning: According to Google, the blurring of an image on Google Maps is permanent; you can’t reverse it. So, be sure this is what you want to do before you proceed.&nbsp;</p>







  Go to <a href="http://google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and enter your home address  Click on the picture of your house to enter Street View mode  Click “Report a problem” link in the bottom-right corner of the screen  Center the red box on the object you want to blur, like your car or home  Click on the object type in the “Request blurring” list  Provide an explanation of why you want to blur the object, in the filed that appears  Enter your email address and hit Sumit.  



<p>Google will evaluate your request. The team (or systems) at Google will consider your request; it is not clear how long this will take. Once they’ve finished reviewing your request, they will let you know if it has been approved or rejected.&nbsp;</p>

Spritely Goblins
v0.7
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
CapTP support
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

<p>The white mess in the image above is the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7152/">Bobcat Fire</a>, spreading now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, against which Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl (that’s it, on the right) reaches its limits of advance to the north. It makes no sense to build very far up or into these mountains, for two good reasons. One is fire, which happens often and awfully. The other is that the mountains are geologically new, and falling down almost as fast as they are rising up. At the mouths of valleys emptying into the sprawl are vast empty reservoirs—catch basins—ready to be filled with rocks, soil and mud “downwasting,” as geologists say, from a range as big as the Smokies, twice as high, ready to burn and shed.</p>
<p>Outside of its northern rain forests and snow-capped mountains, California has just two seasons: fire and rain. Right now we’re in the midst of fire season. Rain is called Winter, and it has been dry since the last one. If the Bobcat fire burns down to the edge of Monrovia, or Altadena, or any of the towns at the base of the mountains, heavy winter rains will cause downwasting in a form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> describes in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The water was now spreading over the street. It descended in heavy sheets. As the young Genofiles and their mother glimpsed it in the all but total darkness, the scene was suddenly illuminated by a blue electrical flash. In the blue light they saw a massive blackness, moving. It was not a landslide, not a mudslide, not a rock avalanche; nor by any means was it the front of a conventional flood. In Jackie’s words, “It was just one big black thing coming at us, rolling, rolling with a lot of water in front of it, pushing the water, this big black thing. It was just one big black hill coming toward us.</p>
<p>In geology, it would be known as a debris flow. Debris flows amass in stream valleys and more or less resemble fresh concrete. They consist of water mixed with a good deal of solid material, most of which is above sand size. Some of it is Chevrolet size. Boulders bigger than cars ride long distances in debris flows. Boulders grouped like fish eggs pour downhill in debris flows. The dark material coming toward the Genofiles was not only full of boulders; it was so full of automobiles it was like bread dough mixed with raisins. On its way down Pine Cone Road, it plucked up cars from driveways and the street. When it crashed into the Genofiles’ house, the shattering of safety glass made terrific explosive sounds. A door burst open. Mud and boulders poured into the hall. We’re going to go, Jackie thought. Oh, my God, what a hell of a way for the four of us to die together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three rains ago we had debris flows in Montecito, the next zip code over from our home in Santa Barbara. I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/01/15/montecito/">Making sense of what happened to Montecito</a>. The flows, which destroyed much of the town and killed about two dozen people, were caused by heavy rains following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire">Thomas Fire</a>, which at 281,893 acres was biggest fire in California history at the time. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)">Camp Fire</a>, a few months later, burned a bit less land but killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including whole towns. This year we already have two fires bigger than the Thomas, and at least three more growing fast enough to take the lead. You can see the whole updated list on the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/">Los Angeles Times California Wildfires Map</a>.</p>
<p>For a good high-altitude picture of what’s going on, I recommend NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)</a>. It’s a highly interactive map that lets you mix input from satellite photographs and fire detection by orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> and <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/">VIIRS</a>&nbsp;systems. MODIS is onboard the <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra</a> and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> satellites; and VIIRS is onboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html">Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)</a> spacecraft. (It’s actually more complicated than that. If you’re interested, dig into those links.) Here’s how the FIRMS map shows the active West Coast fires and the smoke they’re producing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a lot of cremated forest and wildlife right there.</p>
<p>I just put those two images and a bunch of others up on Flickr,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157715920586418">here</a>. Most are of MODIS fire detections superimposed on 3-D Google Earth maps. The main thing I want to get across with these is how large and anomalous these fires are.</p>
<p>True: fire is essential to many of the West’s wild ecosystems. It’s no accident that the California state tree, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coast Redwood</a>, grows so tall and lives so long: it’s&nbsp;adapted to fire. (One can also make a case that the state flower, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia_californica">California Poppy</a>, which thrives amidst fresh rocks and soil, is adapted to earthquakes.) But what’s going on here is something much bigger. Explain it any way you like, including strange luck.</p>
<p>Whatever you conclude, it’s a hell of a show. And vice versa.</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>Today in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/creepy-geofence-finds-anyone-near-crime-scene/?bxid=5cc9e0b124c17c766aabcf24&amp;cndid=52111978&amp;esrc=Wired_etl_load&amp;source=EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_TRANSPORTATION_ZZ&amp;utm_brand=wired&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_mailing=WIR_FastForwardTopClickers%202020-09-07&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=nl&amp;utm_term=WIR_TopClickers_EXCLUDE_Transportation">Wired</a>, I read about geofencing warrants. </p>



<p>Geofence Warrants&nbsp;are a law enforcement practice. Law enforcement submits a request to tech companies, notably Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, for a list of all the devices in, at, or near a location during a specific period of time. The objective of this practice is to identify people to be interviewed as part of an investigation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Example,</p>



  To identify devices within a few hundred yards to a mile of a murder scene, or accident.   



<p>As of the summer of 2020, this practice is coming under scrutiny, as some have raised privacy concerns about the practice; the practice could cause harm. It could have an adverse effect on individuals’ right to privacy and civil liberties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, it could be used</p>



  
  to identify people during a protest in violation of the protesters’<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">&nbsp;First Amendment rights</a>, i.e. the right to free speech.  in densely populated areas in violation of individuals’&nbsp;<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">Fourth Amendment rights</a>, namely their right to “secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizure.”  



<p>I’m all for the development of technology and the use of technology to maintain societal safety and democracy, but I do have my concerns. I want to believe that most people and organizations have well-meaning intentions, that they want to create value for people and themselves, but capabilities like geofencing have so many applications that can be used for malign purposes. We need to be careful.</p>



<p>I think it is crucial that we develop a wide range of technology that leverages personal data, like an individual’s location, to generate value for both society and for the individual, but it is imperative that we find ways to ensure individual users of this technology have the ability to maintain their agency and self-sovereignty.  </p>

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.

<p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>Today’s increasingly sophisticated consumers now view digital interactions as the primary mechanism for interacting with brands and, consequently, expect deeper online relationships delivered simply and unobtrusively. CIAM turns customer data into Gold! Scalability, Security &amp; Privacy, Usability, Extensibility, and APIs &amp; Integration are the five pillars of CIAM. The following video talks about these five pillars in&nbsp;detail.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/five-pillars-of-ciam-d5657a9e375b">Five Pillars of CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The other day I made a
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/104746037303599668">sadpost on the fediverse</a>
that said: "simultaneously regularly feel like people don't take the
directions I'm trying to push seriously enough and that I'm not worth
taking seriously".
(Similarly, I've also joked that "imposter syndrome and a Cassandra
complex are a hell of a combo" before.)
I got a number of replies from people, both publicly and privately, and
the general summary of most of them are, "We do care!  The stuff you're
working on seems really cool and valuable!  I'll admit that I don't
really know what it is you're talking about but it sounds important!"
(Okay, and I just re-read, and it was only a portion of it that even said
the latter part, but of course, what do I emphasize in my brain?)
That was nice to hear that people care and are enthusiastic, and I did
feel much better, but it did also kind of feel like confirmation that
I'm not getting through to people completely either.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred">jfred</a> made an
<a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred/104747234928467298">interesting reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that feels familiar. Impostor syndrome hits hard. You're
definitely worth taking seriously though, and the projects you're
working on are the most exciting ones I've been following.</p>
<p>As for people not taking the directions you're pushing
seriously... I've felt the same at work, and I think part of it is
that there's only so much one person can do. But also part of it is:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/</a></p>
<p>...it's hard to get ideas across to someone until they can interact
with it themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first of all, what a nice post!
Second of all, it's kind of funny that jfred replied with this because
out of everyone, jfred is one of the people who's picked up and
understood what's happening in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>
in particular the most, often running or creating demos of things on
top of it using things I haven't even documented yet (so definitely
not a person I would say isn't taking me seriously or getting what the
work is doing).</p>
<p>But third, that link to <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/">Habitat Chronicles</a>
is right on point for a few reasons: first of all, Spritely is hugely
influenced by the various generations of Habitat, from the original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc">first-ever-graphical-virtual-worlds Habitat</a>
(premiering on the Commodore 64 in the mid 1980s, of all things!)
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNiePoNiyvE">Electric Communities Habitat</a>,
especially because that's where the <a href="http://erights.org/">E programming language</a>
came from, which I think it's safe to say has had a bigger influence on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a> than anything
(except maybe
<a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">this paper by Jonathan Rees</a>,
which is the first time I realized that "oh, object capability security
is just normal programming flow").
But also, that blogpost in particular was so perfect about this subject:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a>...!</p>
<p>In summary, the blogpost isn't saying that people aren't foolishly
incapable of understanding things, but that people in general don't
understand well by "being explained to".
What helps people understand is experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually people can be educated, but what you have to do is find a
way give them the experience, to put them in the
situation. Sometimes this can only happen by making real the thing
you are describing, but sometimes by dint of clever artifice you can
simulate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really congealed for me and helped me feel justified in an
approach I've been taking in the Spritely project.
In general, up until now I've spent most of my time between two
states: coding the backend super-engineering stuff, and coding
demos on top of it.
You might in the meanwhile see me post technobabble onto
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">my fediverse</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb">birdsite</a> accounts, but I'm not in
general trying too hard to write about the structurally interesting
things going on until it comes time to write documentation
(whether it be for <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>,
or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/magenc/blob/master/magenc/scribblings/intro.org">immutable storage</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/crystal/blob/master/crystal/scribblings/intro.org">mutable storage</a> writeups).
But in general, the way that I'm convinced people will get it is not
by talk but by first, demonstration, and second, use.</p>
<p>Aside from the few people that have picked up and played with Goblins
yet, I don't think I've hit a sufficient amount of "use" yet in Spritely.
That's ok, I'm not at that stage yet, and when I am, it'll be fairly clear.
(ETA: one year from now.)
So let's talk about demonstration.</p>
<p>The first demo I wrote was the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/golem/blob/master/README.org">Golem demo</a>,
that showed roughly that distributed but encrypted storage could be
applied to the fediverse.
Cute and cool, and that turned the heads of a few fediverse
implementers.</p>
<p>But let's face it, the best demo I've done yet was the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
And it didn't hurt that it had a cool looking animated GIF to go
with it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to this demo, people would ask me, "What's this Goblins thing?"
And I'd try to say a number of things to them... "oh, its a
distributed, transactional, quasi-functional distributed programming
system safe to run in mutually suspicious networks that follows object
capability security and the classic actor model in the style of the E
programming language but written in Scheme!"
And I'd watch as their eyes glaze over because
why wouldn't their eyes glaze over after a statement like that, and
then I'd try to explain the individual pieces but I could tell
that the person would be losing interest by then and
why wouldn't they lose interest but even realizing that I'd kind of
feel despair settling in... </p>
<p>But when you show them a pew pew space lasers game and oh wow why
is there time travel, how did you add time travel, is it using
functional reactive programming or something?
(Usually FRP systems are the only other ones where people have
seen these kinds of time travel demos.)
And I'd say nope!
It doesn't require that.
Mostly it looks like writing just straightahead code but you get
this kind of thing for free.
And the person would say, wow!
Sounds really cool!  How much work does it take to add the time
travel into the game?
And I just say: no extra work at all.
I wrote the whole game without testing anything about time travel or
even thinking about it, then later I just threw a few extra lines to
write the UI to expose the time travel part and it just worked.  And
that's when I see peoples' heads explode with wonder and the
connections start to be made about what Goblins might be able to do.</p>
<p>But of course, that's only a partial connection for two reasons.
One is that the time travel demo above only shows off a small,
minute part of the features of Goblins.
And actually, the least interesting of them!
It doesn't show off the distributed programming or asynchronous
programming parts, it doesn't show off the cool object capability
security that's safe to run in mutually suspicious networks.
But still: it gave a taste that something cool is happening here.
Maybe Chris hasn't just been blowing a bunch of time since
finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standardization process
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785">about two and a half years ago</a>.
(Yikes, two and a half years ago!?!)</p>
<p>To complete the rest of that demonstration of the other things
in the system requires a different kind of demo.
Terminal Phase was a demo to show off the synchronous half of Goblins,
but where Goblins really shines is in the asynchronous, distributed
programming stuff.
That's not ready to show off yet, but I'll give you the first taste
of what's in progress:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Actually a bit more has progressed since I've recorded that GIF,
multiple chatrooms and etc, but not really worth bothering to show
off quite yet.)</p>
<p>Hmm, that's not really all that thrilling.  A chatroom that looks about
the same level of featureful, maybe less, than IRC?
Well, it could be more exciting if you hear that the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/chat-backend.rkt">full chat protocol implementation</a>
is only about 250 lines of code, including authenticating users and
posts by users.
That's smaller even than its
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">corresponding GUI code</a>,
which is less than 300 lines of code.
So the exciting thing there is how much heavy lifting Goblins takes
care of for you.</p>
<p>But that's hardly razzle-dazzle exciting.
In order for me to hint at the rest of what's happening here, we need
to put out an asynchronous programming demo that's as or more
interesting than the time travel demo.
And I expect to do that.
I hope soon enough to show off stuff that will make people go,
"Oh, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>But even that doesn't complete the connection for people,
because showing is one thing but to complete the loop, we need
people to use things.
We need to get this stuff in the hands of users to play with and
experiment themselves.
I have plans to do that... and not only that, make this stuff
not intimidating for newcomers.
When Spritely guides everyday people towards extending Spritely from
inside of Spritely as it runs, that's when it'll really click.</p>
<p>And once it clicks sufficiently, it'll no longer become exciting,
because people will just come to expect it.
A good example of that comes from the aforementioned
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, before Lucasfilm, I worked for <a href="http://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>
(the original hypertext project, way before this newfangled World
Wide Web thing). One of the things I did was travel around the
country trying to evangelize the idea of hypertext. People loved it,
but nobody got it. Nobody. We provided lots of explanation. We had
pictures. We had scenarios, little stories that told what it would
be like. People would ask astonishing questions, like “who’s going
to pay to make all those links?” or “why would anyone want to put
documents online?” Alas, many things really must be experienced to
be understood. We didn’t have much of an experience to deliver to
them though — after all, the whole point of all this evangelizing
was to get people to give us money to pay for developing the
software in the first place! But someone who’s spent even 10 minutes
using the Web would never think to ask some of the questions we got
asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, if we succeed, the ideas in Spritely will no longer seem
exciting... because people will have internalized and come to expect
them.
Just like hyperlinks on the web today.</p>
<p>But to get there, in the meanwhile, we have to get people interested.
To become so successful as to be mundane, we have to first be
razzle-dazzle exciting.
And to that end, that's why I take the demo approach to Spritely.
Because it's hard to tell someone something... but showing them,
that's another matter.</p>
<p>PS: It's also not true that people don't get what I'm doing, and
that's even been reflected materially.
I've been lucky to be supported over the last few years from a
combination of
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/samsung-stack-zero-grant/">a grant from Samsung's Stack Zero</a>
and
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">one from NLNet</a>,
not to mention quite a few <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">donors on Patreon</a>.
I do recognize and appreciate that people are supporting me.
In some ways receiving this support makes me feel more seriously about the
need to demonstrate and prove that what I'm doing is real.
I hope I am doing and will continue to do a sufficient job, and hope that
the upcoming demos contribute to that more materially!</p>
<p>PPS: If, in the meanwhile, you're already excited, check out
the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins documentation</a>.
The most exciting stuff is coming in the next major release
(which will be out soon), which is when the distributed programming
tools will be made available to users of the system for the first time.
But if you want to get a head start, the code you'll be writing will

<p>I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about and drilling into the nature of personal information. I’ve been thinking about its role within society, and how we can find a risk-reward equilibrium (i.e., The Identity Nexus®) when it comes to the exchange of personal information between public institutions, private organizations, and people (i.e., data subjects).</p>



<p>To make this exercise manageable, I landed on three critical cornerstones that we should all consider to equitably manage and exchange personal information, namely privacy, security, and compliance.</p>



 Personal Information Management Cornerstones 



<p>The three cornerstones of personal information management are,</p>



  Privacy, the ability for a data subject to have agency over their phygital self, that is the ability to control the who, what, when, where, for how long, and for what purpose any entity can access and use their physical or digital self (aka personal information), or capital assets (i.e. the physical asset or any data produced by those assets, such as a connected car, house, clothes, phone, pet, etc.)  Security, the technologies and processes that ensure only authorized people, systems or services, etc. can access an individual’s physical and digital self or capital assets.   Compliance, the rules, the policies, the rights, and governance models that we all technologically and socially agree to follow when it comes to personal information management (e.g. collection, storage, aggregation, refinement, dissemination, exchange, valuation, etc.), and the punishment if any of these rules, policies, rights, and governance models are not followed or are breached.   



<p>I’ll write more on each of these cornerstones later, but I wanted to take a moment to talk about compliance briefly. </p>



 Personal Information Management Compliance 



<p>Without effective personal information management compliance, there will be little chance of achieving The Identity Nexus. People and their data will be “legally” abused (more than they are now), criminals will run amuck, and there will be a total loss of trust. We’ll be facing chaos, anarchy. </p>



<p>Regulations are an important and key element of personal information management compliance. Personal information management regulations are the society and industry laws and policies we all agree to and/or are subjected to to give people rights to their data and the guardrails we put on organizations’ to ensure that they properly steward people’s data.</p>



<p>For those whose job it is to write and manage regulations, wrapping one’s head around the nuances of all the personal information management regulations can be quite a challenge, and for the laymen, it can be nearly impossible. Luckily, we have organizations like the <a href="https://iapp.org">Intonational Association of Privacy Professionals</a> that does yeoman’s work in helping their members and the industry at large navigate the personal information regulatory landscape. </p>



 IAPP US State Comprehensive Privacy Law Comparison 



<p>On July 7, 2020, the IAPP released an update to its <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/state-comparison-table/">US state comprehensive privacy law comparison</a>, a matrix that evaluates the personal information management regulations in the works across the states. The matrix lists the stage each relevant privacy legislative effort is in within a given state, and the eight most common rights each law affords individuals and the eight obligations that organizations must adhere to (see the image below).</p>



 People’s personal information management rights 



  Right of access  Right of rectification  Right of deletion (aka right to be forgotten)  Right of restrictions  Right of portability  Right of opt-out  Right against automated decision making  Private right of actions  



 Organization’s obligations toward personal information stewardship 



  Strict age opt-in or opt-out or the prohibition on the sale of information   Notice/transparency requirement  Data breach notification  Risk assessments  Prohibition on discrimination when exercising rights  Purpose limitations  Processing limitations  Fiduciary duty  



<p>It is essential for every one of us to study and understand how these laws can benefit us personally and how they may affect our businesses, now and in the future. With this understanding we can then strive to find the equilibrium state for the flows of personal information within society, we can find The Identity Nexus. That is we can ensure that there is an equality of value exchange to risk amongst all those participating throughout the personal information management economy.</p>

  <p>Summary:      If your identity system doesn't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then it's not SSI.</p>


<a></a>
 

A few days ago I was in a conversation with a couple of my <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati">identerati</a> friends. When one used the term "SSI", the other asked him to define it since there were so many systems that were claiming to be SSI and yet were seemingly different. That's a fair question. So I thought I'd write down my definition in hopes of stimulating some conversation around the topic. 
<p></p>

<p>
    I think we've arrived at a place where it's possible to define SSI and get broad consensus about it. SSI stands for self-sovereign identity, but that's not really helpful since people have different ideas about what "sovereign" means and what "identity" means. So, rather than try to go down those rabbit holes, let's just stick with "SSI."1
</p>

<p>
    SSI has the following properties:
</p>
 
     SSI systems use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) to identify people, organizations, and things. Decentralized identifiers provide a cryptograhic basis for the system and can be employed so that they don't require a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers. Exchanging DIDs is how participants in SSI create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationships</a>, a critical feature. 
     

     SSI participants use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials exchange</a> to share information (attributes) with each other to strengthen or enrich relationships. The system provides the means of establishing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">credential fidelity</a>. 
     

     SSI supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">autonomy for participants</a>. The real value proposition of SSI is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy implies that participants interact as peers in the system. You can build systems that use DIDs and verifiable credentials without giving participants autonomy. 
     
 

<p>
    Beyond these there are lots of choices system architects are making. Debates rage about how specifically credential exchange should work, whether distributed ledgers are necessary, and, if so, how should they be employed. But if you don't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then you're not doing SSI.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence of these properties, participants in SSI systems use some kind of software agent (typically called a wallet for individuals) to create relationships and exchange credentials. They don't typically see or manage keys or passwords. And there's no artifact called an "identity." The primary artifacts are relationships and credentials. The user experience involves managing these artifacts to share attributes within relationships via credential exchange. This user experience should be common to all SSI systems, although the user interface and what happens under the covers might be different between SSI systems or vendors on those systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that, as we work more on interoperability, the implementation differences will fade away so that we have a single identity metasystem where participants have <a>choice about tools and vendors</a>. An identity metasystem is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios that the world presents us</a> and will support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">digital interactions that are life-like</a>. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     This is not to say I don't have opinions on what those words mean in this context. I've written about "sovereign" in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">Cogito, Ergo Sum</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">On Sovereignty</a>, and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">Self Sovereign is Not Self Asserted</a>.

<p>The following letter from a group of UK parliamentarians rings alarm bells that should awaken all of us – I suspect similar things are happening in the shadows well beyond the borders of the United Kingdom…</p>
<p>The letter recounts the sad story of one more politician with no need for science or expertise – for him, rigorous attention to what systems do to data protection and privacy can simply be dismissed as “bureaucracy”.&nbsp; Here we see a man in over his head – evidently unaware that failure to follow operational procedures protecting security and privacy introduces great risk and undermines both public trust and national security.&nbsp; I sincerely hope Mr. Hancock brings in some advisors who have paid their dues and know how this type of shortcut wastes precious time and introduces weakness into our technical infrastructure at a time when cyberattack by organized crime and nation states should get politicians to sober up and get on the case.</p>

<p>Dear Elizabeth Denham,</p>
<p>We are writing to you about the Government’s approach to data protection and privacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also the ICO’s approach to ensuring the Government is held to account.<br>
During the crisis, the Government has paid scant regard to both privacy concerns and data protection duties. It has engaged private contractors with problematic reputations to process personal data, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/it-started-as-1-now-its-1-million-wheres-the-mandate-for-letting-palantir-into-our-nhs/">Open Democracy and Foxglove</a>. It has built a data store of unproven benefit. It chose to build a contact tracing proximity App that centralised and stored more data than was necessary, without sufficient safeguards, as <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1284/documents/11453/default/">highlighted by the Human Rights Committee</a>. On releasing the App for trial, it failed to notify yourselves in advance of its Data Protection Impact Assessment – a fact <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/334/html/">you highlighted</a> to the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1037/documents/8502/default/">Human Rights Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Government has admitted breaching their data protection obligations by failing to conduct an impact assessment prior to the launch of their Test and Trace programme. They have only acknowledged this failing in the face of a threat of legal action by <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/app/uploads/2020/07/200715-PAP-Response-Letter.pdf">Open Rights Group</a>.The Government have highlighted your role at every turn, citing you as an advisor looking at the detail of their work, and using you to justify their actions.</p>
<p>On Monday 20 July, Matt Hancock indicated his disregard for data protection safeguards, saying to Parliament that “I will not be held back by bureaucracy” and claiming, against the stated position of the Government’s own legal service, that three DPIAs covered “all of the necessary”.</p>
<p>In this context, Parliamentarians and the public need to be able to rely on the Regulator. However, the Government not only appears unwilling to understand its legal duties, it also seems to lack any sense that it needs your advice, except as a shield against criticism.<br>
Regarding Test and Trace, it is imperative that you take action to establish public confidence – a trusted system is critical to protecting public health. The ICO has p<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/information-notices/enacted">owers to compel documents to understand data processing, contractual relations and the like (Information Notices</a>). The ICO has powers to assess <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/assessment-notices/enacted">what needs to change</a> (Assessment Notices). The ICO can demand particular changes are made (Enforcement notices).&nbsp; Ultimately the I<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/part/6/crossheading/enforcement-notices/enacted">CO has powers to fin</a>e Government, if it fails to adhere to the standards which the ICO is responsible for upholding.</p>
<p>ICO action is urgently required for Parliament and the public to have confidence that their data is being treated safely and legally, in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p>

<p>事後報告ですが、金融庁と日本経済新聞の共催の『Fin/Sum | BG2C 2020』に出演しました。本来は3月に行う予定だったものですが、新型コロナ禍により延期になっていたものです。</p>



<p>会場は東京は日本橋のコレド室町テラス３階の「室町三井ホール＆カンファレンス」で、座席はありましたが、ソーシャルディスタンスを撮っておりましたし、参加人数的にはちょっと寂しい感じで、麻生大臣はビデオメッセージ、その他の登壇者も多くはリモートという形でした。</p>



    ビデオ出演の麻生大臣  キーノートのメインホールの様子  モデレータの佐古早稲田大学教授j以外はリモート参加  松尾ジョージタウン大学教授はこのために来日、２週間の隔離生活  ルーム２はこんな感じ  珍しく日本のパネリストのみのパネル  <a></a><a></a><a></a>   



<p>わたしのセッションは、11:20からのBG2Cの一環としての「ブロックチェーンとアイデンティティ」というパネルディスカッションでした。モデレータのわたしだけが部屋にいて、登壇者の</p>



  <a>アイリーン・ヘルナンデス</a><br>GATACA<br>創業者 兼 CEO  <a>マリア・ヴァッチーノ</a><br>Easy Dynamics Corp.<br>ディレクター  <a>キム・キャメロン</a><br>Convergence Tech<br>チーフアイデンティティオフィサー<br>www.identityblog.comモデレーター  



<p>は、当然のことながら、それぞれ、スペイン、アメリカ、カナダからのリモート参加です。アイリーンは午前３時２０分からというすごい時間帯でしたが、ビシッと服装も整えておしゃれして出てくれました。もちろん、マリアもです。総じて海外パネリストは男性陣は髪ボサボサに対して女性陣はビシッとしてた感じがします。</p>



<p>しかし、こういうリモートのパネルはやっぱり心臓に悪いですね。リモート側の音が会場ではリバーブがかかりすぎてよく聞こえなかったりなど、コンディションが良くないですし、それ以前に、ちゃんとコールインしてくれるか、その時の回線は大丈夫か、などいろいろ不安要素があります。</p>



<p>そんなこんなで、自分のセッションのスクショとか取るの忘れてしまいました。主催者からそのうち写真や録音が出てくるのではないかと期待して…。</p>



<p>なお、Fin/Sum | BG2C では、他に２つのアンカンファレンスセッションにも出て、そのうち一つではファシリテーターをやらせていただきました。リモートのアンカンファレンスもなかなかおもしろい経験でした。</p>

<p>I host a <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">weekly call on distributed governance</a>. This blog provides my personal opinions but by all means view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">entire discussion here</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>One of the big debates in the Genesis DAO started by DAOstack was the question of anonymity. Should people be able to make proposals and ask for budgets without providing a real identity?</p><p>Part of the problem was a structural problem with DAOstack at the time: there was no escrow system. You could allocate funds to a project, but you could not hold the funds until the project was complete. In other words, everyone was paid up front for their project as soon as the group approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another aspect of the problem was human: we all feel a little weird chatting with someone faceless. On the discussion boards, one person could potentially have multiple pseudonyms. If we were discussing something controversial, it would be fairly easy for someone to pretend to be multiple people arguing for or against the proposal. It was also fairly easy to troll the system anonymously. It wasn’t as easy to game the voting, though it was certainly possible.</p> It Ain’t&nbsp;Real <p>The example of the Genesis DAO was somewhat trivial, because it was a small number of people who actually did know one another. None of the anonymous people seriously asked for budget (though there was an anonymous troll), the amounts of money in question weren’t huge, and it was a small enough community that everyone pretty much knew one&nbsp;another.</p><p>In real life, identity is fundamental to democracy. It amazes me how many people cherish their anonymity so much that this is under debate. <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">Our weekly chat</a> about anonymity was wide-ranging, and as usual, we came to the conclusion that “it depends.”</p> Does It Really&nbsp;Depend? <p>Personally, I think it doesn’t depend on the situation at all. At almost all stages of governance, you need to know some information about the person. You almost never need to know their actual name, but you almost always need to know, at a minimum, whether they have the right to influence a particular situation.</p><p>My minimum viable values statement about governance is: If the decision will impact you, you should have the ability to influence the decision. How much influence you should have is a different question. For example, if you are not an expert on hydroelectric dams, maybe you don’t get to decide where to build the dam, but if you live near the river, your perspective should be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>This isn’t the way democracy runs today. Corporations make decisions that impact their workers, customers and the environment with no regard for their opinions. Governments determine foreign policy without having any responsibility for the citizens of foreign countries who will be impacted by those policies. Lawmakers in one state make laws that influence neighboring states. We call that democracy. I digress but it’s important. We are completely normalized to a situation in which, as long as we feel fairly treated inside our organization, the external people’s feelings are irrelevant to what we call fair&nbsp;process.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;Name? <p>Throughout most of the decision-making process, therefore, full anonymity is not appropriate. Knowing people’s name isn’t particularly important, but in each stage of the process, some identifying information is helpful to democracy.</p>  In discussions and sentiment signalling, you need to know a person’s affiliation and expertise. Are they a resident? Do they work for the solar panel company? Are they an expert in urban planning? Is the electric company going to make a bid to buy up their land if this project is approved? Did they educate themselves and read multiple perspectives on the issue at hand? In the best of cases, you would also show an indicator of their reputation in the domains being discussed.  In problem definition, you need to know the person’s sentiment and perspective on the issue as well as something about their cognitive abilities. Are they good at detail or systems-wide analysis? Can they integrate multiple perspectives and listen well to others? Does the makeup of the problem-definition team appropriately represent enough different perspectives on the problem? Are they good at asking deeper questions, or do you use a highly-facilitated problem-definition process?  For proposal-making, while it is often optimal to let everyone propose ideas, it’s equally important to have the right experts in the room. Is this person an electrician or architect? Have they done other successful projects in this specific area? Again, the best ideas might come from someone who doesn’t have the proper background, but the process of solidifying the proposal needs to be grounded in&nbsp;reality.  For voting you need to know that this is the individual they said they were, and that they are voting in accordance with the rules of the voting&nbsp;system.  For execution of the decision, you need to know the qualifications of the people carrying out the&nbsp;work.  For accountability, oversight and assessment of the process, you need to know the qualifications and the vested interests of the&nbsp;people.  Finally, for whistle-blowing, you need some level of anonymity but you may also need verifiable evidence. Throughout the entire process, there needs to be some mechanism for people to give feedback safely when their own self-interest might be endangered. Scientists at a chemical company are the best qualified to expose if there might be unpublished side-effects to some new product. If there are good enough privacy and anonymity controls, such information could be leaked more transparently while verifying the reliability of the&nbsp;sources.   Collapsing reality and&nbsp;desire <p>One of the reasons people clamor for anonymity is that the tech collapses our identity and name and private data. Identity isn’t just your name. All of your data doesn’t have to be identified in every transaction — collapsing these concepts is sloppy and leads people to think there are only two possibilities: complete anonymity and complete exposure.</p><p>Identifying yourself by your name is the easiest way for people to eliminate anonymity, but it exposes more information than is necessary. I think that most of the debate over anonymity is due to the fact that we haven’t found creative ways to de-couple someone’s actual name from other attributes about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Technically, it would be possible to create a system where someone has a different name to different people. I would look at all of Alice’s posts and develop an opinion of her. You might be looking at Andrea’s posts — not knowing that Andrea and Alice were actually the same person, but anonymized so that when we met this person in real life, let’s say it’s really Alexa, we wouldn’t be able to attribute that information to her unless she wanted us to. She might appear differently on different forums, because she’s more of an expert in oceanography than in architecture. That’s an extreme implementation, but it’s just one example of how technology can be used to provide us the information we need to form opinions online without compromising someone’s identity.</p><p>As soon as we recognize that we can develop solutions for allowing different levels of participation and providing the data we need without exposing something sensitive, we can start to have a conversation about the need for anonymity in specific situations.</p><p>Enjoy our <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">talk about anonymity and democracy</a>. Most people don’t agree with me on the call! Feel free to join us. We have new topics every week, and <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">the call is open to&nbsp;all</a>.</p>

<p>Many readers will already know that I retired from Microsoft after twenty years working as Chief Architect of Identity and other related roles. I had a great time there, and Microsoft adopted the Laws of Identity in 2005 at a time when most tech companies were still under dark influence of “Privacy is Dead”, building systems destined to crash at endless cost into a privacy-enabled future. Microsoft is a big complicated place, but Bill Gates and Satya Nadella were as passionate as me about moving Microsoft and the industry towards digital identity respectful of the rights of individuals and able to empower both individuals and organizations.  I thank them and all my wonderful colleagues and friends for a really great ride. </p>
<p>In the last years I led Microsoft to support Decentralized Identity as the best way to recognize the needs and rights of individual people, as well as the way to move enterprises and governments past the security problems, privacy roadblocks and dead ends that had resulted from the backend systems of the last century.  Truly exciting, but I needed more time for my personal life.</p>
<p>I love being completely in control of my time, but my interest in digital identity is a keen as ever. So besides working with a small startup in Toronto called Convergence Tech on exciting innovation around Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity, I’ve decided to start blogging again.  I will, as always, attempt to dissuade those responsible for the most egregious assaults on the Laws of Identity.  Beyond that, I share my thoughts on developments in the world of Decentralized Identity and technology that enfranchises the individual person so each of us can play our role in a democratic and secure digital future.</p>

<p>Cloud security is about much more than security functionality. The top cloud providers all seem to have a capable suite of security features and most surveyed organizations report that they see all the top cloud platforms as generally secure. So, why do 92% of surveyed organizations still <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report/">report</a> a cloud security readiness gap? They’re not comfortable with the security implications of moving workloads to cloud even if they believe it’s a secure environment and even if the platform offers a robust set of security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Two contributing factors to that gap include:</p>  78% reported that cloud requires different security than on-prem. With security skills at a shortage, the ability to quickly ramp up on a new architecture and a new set of security capabilities can certainly slow progress.<br>  Only 8% of respondents claimed to fully understand the cloud security shared responsibilities model; they don’t even know what they’re responsible for; never mind how to implement the right policies and procedures, hire the right people, or find the right security technologies.  <p>I recently posted about how Oracle is addressing the gap  on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a>. There's a link in the post to a new whitepaper from Dao Research that evaluates the cloud security capabilities offered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Oracle took some criticism for arriving late to the game with our cloud infrastructure offering. But, several years of significant investments are paying off. Dao's research concludes that “Oracle has an edge over Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as it provides a more centralized security configuration and posture management, as well as more automated enforcement of security practices at no additional cost. This allows OCI customers to enhance overall security without requiring additional manual effort, as is the case with AWS, Azure, and GCP.”<br></p><p>A key take-away for me is that sometimes, the competitive edge in security in delivered through simplicity and ease of use. We've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2012/12/complexity_the_worst.html">heard</a> over and over for several years that complexity is the enemy of security. If we can remove human error, bake-in security by default, and automate security wherever possible, then the system will be more secure than if we're relying on human effort to properly configure and maintain the system and its security.<br></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Click here to check out the post and the Dao Research whitepaper</a>.<br></p>

<p>Back in 2019, the <a href="http://www.datumfuture.org">Datum Future</a> and <a href="http://www.globalwebindex.com">GlobalWebindex</a> released a study, <a href="https://www.datumfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Data-Confidence-Index-Datum-Future-and-GWI-2019.pdf">The Data Confidence Index</a>. This study is as relevant today as when it was released. According to Catherine Mayer of Datum Future, with this study, they set out to explore the differences between people’s privacy attitudes and their privacy protection behaviors.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Data Confidence Index is a measure of expressed privacy concerns against online privacy behaviours</p></blockquote>



<p>When calculating the data confidence index, the researchers assessed people’s attitudes toward data usage and safety across three privacy concerns: 1) concerns related to how companies use data, 2) concerns about the Internet eroding privacy, and 3) the desire for anonymity online. The authors then indexed these privacy concerns against five privacy protection behaviors, 1) deleting cookies, 2) using a private browser, 3) using an ad-blocker, and 4) VPN use to stay anonymous online and for hiding browser activity.</p>



 The Findings 



<p>The following figure shows the index across 41 countries with 0 representing the people with the most confidence in their ability to engage in privacy protecting-behaviors that are in line with their privacy concerns, and 2.0 representing those with the least confidence to do so; the study suggests that the Taiwanese are the least confident and the Swedes are the most confident about their data.</p>



    



 Discussion 



<p>This is a valuable study. It helps us better understand people’s privacy concerns in relation to their behaviors, and it can be useful for understanding market personas and for targeting specific countries with privacy-enhancing technologies.</p>



 Study limitations 



<p>The study, however, does have its limitations. The authors point out that individual cultures, demographics, and experiences influence people’s privacy attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, attitudes towards privacy and related behaviors are impacted by a country’s collectivist or individualist orientation, with individualist cultures expecting individuals to take more responsibility for themselves, while collectivist cultures look to society, e.g. government, to do so. In addition, the level of Internet penetration in a country and the extent to which digital behaviors are more tightly aligned to social and media behaviors vs. lifestyle activities, like communications and paying the bills, are important to consider. All these factors may play a role in privacy attitudes and behaviors but are not taken into consideration by the researchers in this study.</p>



 Other privacy protection behaviors to consider 



<p>In addition to the limitations above, I’d like to add one of my own. The study only looks at five privacy protection behaviors; however, there are many <a href="https://identitypraxis.com/2019/04/27/youre-being-scored-what-it-means-for-your-privacy/">other considerations and behaviors</a> that users can and should engage in if they truly want to take control of their data and privacy.</p>



<p>A summary of just a few of the leading privacy-protecting behaviors, including those above, are,</p>



  Using an independent cross-platform password manager, and most importantly not reusing usernames and passwords across accounts, or sharing passwords  Sharing an alias name, provide false data, when appropriate  Limit information sharing on social media and in other apps  Employing an identity aliasing tools, such as email, credit card, and phone number aliasing solution  Installing a tracker manager (aka ad-blocker)  Turning on and using MFA (multi-factor authentication) on accounts  Activating and keeping current anti-virus on computers and mobile devices: block viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing  Installing and using anti-keylogger software on your computer  Installation and using Webcam blocker software, or take the easier route and put on and use a webam cover  Private, “safe”, browser (NOT incognito mode)  Enabling mobile SIM card protection with a PIN code  Installing and keeping current an Internet network monitoring solution  Using a VPN whenever connected to a public WiFi network  Monitoring credit scores and accounts  Subscribing to a darknet monitoring service  Using services like Apple Pay and Google Pay  Communicating through encrypted messaging or email apps  Having identity insurance and access to fraud restoration services  Enacting regulatory rights and asking companies for a copy of their data  Being wary of phishing and other common fraud, never giving out sensitive information  Reading terms &amp; conditions and privacy policies before signing up for a service or downloading and installing apps  Use anonymous payment methods  Delete or cancel unused social media and other accounts  Cancel or don’t go through with a transaction if the site or vendor does not “feel” trustworthy  Change default privacy settings on a device or application  Validate tax information on file at <a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>  Keeping an eye out for the emergence of personal information management solutions (more on this later in future articles)  



<p>These are just a handful of the many behaviors that people can engage in to safely and securely navigate the Internet and build their data confidence and peace-of-mind.</p>



<p>In summary, there is so much more we can do. When looking at the data confidence index, only 2 of 41 countries are generally confident the vast majority of people of moderate to high concerns.</p>



 Study Methodology 



<p>The study is based on GlobalWebIndex’s data from the Q1 – Q4 2018 research waves among a sample of 391,130 internet users aged 16 – 64 across 41 markets in which GlobalWebIndex tracks online privacy behaviors.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro-credentials, incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and instantly trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a personally held wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in interoperable achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. The lead author of that piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, also leads a group called the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/university-led-digital-credentials-consortium-explores-technology-digital-academic-credentials">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). DCC includes 14 intrepid schools, including the likes of MIT and Harvard, developing interoperability of achievements that are literally carried by the achievers. They also <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf">see VCs</a> as the basis for this interoperability, and are making exciting progress.</p><p>My conclusion: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad, even global academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that can securely transport the achievement or LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers, via the achiever&nbsp;herself.</p><p>By using this same VC technology for student ID, a school does three critical things to lay the foundation for later exchanging achievements:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by the school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?

Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.

Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system. Better to start a new identity project with self-sovereign student ID, which can begin to consolidate systems and reduce complexity, than build another layer that may well add to&nbsp;it.</p> In Conclusion <p>For those interested primarily in achievements, ID is an “and” and not an “or,” and it should come first, as it lays a technical and familiarity foundation for achievements to be issued and quickly useful. Communications could come soon after ID, because it becomes available as soon as the first connection with a student is&nbsp;created.</p><p>Achievements will come later, after the necessary consensus among schools and employers has been sorted to establish semantic meaning and interoperability for exchanged data payloads. Then this model — of people receiving, controlling, and sharing their achievements in a digital, verifiable form — will become the norm, and the future of work will become the&nbsp;present.</p><p>Until that day, schools can leap right past proprietary digital ID solutions and go straight to self-sovereign, and reap all its benefits without having to wait for anyone else to agree to anything, giving students a modern digital experience they’ll&nbsp;love.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-1-of-2-d3104ab0f8f2">Part 1: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</a></blockquote><p>¹ Down the road, VCs could also be used for authorization, where granular-level permissions and entitlements are carried and presented by individuals, simplifying the administration of centralized policy-based access control and moving enforcement to the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>Special thanks to several helpful reviewers, editors, and contributors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnphillips11kps/">John Phillips</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Dr. Phil Windley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phil Long</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-perry-1b7a254/">Scott Perry</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinkelk/">Alan Davies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taykendesign/">Taylor Kendal</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-hailstone-92a1a51/">Matthew Hailstone</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product, and do not result in vendor lock-in; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. As a partner of venture studio <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, a startup now developing a self-sovereign student ID&nbsp;product.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID: students independently store verifiable data, and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: strong, passwordless login, KBA-free call in, &amp; cardless walk in; secure, keyless facility and systems access; prove skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; breakthrough fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent; and&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions.  <a href="https://link.medium.com/W3o6duQc19">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a>  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal — which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? I think it’s because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship with those students.</p><p>I’ll discuss this more in “Why Self-Sovereign” below.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the physical and digital bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things wherever they want by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between their container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet, and shares proofs of with others when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not credentials, they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), received a degree, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from iPhone to Samsung and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>By “useful” I mean it can be used for many important, new, relevant purposes and also make expected and ordinary uses&nbsp;better.</p><p>I’ll organize the usefulness of self-sovereign student ID into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within this Part 1 and is where I’ll delve the most deeply. I’ll touch on the remaining categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC presentation and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a digital, and therefore more powerful, version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords, and social login, and can be used in conjunction with or as a substitute for&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, identity or otherwise. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with any other desired information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because shared secrets (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics, location and more can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards, so tools from different vendors can be interoperable. This means that your school isn’t locked into a single vendor and can replace a vendor without reissuing IDs (try that with a traditional ID system). Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS. You don’t have to worry that any vendor selected for digital student IDs can’t support your diverse campus needs, or that you’re stuck with lousy quality or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Use of student ID becomes no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet (note the irony) with some of a student’s VCs, greatly expanding the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items the student can carry and benefit from, and making it much harder for a fraudster to get away with swapping out the name, photo, ID number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>Who doesn’t want fewer usernames and passwords to deal with? With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call; when walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than repeatedly treated as a stranger.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have it. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. And by minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence that they did so, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors, a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>And that’s not a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into how this can occur within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For most, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and immediately felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And of course, ID is a prerequisite for most other use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by verifying who you’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be a fraction of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. The uses discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> are cool and exciting, but just icing on the&nbsp;cake.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

  Sqitch v0.9998: Now with Snowflake support, an improved Homebrew tap, and the quickest way to get started: the new [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/).

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>
enables <a href="https://docs.docker.com/network/host/" title="Docker documentation: “Use host networking”">host networking</a>, so on Linux, at least, you should be able to
connect to <code>localhost</code> to deploy your changes. On <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Mac”">macOS</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds" title="Docker documentation: “Networking features in Docker for Windows”">Windows</a>, use
the <code>host.docker.internal</code> host name. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture. Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships, what is allowed, and what is behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by an intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a>: No one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define its menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has a credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.
</p>


 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.  
     See Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">nice summary</a> of James C. Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.
      See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff for a detailed (705 page) exploration of this idea.  
     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifer for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>
<p>All are encouraged to review these drafts in advance of the formal OpenID Foundation review period for them, which should commence in a few weeks.  If you believe that changes are needed before they become Final Specifications, please file issues describing the proposed changes.  Discussion on the <a href="mailto:openid-specs-ab@lists.openid.net">OpenID Connect mailing list</a> is also encouraged.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for writing the initial logout certification tests.  And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_panva">Filip Skokan</a> for providing resolutions to two of the thornier Session Management issues.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground. As Peter Drucker famously said, “Innovate or&nbsp;die”.</p><p>References</p><p>Figure 1: A Verifiable Credentials Primer, by Manu Sporny, Digital&nbsp;Bazaar</p><p>W3C Verifiable Credentials - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/digital-credentials-for-a-safer-world-37a2e1694791">Digital Credentials for a Safer World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>来る日本時間7月28日午前3:30から、「So You Want to Base on Consent?」というタイトルでIdentiverseで講演します。</p>



<p>このタイトルは、グレン・グールドの「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲から着想を得たもので、ある意味無謀なことを、といいながら、じゃぁどうしたらよいのかということをISO/IEC 29184 から抽出してお話します。</p>



<p>この「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲の出だしの歌詞、こうなんです。</p>



<blockquote><p>So you want to write a fugue?<br>You’ve got the Urge to write a fugue, <br>You’ve got the nerve to write a fugue, <br>So go ahead. </p>Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue (1963)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、フーガが書きたいとな？<br>フーガを書きたいという衝動があり、<br>フーガを書くという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p>上記：私訳</blockquote>



<p>出だしでそう歌って、フーガの様々な技法をこの曲の中で紹介していきます。</p>



 

 Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue? (1963)



<p>「フーガを書きたいを」、「同意で取り扱いたい」で置き換えたのがこの講演です。いわば、</p>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、同意でやりたいとな？<br>同意でやりたいという衝動があり、<br>同意でやりきるという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p></blockquote>

<p>So You Want to Base on Consent?</p>



<p>Many people seem to believe that having their customers pressing “Agree” button is good enough to collect their “consent”. That’s actually not the case. Obtaining privacy consent has very high bar partly because that is the exception mechanism that you can resort to only when other lawful bases for the processing of personal data does not work.</p>



<p>This session will briefly touch on other lawful bases and what is needed for potentially valid consent, then goes on to explain the requirements for privacy notice and consent process set out in “ISO/IEC 29184 Online privacy notices and consent”.</p>



<p>ISO/IEC 29184 is an international standard that has been in making for the last 5 years. Stakeholders involved in the discussion included data protection authorities around the globe, technical community, lawyers, and businesses. It sets out the requirements for 1) What are needed to be in a privacy notice, 2) What are needed to be done in obtaining the consent, 3) What are needed to be done in the maintenance of privacy notices. For any business that wants to respect customer privacy, this document provides excellent guidance on what needs to be followed.<br>Speaker/s: Nat Sakimura<br>Topic: Privacy</p>

My first attempt at the <a href="https://ondemand.thestand.co.uk/Video/EGMEGL/the_cabaret_of_dangerous_ideas">Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas</a>. Scary…</p>
<p>I was nervous and I know I could have conveyed my thoughts with more clarity and coherence. I virtually missed out my section on trust - our way of navigating the uncertainties of our environment. Still, I am grateful for the opportunity and everyone who helped make it happen. I largely enjoyed myself. And I learnt a lot. I look forward to hopefully attempting a full show next year!</p>
<p>My show, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/in-control">#AreYouInControl?</a>, was an attempt to condense and convey a period of reflection into the role and impact identity technology in the complex system that is human society. A web of relationships and influence that limit and expand the possibilities of individuals as they navigate uncertainty and seek to optimise some values perceived to be important in a given context at a given moment in time and space. </p>
<p>My background is not in social science, I research digital identity, privacy and to lesser extent cryptography. The digital world represents this fascinatingly tangled mesh of human social and economic interaction. It has infinitely expanded the set of possible possibilities. The fact that we could run a virtual show is a testament to the expansion of capabilities to interact. It has also created new risks - privacy, security, surveillance, manipulation. And new constraints on interaction, the set of characters and emojis we can use to communicate with, the mechanisms we use to identify and authenticate others, the set of possible actions a platform supports.</p>
<p>These new environments that we exist within are no longer inanimate, they are designed, developed and populated by human beings. The environment has become a source of data, a digital representation of collective memory. Whether intentionally or not, the constraints, risks and possibilities emergent in these virtual spaces are perceived subjectively by each of us. There can be little doubt that these systems present powerful mechanisms for influence at the individual, group and societal level.</p>
<p>The challenge that we must all grapple with, is power to who? For what purpose? Who decides?</p>
<p>Digital technology is neither good nor bad. It is up to us to decide the values these virtual spaces incentivise, what rules they enforce, who they benefit and how they can be changed.</p>
<p>So are you in control?</p>
<p>No, but is control something we should aspire for?. Uncertainty and independent thought is <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3620295.html">the difference that makes a difference</a> in our complex human system. We should embrace it and protect it.</p>
<p>Instead of control, we should strive for influence and agency driven through intention and the freedom from the intrusive influence of others intentionally kept beyond our awareness. I am interested in technology that can foster cooperation, participation and democratic governance among individuals so they can become empowered agents for change in our society.</p>
<p>I am not sure how much of the above I managed to convey. What can I say, I certainly was not in control despite the influence I attempted to exert through practice and preparation.</p>

CREDIT: © DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY / ALAMY/DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY /&nbsp;ALAMY This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</p> TL;DR:   Most organizations aren’t digitally connected to one another, creating “trust domain” barriers that are slow, manual, and expensive to traverse.  Similar to shipping containers, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can bridge trust domains between and within organizations, by using you as their&nbsp;courier.  The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains from many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear.   The Barriers VCs Can Bridge: Trust&nbsp;Domains <a href="https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region">https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region</a><p>Today, if you’re applying for a loan at your financial institution (FI) and need to prove your employment, how can you do so digitally, instantly? You can’t, in most cases. Why? Because it’s not feasible for every FI to have a direct, digital connection to every possible employer they may need data from. The same boundaries exist between schools, when a student transfers and desires to receive credit for classes taken: it’s untenable for every school to have a direct connection to every other&nbsp;school.</p><p>This leaves FI’s, employers, schools and other organizations in separate, unconnected trust domains, unable to directly exchange trusted data and reliant on manual processes, often through third-party data brokers acting as intermediaries. Exchanging data between trust domains today is analogous to the manual, labor-intensive “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">break-bulk</a>” process used for millennia for all global trade prior to shipping containers, and is similarly slow, complicated, and expensive.</p><p>This is also why VC adoption may be resisted by incumbent data intermediaries as vigorously as <a href="https://www.discovercontainers.com/a-complete-history-of-the-shipping-container/">labor unions protested shipping containers</a>.</p><p>And this is the same reason we have so many usernames and passwords in the first place: there is no universal way to traverse trust domains in the digital realm. Identity federations within a single trust domain, like what’s offered by the current IAM industry to large organizations, solve this problem elegantly. But cross-domain identity federations, however, have repeatedly attempted to address this and <a href="http://lockstep.com.au/library/identity_authentication/the-false-allure-of-federated.html">failed for various reasons</a>, leaving the problem unresolved and ballooning.</p><p>The boundaries between digital trust domains are understandably high, as the stakes can be high, the risk of fraud ever-present, and fraudsters can comfortably apply their trade from anywhere. We know these boundaries well:</p>  Having many usernames and passwords  Cumbersome forms and onboarding processes  Verbally authenticating when calling a service center, and re-authenticating when being transferred  Waiting for agreements to be signed or consent to be&nbsp;given  Waiting for any kind of application to be&nbsp;approved  Slow verifications of any kind of documents, records  Many slow and/or tedious processes that rely on verifications  <p>Any time you are slowed down or prevented from doing something because you can’t quickly prove something, it’s a manifestation of boundaries between trust domains, much like the bygone situation in shipping that necessitated “break-bulk.” If gatekeepers, human or automated, could quickly verify everything they needed to verify, they could quickly open their&nbsp;gates.</p><p>With VCs, they now&nbsp;can.</p> How VCs Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains <p>This post already assumes a basic understanding of how VCs work, but at the risk of being redundant, I want readers to understand, mechanically, how VCs bridge trust&nbsp;domains.</p><a href="https://despair.com/products/dysfunction">https://despair.com/products/dysfunction</a><p>I think this ^^ is one of the funnier “demotivators” at despair.com, a site everyone should check out for a good laugh. As with most humor, what makes a demotivator funny is the thread of truth that runs through&nbsp;it.</p><p>The relevant truth in this poster is this: the only consistent feature in ALL of your relationships — not just your dissatisfying ones — is you. You are the common factor between all your employers, your FIs, your schools, and every other organization you deal with, and that makes you the ideal courier of data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>If only you had the data… and if only it could be trusted when you delivered it…</p><p>Well, this is where our super duper data shipping container comes in, the VC. Here’s how it all comes together:</p>  You start with an empty digital SSI wallet. Not the Apple kind or Android kind or anything else similarly proprietary and non-portable, but a standardized self-sovereign digital wallet that’s all yours, where you literally hold the digital keys to&nbsp;it.  You offer/accept connections to/from other people, organizations, or things using QR codes or other means of bootstrapping. These are peer-to-peer relationships that you now own and control, and not through some platform or company where they could be seen, controlled, or taken away from&nbsp;you.  When VCs are offered to you by your connections, you choose whether to accept them into your wallet. When you do, you’re now a “holder.” An entity who gives you a VC, whether person, organization, or thing, is called an “issuer.”  When you want to prove something to someone, or share verifiable data, you must first connect with them (#2) then you can share one or more of your VCs. You can also share a subset of data from a VC and not the whole thing, or just proof that you have a VC, or a compound proof from multiple&nbsp;VCs.  In seconds, verifiers can verify four things about what you’ve&nbsp;shared:    Who (or what) issued it to&nbsp;you  It was issued to you and not someone&nbsp;else  It hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  It hasn’t been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer  <p>Voila! Data has just left one trust domain and been accepted into another, without any direct connections between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Most important: verifiers can confirm these four things cryptographically, without having to contact the original issuer. If verifiers had to contact the original issuer to confirm things, that defeats the whole purpose and we’d be back to square one. But they don’t, so we’re not, and that changes everything.</p><p>By using you as the courier of verifiable data between organizations you deal with, unrelated trust domains now have a bridge, and without requiring direct connections to one another. The key to making this all work is that issuers, holders, and verifiers all use the same interoperable protocols. This is why cooperation among competitors and the VC standards work¹ is critical, and exciting that it has made so much progress over the last several&nbsp;years.</p> The Vast Potential of Verifiable Credentials CREDIT: Evernym,&nbsp;Inc.<p>The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains for many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear:</p>  No more usernames or passwords, replaced by trusted&nbsp;VCs  No more forms, quick and easy onboarding everywhere  No more verbal authentication, you’re recognized everywhere you choose to&nbsp;be  Instant, digital, multi-party consent (after waiting for slow humans to decide something)  Instant application approvals  Instant verifications of documents, records  The efficient exchange of any trusted information  <p>The effects for user experience would be wonderful. Friction from trying new vendors, products, and services would reduce to almost nothing. Customers can be instantly recognized as valued guests rather than treated as strangers at each new interaction. Processes and workflows can be simplified, automated, and accelerated, and new, nearly seamless experiences offered.</p> In Conclusion <p>The current inability for data to efficiently traverse trust domains bears a striking resemblance to global trade complexities prior to 1956; Verifiable Credentials bear a striking resemblance to its revolutionary solution, the shipping container.</p><p>Due to the enormous physical, logistical and even political obstacles to adoption, it took shipping containers more than a decade to hit their stride, for everyone to realize their potential. With VCs it will happen much more quickly, as much of our world is already digital, and connected.</p><p>I have often said during my five years in SSI that the tech titans of tomorrow are being created today, and I believe that now more than ever.

<a href="https://www.atclogistic.net/service/">https://www.atclogistic.net/service/</a> This is part 2 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p> TL;DR:   Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t just functionally similar to shipping containers, they are economically similar as well, and will bring an explosion in global digital trade like shipping containers brought for global physical trade. The right container at the right time can change the world, dramatically.  Shipping containers caused a precipitous drop in shipping costs (over 95%) by bridging the physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks; VCs can deliver a similar cost reduction in the digital realm, by bridging the contexts between organizations.  The transitive trust enabled by VCs enables cooperative network effects, which are even bigger than regular network&nbsp;effects.   If VCs Are Economically Similar to Shipping Containers, It’s a Big&nbsp;Deal <p>The comparison of VCs to shipping containers is much more than a passing one. This analogy, which I’ve been using in presentations and conversations for the last couple of months, has been a big improvement when teaching the basic concept of VCs from a functional standpoint. It is simple, clear, and everyone seems to quickly understand it, a rare breath of messaging fresh air in a world of confusing SSI&nbsp;lingo.</p><p>But more important than messaging clarity, if VCs are economically similar to shipping containers, the ramifications to the digital economy are hard to overstate; everyone in SSI will be in for one heckuva&nbsp;ride.</p><p>In fact, I believe this possibility — that Verifiable Credentials are economically similar to shipping containers — could be the most impactful business realization of my lifetime.</p> The Right Container = Economic Explosion <p>From a humble beginning in 1956, “containerization” brought an explosion in global trade and became “more of a driver of globalisation than all trade agreements in the past 50 years taken together,” according to <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero">The Economist</a>.</p><p>But how?</p><p>Before 1956, when shipping containers were invented by trucking entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, the world already had containers of many kinds — barrels, bags, boxes and crates — that needed to be painstakingly emptied when a ship arrived at port, and contents moved into other containers on trucks and trains. This manual “break-bulk” process, unchanged for millennia, was slow, complicated, dangerous, and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Instead, Mr. McLean envisioned a container that was sturdy, stackable, secure, and most important: moved intact from a truck onto a train or a ship, and then back again when a ship reached its destination, without being re-packed along the way. It took a few years to really take off, but when shipping containers proved their immense usefulness in the Vietnam war it became clear they were the future, and the ISO then introduced the first shipping container standards that the industries of ships, trains, and trucks would begin to adhere&nbsp;to.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.</p><p>The efficiency gains were so dramatic that producers of raw materials and small manufacturers in every corner of the world could now market their products to every other corner of the world, changing global trade forever. “Made in China” wouldn’t be a thing today without “containerization.”</p> From $5.86 to&nbsp;$.16 <p>There were many other containers in existence prior to 1956; why did this particular container make such a disproportionate difference?</p><p>“<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Trans-contextual value transfer</a>,” is the answer, in economic terms, my colleague Dr. Sam Smith would use, the ability to efficiently move value between the very different contexts of ships, trucks, and trains. By moving the entire container, and not emptying it until it has reached its final destination, the break-bulk process was eliminated entirely, causing a precipitous drop in shipping times and overall transaction costs. Stunningly, the price to unload one ton of goods fell from <a href="https://traderiskguaranty.com/trgpeak/history-shipping-containers/">$5.86 in 1956 to only $.16&nbsp;today</a>.</p><p>Whenever transaction costs are reduced there is an increase in transactions proportional to the reduction¹, and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>Bridging contexts in any arena is hard, and expensive, but the gains from discovering how to do it efficiently can be enormous. Standardized shipping containers bridged physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks and changed the world forever; VCs will do a similar thing for data, lowering transaction costs by efficiently bridging contexts between trust&nbsp;domains.</p> VCs Do for Data What Shipping Containers Did for Physical&nbsp;Goods <a href="http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/">http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/</a><p>Trust domains and how VCs bridge them, mechanically, is the subject of Part 3 of this series, “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How VCs Bridge Trust Domains</a>,” and so will not be treated fully here, but a quick summary seems appropriate.</p><p>The current process of moving trusted data between unconnected organizations is uncannily similar to the break-bulk shipping process prior to 1956: data must be carefully removed from the data containers of the sending organization and re-packaged into the data containers of the receiving organization. As an example, just ask anyone in the know how academic transcripts in the U.S. are really exchanged between schools today: it is manual, slow, complicated, expensive, and often requires the paid help of 3rd-party intermediaries. Again, this is strikingly similar to break-bulk.</p><p>VCs address this chasm how shipping containers did. Data senders (“issuers”) and data receivers (“verifiers”) first agree on a standardized container². Issuers pack VCs with a desired payload and then issue it, either to the wallet of an individual “holder” or into storage in a database or blockchain. When verified, the verifier can rely on the fidelity of the data payload because they can <a href="https://link.medium.com/Jj8ynRY0e8">verify the provenance and fidelity of the container it came in</a>, and critically, perform that verification cryptographically without contacting the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>We don’t yet know to what degree VCs will reduce costs. Earlier I cited the more than 95% drop in costs shipping containers delivered; that level of efficiency wasn’t fully realized until most ships, trains, and trucks had made modifications to adhere to the standards and were in full production. The same thing will happen with VCs. While it will take some time, with the complete elimination of “break-bulk”-style data exchange, and of the then-obsolete data middlemen and their associated time, cost, and manual processes, the cost reduction will be&nbsp;massive.</p><p>When comparing VCs and shipping containers, you discover the nature of the problem they address is similar, the way they address it is similar, and the size of the markets — global physical trade and global e-commerce — is arguably similar. It follows that the reduction in transactions costs, proportional increase in transactions, and overall economic impact would be similar,&nbsp;too.</p> VCs Unlock Global Network&nbsp;Effects <p>Another, related dimension of the economic impact VCs will have on the digital economy, and one that’s more familiar than shipping containers but potentially just as impactful, is network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>VCs enable a powerful kind of network effect, a cooperative network-of-networks effect. Deeper research into how SSI and VCs enable cooperative network effects has been done by Dr. Samuel Smith, my partner at Digital Trust Ventures, in his seminal paper, <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Meta-Platforms and Cooperative Network-of-Networks Effects</a>, so I will only summarize Sam’s findings&nbsp;here.</p><p>When networks “cooperate,” some value from one network is transferable to another. Cooperative network effects are inter-network and exponentially greater than intra-network effects, like comparing the internet to AOL. To understand cooperative network effects it’s helpful to first understand its cousin: competitive network effects³.</p><p>The ride sharing industry offers an excellent example of competitive network effects. When Uber acquires a new driver, that driver becomes more likely to also drive for Lyft, Uber’s direct competitor. Though Uber and Lyft may wish it were not so, every driver and rider gained by one network is just clicks away from being gained by the other, which is unfortunate for whoever spent large sums to first gain them. This effect accelerates competition, adds price pressure, and sows the seeds of mass defection if it ever becomes advisable. Of course there is a selfishly beneficial tradeoff too, when your network gains from another’s expansion.</p><p>In contrast, cooperative network-of-network effects occur when growth in one network benefits other, non-competitive networks. Literally, customers gained in one network or industry are accretive to other, non-competitive and even completely unrelated networks or industries.</p><p>For example, several credit unions (CUs) in the U.S. are now issuing VCs to members to enable a secure, streamlined experience when they call in, walk in, or log in; they call it <a href="https://www.memberpass.com">MemberPass</a>. While the first use cases are limited to within the issuing CU, any entity in any industry could also choose to accept MemberPass and offer a sleek onboarding and login experience that eliminates forms and passwords for anyone presenting one. What website wouldn’t prefer instant onboarding and authentication of new customers presenting cryptographically verifiable credentials issued by regulated U.S. financial institutions, instead of the friction of forms, usernames, and breachable passwords they’re forced to offer&nbsp;today?</p><p>Every new MemberPass issued becomes a new, easily onboardable prospective customer for any entity anywhere that accepts VCs, online or off. And value flows both ways, as CUs benefit from increased satisfaction whenever members successfully use MemberPass, from increased value provided to members and the loyalty that engenders, and from increased demand for MemberPass from both existing and prospective CU&nbsp;members.</p><p>These are cooperative network effects indeed, as they foster cross-industry collaboration. The only obstacle is awareness.</p><p>This kind of cooperation between unrelated networks, both intentional and unintentional, has rarely been observed or achievable, but with VCs becomes predictable. The resulting ‘meta’ network effects — <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Smith’s Law</a> — are exponential compared to intra-network effects, and also beyond <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29066/metcalfes-law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>. If you’re a student of the science of network effects, be sure to check out <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Sam’s paper</a>. You’re in for a treat; the math for this is incredible.</p> In Conclusion <p>Shipping containers were a once-in-a-lifetime improvement in global trade, forever bridging the physical barriers between ships, trains, and trucks. VCs are the shipping containers of the digital realm, bridging trust domain barriers between organizations, departments, and even internal&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Shipping containers brought an unprecedented multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar global economic expansion by dramatically reducing transaction costs for physical goods; VCs will do the same for digital goods, and economically change the world to a similar magnitude.</p><p>If that were VCs only economic value, it would be more than enough. VCs also enable cooperative network-of-network effects, where issuances in one industry can benefit other, non-competitive industries, potentially many of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Excited yet?

 This is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials.

Having containers inside of containers is a feature, not a&nbsp;bug.  Like physical credentials, the VC container is always verifiable, not its data&nbsp;payload.   The Credential That&nbsp;Isn’t <p>Despite their name, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t really credentials; they are containers, much like shipping containers for data, which actually makes them more useful and powerful than if they were credentials.</p><p>NOTE: The comparison to shipping containers is more than a passing one, as shipping containers are the most impactful containers ever devised and VCs are strikingly similar to them, both functionally and economically. Details of these similarities and their potential ramifications are covered in parts <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">2</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">3</a> of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>Like a shipping container, there’s a sender, called the “issuer”, who packs a VC’s data contents. The receiver of the VC container, called the “verifier”, unpacks and verifies its payload (or a subset proof thereof). Between issuers and verifiers there is typically a human carrying the VC in a standardized SSI digital wallet, but VCs can also be transported in other ways, or stored in a relational database¹ or a distributed ledger².</p><p>The payload of a VC can be any kind of data and is not limited to what might normally be considered a credential.</p><p>In fact, the word “credential” is a holdover from the worlds of identity and academia, where VCs began their standardization journey and have many important use cases. But recently I’ve seen people in academia get confused when the payload inside a VC is what the academic world calls a credential — like a diploma or a transcript — resulting in a credential within a (verifiable) credential. Others get confused when the VC payload isn’t a credential, in either academic or identity parlance, but we still call the VC a credential.</p><p>Now that VCs have the global momentum they do, I feel we need to “open the aperture” beyond identity and credentials. Here are some example VC payloads not typically considered credentials, all of which become cryptographically verifiable when delivered as a payload within a&nbsp;VC:</p>  Consent, permissions, votes,&nbsp;opinions  Balances, totals, deficits, ranges, statistics, source&nbsp;data  Statements, agreements, contracts, invoices, sources  Confirmations, acknowledgements, attestations, assertions, affidavits  The speed, trajectory, weight, temperature or location of&nbsp;anything  Laws, regulations, statutes, rules, orders, decrees, declarations  Photos, videos, music,&nbsp;messages  Software code, hashes, files, the state of a database at a given point in&nbsp;time  Tests, procedures, prescriptions, diagnoses  <p>Of course, objects typically considered credentials make ideal VC payloads:</p>  Identities, names, addresses, usernames, titles, attributes, profiles, bios  Licenses, passports, visas, permits, tickets, coupons, vouchers, receipts  Skills, competencies, certificates, badges, diplomas, degrees, achievements, awards  Identifiers, codes, account numbers, ticket&nbsp;numbers  <p>It is true that the identity- and achievement-related use cases in this second list are those most actively being pursued in the VC space right now, and many in the first list cannot be realized until there’s broader adoption by issuers and verifiers. Still, the word “credential” has a specific meaning in several industries, and it is consistently confusing to VC noobs for one simple reason: it is an inaccurate term for what a VC really is and&nbsp;does.</p><p>Truly, “Verifiable Credentials” should be renamed to “Verifiable Containers.” I can’t think of anything important we lose by doing so, and can think of much clarity and other benefits (detailed in this series) that we would gain. Of all the gnarly terminology challenges we face in the SSI space, this one seems like a slam dunk to&nbsp;me.</p> Containers Inside of Containers Is a Feature, Not a&nbsp;Bug <a href="http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls">http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls</a><p>On several occasions I’ve been asked something like: “We already have containers for learning achievements with <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a>; why do we need another container?”</p><p>A fair question, but it presumes containers inside of containers aren’t useful or necessary for data, which isn’t necessarily the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Life is full of containers inside of containers. Products at the store come in boxes that arrived in larger boxes, stacked with other boxes onto a crate, which itself is another container, often shipped inside shipping containers, which are carried in/on the containers of ships, trains, and trucks. Data is stored inside files within folders, within other folders, inside of directories, inside of virtual machines, inside of partitions, inside a hard drive, within an enclosure, inside a computer, often on a shelf within a rack within a room inside a building.</p><p>You get the&nbsp;point.</p><p>Each level of container has a purpose and adds value and efficiency to the whole chain; try taking one away and it gets messy. Sub-specialties and entire industries are built up around the containers at each level, and they often don’t know much about the containers at the other levels. The people operating giant cranes at a port don’t know or care much about what’s inside the containers they’re moving, and they don’t need&nbsp;to.</p>CREDIT: Cam&nbsp;Geer<p>Even though it is a container itself, like any file a VC must be held in another container: a database, blockchain, or preferably a standardized SSI wallet. If a wallet, that wallet must be held in another container that makes it usable, like a smartphone, a USB stick or even a chipped&nbsp;card.</p><p>A VC can hold any sort of data payload, even as simple as a clear-text “Yes” or “No” when granting or refusing consent. If the payload is more advanced, like an academic achievement, it should be encoded in a way that provides semantic meaning to a verifier, such as an <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record">IMS Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). When a CLR is a VC’s payload, it’s an achievement inside of a CLR container inside of a VC container likely inside of a wallet. Take away the CLR container and you lose some semantic meaning for verifiers; take away the VC container and you lose the ability for CLRs to become portable alongside other, non-CLR payloads, forcing CLR users to adopt special capabilities unique to CLRs. If you repeat that specialized thinking for every kind of payload, from academia to healthcare to government, you quickly get back to a world full of bespoke containers and troublesome trust domains, right back where we&nbsp;started.</p><p>This is why a standardized shipping container for data is needed, and just as useful as its physical analog. Whether physical or digital, it’s Russian dolls everywhere you look, and that’s a good&nbsp;thing.</p> VC Containers Are Always Verifiable; Payloads Are&nbsp;Not <p>As with any container, with VCs it’s GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. The only thing that’s always verifiable with a VC is the container itself, where a verifier can cryptographically verify its fidelity, but not always the veracity of the&nbsp;payload.</p><p>For example, ABC University could issue to you a VC with this statement: “blue is green.” Clearly blue is not green and someone was messing around, but we can still verify four elements of the VC’s fidelity:</p>  ABCU issued&nbsp;it;  They issued it to&nbsp;you;  It has/hasn’t been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued;  ABCU has/hasn’t revoked&nbsp;it.  <p>Knowing who packed the container establishes the VC’s provenance to a specific issuer and directly influences a verifier’s willingness to rely on its payload, which is why many conflate this issue and believe that payloads are verifiable. But it is a significant distinction; a verifier can confirm that a VC container is authentic and from a trustworthy source, but still decide not to rely on its payload. (A payload can often be separately verifiable in some way, such as an Open Badge or even another VC, but that is beside the point&nbsp;here.)</p><p>This is how physical credentials work, too. A physical passport is a container that holds data (though only one type of highly regulated data); it is the physical container the airport verifies when you present it to them. Then, upon concluding the container is authentic, the airport usually proceeds to rely upon the data within the presented container. VCs function in the same manner but in the digital realm and capable of carrying any data payload, which makes them far more flexible, useful, and powerful overall than physical credentials.</p><p>Of course, you don’t need a battery to share your driver’s license, so there’s that.

And as you’ll read in parts 2 and <a href="https://medium.com/p/97155d0f3c17/edit">3</a> of this series, it has the potential to change the world as much as the shipping container did, and that’s a big deal.

<p>Well!  Morgan and I have co-launched a new podcast called
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">FOSS and Crafts</a>!
As the title implies, it's going to be a fairly interdisciplinary
podcast... the title says it all fairly nicely I think: "A podcast
about free software, free culture, and making things together."</p>
<p>We already have the <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">intro episode</a> out!
It's fairly intro-episode'y... meet the hosts, hear about what to expect
from the show, etc etc... but we do talk a bit about some background
of the name!</p>
<p>But more substantial episodes will be out soon.
We have a lot of plans and ideas for the show, and I've got a pretty
good setup for editing/publishing now.
So if that sounds fun, subscribe, and more stuff should be hitting
your ears soon!</p>
<p>(PS: we have a nice little community growing in
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#fossandcrafts on irc.freenode.net</a>
if you're into that kind of thing!)</p>

			<p>#BlackLivesMatter #NewYorkCity
				©&nbsp;2020 David E. Wheeler
			</p>
		
	

         
<p>I took advantage of the new City Bike dock in front of our flat to ride 80
blocks south through Central Park today to see the new <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/black-lives-matter-painted-on-street-outside-trump-tower.html" title="‘Black Lives Matter’ Painted on Fifth Avenue Outside Trump Tower">#BlackLivesMatter mural</a>
outside Trump Tower. Not too many people around, perhaps a dozen taking photos
and selfies. I joined them, then took a photo for a couple and their toddler in
front of the mural. I couldn’t stop grinning under my mask. The mural may be
symbolic, but holy cats do symbols matter.</p>
<p>More photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjMEw-ptAg/">on Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Also, what a great ride this was. Thinking about quitting my job just to wander
around New York and take it all in. Love this city.</p>

is soo great. In a few cogent, direct, clear paragraphs, she covers her views on
quarantine, Covid, reading, pregnancy, capitalism, Black Lives Matter, policy
changes, protest, climate change, and more. An example, on white discomfort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also suspicious of the way that Not Being Racist is a project that people
seem to be approaching like boot camp. To deepen your understanding of race,
of this country, should make you feel like the world is opening up, like
you’re dissolving into the immensity of history and the present rather than
being more uncomfortably visible to yourself. Reading more Black writers isn’t
like taking medicine. People ought to seek out the genuine pleasure of
decentering themselves, and read fiction and history alongside these popular
anti-racist manuals, and not feel like they need to calibrate their precise
degree of guilt and goodness all the time.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> 2020 talk Enabling Scalable Multi-lateral Federations with OpenID Connect was just broadcast and is <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event/ShowKey=96621">available for viewing</a>.  The talk abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Numerous large-scale multi-lateral identity federations are in production use today, primarily in the Research and Education sector.  These include national federations, such as SWAMID in Sweden and InCommon in the US, some with thousands of sites, and inter-federations among dozens of federations, such as eduGAIN.  Yet these existing federations are based on SAML 2 and require the federation operator to poll the participants for their metadata, concatenating it into a huge file that is distributed to all federation participants nightly – a brittle process with significant scalability problems.</p>
<p>Responding to demand from the Research and Education community to migrate from SAML 2 to the simpler OpenID Connect protocol, the OpenID Connect working group has created the OpenID Connect Federation specification to enable this.  The new approach incorporates lessons learned from existing SAML 2 federations – especially using a new, scalable approach to federation metadata, in which organizations host their own signed metadata and federation operators in turn sign statements about the organizations that are participants in the federation.  As Shibboleth author Scott Cantor publicly said at a federation conference, “Given all my experience, if I were to redo the metadata handling today, I would do it along the lines in the OpenID Connect Federation specification”.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe progress implementing and deploying OpenID Connect Federation, upcoming interop events and results, and next steps to complete the specification and foster production deployments.  The resulting feedback from Identiverse participants on the approach will be highly valuable.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a late-breaking addition, data from the June 2020 Federation interop event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> was included in the presentation.</p>

  Do you serve a problem or do you solve a problem?<br><br>Serving problems is lucrative work.<br><br>Solving problems is valuable work.<br><br>Extracting the value from your service of problems is done in completely different ways than from solving problems. People who solve problems are the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the social-benefactors that move our species forward. People who serve problems benefit from the existence of problems to serve.<br><br>This is a profoundly important distinction to understand in the constitution of any Society. People do the work they are enticed to do. Work is valued in any number of ways, and markets form systems based on the repeatability of a task, or behavior, or contract model.<br><br>Contracts define the repeatability of actions. Solving problems ends the service loop provided by those people that benefit from the existence of problems to serve. All around the industrialized world, people are serving problems. Little problems that are solved with button pushes, and big problems that require emotional investment.. both are being solved by people. Solving those problems in a different manner than they are being served creates a new problem:<br><br>What will people who serve problems do if someone solves the problem that they serve?<br><br>The extinction of problems is a HUGE problem for people that are dependent on the existence of problems to serve for their own well-being. Do you see the loop? Do you sense the problem?<br><br>Meta-thinkers that can escape this loop and apply their attention to the solving of problems are the greatest agents of change possible in the Human species. All over the world, the fear of the future is taking over immature psychologies. People who fear their own ability to take care of their needs, to have enough to get by, or to prosper with adequate health, wealth and wisdom through life's required challenges, are falling victim to a very predictable mental deficiency.<br><br>The unpredictability of life is not unique, it is the status quo. Change is constant, and people are here to solve the problems that life is composed of. Serving problems is an industrial era monetization of the permanence of problems. Government think tanks of eras gone by persist this logic pattern and operational mandate in order to extract rent from the existence of problems they, and their cronies, service.<br><br>Service models that help problems persist exist definitively in 2020 as political platforms. Creating problems from the raw material of modern life, recycling problems that are rehashed from dead history, joining problems in endless propaganda cycles that induce fear, compliance, and predictable work-patterns is how problem-servers maintain their authority in Society.<br><br>People are manipulated into believing, into accepting the idea that the servants of persistent problems, and problem-cycles that never end, are here to help them. People buy into these ideas in good faith, because they think that these "good people" serving their problems are their friends helping them overcome, when in fact they are the barnacles riding shotgun on the energy of the problem that is being served for the benefit of the party being directly affected by the problem, as well as the party earning a paycheck via their service of the problem.<br><br>Never-ending cycles of oppression are the result when the servants of problems show up on the scene. In the name of social justice, of workers rights, or child welfare, of education, of health care, of drug enforcement, and many other problems, servants of problems loot the world of value in a never-ending cycle of servitude. Problems persist indefinitely, incremental improvements ebb and flow, and people believe in servants that become parties with platforms.. servants of problems.. VOTE DEMOCRAT!<br><br>Problem solvers are different.<br><br>Problem solvers are disruptors.<br><br>Problem solvers end service cycles, and give new capabilities to Individual people. ALWAYS to Individual people, empowerment solutions are delivered directly to the experience where people have problems. This is the critical distinction, as Individuals we begin, as Individuals we remain.. for our entire life, one person will travel with you for the duration. One.<br><br>One among many other ones, this is our species Humanity.<br><br>Solving human problems is the highest order work there is. People solving problems is as close as we will ever come to the purpose of human life. People helping people solve problems, everyday.. constantly, new problems is the raw material of enlightenment, and equality for enlightened people.<br><br>There is no other condition that intercedes as more important than being human, and solving problems.<br><br>Mob rulers need mob thinkers, to enforce their service model to problems. People will never solve a problem so long as they are held captive to the servants of problems. When you vote, vote not for the servants of Society's problems, but for the people that solve problems.<br><br>Vote for the actual, functional leader. Vote for your operational existence, vote for the solution to real problems, and look for the distinction between problems that can be solved, and problems that exist so that they can be serviced.<br><br>This will help you immensely in your life, and it will solve a major problem for all of Humanity.<br><br><br><br><br>

  In 2008, my new family had a 3 year old child, a young international toy design and distribution company, and a newly emerging indie educational technology non-profit to take care of and grow with all the daily intensities you can imagine. Money? Yeah, we were working our butts off to survive and prosper with ideas and implementations that had very little support to fall back on if something went wrong. Health care? Yeah, we paid for it ourselves.<br><br>Then came ObamaCare. You might of heard about it. I watched the news, wondering if our Government would do something right for a change. Then reality started to sink in. The "Individual Mandate" was a perversion of the system I knew, and was an ugly administrative overreach that looked desperate in its attempt to force participation. Every part of that program was devised to support the non-working class, or the employed-class of people. As an entrepreneur funding my own survival, and any hope of quality of care or prosperity, I was not a consideration. Months later, after its passage, this reality become solidified. My family lost the health care it was paying for independently.<br><br>I was a casualty of progress, right? A method of socialized health care was being promoted as a savior for the people of my country, when in fact, it was being experienced in just the opposite way by an actual American family. It took me many years to solve this problem, but eventually I did so. It is called DevCare... and I provide it to 9 people who work for me plus their families. I spend $60,000+ per year providing health care to the people I employ. It works, and it works really well.<br><br>ObamaCare? Yeah.. that was pure socialist BS. That was never a solution to a problem, it was a redesign of dependency, forced upon Americans by a President and Congress hell-bent on changing America from a place where an "American Dream" of self-possession, private ownership, free-enterprise and hard work paid off. Instead, we all got equalized.. as Medicare dependents.<br><br>So along the way, after years doing private toy development, and licensing under brands as well known as "Imaginarium" from Toys R Us, we folded shop. It was time to move on. Doing business in China was not going to go well for anyone anymore. The writing was on the wall. "Move along"....<br><br>My kid, in the meantime, had entered the public school system, specifically because I wanted him to have an experience of learning with the public in my country. We lived in an extremely rural location, and 60%+ of the students attending our school received federally subsidized lunches. So in order to make sure the school produced at the level I hoped, my wife and I volunteered. She became the President of the PTA, and I donated my time and resources to introduce kids to robotics, programming, and art/math/logic that can move while you learn about it. Along the way, some local-yocal parents complained that our activities were going to steal jobs from the local contractor-economy, and should be shut-down. I shit you not. The school Principal was smarter than that, and we continued volunteering.. at least until 2nd grade.<br><br>That was the end of my public school experience. In 2nd grade, we exceeded the capacity of the public school system in the United States of America. There was no other choice... move, pay for private school that "might" be better, or do it yourself... home school... or leave the religious stuff out and just "indie school". So we did so... we built a company that supports multiple families while educating our own child indie school style.<br><br>And we moved... to New York.. to Long Island, where accessing independent learning was much easier than in Virginia. Where economics was something that had velocity, and all sectors were present in everyday life... not separated by scores of miles, stored on Dulles Toll Road, or in communities trying to overcome their racist past like Charlottesville.<br><br>And along the way, we had an experience that was completely unexpected; others saw the world and the problems being created at the hands of socialist Governors as we did. Individual mandates were seen as communist over-reaches, regardless of media propaganda controlling the masses of dependents. And being an entrepreneur, building and teaching, and leading the world towards "functional literacy" and "functional identity" by sourcing everyone with the ideas behind self-Sovereign identity, starting in President Obama's own $10million effort called NSTC, started picking up steam.<br><br>But socialists do one thing well... they clone value so they can deplete it. They loot, to be more precise. And by becoming visible, and sharing problem:solution outcomes, I was exposing myself to a ravenous community of socialist looters, both in Washington DC and Silicon Valley. No one survives that onslaught, right? With a social graph documenting all the relationships and hidden beliefs of Americans, and Government making dependency the law of the land, producing functional literacy on the part of American's was becoming increasingly challenging.<br><br>"If you are not a socialist in your 20's, you have no heart. If you are not a capitalist by your 30's, you have no brain".. not sure that is an actual quote anybody ever said, but it makes sense in observable reality.<br><br>I was raised by a Teacher, a social worker who believed she could solve the worlds problems by caring enough, even if practicable financial literacy was a mystery concept. I come from a family of educators, economists, a learned people.. and I respect all their ideas and practices to help the world be a better place, and people be better citizens.<br><br>But I am not one to swallow conformity, and I am not one to wait for my dependencies to be served by a Governing system that can not accurately define them, let along respect the life, liberty or pursuit of happiness that Individuals create in my country.<br><br>So with all the "Hope" in the world for "Change I could Believe in" I decided to go a different route. I decided to solve my own problems. To stand up my own Rights. To demonstrate what a functional American is, and to mentor others to overcome the false education system based on "Credentials of Exclusion" that exists to provide employment first, and education next. Jobs, Jobs Jobs!<br><br>Sure, a "Union of Workers" seems like a decent concept within a "More Perfect Union".. but is it? The USSR (Russia) was formed for just that purpose...&nbsp; a "Union of Workers". More importantly, how is a "More Perfect Union" made possible by sub-Unions, or operational cults in most cases, that demand loyalty from their participants and black-ball any and all non-believers who step out of line?<br><br>America in 2020 has a thinking problem to overcome. It has induced an operational problem wherein data slaves functioning on a data plantation believe they are "FREE", when in fact they are anything but. Labor is owned by the State, Identity is provisioned by the State, and compliance is not optional.<br><br>Is that even Constitutionally accurate? No, but then again, the Constitution does not compute in 2020. How can it ever hope to be accurate in rendering the operational format of participation for citizens when it can not even be designed effectively at root participation for American babies with any sense of accuracy? American babies with a Social Security number, after all, are the most at risk population for identity theft that there is. Sound like a good system?<br><br>Depends who you ask.<br><br>You see, the Government loves stability. Nothing propels a war machine like the stable revenue derived from employees. W2/W4 employees after all, pay the Government first, before they ever receive any money in their pay checks, having it auto-debited from their salaries. Of course, owners do it completely different, having a system designed to support them because well.. "Ownership Supremacy" on planet Earth is easily experienced. Owners pay the Government last, after all expenses have been deducted against revenue.<br><br>A Society of Owners is the only structural equality that will ever be possible. In 2020, the concept of "White Supremacy" dominates the perception of operationally illiterate people. In our country, a socio-economic war was fought, and owners were the winners on both sides of the transition from enslavement to employment, because structure yields results. It was never about black/white... it has always been about the ownership contract. Native Americans did not experience genocide, they experienced the incremental defeat of living on a planet that you do not own. Owners own the world that everyone else is living on.<br><br>Equality begins when you own yourself, and you own root participation in civil Society. That begins at identity formation. American Sovereignty was demonstrated by the founding fathers. They had no permission to dissolve their Sovereign allegiance to the King of England, and they did not have any permission to "Declare Independence" as a Sovereign Nation. But these people understood something far more basic and true. Human authority on planet Earth, and in this Universe, is self-Sovereign, or it does not exist. You may need to fight for your Human Rights, but they will never come from anyone but yourself.<br><br>No Institution, no man-made organization will ever give Humanity the direct experience that the Creator of existence has given to Humanity. Self-Sovereign Human Authority is the only authority that exists in Civil Society, or your Society is not civil.<br><br>Look around 2020 people... your Society is not civil. Fixing that starts with identity, for owners.<br><br>Own Root. It is not optional.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<blockquote>This article is part of a series about XYZ and how it works, also including articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-why-b855970fdd89">Why?</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">Handles</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-interaction-a84091d2a8c8">Interaction</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-compatibility-with-oauth-2-f7b490be536d">Compatibility</a>.</blockquote><p>OAuth 2 loves its bearer tokens. They’re a really useful construct because they are simple: if you have the token, you can do whatever the token is good for. It’s all the proof that you need: you can present it in exactly the format that you received it in, no cryptography involved.</p><p>This simplicity makes it easy for client developers to get it right, most of the time. You give them a magic value, they put the magic value into the right header, and suddenly the API works and they can stop thinking about this security&nbsp;thing.</p> Sender Constraints <p>The downside to bearer tokens, and it is a big downside, is that anyone who has a copy of the token can use it. TLS protects the token in transit over a direct hop, but it doesn’t fix the fact that the people who are allowed to see the token aren’t the same as the people who are allowed to use the token. This means that if a client sends its token to a rogue resource server, or even the wrong resource server, then that resource server can replay the token somewhere else.</p><p>To address this in the OAuth 2 world, there is active work to define how to do sender constrained access tokens. These tokens would move beyond a bearer token by requiring the client to present some type of verifiable keying material, like a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">mutual TLS certificate</a> or an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop">ephemeral key generated by the client</a>. There was previously work of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding">using TLS token binding</a> as well, but that has sadly gone by the wayside as TLS token binding <a href="https://identiverse.com/2018/10/31/chrome-puts-token-binding-in-a-bind/">failed to take off</a>. These work pretty well, but there is an overwhelming prevalence of OAuth 2 code that looks for the Bearer keyword for the token type and breaks if you show it anything else. Because of this, the MTLS spec requires that you continue to use the Bearer token type, and there has even been pushback for DPoP to use Bearer as an option as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And on top of all of this, the token presentation is tangled up with the OAuth2 client authentication, which could be based on a secret, a key, or nothing at all (in the case of public clients).</p><p>With XYZ, we don’t have this legacy of bearer tokens and client authentication, and we were able to build a system that was more consistent from the&nbsp;start.</p> Presenting Keys <p>In XYZ, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/keys/">key presentation is at the core of all client interactions.</a> When a client calls the AS, it identifies itself by its key. The key formats in XYZ are flexible. A client can present its key as a JWK, an X509 certificate, or potentially any number of other formats through extensions. The key can be RSA, or elliptic curve, or potentially some other exotic form. The protocol doesn’t really care, so long as there’s a method to validate&nbsp;it.</p><p>This key can be <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">passed by value or by reference</a>, and the AS can even decide to assign a reference dynamically, but the important thing is that it’s the key that identifies the software that’s making the call. This alone is an important shift from OAuth 2, because specifications like MTLS for OAuth and DPoP have shown us the value in allowing a client to bind an ephemeral key to its requests. In XYZ, the default is that all client keys are ephemeral, unless the AS has some additional set of metadata and a policy attached to the&nbsp;key.</p><p>Whatever key the client uses for its requests to the AS, it’s reasonable that the client would be able to use that same key for requests to the RS. But in this case, the client is also going to be presenting the access token it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>But unlike a bearer token, it’s not enough to present the token alone, or the key, or its identifier. The client also has to present proof that it currently holds that key to the server. It does this by performing a cryptographic operation on the request, in some fashion can be verified by the server and associated with the key. But&nbsp;how?</p> Agility of Presentation <p>Herein lies the real trick: a new delegation protocol is going to have to be flexible and agile in how the client is allowed to prove its keys. Just about every deployment is going to have its own considerations and constraints affecting everything from how keys are generated to how proofs can be validated across the&nbsp;layers.</p><p>In XYZ, we’ve made the key presentation modular. Instead of defining a required cryptographic container, XYZ declares that the client has to present the key in a manner bound to its request, in some fashion, and declare that proofing method. The two categories implemented to date are MTLS and HTTP-based message signatures.</p><p>For MTLS, it’s pretty straightforward. The client needs to use its client certificate during the TLS connection to the server, and the server needs to verify that the certificate in use is the same one referenced in the request — either the request body for the AS or the access token for the RS. The server does not need to do a full chain validation of the client’s certificate, though it’s free to do so in order to limit which certificates are presented.</p><p>For HTTP message signing it’s a similar outlay of effort, but the signature is presented at the HTTP layer and has to directly cover some or all of the HTTP request. There are a number of different specifications out there for doing this, and our test XYZ implementations have built out support for a several of them including Cavage signatures, OAuth DPoP, and even a simple JWS-based detached body signature invented for the protocol. The most promising, to my mind, is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures">new signatures specification being worked on in the HTTP working group of the IETF</a>. It’s being based on a long experience with several community specifications, and I think it’s really got a chance to be a unifying security layer across a lot of different applications. Eventually, we’re likely to see library and tooling support like we have with&nbsp;TLS.</p><p>The use cases for these are different. MTLS tends to work great for webserver-based applications, especially in a closed enterprise setup, but it falls apart for SPA’s and ephemeral apps. HTTP message signing is more complex to implement, but it can survive across TLS termination and multiple hops. There is no one answer, and there are likely other approaches that will be invented down the road that work even&nbsp;better.</p> Signatures as a Core&nbsp;Function <p>OAuth 1 had its own bespoke signing mechanism, which confused a lot of developers. OAuth 2 set out to avoid the problems that this caused by removing signatures entirely, but in so doing has pushed the needle too far away from good security practices and made it hard to add such functionality back in. With XYZ we tried to strike the balance by allowing different mechanisms but assuming that signing, of some fashion, was going to be available to every client. With today’s library and software support, this seems to be true across many platforms, and time will tell which methods work the best in the real&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/38809138">Originally written</a> as a post
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">for Patreon donors</a>.)</p>
<p>Hello... just figured I'd give a fairly brief update.  Since I wrote
my last post I've been working hard towards the distributed
programming stuff in Goblins.</p>
<p>In general, this involves implementing a protocol called
<a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/CapTP">CapTP</a>, which
is fairly obscure... the idea is generally to apply the same "object
capability security" concept that Goblins already follows but on a
networked protocol level.  Probably the most prominent other
implementation of CapTP right now is being done by the
<a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a> folks,
<a href="https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/captp/lib/captp.js">captp.js</a>.
I've been in communication with them... could we achieve
interoperability between our implementations?  It could be cool, but
it's too early to tell.  Anyway it's one of those technical areas
that's so obscure that I decided to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I%5B1-25%5D">document my progress on the cap-talk mailing list</a>,
but that's becoming the length of a small novel... so I guess, beware
before you try to read that whole thing.  I'm far enough along where
the main things work, but not quite everything (CapTP supports such
wild things as distributed garbage collection...!!!!)</p>
<p>Anyway, in general I don't think that people get too excited by
hearing "backend progress is happening"; I believe that implementing
CapTP is even more important than standardizing ActivityPub was in the
long run of my life work, but I also am well aware that in general
people (including myself!) understand best by seeing an interesting
demonstration.  So, I do plan another networked demo, akin to the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time-travel Terminal Phase demo</a>,
but I'm not sure just how fancy it will be (yet).  I think I'll have
more things to show on that front in 1-2 months.</p>
<p>(Speaking of Goblins and games, I'm putting together a little library
called <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/game-goblin">Game Goblin</a>
to make making games on top of Goblins a bit easier; it isn't quite
ready yet but thought I'd mention it.  It's currently going through
some "user testing".)</p>
<p>More work is happening on the Datashards front; Serge Wroclawski
(project leader for Datashards; I guess you could say I'm "technical
engineer") and I have started assembling more documentation and have
put together <a href="https://datashards.net/">some proto-standards documents</a>.
(Warning: WIP WIP WIP!!!)  We are exploring with a standards group
whether or not Datashards would be a good fit there, but it's too
early to talk about that since the standards group is still figuring
it out themselves.  Anyway, it's taken up a good chunk of time so I
figured it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So, more to come, and hopefully demos not too far ahead.</p>
<p>But let's end on a fun note.  In-between all that (and various things
at home, of course), I have taken a bit of what might resemble
"downtime" and I'm learning how to make ~chiptunes / "tracker music"
with <a href="https://milkytracker.titandemo.org/">Milkytracker</a>, which is
just a lovely piece of software.  (I've also been learning more about
<a href="http://www.drpetter.se/article_sound.html">sound theory</a> and have
been figuring out how to compose some of my own samples/"instruments"
from code.)  Let me be clear, I'm not very good at it, but it's fun
to learn a new thing.  Here's a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.flac">dollhouse piano thing</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.xm">XM file</a>), the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/ecto-house.flac">start of a haunted video game level</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.flac">sound experiment representing someone interacting with a computer</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
and the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">mandatory demonstration that I've figured out how to do C64-like</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_modulation">phase modulation</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggios</a> (<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">XM file</a>).
Is any of that stuff... "good"?  Not really, all pretty amateurish,
but maybe in a few months of off-hour experiments it won't be... so
maybe some of my future demos / games won't be quite as quiet!  ;)</p>
<p>Hope everyone's doing ok out there...</p>

  I had a great time in the sessions at <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2020/06/indiewebcamp-west-2020-ZB8zoAAu6sdN">IndieWebCamp West</a> yesterday!

<p>My blog post permalinks have been bothering me for a while, I feel like they are too cluttered. I mostly like the design of my notes and photos permalinks, since the content on those pages is relatively short, I don't mind how much other stuff on the page there is since it's also good for discoverability of my other content. However on my blog posts, people often come to those from some external source, and they're really there just to read the blog post and then leave. So I wanted to clean it up a bit.</p>
<p>Here's what my blog post pages looked like before.</p>

<p>This is on a 13" Macbook screen with a browser as wide as possible. Here is what the blog posts look like now.</p>

<p>I wanted to give the blog posts a bit more space, so I increased the size of the middle column. I also took out the top bar with the clock and weather. I removed my little author avatar (it duplicated my name, and the photo wasn't really placed very well.) I also changed the timestamp to show just the date, instead of the full date and time and timezone. For notes and photos the time is possibly relevant, but it's really not important for blog posts.</p>
<p>I also added a custom font, which tbh I'm on the fence about using. I do feel like the slightly wider font goes well with the slightly larger column.</p>
<p>So that's the first of the projects for the day done!</p>
<p>Update: Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sl007/104423151649889418">a suggestion from Sebastian</a>, I also increased the font size on the blog posts to keep a similar number of characters per line.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1
 2

 4
 5

 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
32
</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more. <a>↩︎</a></p>
