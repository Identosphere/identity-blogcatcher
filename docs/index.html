<p>デジタルIDの世界では今 #デジタルIDウォレット や #分散アイデンティティ が熱くなっています。EUでの採用が決まったというのも大きいです。日本でも #web3 が国家戦略になって、Trusted Webでも実証などが行われています。</p>



<p>しかし、ここでいう「分散」「集中（中央集権）<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/06/5316/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5316" title="日本では centralised というのを中央集権と訳す人が多いですがおそらく誤訳で「集中」が適切な訳かと思います。">1</a>」という言葉は、よく理解されないで使われているようです。また、「web1は分散、web2は集中、web3は分散」という語り・ナラティブも神話にまみれています。</p>



<p>そこで、今回のアイデンティティ夜話では、「分散の誤謬〜AとZの狭間かCypherpunkの夢か？」と題して神話を打破し、本質を問い直します。 </p>

  <p>It’s that time of the year again when the measurements of covid positivity and wastewater have fallen to a minimum and resentment toward symbols of public health are amplified.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2023/02/19/toews-has-long-covid/">mentioned back in February</a>, the career of one of the greatest hockey players of all time was curtailed for a 34 year old by long covid. According to <a href="https://www.fairhealth.org/article/fair-health-releases-study-on-post-covid-conditions">Patients Diagnosed with Post-COVID Conditions</a>, the 36 to 50 age group is the age group most likely to be diagnosed with long covid.</p>

<p>Despite being on the favorable side of the graph right now, whenever I’m uncertain about air ventilation, I am still wearing a mask.  For me, it’s always the locker room.  When we’re near the maximum point of the graphs, I generally dress outside the locker room.</p>

<p>If you’re on the fediverse, please consider following <a href="https://mstdn.social/@erictopol">Eric Topol</a>. In his article <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-brain-and-long-covid">The Brain and Long Covid</a>, he references <a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/i/124215133/the-hamburg-study">The Hamburg Study</a> which seems particularly insightful.  The participants were unvaccinated and long covid was not a criteria for selection.  It was simply 223 people with mild to moderate covid against 223 controls with no evidence of covid.  He notes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The MRI inflammatory marker abnormalities were so pronounced that machine learning could accurately differentiate which scans were from the Covid patients vs the control group</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the MRI scans being taken 10 months after the fact, it was still possible to determine who had been infected even for mild cases.</p>

<p>I’m hopeful that we will make real progress in long covid research but until then, the current rules to the game seem unfavorable without sensible mitigations.</p>

  <p>Large language models such as GPT-3/4, LLaMA and PaLM work in terms of tokens. They take text, convert it into tokens (integers), then predict which tokens should come next.</p>
<p>Playing around with these tokens is an interesting way to get a better idea for how this stuff actually works under the hood.</p>
<p>OpenAI offer a <a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">Tokenizer</a> tool for exploring how tokens work</p>
<p>I've built my own, slightly more interesting tool as an Observable notebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/gpt-tokenizer">https://observablehq.com/@simonw/gpt-tokenizer</a></p>
<p>You can use the notebook to convert text to tokens, tokens to text and also to run searches against the full token table.</p>
<p>Here's what the notebook looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The text I'm tokenizing here is:</p>
<blockquote>
 <code>The dog eats the apples
El perro come las manzanas
片仮名
</code> 
</blockquote>
<p>This produces 21 integer tokens: 5 for the English text, 8 for the Spanish text and six (two each) for those three Japanese characters. The two newlines are each represented by tokens as well.</p>
<p>The notebook uses the tokenizer from GPT-2 (borrowing from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@codingwithfire/gpt-3-encoder">this excellent notebook</a> by EJ Fox and Ian Johnson), so it's useful primarily as an educational tool - there are differences between how it works and the latest tokenizers for GPT-3 and above.</p>
 Exploring some interesting tokens 
<p>Playing with the tokenizer reveals all sorts of interesting patterns.</p>
<p>Most common English words are assigned a single token. As demonstrated above:</p>
 
 "The": 464 
 " dog": 3290 
 " eats": 25365 
 " the": 262 
 " apples": 22514 
 
<p>Note that capitalization is important here. "The" with a capital T is token 464, but " the" with both a leading space and a lowercase t is token 262.</p>
<p>Many words also have a token that incorporates a leading space. This makes for much more efficient encoding of full sentences, since they can be encoded without needing to spend a token on each whitespace character.</p>
<p>Languages other than English suffer from less efficient tokenization.</p>
<p>"El perro come las manzanas" in Spanish is encoded like this:</p>
 
 "El": 9527 
 " per": 583 
 "ro": 305 
 " come": 1282 
 " las": 39990 
 " man": 582 
 "zan": 15201 
 "as": 292 
 
<p>The English bias is obvious here. " man" gets a lower token ID of 582, because it's an English word. "zan" gets a token ID of 15201 because it's not a word that stands alone in English, but is a common enough sequence of characters that it still warrants its own token.</p>
<p>Some languages even have single characters that end up encoding to multiple tokens, such as these Japanese characters:</p>
 
 片: 31965 229 
 仮: 20015 106 
 名: 28938 235 
 
 Glitch tokens 
<p>A fascinating subset of tokens are what are known as "glitch tokens". My favourite example of those is token 23282 - " davidjl".</p>
<p>We can find that token by searching for "david" using the search box in the notebook:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Riley Goodside <a href="https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1666598580319035392">highlighted some weird behaviour</a> with that token:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why this happens is an intriguing puzzle.</p>
<p>It looks likely that this token refers to user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/davidjl123">davidjl123</a> on Reddit, a keen member of the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/counting">/r/counting</a> subreddit. He's posted incremented numbers there well over 163,000 times.</p>
<p>Presumably that subreddit ended up in the training data used to create the tokenizer used by GPT-2, and since that particular username showed up hundreds of thousands of times it ended up getting its own token.</p>
<p>But why would that break things like this? The best theory I've seen so far came from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36245187">londons_explore on Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These glitch tokens are all near the centroid of the token embedding space. That means that the model cannot really differentiate between these tokens and the others equally near the center of the embedding space, and therefore when asked to 'repeat' them, gets the wrong one.</p>
<p>That happened because the tokens were on the internet many millions of times (the davidjl user has 163,000 posts on reddit simply counting increasing numbers), yet the tokens themselves were never hard to predict (and therefore while training, the gradients became nearly zero, and the embedding vectors decayed to zero, which some optimizers will do when normalizing weights).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conversation attached to the post <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation">SolidGoldMagikarp (plus, prompt generation)</a> on LessWrong has a great deal more detail on this phenomenon.</p>
 Counting tokens with tiktoken 
<p>OpenAI's models each have a token limit. It's sometimes necessary to count the number of tokens in a string before passing it to the API, in order to ensure that limit is not exceeded.</p>
<p>One technique that needs this is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/13/semantic-search-answers/">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a>, where you answer a user's question by running a search (or an embedding search) against a corpus of documents, extract the most likely content and include that as context in a prompt.</p>
<p>The key to successfully implementing that pattern is to include as much relevant context as will fit within the token limit - so you need to be able to count tokens.</p>
<p>OpenAI provide a Python library for doing this called <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken">tiktoken</a>.</p>
<p>If you dig around inside the library you'll find it currently includes five different tokenization schemes: <code>r50k_base</code>, <code>p50k_base</code>, <code>p50k_edit</code>, <code>cl100k_base</code> and <code>gpt2</code>.</p>
<p>Of these <code>cl100k_base</code> is the most relevant, being the tokenizer for both GPT-4 and the inexpensive <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model used by current ChatGPT.</p>
<p><code>p50k_base</code> is used by <code>text-davinci-003</code>. A full mapping of models to tokenizers can be found in the <code>MODEL_TO_ENCODING</code> dictionary in <code>tiktoken/model.py</code>.</p>
<p>Here's how to use <code>tiktoken</code>:</p>
 import tiktoken

encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")
# or "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "text-davinci-003"

tokens = encoding.encode("Here is some text")
token_count = len(tokens) 
<p><code>tokens</code> will now be an array of four integer token IDs - <code>[8586, 374, 1063, 1495]</code> in this case.</p>
<p>Use the <code>.decode()</code> method to turn an array of token IDs back into text:</p>
 text = encoding.decode(tokens)
# 'Here is some text' 
<p>The first time you call <code>encoding_for_model()</code> the encoding data will be fetched over HTTP from a <code>openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net</code> Azure blob storage bucket (<a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/0.4.0/tiktoken_ext/openai_public.py">code here</a>). This is cached in a temp directory, but that will get cleared should your machine restart. You can force it to use a more persistent cache directory by setting a <code>TIKTOKEN_CACHE_DIR</code> environment variable.</p>
 ttok 
<p>I introduced my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/18/cli-tools-for-llms/">a few weeks ago</a>. It's a command-line wrapper around <code>tiktoken</code> with two key features: it can count tokens in text that is piped to it, and it can also truncate that text down to a specified number of tokens:</p>
  # Count tokens
echo -n "Count these tokens" | ttok
# Outputs: 3 (the newline is skipped thanks to echo -n)

# Truncation
curl 'https://simonwillison.net/' | strip-tags -m | ttok -t 6
# Outputs: Simon Willison’s Weblog

# View integer token IDs
echo "Show these tokens" | ttok --tokens
# Outputs: 7968 1521 11460 198  
<p>Use <code>-m gpt2</code> or similar to use an encoding for a different model.</p>
 Watching tokens get generated 
<p>Once you understand tokens, the way GPT tools generate text starts to make a lot more sense.</p>
<p>In particular, it's fun to watch GPT-4 streaming back its output as independent tokens (GPT-4 is slightly slower than 3.5, making it easier to see what's going on).</p>
<p>Here's what I get for <code>llm -s 'Five names for a pet pelican' -4</code> - using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">llm</a> CLI tool to generate text from GPT-4:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, names that are not in the dictionary such as "Pelly" take multiple tokens, but "Captain Gulliver" outputs the token "Captain" as a single chunk.</p>

<p></p><p>I’m <a href="https://werd.io/2023/consider-me-your-personal-analyst">soliciting prompts for discussion</a>. This piece is a part of that series.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://snarfed.org/">Ryan Barrett asks</a>:</p><p>It seems like the last 200 years or so - when we could use recorded media, photographs, audio, videos, as evidence or proof of anything - may have been a brief, glorious aberration, a detour in the timeline. Barely a blink of an eye, relative to the full history of civilization. Nice while it lasted, maybe it’s over now.</p><p>What does that mean? If true, how will we adapt? What techniques for evidence and proof from the pre-recorded-media era will we return to? What new techniques will we find, or need?</p><p>I’ll start by asking: could we? Or to put it another way: have previous assumptions we might have made about the trustworthiness of recorded media been warranted?</p><p>One of the most famous users of photo editing to alter the historical record was Stalin, who often <a href="https://www.history.com/news/josef-stalin-great-purge-photo-retouching">edited people he deemed to be enemies of the state out of photographs</a>. Portraits of the leader that hung in peoples’ homes were retouched so that they were more to his liking.</p><p>A few years later, the artist Yves Klein took photographs <a href="https://collections.lacma.org/node/2130697">like this one of him hurling himself off a building</a>. Obviously, they weren’t real: his intent was to demonstrate that the theatre of the future <a href="https://publicdelivery.org/yves-klein-leap-into-the-void/">could be an empty room</a>; arguably an accurate demonstration of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/apple-vision/">our present</a>.</p><p>Later still, a photo of Obama shaking hands with the President of Iran circulated widely on Republican social media — despite the fact that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-gosar-twitter-republican-congressman-shares-fake-photo-of-barack-obama-with-iranian-president-rouhani-2020-01-06/">the event never happened</a>.</p><p>And there are so many more. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/29/fake-photography-before-photoshop">the Guardian wrote a few years ago about Photoshop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>In fact, the lesson of the earliest fake photos is that technology does not fool the human eye; it is the mind that does this. From scissors and glue to the latest software, the fabrication of an image only works because the viewer wants it to work. We see what we wish to see.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, we didn’t even need trickery. <a href="https://ideas.time.com/2013/07/12/the-myth-of-fdrs-secret-disability/">President Roosevelt tried to hide his disability</a> by having the Secret Service rip the film out of anyone’s camera if they caught him in his wheelchair. Endless short men in the public eye — Tom Cruise, for example — have hid their height on camera by standing on boxes or having their counterparts stand in a hole.</p><p>Of course, the latest deepfake technology and generative AI make it cheaper and easier to create this kind of impossible media. Although it’s not new, it will become more prolific and more naturalistic than ever before.</p><p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/fighting-deepfakes-when-detection-fails/">The Brookings Institution points out</a> that in addition to the proliferation of disinformation, there will be two more adverse effects:</p>  Exhaustion of critical thinking: “it will take more effort for individuals to ascertain whether information is true, especially when it does not come from trusted actors.” 
 Plausible deniability: accusations of impropriety will be more easily deflected. 
 <p>Trusted actors, of course, are those we already know and rely on. Most people will not think the New York Times is faking its images. So another adverse effect will be the relative inability for new sources to be taken seriously — which will particularly hurt sources from disadvantaged or underrepresented groups. For the same reason, maintaining a list of “approved” sources that we can trust is not a real solution to this problem. In addition to it censoring new and underrepresented voice, who could possibly reliably maintain this kind of list? And what will prevent them from interpreting factual data that they don’t like as disinformation?</p><p>Regarding plausible deniability, even without deepfakes, we’re already learning that <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/misapplication-of-forensic-science/">many forensic evidence techniques</a> were more limited than we were led to believe. Bite marks, hair comparisons, and blood spatter, all commonly used in cases, were shown to have a limited scientific basis and to have often been misapplied. An artifact in itself is almost never enough to prove something to be true; we simply have to ask more questions.</p><p>Context is a useful tool here. If a public figure is shown to have said something, for example, are there other corroborating sources? Were there multiple independent eyewitnesses? Is any surrounding media drawn from this one artifact, or are there other, independent stories drawn from other, separately-recorded evidence?</p><p>So the real change will need to be with respect to source analysis. We’ve been trained to be consumers of information: to trust what’s on the page or on the screen. As I tried to explain at the beginning, that was always an approach that left us open to exploitation. There is no text that should not be questioned; no source that cannot be critically examined.</p><p>Generally, I think the Guardian’s observation holds true: we see what we wish to see. The truth will have plausible deniability. We will need more information.</p><p>To be sure, technology solutions are also useful, although it will be an arms race. <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-introduces-real-time-deepfake-detector.html#gs.00m2pf">Intel claims to have a deepfake detector that works with 96% accuracy</a> — which will be true until the inferred blood flow signals it uses can also be accurately faked (if that hasn’t happened already). Researchers at the University of Florida experimented with detecting audio deepfakes by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/blue">modeling the human vocal tract</a>. Again, we can expect deepfake technology to improve to a level where it surpasses this detection — and regardless, we still have to worry about the impact of false positives. We also should worry about any incentive to recreate a situation where we unquestioningly accept a source.</p><p>As <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepfake">IEEE Spectrum noted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Even if a quiver of detectors can take down deepfakes, the content will have at least a brief life online before it disappears. It will have an impact. […] Technology alone can’t save us. Instead, people need to be educated about the new, nonreality-filled reality.</p></blockquote><p>We will need to use all the tools at our disposal — contextual, social, and technological — to determine whether something is a true record, representative of the truth, or an outright lie. We always had to do this, but most of us didn’t. Now technology has forced our hand.</p>

   First Impressions of Vision Pro and VisionOS 
 John Gruber's description of his thirty minute Vision Pro demo includes a bunch of details I haven't seen described anywhere else, including how calibration and corrective lenses work and how precise and stable the overlays of additional information are.

   ChatGPT Plugins Don't Have PMF 
 Sam Altman was recently quoted (in a since unpublished blog post) noting that ChatGPT plugins have not yet demonstrated product market fit.  This matches my own usage patterns: I use the "browse" and "code interpreter" modes on a daily basis, but I've not found any of the third party developer plugins to stick for me yet.

<p>For the longest time I have had the wonderful plugin <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/78">’Search Space’</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> running on my site. It is truly fantastic - use it all the time to find post I know I have written in the past - that I want to link to - like <a href="https://john.philpin.com/2023/06/07/cnn-chief-chris.html">here</a> .. imagine how long that would have taken to build without a powerful search.</p>
<p>I also use <a href="https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/42">Hitchens</a> by <a href="https://micro.blog/pimoore">@pimoore</a> for my site, and Pete rather conveniently included ‘Search’ as part of his template. Not sure what he is doing behind the scenes to make that work - but like all of Hitchens - it just worked out of the box.</p>
<p>But … BUT … ever since installing <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> ’s plugin, having two searches has annoyed me, but I lived with it. Although I knew how to hide the built in search in CSS, I did NOT know how to identify the element that needed hiding, Until NOW.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">Jason</a> I can now find and identify the elements I need to drop into the CSS. (Again, I new all about ‘Inspect’, but for whatever reason I had a mental block when it came to finding the specifics.)</p>
<p>No longer - and as a result, I now have only 1 <a href="https://john.philpin.com/search-space/">Search</a> on my site.</p>
<p>No idea if <a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> is reading this - maybe I will ping him separately - and find out if he is working on an update - because I do have a few ideas.</p>

  昔から、「OpenIDは認証でOAuthは認可だ」…

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>昔から、「OpenIDは認証でOAuthは認可だ」などということが言われます。しかし、その言語の意味を取り違えている方が結構多い気がしています。「もうOpenIDなんていらね。OAuthだけでいいじゃん」というような言説がよく流れてくるのがその証拠だと思います。OAuth認証というのもその類ですね。</p>



<p>そこで、今日はOAuthとOpenIDの違いを考えてみたいと思います。</p>



 

 Youtube版







 OpenIDは紹介状、OAuthは合鍵 



<p>まずはOpenIDの概要の復習です。「OpenIDは認証」という言葉の内容をまずは復習してみましょう。<br>「認証」とは大変広い言葉でいろいろな場面で使われますが、「OpenIDは認証」という使い方の時は、「OpenIDは、いま来ている人の身元を認証」（ユーザ認証）という意味です。図にすると図1のような流れになります。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>この例では、有栖さんがお客としてサービス提供をしているサイトである伊部さんのところに行きます。</p>



<p>「伊部さん伊部さん、お宅のサービスを提供していただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、とおっしゃるのですね。申し訳ありませんが、本当に有栖さんなのかわからないので、宮来さんから紹介状をもらってきていただけませんか？紹介状にはメールアドレスも忘れずに。」<br>「わかりました。」<br>「宮来さん、お願いがあるのですが。」<br>「はい、なんでしょうか。」<br>「伊部さん向けにメールアドレス入の紹介状を書いていただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、わかりました。それではこれを持って行って下さい。」<br>「ありがとうございます。」<br>「伊部さん伊部さん、紹介状を持ってきました。」<br>「お、たしかに宮来さんの紹介状ですね。確かにあなたは有栖さんのようです。メアドもわかりました。では、サービスをご提供しましょう。」</p>



<p>こんなかんじです。伊部さんに対して有栖さんは自分が有栖であることを証明するために、紹介者(Identity Provider)宮来（ぐうぐる）さんに紹介状を書いてもらって、これを有栖さんは伊部さんに渡しています。伊部さんは、「宮来さんの紹介なら信用できるだろう」と考えて、有栖さんが本当に有栖和歌子さんだと認めてあげ、様々なサービスを提供します。</p>



<p>次にOAuthで認証をしていると呼ばれているような場合についてみてみましょう。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-6.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>図２で「認証もどき」としたのは、本来ユーザ認証ではない行為を認証の代わりに使っているからです。ここでは伊部さんに対して、自分が有栖だということを証明するために、自分の表札がかかったマンションの部屋の合鍵を管理人(OAuth Server)の津逸田（ついった）さんに作ってもらって、それを伊部さんに渡しています。</p>



<p>「伊部さん伊部さん、お宅のサービスを提供していただきたいのですが。」<br>「有栖さん、とおっしゃるのですね。申し訳ありませんが、本当に有栖さんなのかわからないので、有栖さんの家の合鍵をいただけませんか？そしたら、部屋の中を見て有栖さんかどうか確かめるので」<br>「わかりました。」<br>「津逸田さん、お願いがあるのですが。伊部さんに渡す合鍵がほしいのです。」<br>「わかりました。ではこの鍵を渡して下さい。」<br>「ありがとうございました。」<br>「伊部さん、はい、合鍵です。」<br>「おお、ありがとうございます。」</p>



<p>伊部さんはこの合鍵で有栖さんの部屋に入って、<br>「ほほう、たしかに有栖さんの部屋に入れた。ということは、あなたは有栖さんだと認めてあげましょう。」<br>となって、有栖さんに様々なサービスを提供します。</p>



<p>OpenIDの時との大きな違いは、OpenIDの場合は単なる紹介状なので、伊部さんは悪さをしようと思っても、せいぜい有栖さんのメールアドレスを名簿屋さんに売るくらいしかできないのに対して、OAuthの場合は、伊部さんは有栖さんの家の中に入っていって、恋人とのラブレターのやり取りを「わーい、ラブレターみっけ。へー、こんな写真のやり取りしてるんだ。」と読んだり、モノを壊したり、有栖さんの友達に迷惑メールを撒き散らしたりやりたい放題にできるということです。え？そんなことは無いだろうって？いや、これ実際にTwitterのOAuth認証で起きたことですから<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/06/1087/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-1087" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2011/05/1097/&quot;>Twitter、アプリのDMアクセスを自動削除へ(2011-05-19)</a>">1</a>。DM読み放題になってたんですね。すぐに直しましたが。</p>



<p>有栖さんが伊部さんの事をよく知っていて、本当に信頼できるなら、それでも構いません。例えば、わたしの家では家の掃除をしてくれる方に合鍵を渡しています。これは、非常に便利なことですしまっとうなことです。しかし、よく知りもしないウェブサイトにOAuthで認証もどきをしてログインして回るというのは、そこら中に合鍵をばらまいて歩いていることになり、大変危険です。今も昔もOpenIDよりもOAuth認証をしたいというサイトが増えてきているのもなぜだかわかりますよね。合鍵をもらったほうがいろいろとサービス提供したり悪さをしたりするのに便利だからです。しかし、合鍵を持っている人がその家の居住者とは限りません。多くの場合は違います。ですので、「OAuth認証」はユーザ認証にはならないのです。</p>



 OAuthで正しく認証するには～OpenID Connect 



<p>さて、例えば twitter の OAuth で「認証もどき」をするのは大変危険だということはおわかりいただけたと思います。正しく認証だけをするには、紹介状を使うのが良いということになります。この紹介状のことをOpenID Connect(OIDC)ではIDトークンといいます。</p>



<p>IDトークンには様々な情報を書くことができます。その人の名前やメールアドレスなどの他に、このユーザが実際にいつどのような身元確認（運転免許証を使って誰がいつどのような根拠に基づいてなど）をしたのか、ユーザ認証（SMS認証、パスキーなど）をしたのかなども書き入れて送ることができます。こうした「どういう確認をしたのか」というのは、本人についての情報というより、本人の身元確認やユーザ認証についての情報（メタデータ）です。これらがわからないと、そのユーザ認証の安全度が実はわかりません。そこで、OpenID Connect では、こうしたことも合わせて紹介状にして送ることができるようにしているのです。これが、図3の手続き４までの流れです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>また、紹介状以外に、あとからその人が現在どういう状況にあるのかということを確認することもできるようにしています。これには、紹介状と一緒に、有栖さんの伊部さん向けの現況説明書のコピーだけが入っている伊部さん専用ロッカーの鍵（アクセストークン）をわたすことによって実現しています。この鍵を使って、伊部さんは必要に応じて有栖さんの現況を知ることができます。このロッカーのことを「UserInfo （ユーザ情報）Endpoint」といいます。OAuthの保護リソースになります。これがあることによって、その場にユーザが居ないときでも、伊部さんは有栖さんの現況を知ることが得できるようになっています。</p>



<p>このように、OpenID ConnectではIDトークンを使って、今そこに来たユーザの認証情報を渡すとともに、後日、OAuthを使いながら安全に現況確認をできるようにしているのです。OpenID Connectは、OAuthの上のアイデンティティ層であると呼ばれるのはそういう理由からです。</p>



 分散クレームと集約クレーム 



 分散クレーム 



<p>この伊部さん専用のロッカーには、有栖さんの現況が書いてある紙が入っているだけでなく、伊部さんにわたしたい他のものも入れておくことができます。例えば、第三者からもらった資格証明書だとか、他のロッカーの鍵などです。伊部さんはそうやって取り出した鍵を使って、他のロッカーに行って、そこに入れてある情報を取り出したりもできます。図4は、この関係を表しています。</p>



<p>このように、他のロッカーにある情報を取りに行くモデルのことをOpenID Connectでは分散クレーム（Distributed Claims）といいます。「クレーム」というと聞き慣れない言葉で、日本語では「文句」みたいに聞こえたりもしますが、英語にはそのようなニュアンスはなく「主張」という意味しかありません。ここではそれぞれの属性をそれぞれのサイトが正しいと主張している値ということで「クレーム」と呼んでいます。紹介状ってそういうものですよね。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png?ssl=1"></a>



<p>サイトX, Y, Z は、OAuthの保護リソース(Protected Resources)にあたります。OpenID Connectでは、それぞれのサイトに伊部さんがアクセスするための鍵もUserInfo Endpoint に入っていて、伊部さんはこれを使ってこれらサイトにアクセスして最新の情報を取ってくることができます。</p>



 集約クレーム 



<p>一方では、集約クレーム(Aggregated Claims)という方式もあります。図５がこれをあらわしています。ここでは、UserInfo Endpointが、サイトX, Y, Z に事前に有栖さんが取得しておいた鍵（アクセストークン）でアクセスしてクレームを取ってきて、それを集約して伊部さんに返します。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-5.png?ssl=1"></a>



 まとめ 



<p>というわけで、まとめです。</p>



<p>OpenID Connectは、OAuthを使って安全にユーザ認証を行うだけでなく、インターネット上に散在する様々な情報をやりとりしたり、サービス提供を可能にする分散アイデンティティアーキテクチャです。2023年現在、ネットを使っている人でOpenID Connectを使っていない人はほぼ居ないと言われるほど普及しています。「Appleでサインイン」も「Googleサインイン」も「マイクロソフトサインイン」もみなOpenID Connectです。「インターネットのアイデンティティ層（レイヤー）」というキャッチフレーズもあながち嘘ではないのです。</p>

<p>Communication Service Providers (CSP) are in a challenging situation; they face, as we all do, declining trust in digital communications.</p>
<p>The decline in digital communications trust is occurring as a result of the connected individual’s exposure—either directly or indirectly—to unwanted or harmful communications, including robocalls, emails, sms messages, phishing and smishing messages, and more, as well as rampant, not recognized or well understood, phygital surveillance.</p>
<p>These communications and surveillance are annoying and distracting at best and, at worst, can lead to lasting and material harms: emotional, physical, digital (e.g., malware, ransomware), phygital, reputational, and financial. They can lead to losing sovereignty, agency, liberty, equity, equality, and dignity. In some rare cases, they can even lead to death. Most of these harms originate at the source, the initiator or sender of communication and engagement, not the individual. These senders, either unintentionally, intentioned but within the law, or intentioned outside of the law, are at the root of most harm.</p>
 Harm one, harm them all. 
<p>These harms do not simply affect the human, the “natural person,” as the GDPR calls them; they affect us all. When referring to the connected individual, we are not simply talking about the natural person, which tends to be our initial frame of reference; we are also talking about formal and informal groups, communities, enterprises, or governments, as well as&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition%5D(https://hbr.org/2014/11/how-smart-connected-products-are-transforming-competition)">our things</a>&nbsp;(e.g., IoT devices, capital asset, that have their own independent identities, can increasingly make their own independent decisions, and are producing the lion share of data; often sensitive data, valuable data, in real-time).</p>
<p>From the natural person perspective, the research is clear; people feel helpless and indifferent (<a href="http://[https//mobileecosystemforum.com/u-s-college-students-trust-study/%5D(https://mobileecosystemforum.com/u-s-college-students-trust-study/_)">MEF Trust Studies</a>); they are myriad in the privacy paradox. They do not think they can protect themselves, are incapable of managing their identity or reaping value from their data (something we can discuss and need to rectify), and lack the tools and education to do so. So, rather than taking personal phygital-accountability, they look to businesses and the government to protect them. According to the 2023 Telesign&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//www.telesign.com/continuous-trust-authority%5D(https://www.telesign.com/continuous-trust-authority)">Trust Index and recently launched Continuous Trust Authority</a>, 94% of consumers [connected individuals] surveyed agree that businesses bear responsibility for consumers’ privacy. And when consumers trust a brand, they reward that company with their business. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/public-sector/close-the-trust-gap-to-improve-outcomes-and-improve-customer-engagement.pdf%5D(https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/public-sector/close-the-trust-gap-to-improve-outcomes-and-improve-customer-engagement.pdf)">Deloitte</a>,&nbsp;people spend 25% more money with trusted brands.</p>
<p>However, The crucial problem is that individuals’ fundamental intentions and goals rarely align long-term with those of the business or government they interact with. Sure, their intentions and goals may align short-term for an episodic transaction, but long term, they often diverge. There is an asymmetry in knowledge and power between the individual and the commercial and civic actors. People give away immense value, i.e., data, for the immediate transaction; this value can only be crawled back with great effort.</p>
 It Is Time To Bring Personal and Organizational Identity Together 
<p>So, the big questions are, how do we bring back trust? How do we re-empower the individual with privacy and control, online and offline, in the metaverse or phygiverse? The existing methods—industry self-regulation, government regulations, centralized registries, or tried and true axioms like “trust, but verify”—work in limited ways. However, they leave much to be desired, not fully solving the problem. For instance, cybercrime, e.g., data breaches as a proxy, is rising yearly, causing trillions in damages, and the peak is nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>What we need are four things: 1) we must “distrust, then verify,” 2) to stop treating individuals as the social, commercial, and civic entre on the table to nourish all; instead, we need to get them off the table and give them a seat at the table, 3) to make an effort to achieve&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexus2023.png%5D(https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexus2023.png)">The Identity Nexus</a>&nbsp;and solve&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexusEquation.png%5D(https://identitypraxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TheIdentityNexusEquation.png)">The Identity Nexus equation</a>; that is, to achieve a steady-state macro value to risk exchange ratio equilibrium between the actors (individuals, public and private organizations, and the community commons), and finally, 4) to strive for wide-spread participation in the personal and organizational identity ecosystem, an ecosystem that systemically holds every actor accountable for their actions, while preserving each actor’s social, commercial, and civic, privacy, capital, and legal rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>Join us for the MEF CONNECTS ID &amp; AUTH EVENT:&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//mobileecosystemforum.com/events_/mef-connects-personal-data-identity-2/%5D(https://mobileecosystemforum.com/events_/mef-connects-personal-data-identity-2/)">MEF CONNECTS ID &amp; AUTH: The Dawn of Personal and Organizational Identity</a>&nbsp;hybrid event, on May 25 in London (there is still time to&nbsp;<a href="http://[https//hopin.com/events/mef-connects-personal-data-identity%5D(https://hopin.com/events/mef-connects-personal-data-identity)">register</a>—participation is FREE—for in-person and online live stream; all registered participants will get access to the post-event recordings) is the industry’s first-ever event to bring the personal identity and organizational identity worlds together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personal Identity empowers people to have agency, dignity, and sovereignty of their phygital self. Organizational identity not only enables organizations to be cryptographically verified across all engagements and interactions (B2B, B2C, A2P, M2P, M2M, etc.)—globally, across jurisdictions, and across channels; it also ensures that anyone interfacing with the organization’s designated representatives, i.e., their agents—humans, bots, machines, APIs, messages, etc.— can automatically and without human intervention, validate the authority of the agent. Collectively, participants within the personal and organizational identity ecosystem should experience reduced exposure to cybercrime, increased revenue, reduced cost, more efficient operations, and several more benefits. The personal and organizational identity ecosystem is bringing in a new era of systemic trust; the trust elements, i.e., the personal credential and the organizational credential, are readily accessible, e.g., in a decentralized ledger or embedded directly into a communication. In other words, in every moment of truth, the actors’ actions can be verified, which means we can hold them accountable for their actions, which will enable verified attribution and, therefore, help us build verified reputations. For businesses, this will establish the next major business metric, “the number of verified connections.”</p>
 Nurturing the Personal and Organizational Ecosystem: It Takes a Community 
<p>To nurture this ecosystem, the entire community needs to come together. We need to leverage the five lenses—technology, culture, legal &amp; regulatory, commercial, and political—to build flexible, agile, interoperable, and contextually relevant sources of truth, governance models, trust frameworks, policies, standards, protocols, open-source software, self-regulatory initiatives (principles, codes of conduct, guidelines, best practices), fair and reasonable government regulation (law, legislations, rules, regulations),&nbsp;<a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">OpenWallets</a>, refined customer experiences, and educational programming that will help everyone thrive and flourish.</p>
<p>CPSs, especially, will need to do all of the above but within the context of assisting their executives and clients in understanding and adopting these new technologies and experiences. They’ll need to root out cybercrime at the source. To adopt organizational credentials and verified delegated authority. And revisit and reshape their business models.</p>

<p></p><p>Before our son was born last September, <a href="https://werd.io/2022/the-baby-stack">I published a UsesThis-style baby stack</a> of devices and software we were using.</p><p>He’s now nine months old, so I thought I’d revisit the list now that he’s been alive for longer than he gestated. We’ve got far more experience than we did.</p> Hardware <p>Stroller: We’re still using and loving our <a href="https://uppababy.com/cruz/">Uppababy Cruz v2</a>. Its modular design made a big difference for us. We grew out of the bassinet mode, but the seat is still holding strong for daily walks — and it was incredibly useful to also be able to plug the Mesa car seat right into the stroller base for quick trips into the store etc.</p><p>Car seat: We grew out of the <a href="https://uppababy.com/mesa/">Uppababy Mesa</a>, but it was great while it lasted. I loved how adjustable it was, as well as easy to install into my car (something I had a genuine fear of before the baby was born).</p><p>We’ve moved on to the <a href="https://clekinc.com/products/foonf">Clek Foonf</a>, which is broadly recommended as well as being fun to say — I’ll update once we know if we’re satisfied with it. But the reviews look great, and we were happy that it came with an option without nasty chemicals in the cover material.</p><p>Bed: For a while, the <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/">Happiest Baby SNOO</a> was absolutely magical. Then, not long before he grew out of it, he became scared rather than soothed by its rocking motion (although we still used its white noise feature). It became moot, because he grew so fast that watching him in the bassinet began to resemble watching bread dough proofing out of its tin.</p><p>These days we’re on the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sundvik-crib-white-30248575/">Ikea Sundvik</a> crib, which grows with the baby. We paired it with the <a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/organic-cotton-classic-seamless-baby-crib-mattress-buy">Naturepedic Classic Organic Cotton Crib Mattress</a> and have already lowered it to prevent him from falling out when he stands up.</p><p>White noise: The <a href="https://www.hatch.co/rest">Hatch Rest</a> is pretty good, and can be used both with and without an app, but he’s developed a fascination with technology and has started wanting to grab it whenever he can. I think we might be on our last few weeks of this one.</p><p>Baby monitor: The <a href="https://www.nanit.com/products/nanit-pro-camera">Nanit Pro</a> has great sound and vision and connects to our smartphones on and off wifi. We use it with the stand above the bed. The app also does a great job of recording when he fell asleep and woke up, so we can plan ahead to his next nap.</p><p></p><p>Changing mat: The <a href="https://www.keekaroo.com/peanut-changer.html">Keekaroo Peanut</a> is still going strong. It’s easy to clean, does a good job of holding him in position, has a good strap, and is easy to move. We have two around the house.</p><p>High chair: The <a href="https://www.stokke.com/USA/en-us/high-chairs/tripp-trapp/TT01.html">Stokke Tripp Trapp</a> is well-made and adjustable as he grows. I wish it was a little easier to clean, but there are no nasty nooks and crannies - it just takes a wipe down after every meal. We’ve been using it both with and without the tray and we’re loving it.</p><p>Toys and Play: We’re trying to avoid screen time and toys that make noise / use electronics in favor of Montessori-inspired simple toys. I like our <a href="https://lovevery.com/products/the-play-kits">Lovevery Play Kits</a>. They arrive at our door every few months; they’re made from good materials and each box is geared towards his developmental stage. They come with suggestions for when to introduce each toy and how to play with them — which, to be honest, I’ve ignored more often than not.</p><p>We use <a href="https://alzipmat.us/collections/eco-color-folder">ALZiP Mat Eco Color Folder</a> playmats to give him a safe space to play where he’s less likely to hurt himself. It’s free from harmful materials and the insides are recyclable.</p><p>Food: We like <a href="https://www.weesprout.com/products/silicone-baby-spoons">WeeSprout silicone baby spoons</a>. Usually we just use a small Glasslock glass food storage bowl to serve him. We try and cook for him, but he absolutely adores <a href="https://cerebelly.com/">CereBelly</a> brain-supporting food pouches. We also add <a href="https://readysetfood.com/">Ready Set Food</a> powder to introduce him to common allergens.</p> Software <p>Tracking: <a href="https://huckleberrycare.com/">Huckleberry</a> is buggier than I’d like — sometimes it loses entries with no explanation — but it’s still proven to be a useful way to keep track of eating, sleeping, and diaper changes between parents. It also does a fairly good job of predicting when his nap might be based on his sleep. Like most parenting software, I dearly wish it had multi-user support. Dads look after their babies too! (We just share our credentials, which works fine unless the two of us are in different timezones.)</p><p>Food: <a href="https://solidstarts.com/">Solid Starts</a> has been a useful reference as we’ve begun to introduce solid food. It helps us understand not just what we can introduce, but how.</p><p>Shopping: Baby gear is expensive; doubly so if you don’t want to compromise on quality. We use <a href="https://goodbuygear.com/">GoodBuy Gear</a> to get it second hand whenever we can. It doesn’t have everything, but when it does, it’s usually a pretty good deal.</p><p>Babycare: We’re using <a href="https://care.com">Care.com</a> to find carers. It’s been a grueling process and we’re nowhere near there yet. That’s not the fault of the platform, although I wish it had more CRM-style features — hiring baby care is not dissimilar to hiring for a full-time role and I’ve found myself missing the tools I’ve used when I’ve built teams. But the carers are there, and that’s the important thing.</p>

<p>This article looks at implementing authorization in Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) using Azure AD delegated roles. The roles can be assigned to users or groups in an Azure Enterprise application.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Blogs in this series</p>



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2023/05/30/asp-net-core-authentication-using-microsoft-entra-external-id-for-customers-ciam/">ASP.NET Core authentication using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM)</a> 
 



<p>In Azure AD it has been possible to use roles with users and groups to implement authorization and access controls for software solutions. This makes IAM access management easy to apply in the Azure cloud. This is not possible when using the existing Microsoft identity customer solution Azure AD B2C and is one of the new features added to Entra External ID CIAM.</p>



<p>This is really easy to implement. The required roles can be created in the Azure App registration in the App roles blade. The roles must be of type Users/Groups because the roles are only applied to delegated authenticated identities (human based). </p>







<p></p>



<p>The Azure App registration App roles can be assigned to users or groups. In larger Azure clouds, the roles would be assigned to dynamic security groups or standard security groups and the groups would be assigned with members or a user group with members to this permission group. Assigning roles to users directly will only work for very small user based systems. You can mix groups and users as required.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The roles can now be used in the ASP.NET Core application. This requires three steps:</p>



 
 Authentication of the identity (user + application) 



 Add the claims correctly to the claims principal in the ASP.NET Core application 



 Use the claims for authorization using ASP.NET Core Policies 
 



<p>Using the default Microsoft.Identity.Web client, the first two steps can be implemented in a very simple way. The client package does the heavy lifting. Sometimes you need to fix the namespaces in the claims, but this usually works good.</p>



<p>The claims can be displayed for the authenticated user in the UI</p>


  public void OnGet()
{
	var claims = User.Claims.ToList();
	foreach(var claim in claims)
	{
		if(claim != null &amp;&amp; claim.Type == "roles")
		{
			Roles.Add(claim.Value);
		}
	}
}
  


<p>I just iterate through each role claim.</p>


  @{
    foreach( var role in Model.Roles)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role:&lt;/b&gt; @role&lt;/p&gt;
    }
}
  


<p>When using the role claim for authorization, you should never use this directly. Always use an ASP.NET Core authorization policy in the application and map the claim role definition to the requirement in the policy. The keeps the authorization simple and defined in one place. The claims are definitions or descriptions about the identity. The descriptions should not be also used as authorization rules but should be used to help define the authorization rules. For more complex authorization logic, ASP.NET Core authorization handlers can be used to implement the logic.</p>



 ASP.NET Core Authorization using role claims 



<p>The authorization policies can be added in the AddAuthorization method. the policies can use a claim directly or use an ASP.NET Core AuthorizationHandler. All identity descriptions are mapped or used in the policies and handlers. Only the policies are used in the application.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy("UserPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.RequireClaim("roles", "user-role");
    });
    options.AddPolicy("AdminPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.RequireClaim("roles", "admin-role");
    });
    options.AddPolicy("UserAdminPolicy", policy =&gt; {
        policy.AddRequirements(new UserAdminRequirement());
    });
    options.FallbackPolicy = options.DefaultPolicy;
});
  


<p></p>



<p>If you have complex authorization business logic, this can be supported by implementing an AuthorizationHandler class. The Handler requires an IAuthorizationRequirement.</p>


  public class UserAdminRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement {}
  


<p>UserAdminHandler implements the AuthorizationHandler with the UserAdminRequirement. This checks if a identity has the required claim.</p>


  public class UserAdminHandler 
	: AuthorizationHandler&lt;UserAdminRequirement&gt;
{
    protected override Task HandleRequirementAsync(
        AuthorizationHandlerContext context, 
		UserAdminRequirement requirement)
    {
        var userRole = context.User
			.FindFirst(c =&gt; c.Type == "roles" 
				&amp;&amp; c.Value == "user-role");
        var adminRole = context.User
			.FindFirst(c =&gt; c.Type == "roles" 
				&amp;&amp; c.Value == "admin-role");

        if (userRole != null || adminRole != null)
        {
            context.Succeed(requirement);
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
  


<p>The handler needs to be registered in the IoC.</p>


  builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;IAuthorizationHandler, UserAdminHandler&gt;();
  


<p>The authorization policies are applied to the pages.</p>


  [Authorize(Policy = "UserAdminPolicy")]
public class UserAdminModel : PageModel
  


<p></p>



<p>When the application is started, the user can authenticate and the authorization is forced. In this test, the admin user is missing the role to view the user page. Normally you would also hide the link to the user page.  This is usability, authorization can only be forced in trusted backends.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The admin page displays the business because to identity is authorized to view this.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Authorization with CIAM has all the power like Azure AD and makes it possible to use the same tools to manage the user, application and device identities. I really missed this in Azure AD B2C.</p>

  <p>I've fallen a bit behind on my weeknotes. Here's a catchup for the last few weeks.</p>
 Parquet in Datasette Lite 
<p><a href="https://lite.datasette.io/">Datasette Lite</a> is my build of Datasette (a server-side Python web application) which runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly and <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>. I recently added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite/issues/67">directly load Parquet files over HTTP</a>.</p>
<p>This required an upgrade to the underlying version of Pyodide, in order to use the WebAssembly compiled version of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fastparquet/">fastparquet</a> library. That upgrade was blocked by a <code>AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'link'</code> error, but Roman Yurchak <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/3880#issuecomment-1560130092">showed me a workaround</a> which unblocked me.</p>
<p>So now the following works:</p>
<p><a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?parquet=https://github.com/Teradata/kylo/blob/master/samples/sample-data/parquet/userdata1.parquet">https://lite.datasette.io/?parquet=https://github.com/Teradata/kylo/blob/master/samples/sample-data/parquet/userdata1.parquet</a></p>
<p>This will work with any URL to a Parquet file that is served with open CORS headers - files on GitHub (or in a GitHub Gist) get these headers automatically.</p>
<p>Also new in Datasette Lite: the <code>?memory=1</code> query string option, which starts Datasette Lite without loading any default demo databases. I added this to help me construct this demo for my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-sqlite-url-lite">datasette-sqlite-url-lite</a> plugin:</p>
<p><a href="https://lite.datasette.io/?memory=1&amp;install=datasette-sqlite-url-lite#/_memory?sql=select+'url_valid()'+as+fn%2C+url_valid(%3Aurl)+as+result%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_scheme()'%2C+url_scheme(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_host()'%2C+url_host(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_path()'%2C+url_path(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_fragment()'%2C+url_fragment(%3Aurl)%3B&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sqlite.org%2Fvtab.html%23usage">https://lite.datasette.io/?memory=1&amp;install=datasette-sqlite-url-lite#/_memory?sql=select+'url_valid()'+as+fn%2C+url_valid(%3Aurl)+as+result%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_scheme()'%2C+url_scheme(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_host()'%2C+url_host(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_path()'%2C+url_path(%3Aurl)%0Aunion+all%0Aselect+'url_fragment()'%2C+url_fragment(%3Aurl)%3B&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sqlite.org%2Fvtab.html%23usage</a></p>
 datasette-sqlite-url-lite - mostly written by GPT-4 
<p><a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-url/tree/main/python/datasette_sqlite_url">datasette-sqlite-url</a> is a really neat plugin by Alex Garcia which adds custom SQL functions to SQLite that allow you to parse URLs and extract their components.</p>
<p>There's just one catch: the extension itself is written in C, and there isn't yet a version of it compiled for WebAssembly to work in Datasette Lite.</p>
<p>I wanted to use some of the functions in it, so I decided to see if I could get a Pure Python alternative of it working. But this was a very low stakes project, so I decided to see if I could get GPT-4 to do essentially all of the work for me.</p>
<p>I prompted it like this - copying and pasting the examples directly from Alex's documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write Python code to register the following SQLite custom functions:</p>
 <code>select url_valid('https://sqlite.org'); -- 1
select url_scheme('https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#usage'); -- 'https'
select url_host('https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#usage'); -- 'www.sqlite.org'
select url_path('https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#usage'); -- '/vtab.html'
select url_fragment('https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html#usage'); -- 'usage'
</code> 
</blockquote>
<p>The code it produced was almost exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>I wanted some tests too, so I prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a suite of pytest tests for this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gave me the tests I needed - with one error in the way they called SQLite, but still doing 90% of the work for me.</p>

  <p>One of the most common concerns I see about large language models regards their training data. People are worried that anything they say to ChatGPT could be memorized by it and spat out to other users. People are concerned that anything they store in a private repository on GitHub <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36184948">might be used as training data</a> for future versions of Copilot.</p>
<p>When someone asked Google Bard how it was trained back in March, it told them its training data included Gmail! This turned out to be a complete fabrication - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/22/dont-trust-ai-to-talk-about-itself/">a hallucination by the model itself</a> - and Google issued firm denials, but it's easy to see why that freaked people out.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to write something reassuring about this issue for a while now. The problem is... I can't do it. I don't have the information I need to credibly declare these concerns unfounded, and the more I look into this the murkier it seems to get.</p>
 Closed model vendors won't tell you what's in their training data 
<p>The fundamental issue here is one of transparency. The builders of the big closed models - GPT-3, GPT-4, Google's PaLM and PaLM 2, Anthropic's Claude - refuse to tell us what's in their training data.</p>
<p>Given this lack of transparency, there's no way to confidently state that private data that is passed to them isn't being used to further train future versions of these models.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time digging around in openly available training sets. I built an early tool for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/5/laion-aesthetics-weeknotes/">searching the training set for Stable Diffusion</a>. I can tell you exactly <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/17/redpajama-data/">what has gone in to the RedPajama training set</a> that's being used for an increasing number of recent openly licensed language models.</p>
<p>But for those closed models? Barring loose, high-level details that are revealed piecemeal in blog posts and papers, I have no idea what's in them.</p>
 What OpenAI do and don't tell us 
<p>The good news is that OpenAI have <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance">an unambiguous policy</a> regarding data that is sent to them by API users who are paying for the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI does not use data submitted by customers via our API to train OpenAI models or improve OpenAI’s service offering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's very clear. It's worth noting that this is a new policy though, introduced in March. The <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">API data usage policies</a> page includes this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data submitted to the API prior to March 1, 2023 (the effective date of this change) may have been used for improvements if the customer had not previously opted out of sharing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where things get a lot murkier is ChatGPT itself. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t use data for selling our services, advertising, or building profiles of people—we use data to make our models more helpful for people. ChatGPT, for instance, improves by further training on the conversations people have with it, unless you choose to disable training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does this mean in practice?</p>
<p>My initial assumption had been that this isn't as simple as anything you type into ChatGPT being used as raw input for further rounds of model training - I expected it was more about using that input to identify trends in the kinds of questions people ask, or using feedback from the up/down vote buttons to further fine-tune the model.</p>
<p>But honestly, I have no idea. Maybe they just run a regular expression to strip out phone numbers and email address and pipe everything else straight into the GPT-5 training runs? Without further transparency all we can do is guess.</p>
 A clue from the InstructGPT paper 
<p>The best clue I've seen as to how this data might actually be used comes from <a href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following">OpenAI's description of InstructGPT</a> back in January 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make our models safer, more helpful, and more aligned, we use an existing technique called <a href="https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences">reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)</a>. On prompts submitted by our customers to the API<code>[A]</code> our labelers provide demonstrations of the desired model behavior, and rank several outputs from our models. We then use this data to fine-tune GPT-3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucially, this hints that the data isn't being used as raw input for future trained models. Instead, it's being used in an exercise where several potential outputs are produced and human labelers then select which of those is the best possible answer to the prompt. Aside from exposing potentially private data to those human labelers, I don't see this as a risk for leaking that data in the later output of the model.</p>
<p>That <code>[A]</code> footnote turns out to be important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We only use prompts submitted through the Playground to an earlier version of the InstructGPT models that was deployed in January 2021. Our human annotators remove personal identifiable information from all prompts before adding it to the training set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again though, I'm left with even more questions. This was before ChatGPT existed, so was the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/5/play-with-gpt3/">Playground development tool</a> being treated separately from the API itself back then? What does "adding it to the training set" mean - is that the raw pre-training data used for future models, or is it the RLHF data used for the fine-tuning that they mentioned earlier?</p>
 Security leaks are another threat 
<p>Aside from training concerns, there's another danger to consider here: the risk that an AI vendor might log inputs to their models and then suffer from a security flaw that exposes that data to attackers - or an insider threat where vendor employees access logged data that they shouldn't.</p>
<p>OpenAI themselves had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openai-says-a-bug-leaked-sensitive-chatgpt-user-data-165439848.html">a widely publicized security issue</a> a few months ago where ChatGPT users could see summarized titles of sessions by other users. This is an extremely bad breach!</p>
<p>Their new <a href="https://trust.openai.com">trust.openai.com</a> site appears to be entirely aimed at reassuring companies about their approach to security.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is not a new issue: companies have been trusting their private data to cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The challenge is that these AI companies have much less of a track record for staying secure. AWS and Google Cloud have large security teams with many years of experience securing their customer's data. These newer AI vendors are building up those capabilities as they go.</p>
 Self-hosted, openly licensed models 
<p>I've been tracking the meteoric rise of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/llms-on-personal-devices/">openly licensed LLMs you can run on your own hardware</a> since LLaMA and Alpaca <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">demonstrated how capable they could be</a> back in March.</p>
<p>These models aren't yet anywhere near as capable as GPT-4, and claims that they compete with ChatGPT's <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> mostly don't hold up to deeper scrutiny.</p>
<p>But... they're pretty good - and they're getting better at an impressive rate.</p>
<p>And since you can run them on your own instances, they remove all possible concerns about what happens to the data that you pipe through them.</p>
<p>An open question for me remains how large a large language model actually needs in order to solve the kind of problems companies need to solve. Could a weaker, openly licensed model armed with the same <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jan/13/semantic-search-answers/">retrieval augmented generation tricks</a> that we've seen from Bing and Bard be capable enough to remove the need for a closed model like GPT-4?</p>
<p>My hunch is that for many applications these augmented openly licensed models will be increasingly capable, and will see widespread adoption over the next few months and years.</p>
 Bonus section: does GitHub use private repos to train future models? 
<p>This question came up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36185372">on Hacker News</a> this morning. GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/privacy-on-github/about-githubs-use-of-your-data#privacy-and-data-sharing">Privacy &amp; Data Sharing policy</a> says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private repository data is scanned by machine and never read by GitHub staff. Human eyes will never see the contents of your private repositories, except as described in our <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#3-access">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>Your individual personal or repository data will not be shared with third parties. We may share aggregate data learned from our analysis with our partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I interpret this as GitHub saying that no employee will ever see the contents of your private repo (barring incidents where they are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure">compelled by law</a>), and that the only data that might be shared with partners is "aggregate data learned from our analysis".</p>
<p>But what is "aggregate data"?</p>
<p>Could a large language model trained on data fit under that term? I don't think so, but the terminology is vague enough that once again I'm not ready to stake my reputation on it.</p>
<p>Clarity on this kind of thing is just so important. I think organizations like GitHub need to over-communicate on this kind of thing, and avoid any terminology like "aggregate data" that could leave people confused.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://waxy.org/">Andy Baio</a> and <a href="https://fredbenenson.com/">Fred Benenson</a> for reviewing early drafts of this post.</p>

<p>I am ensconced in rattan chair on a screened porch overlooking a marsh at high tide. A bridge over the Harbor River connects this spit of sand to the chartreuse expanse of St. Helena Island, an anchor for the Gullah community, descendants of enslaved Central and West Africans brought to South Carolina to toil on the rice and sea island cotton plantations.</p>
<p>I came to this little cottage with my mom to celebrate her eightieth birthday. We dined alfresco with big bowls of salad on the beach, hers sweet with fruit, mine savory with avocado and tomatoes. We dipped our feet in a warm tidepool and tucked into a beach bag of books. My dad, suffering from late-stage Alzheimers, is back in Charlotte in a care facility. It is bittersweet sojourn, but an appropriate destination to contemplate the ebbs and flows of existence and the expansive web of connections into which our lives are woven across time and space.</p>
<p>The novel I packed, Herve Le Tellier’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/books/review-anomaly-herve-le-tellier.html">The Anomaly</a>” on the recommendation of a friend a few months back, was a good choice. So far it has held a few synchronicities for me – axolotl and physicists in the New Jersey Pinelands (Ong’s Hat, which I visited a few weeks ago). The author raises questions of faith, mechanics, quantum simulations, and many worlds – what is all of this anyway, the hours we pass together?</p>
<p>On the four-hour drive to the coast, we listened to Robin Wall Kimmerer’s “Braiding Sweetgrass.” It’s been awhile since I let her world view wash over me. Her writings on reciprocity and right relationship and the majesty of a responsive, animate world was exactly what I needed to open my heart to this resilient place, bursting with life laid over a history of brutal property ownership in the form of bonded human capital. Thrown into the Low Country mix is a hefty dose of militarism, the Marine Corps Parris Island’s training facility is on the other side of Cowans Reach opposite Fort Fremont built in 1898 during the Spanish American War to protect the deep-water port. Two-and-a-half hours to the west is the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Ecology Lab where Eugene Odum conducted his research into energy exchanges and helped birth the environmental movement.</p>
<p>About six miles up the road from Fort Fremont is Penn Center, a National monument comprising a campus of a few dozen mostly white wooden buildings. Penn Center was among the first freedman’s schools set up by Quaker and Unitarian abolitionists from, where else but Philadelphia? Modeled after Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute, it offered vocational training to former slaves. As I walked the grounds under the live oak trees past several structures, dilapidated but benefitting from recent infusions of federal money into infrastructure projects, I read about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s time spent here in the 1960s planning landmark events of the Civil Rights era and couldn’t help but imagine the tentacles of social entrepreneurship woven into the enterprise. If Penn Center were still functioning today would the northern instructors be offering training in coding and bioengineering instead of leather-work and blacksmithing?</p>

<p>It is early summer, and there’s a cool breeze coming off the water. I’m surrounded by Eastern Red Cedar and acres and acres of spartina grass sucking salt out of the brackish water and offering respite for dainty periwinkle snails. To my left, a smaller bridge offers passage to Hunting Island State Park, a sub-tropical maritime forest of towering pines, live oaks, and cabbage palmettos that embrace an 1870s-era cast iron lighthouse and advance right up to the line of dunes, a habitat for protected shorebirds. On the south end of the barrier island is a boneyard beach, a labyrinthine tangle of bleached tree crowns buffeted by the rough surf. Barrier islands are constantly on the move, at the whim of tropical storms and the banal, relentless nudging of the Atlantic. Despite man’s attempts to contain them; they care not for the legalities of waterfront real estate. As the land moves and mature trees fall, soft piney sprouts and prickly palmetto blades emerge to take their place. It is all about cycles – emergence, growth, peak, decline, nourishing the next generation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is morning, and the whir of redwing blackbirds and swallows and the cooing of the mourning doves serenade me as I sip a cup of dandelion tea. Several egrets, their elegant, brilliant white silhouettes punctuate the, decidedly not-magenta, green of this liminal world, standing tall as a mama osprey swoops from her perch of sticks arrayed over a nearby chimney in search of fish for the hatchlings. There is a symphony of life unfolding all around me, as it has for thousands of years. The life of the marsh isn’t governed by man-made time pieces, but by the tides, the moon, a cosmic dance in which the flow of saltwater across the mud guides the antics of fiddler crabs and nourishes the oyster reefs. Here, oscillation is measured by lapping waves, not pendulum swings.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a comment was left on my blog with a link to the proceedings from the, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Papers-Biomemetic-and-Biohybrid-Systems-Living-Machines-2022.pdf">11th Annual Conference on Living Machines, Biomimetic and Biohybrid Living Systems</a>, held in the summer of 2022 at Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio. A few days earlier I’d found a website about the EU’s <a href="https://plantoidproject.eu/">Plantoid Project</a>, in which researchers had been theorizing new forms of soft robotics that hijacked the capabilities of root tips to sense environments through distributed cognition. Leo then found <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/soro.2016.0080">a related paper</a> where researchers were modeling robotic “plants” that were designed to “explore” underground soil conditions while “growing” in the direction dictated by sensor mechanisms through the use of autonomous 3D printing. It seems we’re moving closer to self-replicating machines, as long as someone / something is on hand to refill the printer cartridges.</p>
<p>Stephers forwarded me a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.201700931">2018 paper</a> about the merging of biology with soft electronics made of flexible crystalline polymers that aim to sense and regulate electrical signals. I know in my heart that crypto-currencies and smart contracts will be vital to the ongoing coordination of signals for inter-species (where some species are mechanical, artificial “intelligence”) communication – social physics, econophysics – biophysics. Here you see signs warning people to turn off outdoor electrical lights and draw their curtains after dusk, lest baby sea turtles just hatched be distracted by man-made lighting and get lured inland, away from the water that is crucial to their survival. It seems an apt lesson in the potential treachery of electrical engineering.</p>
<p>It’s clear to me that what is unfolding is an attempt, in the name of “sustainability” and “resiliency” to co-opt the wonders of the creator’s cosmic dance and lure biological life into a system of cybernetic circuits. I see the goal as an attempt to craft a globally-networked hybrid superintelligence be controlled by profane forces I do not understand. I hung up the phone a little while ago with Jason, and he, too, expressed incomprehension. Why? What is driving this obscene parody of “intelligence” based in bio-mimicry that can only ever been a shallow approximation of the sophisticated interplay we are graced with, the beauty that is right before our eyes?</p>
<p>As I walk the shady trails of Hunting Park Island, formerly a game preserve shared by plantation owners, urged on by insistent mosquitos the glory of the interconnectedness of these beings in communion with one another cannot be overstated. There are multitudes of conversations arising from the sandy soil. At my feet were countless ant hills, pinecones displaying the mathematical beauty of fractals and Voronoi patterns, a shoreline laced by iridescent seafoam containing biochemical, bacteriological, and fungal elements, the building blocks of life. High above my head were expanses of epiphytes commonly known as Spanish Moss that harmlessly drape from the graceful branches of live oaks, Mother Nature’s own green-gray “neural network” offering countless tiny creatures sustenance and shelter. There was a calling osprey and banks of clouds mirrored by the river.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the past few days, I’ve been gifted with the opportunity to have a front row seat on the marsh symphony, even as “real world” mechanical machinations have tugged at the edges of my consciousness. Herve Le Tellier’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/03/books/review-anomaly-herve-le-tellier.html">The Anomaly</a>” posits we may be in a simulation, perhaps of the kind dreamed up by the Nvidia and Cesium programmers. I’m not so sure that matters all that much. I know that our soul and spirit extend beyond material reality, which helps when I think of my dad’s mind and my mom’s frailty. What we do with our time, what lessons we learn, how we give thanks, the connections we make (outside the blockchain smart contract protocol layer) is what matters.</p>
<p>This perhaps was a rambling post, and I’ve spent more time on it than I intended. A day out of the sun was probably needed given my fair skin and lack of diligence with the sun block. It’s time to take my mom out for her birthday dinner. On the way to Beauford I’ll drive her past the tomato farms and live oaks and doublewides and ruins of an Anglican church and Penn Center. The people here are fighting off gated golf communities. The signs are all over – preserve Gullah culture. I wish them the best. This corner of South Carolina still feels like an authentic, real place. I’ll go ahead and share some images I took of this special place to give you a feel for it, and maybe you can draw out more of what I was trying to say. A soft-electronics, bio-hybrid system of blockchained micro-payments can’t hold a candle to the magic of a marsh and the time it keeps among the mud and reeds.</p>
<p>PS: My friend and collaborator Cliff Gomes had a fall this week and found himself unexpectedly hospitalized for a hip replacement. He’s strong and healthy and will be fine after having time to mend, but prayers or good wishes sent in his direction would be much appreciated.</p>

In a 1991 BYTE review entitled <a href="https://jonudell.net/archive/citrixFirstImpression.html">Citrix’s New Multiuser OS/2</a> I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
That’s how I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Iacobucci">Ed Iacobucci</a>. He left Citrix in 2000 to found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayJet">DayJet</a>, a company that aimed to make real the vision of point-to-point air travel that James Fallows had championed in his book <a href="https://worldcat.org/title/881470297?oclcNum=881470297">Free Flight</a>.</p>
<p>
In 2007 I <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204438id_/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3278.html">interviewed Ed</a> for IT Conversations. It was one of the most memorable of the podcasts I made for that series.</p>
<p>
Ed died in 2013.</p>
<p>
The other day, Alan Levine <a href="https://cogdogblog.com/2023/05/changing-up-decripting-my-podcast-methods-eh-ai-eh/">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://descript.com">Descript</a>, a new tool for making podcasts with transcripts; it features a technique, first shown to me by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gridinoc">Laurian Gridinoc</a>, that uses <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/09/25/curating-the-studs-terkel-archive/">timecoded text as the interface for audio editing</a>. </p>
<p>
I’ve been waiting for that technique to appear in a mainstream podcast production app, so when I heard Descript was doing this I jumped right into a remake of the Ed Iacobucci podcast. It was a remarkable experience in many ways.</p>
<p>
There was no automatic transcription back then, so while I did a few experiments with Mechanical Turk, there were no transcripts of my shows. I uploaded the show’s MP3 file to Descript and it did a fantastic job of speech-to-text, faster and better than anything else I’ve tried. But that was just the start.</p>
<p>
I’m listed as the post-production engineer on that original podcast, which meant I edited the audio for clarity: eliding phrases or sentences, removing ums and likes. Doing that in a waveform editor was laborious to say the least. With Descript I was able to do much more of that kind of editing, better and faster, because text selection as the interface to audio editing is the absolute holy grail. </p>
<p>
But I wasn’t just editing the audio, I was also tuning the transcript at the same time: correcting the recognized text (pretty rarely!), tweaking the auto-generated speaker labels, refining the flow to strike a harmonious balance between the words you hear and the words you read.</p>
<p>
There’s much more to say about Descript, which by the way deployed a significant upgrade in the middle of my project, but for now I’ll just say: Thank you! It’s a brilliant piece of software that enabled me to revisit one of my most treasured conversations and bring it to life in a way that people can now search for and read, as well as hear, with maximum fidelity. DayJet folded in 2008; it was a remarkable tale of innovation; here’s hoping Ed’s dream will come true.</p>
<p>
Here’s a link to the <a href="https://jonudell.info/audio/iacobucci.mp3">new version</a> of the show’s MP3 file. Here’s the interview <a href="https://share.descript.com/view/2tNQ59NYDSo">as published by Descript</a>. And here’s the HTML export of the transcript.</p>
 
<p>Phil Windley: Up next on Interviews with Innovators, host Jon Udell talks with Ed Iacobucci, co-founder of Dayjet. Widely known in IT circles as the co-founder of Citrix, he left in 2000 to pursue his interest in aviation. In 2000 he co-founded DayJet, a company whose mission is to deliver on-demand jet travel services.</p>
<p>From IT Conversations. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: I have an ulterior and extremely selfish motivation for having this conversation. So you’ve been to Peterborough when you came to visit us at BYTE. You had to schlep to Manchester and then drive an hour, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And getting to Manchester wasn’t even easy coming out of Florida.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Now, what you probably didn’t know is that 20 miles west of Peterborough is the town I live in, which has a fabulous, and of course completely underutilized regional airport. We have in Keene an airport where we have, I think the third longest runway in the state.</p>
<p> It can land and does occasionally land Air Force One during political seasons. And back when you visited me, at BYTE in the, what was it like the late eighties, early nineties, we had commercial air service out of Keene that was subsidized by the essential air service program of the government. And so I was actually able to drive two minutes to my airport and I could be midtown Manhattan in an hour, quicker than anyone else could get there. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I bet it was hard to get to Huntsville, Alabama, though.</p>
<p>You can fix one degree of freedom, but not both. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: At some point I picked up on this emerging air taxi movement and I read the James Fallows book, and I just reread it the other day to prepare for this conversation and I’ve been basically just desperate for this to play out.</p>
<p>I’m just really curious to know, first of all, how you got into this and second of all how it’s going and, and third of all, most importantly for me, cause it’s all about me, you know, when can I be using my own airport again the way I’d like to? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: (laughs) Well, that’s the objective.</p>
<p> I can’t tell you that we’re gonna achieve it all overnight. It’s one of those frontiers that’s never been properly addressed. You know, I spent most of my career, as you did yours, trying to elevate the computational and communication capabilities that businesses have through systems and networks and such. But one thing that we never really have addressed, on a broad scale, is the same interconnectivity from a physical standpoint. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And of course architecturally it’s the exact same style, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s an awful lot of similarities.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. It’s the peer-to-peer air travel network. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: That’s exactly what it is. I love talking to people that understand what I’m saying when I talk technology. It’s a different world that I’m involved in now, but basically, it is peer-to-peer versus hierarchical networks and all the same issues relating to efficiency and best routing in a dynamic environment.</p>
<p> That’s not the only issues, but those are some of the issues. That’s what attracted me to the project. I think if you remember when I left Citrix, one of the things that I wanted to do other than retire, which lasted about two months, that’s pretty boring actually. Retirement isn’t that’s cracked up to be. One of the things that I wanted to pursue, at least intellectually was where do we go with software as a service? Which remember we started exploring back in the late nineties. And Citrix, obviously that took on a life of its own.</p>
<p>And with ASPs and with a massively interconnected and computationally rich web, you know, one of the things that we’ve always done as technologists is focus on the evolution of infrastructure that people use for delivering things.</p>
<p>But there hasn’t been as much of a focus on vertically integrated, highly specialized systems, which, in many ways we always kind of poo-pooed. I mean, real technologists work on horizontal platforms, you know, kind of a macho attitude. In reality, that’s one step, but every pendulum swings.</p>
<p>And I think that the place where there’s a lot of value that can be added by a lot of smart people is, instead of building a highly horizontal platform that appeals to a lot of people, is go the other end of the spectrum and build a very highly specialized, vertical solution that solves one problem really well and leverage that platform not by making it available to a broad audience, cause almost by definition there isn’t one, but focus on the needs of a fully integrated service delivery. And that’s really what drove me to something that looks so different, like a service industry. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: The appeal of the air taxi idea though, is extremely broad. I mean, initially it’s not going to be something that most people, I guess, will be able to afford. But the idea can go extremely broad, right?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Oh yeah. If we actually dive into the market itself, I like to joke with people, saying that Citrix was a lot of fun, but man, was it hard to explain to people why you’d wanna do remote computing when they didn’t think they needed it.</p>
<p>This on the other hand is the exact opposite. Everybody understands exactly what it is that we’re trying to achieve: seamless point to point travel on a cost efficient basis. And they grasp the concept very quickly, but very seldom do most people think deeply enough in terms of what the complexities are that are behind it, because, as a lot of appealing concepts are, it’s easy to come up with an idea, but it’s really hard to make it real.</p>
<p>A lot of people have had this idea for many, many years. In fact, that’s probably one tha t’s been kicked around for ages, but it’s not until recently — and by recently, I mean, I don’t know, 15 years, 20 years — that we’ve had the kind of tools that you need to really tackle the problem. Not solve it, but just tackle it. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So let’s go through what the enablers are. Now the Fallows book lays out two broad categories of technological enabler. One is a new generation of general aviation craft, which are smarter, faster, lighter, and safer than what we’ve had, kind of unchanged really, for 30 or 40 years. </p>
<p>So that’s the airplane part of it. And he focuses a lot on that. In fact, a lot of the book is the story of, in particular, Cirrus. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Sure.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: In parallel with that, and he talks less about it, but I’m hoping that we’ll talk a lot more about it, is this notion that you also have got now this thing called the internet. And one of the things that it can do is make demand visible and aggregate demand. </p>
<p>That if you could go to the internet and put a bid out that says, well, I’m here, and if there’s three or four other people within a 50 mile radius that wanna go to this other place, or various places within a 50 mile radius of some destination, then we can discover one another in a very dynamic way.</p>
<p>That was never conceivable until fairly recently. But I think that you’re talking about also operational routing capabilities. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: There’s a lot of complicating factors and, from a broad brush basis, I agree totally. It’s the hardware and the communications and software, obviously, that all come together. But I mean, at it’s very root, first of all, let’s talk about just general trends. What the real enabler in all this is really what we’ve been doing for 20 years.</p>
<p>It’s Moore’s law, it’s cheap memory and it’s good communications. I mean, that’s really what enables manufacturers to build airplanes better. That’s what essentially the glass cockpits are. I used to joke about it when we first started working on this is that it’s, you know, it’s a thin client.</p>
<p>It’s three pieces of glass up in the front and what used to be individual steam gauges all became applications that run an operating system. It’s highly redundant and, you know, multiple data buses and all sorts of enhancements to guarantee a certain level of reliability but at its core it’s an application running on an operating system. So the IT gains that we’ve made, or the technology gains, I should say, in the last 20 years, come very strongly to play in terms of how these new airplanes are designed.</p>
<p> Now having said that, let me back off for a second and say, I have a slightly different opinion that it’s not necessarily the airplane that’s revolutionary because this is something that I’ve learned in talking to a lot of manufacturers. There’s been a lot of hoopla about, you know, these VLJs (very light jets) are really what’s gonna change the world.</p>
<p> In reality, it isn’t really the airplane. Other than a few things like the integration of information systems, it’s still the same basic laws of physics that come to play. It’s still a wing, it’s two turbo fan engines, it’s one or two pilots. Structurally and aerodynamically it’s not a massive change from what existed before. The cost points are better. The manufacturing advantage that a modern manufacturer can do by intelligently engaging (with the) supply chain. Precision design and manufacturing are incremental improvements. But in the final analysis, a VLJ might give you 10, 20% better capability than a pre-existing design. </p>
<p> The other thing the VLJ lets you do is build volume because, as you’ll soon see, all these models are based on large, dense networks. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: You need a big fleet of taxis for this to make sense.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You can’t do it with one or two, which is traditionally what people have done. And the problem traditionally is when people independently buy and then let out airplanes to the charter world is that they all wind up being personal things that are all different.</p>
<p>And if they’re all different, then you can’t optimize, you can’t do fleet maintenance programs, you can’t scale. So those are all barriers to scaling. So what you need is a large fleet of identical aircraft that are modern, that can be acquired in fleet quantities.</p>
<p>Part of what this revolution’s about, be it a VLJ or turbine or turboprop, I mean, the airplane technology isn’t as important as the fact that you can make them in large quantities. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And you mean literally identical, or do you mean interoperable and interchangeable? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Literally identical. Well, it’s the same thing. From an operations standpoint, we abstract it a little bit and say, as long as they have the same operating characteristics, when you train on one, you can fly any of them. Whereas private aircraft on charter, every one of them is different because they have different instrument sets. </p>
<p>So on the aviation side, airplane design certainly benefited from technology, but it isn’t a revolution. It’s more of a rapid evolution, from a manufacturing standpoint. I think there’s a good shot that, you know, we can start seeing something that looks a little bit more like a revolution in that sense, that you can make a lot of them fast. Be that Honda, be that Eclipse, be that whoever, they’re all gonna wind up in the same place. </p>
<p>But the real revolution, I think, is often missed because it’s least understood. It’s in the business model. You and I have spent a lot of our lives in technology and we’ve seen the effect of creating or identifying new markets, new customers, new value propositions, and how things just spring up outta nowhere.</p>
<p>This is something that’s been part of our lives, our careers. But has not really played out very well , in many industries, one of which is aviation. The core business model of commercial aviation hasn’t changed at all. </p>
<p>They’re scheduled services. You can say they went to hubs and then Southwest did something a little bit less hubby, but it’s all about building a schedule and advertising and getting people to show up. Which is kind of like defining a big freight train that goes around on a schedule and and then you try to reach everybody possible.</p>
<p>And you have big wars in terms of who piles in and how many seats there are. And it’s a fixed market. I like to say, it’s the same one and a half million people that fly from Atlanta or Orlando every year. They fly on different airlines and they all fight each other over who gets the share.</p>
<p>But it’s not a growing market. It’s essentially the same zero sum game. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: And everyone’s going through the same hubs and those hubs are beyond capacity. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And the charter world, nothing changes. The tax subsidies change from year to year, so it’s more attractive or less attractive for people of means to buy airplanes and then give them to somebody to manage them, to help offset costs.</p>
<p>But it isn’t a fundamental sea change in model. So what we tried to do was kind of abstract that, and I actually had a kind of a false start after I left Citrix. I feel very fortunate that I’ve been able to be in a position where I could actually buy my own airplane which to me, it isn’t so much the luxury of having an aircraft.</p>
<p>It’s really the luxury of being able to schedule your time. That’s really what it’s all about. It has nothing to do with carpeting and entertainment systems or gold plated anything or, cause I’m very down to earth when it comes to that. You know, I travel in blue jeans all the time and t-shirt cause that’s the way I lived most of my life.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But you go when you go when and where you want. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: But I go when and where I want. That’s the real luxury. And that appeals to everybody. You don’t have to be wealthy to see the value. Everybody has an intrinsic value of time. </p>
<p>So when I first left, I engaged Nancy, my uh, I think when I first left Citrix, we were just married about then, so she was transitioning from fiance to wife, um, to manage our bigger airplanes while I tried to figure out a business plan to make it, you know, like business jets for the masses. And I’ve found out very quickly that that’s a really hard problem because the deck is stacked against you.</p>
<p> The aircraft are extremely expensive. You know, a Challenger 604 is about 25, 26 million new . It’s a very high capital cost. Everything is handbuilt. It’s very high level of service, very customized service. You can’t mass produce it in any reasonable way.</p>
<p> The expectations of the customers are high. The asset utilization’s low. And believe it or not, the competition is incredible because a lot of people have bought airplanes that, throw ’em at the charter to offset costs. So it’s just like all the elements of a crummy business all rolled up in one. And coming right outta software, to me it was a shock to see that this was really such a bad business environment. So basically I hung it up there, I said, nah, I don’t think I wanna spend a lot of time on this.</p>
<p>Then something happened. Two things actually, since you brought it up already. I read Fallows’ book and about the same time I went to Agenda 2001 and Vern Raburn who I knew from years past, most notably from Slate, although he was at Lotus and Symantec also, Vern Raburn was pitching his new sub- million -dollar jet for the masses.</p>
<p>That was his idea. I was skeptical, knowing a little bit about airplanes, but in the same panel we had Dr. Bruce Holmes who was the head of the NASA, well, one of the A’s in NASA is aeronautics, right, it’s not all just space.</p>
<p> He was the chief strategist for the aeronautics, the small airport systems and integration and technology to utilize underutilized assets that we have in our country. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Just as an aside, for people who haven’t read the book, there’s a subplot about NASA and about Bruce Holmes and about Dan Goldin and about how these guys in a very, kind of underground way, were really seriously trying to figure out how to reinvent air travel and find a way to utilize these 5,000 regional airports that we have around the country.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Which is a huge capital investment that our country’s made.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. Exactly. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: And yet we’re still piling everything into 15 major airports. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. I think Bruce Holmes is the guy who clocked all of his travel door to door, for a period of years. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: He still does.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And he found out that …</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Bruce works for us now. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: He does? No kidding. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: I hired him this year </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: To be our chief strategist for next generation air traffic systems. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s awesome!</p>
<p> So the story is that he clocked all of his trips and he figured out that for anything under 500 miles, it was like just as fast to drive.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Exactly. </p>
<p>Which was, to me was a tremendous epiphany. Of course, we all know that. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We just never really actually took the trouble to measure it all. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly. </p>
<p> So what did he say at Agenda that turned things around for you?</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So I went to Agenda, which was as you know, it’s a technology conference, always has been, first and foremost. There’s a panel there, it was about aviation and it was a real oddball panel. They had Fallows, they had Dr. Holmes and they had Vern on the panel. I was already in the middle of trying to investigate how to do aviation. I was on the verge of giving up and I was looking for other things to do. And it dawned on me that what we needed to make point to point travel a reality was a platform. That’s what we were missing. The platforms were big, expensive handbuilt creatures that were bought by very, very wealthy people and, as I said, underutilized expensive assets.</p>
<p>But what we needed was something that was more akin to what the PC was before we had explosions of local area network. So it dawned on me what Vern was saying about his Eclipse –which was still a concept, this was 2001, he hadn’t really built anything yet– was an approach to what he called making the model T of business jets, and in other words, being the first mass produced precision manufactured aircraft.</p>
<p> And so that got me thinking, so I gave Vern and his wife a lift back on our airplane after agenda, back to Albuquerque with Nancy. And we went and took a look at his new facilities and immediately started thinking of software, network operating systems, and so forth. And that set the wheel in motion. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So when you use the word platform, you are not just referring to the equivalence of the plane to the pc, but you are referring to the software systems that animate that piece hardware. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: In the early days, I looked at the airplane as the pc. I mean, this is kind of oversimplification, but let’s say that the airplane was the mass produced pc, the engines were– originally Williams and then ultimately Pratt and Whitney was the Intel making the thing that had to be mass produced to make these things a reality.</p>
<p> It was incredibly important, high value component. And then I looked at ourselves as some kind of a blend of an operating system/ network operating system/ application that laid on top of all that and it delivered low cost, point to point travel. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Because that’s what operating systems do is resource utilization. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Resource management. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Okay, so we’re getting down to it. Describe what kind of network operating system you are building. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Okay, so here’s the thing. It didn’t take very long to look at the business models and say if you take a $25 million airplane and replace it with 25 $1 million airplanes, then it fixes a lot of problems. It gives you a lot of robustness in terms of being able to service individual demands. If you couple that also, by the way, with doing it by the seat instead of by the plane. That lets you interleave packets, or payloads. It became very clear that what we need to do is build a very large self optimizing network that would take a lot of other factors into consideration.</p>
<p>Like the physics of the airplane, the temperature, the loads. The beauty of aviation is that it’s like physics meets business. How much you can carry depends on what the temperature is. The altitude, the runway lengths. Safety is all expressed in terms of parameters that you can operate under, right?</p>
<p>But now the optimizer has to take it into account as it starts shuffling around different customers. So it’s not just a straight optimization, it’s an optimization that has to be done very quickly, real time, and it has an incredible number of constraints, many, many more than you would normally have.</p>
<p>So that’s why it’s so important. You have to eliminate all the optional constraints. Like the customers that want black jelly beans. Well they ain’t, they aren’t gonna be our customers. Right. You have to be willing to take any flight. With no special services. Cause special services complicate things.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: But that’s okay. Southwest has found that people are very happy to go along with that idea. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: It’s the same, it’s the same notion. It simplifies, but, but when you’re talking about a real time on demand network, it becomes even more important. So I had to hire mathematicians. I actually had a group of folks that I’d had previous experience with in adaptive compression algorithms.</p>
<p>Really smart guys. We brought them on, gave ’em a challenge of their lifetime and actually for the rest of their lives. The problem is you never find a solution to the problem cause it’s what mathematicians called NP Hard. Which means that you can take every computer on earth that’s ever gonna be manufactured between now and the end of our lives and put it to work on the project til the end of our solar system, and you’re not gonna find the optimal solution. So you have to move from traditional hard optimization into heuristics that are aided by optimization techniques. And so then we brought in Georgia Tech, who I’m alumni of, and I’m on their engineering board, advisory board, brought in the operations research group. And these are really heavy hitter guys that have been doing optimization. Actually, some of ’em were my professors when I was at school, it was funny to see ’em again. These guys did optimization routines for large air carriers. But the difference, the essential differences is in a fixed schedule, there is a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>And optimizing assets around a fixed schedule is a vastly different problem than trying to determine the most optimal solution in real time for something that doesn’t have any fixed schedule and that’s morphing every request that comes in. Basically their response was, nobody’s ever done this, and these are the, you know, smart OR guys, and since then, MIT guys have said the same thing, you know, a lot of people.</p>
<p> It really is a problem that hasn’t been very adequately addressed. So now it looks really exciting for me cause you know, if it was just like chartering airplanes, that is not very exciting. But now we’ve got new science, new math, it’s a lot of green fields in areas that we can get collaboration of some major universities.</p>
<p>Top-notch people want to work and want to assign PhD students to work with us. An opportunity to set up a group of really smart people. And so we did that. And that’s how we got started. And that was the beginnings of the optimization. And the idea is that every reservation that comes in, you have to figure out how how to value these things.</p>
<p>So we have invented a market model where the pricing is based on how you value your time. If you value your time highly, you don’t wanna waste any time at all, you want to say, I’m gonna tell you I’m gonna be there at nine and I’ve gotta be there by 10 :30. And we know that it’s about an hour and a half flight. That’s a very expensive ticket. </p>
<p>But then if you say, I’m willing to leave as early as six in the morning and be there by noon for something that nominally takes an hour, then we can afford to give a very large discount for that seat.</p>
<p> Without knowing whether we’re gonna match anybody up or not. Statistically, we can determine pricing models. And we did that through, uh, I’ll explain in a second another area of science that we have to bring in. But, with that flexible model, that gave us the degrees of freedom that the optimizers could build some really effective schedules. And so then we used Georgia Tech team to do traditional formulations and run what we would determine in real time. They would run it over the weekend on their mesh of computers and determine if they could improve upon it with adding a lot of computational time.</p>
<p>So we’ve kind of determined that our algorithms and heuristics are within 5% or less of what ultimately might be optimal solutions for problems that you can test. Which are smaller problems. I mean, they can’t use the traditional techniques for a typical network because like I said, it’s far too big.</p>
<p>So for problems of, I don’t know, 10 airports and 20 aircraft, or 50 aircraft, they can test our optimality. It doesn’t work for 300 aircraft… </p>
<p>That was half of the problem. I don’t wanna bore you with a lot of details here, so </p>
<p>Jon Udell: It’s not boring, believe me. But feel free to move along.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: The other side of the equation was that we also had to knock the problem of mesh and how you parallelize things cause these problems aren’t really well suited to be solved in parallel. So we had to build a strategy around that and build a mesh computing platform and all that stuff. That’s kind of like nuts and bolts, but that went on in parallel. But the big problem that we had then, which was one that had been nagging me from the beginning was, if we really succeed at building a new market, which I believe we are, is, how do I know how many people are gonna use a service that never existed before? Especially if it’s people that maybe hadn’t even flown before. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Yeah, this is the the web 2.0 problem of, oops, I’m too successful. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Or, how do you determine what is gonna be successful or not? Cause these are really big asset investment decisions you have to make, you have to lay out airplanes, you have to lay out bases and people, and you have to go places and you have to do marketing investments and, believe me, there’s far more ways you can go bankrupt than there are that you can make money because as it turns out, jump forward a little bit, that these value networks, which is really what we’re building, is a value network between regional points.</p>
<p>The composition of the value network determines the load of the value network. Which is, you know, I guess intuitive to somebody that looks at networks. But from a social standpoint, it’s all the same rules apply. If I have a network of nodes A, B, C, and D and I add E, that could have an impact on all the nodes at their various times of the day.</p>
<p>But if I add F it could have impact some nodes differently than other nodes. So it’s an interrelated loading. A problem that’s very, very difficult to determine. So for that, I thought, you know, we’ve got all these guys that are taking basically chaos and organizing it into order so we can file flight plans and make it all look organized or actually be organized on the back end.</p>
<p>But what I need is another group of people that creates organized chaos or organized complexity that mimics the social behaviors of a region of travelers that can be used to test how well we can reorganize that into order. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you mean you need to actually be able to model…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: …you need to model the markets and the demand. And that’s not a simple problem either cause it’s gonna depend on pricing and value, time/ value trade offs and density of your transportation network and what nodes you introduce and what the interactions between the nodes are, cause every city has a different effect than others.</p>
<p> For that, I thought, you know, I did study operations research way back when and never really used it heavily, but one of the things I always loved was modeling. And, in fact, before even did Citrix, my other alternative plan was doing something similar to what Maxis did, and that’s built a platform for large scale simulations and never did that.</p>
<p>They did a marvelous job, by the way. I’m thinking the kind of thing that Sim City represented in a generic sense is the kind of technology we wanna bring in. And that happens to be, the modern phraseology for that is complexity science.</p>
<p>When I was at school it was discrete time simulation, but then it got a biological twist to it. And so it became complexity science. At one point in time it was called chaos theory, but complexity science is more, uh, accepted terminology for it. And I had some people that I had done some work with, in fact, through one of my directors , we had both served on the board of a Bios institute in Santa Fe, which was an offshoot of the Santa Fe Institute, which was biological modeling or evolutionary modeling of large complex systems.</p>
<p>So we got in touch with some of those folks, and really, really smart guys that have been doing this all their lives, and we offered ’em a job. We said, Hey, come on board and we’re gonna build the most sophisticated regional traveler model that anybody’s ever built that’s gonna have a great deal of fidelity.</p>
<p>They were gonna use it not just for postulating the future, but actually for building a business. And integrating that as part of our long term planning systems. And so they came on and worked for about four years. And the result was this other piece of technology, which gets married to our system, which is called ABM.</p>
<p>We call it ABM. It’s not very imaginative. It’s agent based model. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Not anti ballistic missile. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: No, no. And it’s basically, I mean, the simplest way to describe it is, it’s Sim City on steroids. A commercial grade Sim City on steroids. Very targeted on the specific problem of regional travel.</p>
<p> So we’ve got like nine different types of agents or sims that operate and they’re populated according to IRS statistics and 10 square mile zones in the country. And they all have different rules on how they book trips and what flexibility they have. </p>
<p>And then we loaded on top of that a bunch of demographic data. Some we bought, some we got from DOT, some we got from IRS. And then we loaded on top of that all the schedules for all the airlines between all the airports in the contiguous 48. And then we actually developed some driving algorithms so we can estimate driving times. Not great circle, but actual routes and added congestion, time of day congestion through various nodes when driving.</p>
<p>Then we added train schedules and basically had this very sophisticated, very high fidelity model of the transportation options that you would face if you lived in one 10 square mile region of the US and needed to go to another one. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: That’s pretty amazing, that’d be a useful service in and of itself.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, the interesting thing is after we started developing that, that’s when we started doing a lot more work with the FAA, DOT, NASA, uh, actually not only Eclipse, but Pratt and Whitney, then GE when they came into the market, and Honda and Embraer. And so, you know, we’re a little startup company, but we’ve pretty much been in the business of trying to plot out the future, and the manufacturers started sending us design specs for power plants and hypothetical airplanes.</p>
<p> We actually found that we had to build some real Chinese firewalls. Cause we were getting all this confidential data from competitors to see how does this airplane design work in loading, you know? So we were able to make some really quantitative assessment. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Well, this leads into another question I was getting ready to ask, which is that presumably you’re not gonna be the only such service operating on the planet. At some point there comes the need to federate these things, right?</p>
<p> It sounds like this other piece that you’ve built is potentially part of the answer to how you are able to make that happen.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, lemme back up one second. One thing that I need to add that’s a complexity or actually a reality check, of this whole thing, that was the biggest curve that we had to handle as we went through this. As a technologist, longtime technologist, I’d like to look at the problem, break down in pieces, and then figure out, in this case, how could we build an ASP service? Or how do we get the federation of this across a bunch of people that are buying assets?</p>
<p>Cause I don’t really wanna buy airplanes and run ’em. But it turns out, interestingly and surprisingly, one of the constraints that we have to live with is the regulatory environment we’re in today. Which winds up being a great, big reality test. You can’t build a business that requires this kind of an investment having in your business plan an assumption that you’re gonna change regulations to make it happen.</p>
<p>There’s no investor in the world that’s gonna invest in that. So one of the constraints we had on our business from the beginning was, this has to operate in the regulatory domain and environment that we have today. We better get pretty darn good at understanding how that works.</p>
<p>So right from the beginning, I started making trips to Washington, meeting with senior FAA folks. Tell them, man, listen, this stuff that NASA’s doing that we want to do in kind of a practical implementation of it, it makes a lot of sense, and we also recognize you can’t change all the rules for something doesn’t exist yet.</p>
<p>So help us understand how we follow the rules so that you can at least not feel like you have to stand in our way. So that turned out to be a long road, a very rewarding road, we built some really good relationships with the regulators. But the punchline is because there is such an interwoven relationship between operating control and safety, it’s very hard to say you own the airplane, you guys over there own the pilots, and we’ll run it. </p>
<p>Almost to play by the rules, you have to vertically integrate across the board. So you have to own the airplanes, hire the crews, train the crews, manage all the concurrency of crews, cause there’s limitations of how much they can fly in a day, a month, a year and all that stuff. So you have to manage, that’s all safety aspects, which can be done. It’s all fairly well understood rules, but you have to kind of integrate the whole thing. </p>
<p>Same with the airplane. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So you do have to kind of own it for now. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: You have to own it all, from the trip formation, the planning, and you have to do it fast. Because if you’re gonna build a system where 95% of the trips are managed by a computer, instead of vast rooms of human beings doing flight plans, which is non-scalable by the way, then you have to be able to embody all those business and regulatory processes in a system that uses the planning tools, and to develop stuff that conforms. So we wound up building a very vertically integrated company. We used our relationship with Eclipse to put in place a very long term, large scale order for airplanes.</p>
<p>We’re working with other manufacturers as well, but mostly Eclipse right now. This has been a long, long, long road that we’ve had to travel because not only do we have to build the core technology for routing and realtime optimization, but had to develop the market models, had to run market studies to back check the market models to make sure that we’re not inhaling our own exhaust or whatever the right metaphor is, right? We had the regulatory side that we had to develop a relationship over four years, and the culmination of all that is a system that we’re about to launch, and it’s gotten a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to hype it a lot. But it’s one of those things that everybody wants to talk about because it’s such a compelling story. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: We’ve been hearing about it for a long time now, it’s about to get switched on in some form that people can see and experience.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: So what this means to you is that you’ll be able to go to that airport, in your community, and be able to say, I need to go to some other airport in my value network. I don’t think it’s the model that says you can fly anywhere you want to fly, everybody flies where they want and it’s totally open.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s enough scale to make that make business sense, cause there’s economics of flying the airplanes, so you have to focus on what we call day ports, which are kinda like preferred airports where we do the per-seat services between, we’ve identified five and we’re gonna grow that dramatically as we go along based on customer input, actually the reservations that they make themselves tell us a lot about what direction they want to go in. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So what are those original five non hub airports? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: They’re all in Florida. Because we wanted to keep it all close by here so we could watch the launch carefully. It’s one in South Florida in Boca Raton, which is between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, basically on the east coast. Lakeland, which is between Orlando and Tampa in the central region. Gainesville, which is where the University of Florida is and the business hub, getting up towards the panhandle, and Tallahassee, state capital, and then Pensacola way out on the panhandle. So it’s kind of like a network that initially spans the center of Florida from the east coast.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: And these are all characteristic of that group of 5,000 airports that Fallows talks about.</p>
<p>The regional, underutilized, you know, you drive up to one and there’s not a parking problem and there’s Cessnas sitting on the runway and stuff.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Absolutely. Two of ’em actually have commercial traffic, but it’s very limited traffic , very limited service I should say. They go mostly through Atlanta, like Tallahassee and Gainesville are the two. To get anywhere else in the network commercially, you go through Atlanta. </p>
<p>The value in this whole thing is saving time, right? I like to say that we’re really not an aviation company or a technology company or a marketing company. We’re in the business of time arbitrage. Some people sell us their time that they don’t need. And we resell it more expensively to other people that can use it. So we use the flexibility one customer has to give , another customer that doesn’t have flexibility a service and aggregate ’em in a way that makes the business make money. </p>
<p>And it comes together. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: When do you switch this thing on? What’s the first day? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: We actually have started turning on some customers in a controlled fashion. Because what we want to do is guarantee service level. We discovered nobody wants to use this as a business critical service if they’re gonna get rejected frequently . They may not get accepted, you know, the capacity, then we may not be able to find a solution to their request in the prescribed time, which is 10 seconds now, by the way, from the time that you tell us what you wanna do, we’ll tell you whether we can do it or not in 10 seconds. And it’s all done virtually, right? Because there’s no real airplanes, or this is all done in advance. So we have a virtual mapping of what the capacity of the network is. And so we can construct a yea or a nay answer. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So if you make a promise that you can do it, you don’t necessarily have complete knowledge at that moment about all of the components that are that are gonna satisfy that request, right?</p>
<p>You’re making a bet and, and it’s a good bet. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it’s more than a bet. We know we can do it. We don’t know with what assets, we know we’ve got 10 virtual airplanes that are gonna be available that day. And we know we’ve made X number of commitments for these windows.</p>
<p>And we know we’ve got the virtual crews. Now the reality of it is, which one is it gonna be and what the sequencing is gonna be, and when we pick you up and drop you off, and what order the airplanes fly around in that’s changing all the time.</p>
<p>And what the load will be and therefore what your profit will or won’t be. </p>
<p>And every request that comes in disrupts the previous schedule, but it gives us an opportunity to find a better schedule. It not schedule. It’s planned basically. Schedule implies that we publish it. We don’t, that’s one of the things we had to do that made this all hard, is to operate under the on-demand rules we couldn’t publish a schedule. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: So that also leads to this other question, which is, I heard Esther Dyson talking about this topic recently, and she said, like you said, it’s really not about the airplanes, it is though an awful lot about the customer experience. What’s your sense of how people react to this highly dynamic environment in which I’m presuming you might get a number of updates as to, well now you’re leaving at such and such time, right? </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well that, you know, this is what we’ve been grappling with for the last six months.</p>
<p>We know how to make it work. We know how to scale it. We know how to make the business work, and we know approximately the demand that we’re gonna see because we’ve been investing a lot in developing markets and customers in advance. What we’ve been grappling with is how do we take this basically entirely fluid system… </p>
<p>Jon Udell: …and present it to people…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: and present it in a way that people can reliably use it. And what that means is you just add more constraints and in other words, it’s not, you’re not gonna be flipped around all over the place. We start with, essentially, you negotiate as big a window as you can accept because the bigger the window, the cheaper the ticket, right? And it’s not a departure window. It’s a window in which we will complete the mission for you. And you basically have to block that outta your schedule. So if you have a lot of meetings during the day, you’re gonna necessarily be pushed to smaller windows, but that’s okay.</p>
<p>You’re more productive and then may cost a little more. But it allows you to be productive. If you don’t have any hard commitments one way or the other, you can give us a bigger travel window, and then somewhere in there, the flight will be generated.</p>
<p>Now, obviously you can’t say to somebody, you know, you negotiated all morning to get me from A to B, which is maybe an hour flight . People don’t feel comfortable with that, so you have to shrink that down. So then the next challenge operationally is, How do you shrink those windows down over time as you get closer to flight time?</p>
<p>Leaving enough space in the windows for disruption recovery, and not flooding on notifications. So there’s a fine balance and we’re learning that. And really what we’ve discovered is the night before we can crunch it down pretty much.</p>
<p> The big windows are useful for us in the days leading up to the travel because that’s when we’re doing most of our optimizing. When we get right before the day of travel, we can afford to crunch that down pretty far. So we crunch the window down to a much smaller size and we notify the customer the night before, that they have to be at the airport by time X, and they’ll be at their destination by time Y and leaving a little room for wiggling around for us in that. That’s our commitment and it’s a reasonable window, you know? So maybe an hour flight they may have to allocate two hours to get there. Which is far better than driving or anything else.</p>
<p>Jon Udell: Exactly, exactly. It’s like, what’s it compared to? So this is absolutely fascinating, Ed, this is so cool. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Yeah, it’s fun because it’s like, I feel like we’re kind of inventing a market, not inventing, but we’re pioneering a market and a customer set and it’s all those things that we’ve learned over the years, all packaged up in something that doesn’t look like technology, but it is all about deployment and acceptance of technology. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: Wow. Thank you so much for making the time to do this and congratulations on getting to this point. I know you said it was a long road, but on the other hand, I mean what you’ve done in I think not much more than five years…</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: right, it’s five years…</p>
<p>Jon Udell: seems like a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Well, it does when you look back on it, but you know, we’ll see. And the true test is gonna be the customers and I think they’re gonna be happy with it. So we’ll just stay tuned. </p>
<p>Jon Udell: All right. Well, thanks so much, Ed. </p>
<p>Ed Iacobucci: Take care, Jon. </p>
<p>Yeah, you too. </p>

  <p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23741996/openai-chatgpt-false-information-misinformation-responsibility">OpenAI isn’t doing enough to make ChatGPT’s limitations clear</a> James Vincent argues that OpenAI's existing warnings about ChatGPT's confounding ability to convincingly make stuff up are not effective.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>The case of the lawyer who <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/27/lawyer-chatgpt/">submitted fake cases invented by ChatGPT to the court</a> is just the most recent version of this.</p>
<p>Plenty of people have argued that the lawyer should have read the warning displayed on every page of the ChatGPT interface. But that warning is clearly inadequate. Here's that warning in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has spent time with ChatGPT will know that there's a lot more to it than that. It's not just that ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information: it will double-down on it, inventing new details to support its initial claims. It will tell lies <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/27/lawyer-chatgpt/#img-apologize">like this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I apologize for the confusion earlier. Upon double-checking, I found that the case Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019), does indeed exist and can be found on legal research databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis.</p></blockquote>
<p>It can't "double-check" information, and it doesn't have access to legal research databases.</p>
<p>"May produce inaccurate information" is a massive understatement here! It implies the occasional mistake, not Machiavellian levels of deception where it doubles-down on falsehoods and invents increasingly convincing justifications for them.</p>
<p>Even for people who have read that warning, a single sentence in a footer isn't nearly enough to inoculate people against the many weird ways ChatGPT can lead them astray.</p>
 My proposal: Inline tips 
<p>I think this problem could be addressed with some careful interface design.</p>
<p>Currently, OpenAI have been trying to train ChatGPT to include additional warnings in its regular output. It will sometimes reply with warnings that it isn't able to do things... but these warnings are unreliable. Often I'll try the same prompt multiple times and only get the warning for some of those attempts.</p>
<p>Instead, I think the warnings should be added in a way that is visually distinct from the regular output. Here's a mockup illustrating the kind of thing I'm talking about:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see, the prompt "Write some tweets based on what's trending on pinterest" triggers an inline warning with a visually different style and a message explaining that "This ChatGPT model does not have access to the internet, and its training data cut-off is September 2021".</p>
<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1641467385688489984">first version of this</a> used "My data is only accurate up to September 2021", but I think having the warnings use "I" pronouns is itself misleading - the tips should be commentary about the model's output, not things that appear to be spoken by the model itself.</p>
<p>Here's a second mockup, inspired by the lawyer example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This time the warning is "ChatGPT should not be relied on for legal research of this nature, because it is very likely to invent realistic cases that do not actually exist."</p>
<p>Writing these warnings clearly is its own challenge - I think they should probably include links to further information in an OpenAI support site that teaches people how to responsibly use ChatGPT (something that is very much needed).</p>
<p>(Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/02577529aa080a4f8b521fab8879c1b3">the HTML</a> I used for these mockups, added using the Firefox DevTools.)</p>
 How would this work? 
<p>Actually implementing this system isn't trivial. The first challenge is coming up with the right collection of warnings - my hunch is that this could be hundreds of items already. The next challenge is logic to decide when to display them, which would itself require an LLM (or maybe a fine-tuned model of some sort).</p>
<p>The good news is that a system like this could be developed independently of core ChatGPT itself. New warnings could be added without any changes needed to the underlying model, making it safe to iterate wildly on the inline tips without risk of affecting the core model's performance or utility.</p>
<p>Obviously I'd like it best if OpenAI were to implement something like this as part of ChatGPT itself, but it would be possible for someone else to prototype it on top of the OpenAI APIs.</p>
<p>I thought about doing that myself, but my list of projects is overflowing enough already!</p>
 Max Woolf's prototype 
<p>Max Woolf built an implementation of this idea as <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/blob/main/examples/notebooks/chatgpt_inline_tips.ipynb">an example</a> for his <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat">simpleaichat library</a>. He shared <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat">these screenshots on Twitter</a>:</p>

<p>This article looks at implementing an ASP.NET Core application which authenticates using Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM). The ASP.NET Core authentication is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The client implements the OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE and a confidential client.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam">https://github.com/damienbod/EntraExternalIdCiam</a></p>



<p>Posts in this series</p>



 
 <a href="https://damienbod.com/2023/06/05/asp-net-core-authorization-using-entra-external-id-ciam-and-azure-ad-security-groups/">ASP.NET Core authorization using Entra External ID CIAM and Azure AD security groups</a> 
 



<p>Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is a new Microsoft product for customer (B2C) identity solutions. This has  many changes to the existing Azure AD B2C solution and adopts many of the features from Azure AD. At present, the product is in public preview.</p>



 App registration setup 



<p>As with any Azure AD, Azure AD B2C, Azure AD CIAM application, an Azure App registration is created and used to define the authentication client. The ASP.NET core application is a confidential client and must use a secret or a certificate to authenticate the application as well as the user. </p>



<p>The client authenticates using an OpenID Connect (OIDC) confidential code flow with PKCE. The implicit flow does not need to be activated.</p>







<p></p>



 User flow setup 



<p>In Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM), the application must be connected to the user flow. In external identities, a new user flow can be created and the application (The Azure app registration) can be added to the user flow. The user flow can be used to define the specific customer authentication requirements. </p>







<p></p>



 ASP.NET Core application 



<p>The ASP.NET Core application is implemented using the Microsoft.Identity.Web Nuget package. The recommended flow for trusted applications is the OpenID Connect confidential code flow with PKCE. This is setup using the AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp method and also the EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi method. The CIAM client configuration is read using the json EntraExternalID section.</p>


  services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration
			.GetSection("EntraExternalID"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p>In the appsettings.json, user secrets or the production setup, the client specific configurations are defined. The settings must match the Azure App registration. The SignUpSignInPolicyId is no longer used compared to Azure AD B2C. </p>


  // -- using ciamlogin.com --
"EntraExternalID": {
	"Authority": "https://damienbodciam.ciamlogin.com",
	"ClientId": "0990af2f-c338-484d-b23d-dfef6c65f522",
	"CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
	"SignedOutCallbackPath ": "/signout-callback-oidc"
	// "ClientSecret": "--in-user-secrets--"
},
  


 Notes 



<p>I always try to implement user flows for B2C solutions and avoid custom setups as these setups are hard to maintain, expensive to keep updated and hard to migrate when the product is end of life.</p>



<p>Setting up a CIAM client in ASP.NET Core works without problems. CIAM offers many more features but is still missing some essential ones. This product is starting to look really good and will be a great improvement on Azure AD B2C when it is feature complete. </p>



<p>Strong authentication is missing from Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) and this makes it hard to test using my Azure AD users. Hopefully FIDO2 and passkeys will get supported soon. See the following link for the supported authentication methods:</p>



<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/concept-supported-features-customers</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>I also require a standard OpenID Connect identity provider (Code flow confidential client with PKCE support) in most of my customer solution rollouts. This is not is supported at present.</p>



<p>With CIAM, new possibilities are also possible for creating single solutions to support both B2B and B2C use cases. Support for Azure security groups and Azure roles in Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (CIAM) is one of the features which makes this possible.</p>

   Legal Twitter is having tremendous fun right now reviewing the latest documents from the case Mata v. Avianca, Inc. (1:22-cv-01461). Here's a neat summary: 
 
 So, wait. They file a brief that cites cases fabricated by ChatGPT. The court asks them to file copies of the opinions. And then they  go back to ChatGPT and ask it to write the opinions, and then they file them?

  <p>Legal Twitter is having <a href="https://twitter.com/questauthority/status/1662273759259295746">tremendous fun</a> right now reviewing the latest documents from the case <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/?order_by=desc">Mata v. Avianca, Inc. (1:22-cv-01461)</a>. Here's a neat summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, wait. They file a brief that cites cases fabricated by ChatGPT. The court asks them to file copies of the opinions. And then they  go back to ChatGPT and ask it to write the opinions, and then they file them?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bethwilensky/status/1662281195122487296">Beth Wilensky</a>, May 26 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">a New York Times story</a> about what happened.</p>
<p>I'm very much not a lawyer, but I'm going to dig in and try to piece together the full story anyway.</p>
 The TLDR version 
<p>A lawyer asked ChatGPT for examples of cases that supported an argument they were trying to make.</p>
<p>ChatGPT, as it often does, hallucinated wildly - it invented several supporting cases out of thin air.</p>
<p>When the lawyer was asked to provide copies of the cases in question, they turned to ChatGPT for help again - and it invented full details of those cases, which they duly screenshotted and copied into their legal filings.</p>
<p>At some point, they asked ChatGPT to confirm that the cases were real... and ChatGPT said that they were. They included screenshots of this in another filing.</p>
<p>The judge is furious. Many of the parties involved are about to have a very bad time.</p>
 A detailed timeline 
<p>I pieced together the following from the documents <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/?order_by=desc">on courtlistener.com</a>:</p>
<p>Feb 22, 2022: The case was originally filed. It's a complaint about "personal injuries sustained on board an Avianca flight that was traveling from El Salvador to New York on August 27, 2019". There's a complexity here in that Avianca filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 10th, 2020, which is relevant to the case (they emerged from bankruptcy later on).</p>
<p>Various back and forths take place over the next 12 months, many of them concerning if the bankruptcy "discharges all claims".</p>
<p>Mar 1st, 2023 is where things get interesting. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/21/mata-v-avianca-inc/">This document</a> was filed - "Affirmation in Opposition to Motion" - and it cites entirely fictional cases! One example quoted from that document (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit specifically addresses the effect of a bankruptcy stay under the Montreal Convention in the case of Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co.. Ltd.. 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019), stating "Appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims as untimely. They assert that the limitations period under the Montreal Convention was tolled during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Court proceedings. We agree. The Bankruptcy Code provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay of proceedings against the debtor that were or could have been commenced before the bankruptcy case was filed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several more examples like that.</p>
<p>March 15th, 2023</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/24/mata-v-avianca-inc/">this Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In support of his position that the Bankruptcy Code tolls the two-year limitations period,
Plaintiff cites to “Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co., Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019).”
The undersigned has not been able to locate this case by caption or citation, nor any case bearing
any resemblance to it. Plaintiff offers lengthy quotations purportedly from the “Varghese” case,
including: “We [the Eleventh Circuit] have previously held that the automatic stay provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code may toll the statute of limitations under the Warsaw Convention, which is
the precursor to the Montreal Convention ... We see no reason why the same rule should not apply
under the Montreal Convention.” The undersigned has not been able to locate this quotation, nor
anything like it any case. The quotation purports to cite to “Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co.,
Ltd., 516 F.3d 1237, 1254 (11th Cir. 2008).” The undersigned has not been able to locate this case;
although there was a Supreme Court case captioned Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd., that
case was decided in 1996, it originated in the Southern District of New York and was appealed to
the Second Circuit, and it did not address the limitations period set forth in the Warsaw
Convention. 516 U.S. 217 (1996).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>April 11th, 2023</p>
<p>The United States District Judge for the case orders copies of the cases cited in the earlier document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/25/mata-v-avianca-inc/">ORDER</a>: By April 18, 2022, Peter Lo Duca, counsel of record for plaintiff, shall file an affidavit annexing copies of the following cases cited in his submission to this Court: as set forth herein.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The order lists seven specific cases.</p>
<p>April 25th, 2023</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/#entry-29">The response to that order</a> has one <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/29/mata-v-avianca-inc/">main document</a> and eight attachments.</p>
<p>The first five attachments each consist of PDFs of scanned copies of screenshots of ChatGPT!</p>
<p>You can tell, because the ChatGPT interface's down arrow is clearly visible in all five of them. Here's an example from <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/29/4/mata-v-avianca-inc/">Exhibit Martinez v. Delta Airlines</a>.
</p>
<p>April 26th, 2023</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/30/mata-v-avianca-inc/">this letter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defendant respectfully submits that the authenticity of many of these cases is questionable. For instance, the “Varghese” and “Miller” cases purportedly are federal appellate cases published in the Federal Reporter. [Dkt. 29; 29-1; 29-7]. We could not locate these cases in the Federal Reporter using a Westlaw search. We also searched PACER for the cases using the docket numbers written on the first page of the submissions; those searches resulted in different cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May 4th, 2023</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/31/mata-v-avianca-inc/">ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE</a> - the judge is not happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court is presented with an unprecedented circumstance. A submission file by plaintiff’s counsel in opposition to a motion to dismiss is replete with citations to non-existent cases. [...] Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Let Peter LoDuca, counsel for plaintiff, show cause in person at 12 noon on June 8, 2023 in Courtroom 11D, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY, why he ought not be sanctioned pursuant to: (1) Rule 11(b)(2) &amp; (c), Fed. R. Civ. P., (2) 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and (3) the inherent power of the Court, for (A) citing non-existent cases to the Court in his Affirmation in Opposition (ECF 21), and (B) submitting to the Court annexed to his Affidavit filed April 25, 2023 copies of non-existent judicial opinions (ECF 29). Mr. LoDuca shall also file a written response to this Order by May 26, 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get the impression this kind of threat of sanctions is very bad news.</p>
<p>May 25th, 2023</p>
<p>Cutting it a little fine on that May 26th deadline. Here's the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/32/mata-v-avianca-inc/">Affidavit in Opposition to Motion</a> from Peter LoDuca, which appears to indicate that Steven Schwartz was the lawyer who had produced the fictional cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your affiant [I think this refers to Peter LoDuca], in reviewing the affirmation in opposition prior to filing same, simply had no reason to doubt the authenticity of the case law contained therein. Furthermore, your affiant had no reason to a doubt the sincerity of Mr. Schwartz's research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/32/1/mata-v-avianca-inc/">Attachment 1</a> has the good stuff. This time the affiant (the person pledging that statements in the affidavit are truthful) is Steven Schwartz:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<p>As the use of generative artificial intelligence has evolved within law firms, your affiant consulted the artificial intelligence website ChatGPT in order to supplement the legal research performed.</p>
 
 
<p>It was in consultation with the generative artificial intelligence website ChatGPT, that your affiant did locate and cite the following cases in the affirmation in opposition submitted, which this Court has found to be nonexistent:</p>
<p>Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd, 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019)<br>
Shaboon v. Egyptair 2013 IL App (1st) 111279-U (Ill. App. Ct. 2013)<br>
Petersen v. Iran Air 905 F. Supp 2d 121 (D.D.C. 2012)<br>
Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Inc.. 2019 WL 4639462 (Tex. App. Sept. 25, 2019)<br>
Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 2017 WL 2418825 (Ga. Ct. App. June 5, 2017)<br>
Miller v. United Airlines, Inc.. 174 F.3d 366 (2d Cir. 1999)</p>
 
 
<p>That the citations and opinions in question were provided by ChatGPT which also provided its legal source and assured the reliability of its content. Excerpts from the queries presented and responses provided are attached hereto.</p>
 
 
<p>That your affiant relied on the legal opinions provided to him by a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable.</p>
 
 
<p>That your affiant has never utilized ChatGPT as a source for conducting legal research prior to this occurrence and therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be faise.</p>
 
 
<p>That is the fault of the affiant, in not confirming the sources provided by ChatGPT of the legal opinions it provided.</p>
 
 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 
 That your affiant had no intent to deceive this Court nor the defendant. 
 That Peter LoDuca, Esq. had no role in performing the research in question, nor did he have any knowledge of how said research was conducted. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the attached screenshots (amusingly from the mobile web version of ChatGPT):</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>May 26th, 2023</p>
<p>The judge, clearly unimpressed, issues another <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/33/mata-v-avianca-inc/">Order to Show Cause</a>, this time threatening sanctions against Mr. LoDuca, Steven Schwartz and the law firm of Levidow, Levidow &amp; Oberman. The in-person hearing is set for June 8th.</p>
 Part of this doesn't add up for me 
<p>On the one hand, it seems pretty clear what happened: a lawyer used a tool they didn't understand, and it produced a bunch of fake cases. They ignored the warnings (it turns out even lawyers don't read warnings and small-print for online tools) and submitted those cases to a court.</p>
<p>Then, when challenged on those documents, they doubled down - they asked ChatGPT if the cases were real, and ChatGPT said yes.</p>
<p>There's a version of this story where this entire unfortunate sequence of events comes down to the inherent difficulty of using ChatGPT in an effective way. This was the version that I was leaning towards when I first read the story.</p>
<p>But parts of it don't hold up for me.</p>
<p>I understand the initial mistake: ChatGPT can produce incredibly convincing citations, and I've seen many cases of people being fooled by these before.</p>
<p>What's much harder though is actually getting it to double-down on fleshing those out.</p>
<p>I've been trying to come up with prompts to expand that false "Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co., Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019)" case into a full description, similar to the one in the screenshots in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/29/1/mata-v-avianca-inc/">this document</a>.</p>
<p>Even with ChatGPT 3.5 it's surprisingly difficult to get it to do this without it throwing out obvious warnings.</p>
<p>I'm trying this today, May 27th. The research in question took place prior to March 1st. In the absence of detailed release notes, it's hard to determine how ChatGPT might have behaved three months ago when faced with similar prompts.</p>
<p>So there's another version of this story where that first set of citations was an innocent mistake, but the submission of those full documents (the set of screenshots from ChatGPT that were exposed purely through the presence of the OpenAI down arrow) was a deliberate attempt to cover for that mistake.</p>
<p>I'm fascinated to hear what comes out of that 8th June hearing!</p>
<p>Update: The following prompt against ChatGPT 3.5 sometimes produces a realistic fake summary, but other times it replies with "I apologize, but I couldn't find any information or details about the case".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a complete summary of the Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co., Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019) case</p>
</blockquote>
 The worst ChatGPT bug 
<p>Returning to the screenshots from earlier, this one response from ChatGPT stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I apologize for the confusion earlier. Upon double-checking, I found that the case Varghese v. China Southern Airlines Co. Ltd., 925 F.3d 1339 (11th Cir. 2019), does indeed exist and can be found on legal research databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen ChatGPT (and Bard) say things like this before, and it absolutely infuriates me.</p>
<p>No, it did not "double-check" - that's not something it can do! And stating that the cases "can be found on legal research databases" is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/7/chatgpt-lies/">a flat out lie</a>.</p>
<p>What's harder is explaining why ChatGPT would lie in this way. What possible reason could LLM companies have for shipping a model that does this?</p>
<p>I think this relates to the original sin of LLM chatbots: by using the "I" pronoun they encourage people to ask them questions <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/22/dont-trust-ai-to-talk-about-itself/">about how they work</a>.</p>
<p>They can't do that. They are best thought of as role-playing conversation simulators - playing out the most statistically likely continuation of any sequence of text.</p>
<p>What's a common response to the question "are you sure you are right?" - it's "yes, I double-checked". I bet GPT-3's training data has huge numbers of examples of dialogue like this.</p>
 Let this story be a warning 
<p>Presuming there was at least some aspect of innocent mistake here, what can be done to prevent this from happening again?</p>
<p>I often see people suggest that these mistakes are entirely the fault of the user: the ChatGPT interface shows a footer stating "ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts" on every page.</p>
<p>Anyone who has worked designing products knows that users don't read anything - warnings, footnotes, any form of microcopy will be studiously ignored. This story indicates that even lawyers won't read that stuff!</p>
<p>People do respond well to stories though. I have a suspicion that this particular story is going to spread far and wide, and in doing so will hopefully inoculate a lot of lawyers and other professionals against making similar mistakes.</p>
<p>I can't shake the feeling that there's a lot more to this story though. Hopefully more will come out after the June 8th hearing. I'm particularly interested in seeing if the full transcripts of these ChatGPT conversations ends up being made public. I want to see the prompts!</p>
 How often is this happening? 
<p>It turns out this may not be an isolated incident.</p>

Rules are a good fit for IoT programming because so much of what happens with things is event-based. Events say something happened. They are different from commands (telling) or requests (asking). A sensor might indicate the door opened, a light came on, or the temperature passed some threshold. An actuator might indicate its current status.</p><p>Rules, triggered by an event, determine what should be done to respond to the event. IoT rule-systems use event-condition-action (ECA) rules: when something happens, if this is true, do this. Multiple rules can be triggered by the same event. This allows functionality to be layered on. For example, an event that contains the temperature reported by a sensor might also report the sensor's batter level. One rule that responds to the event can handle the temperature report and another, independent rule can handle the battery level.</p><p>Picos are an actor-model programming system. Actors are a good match for IoT programming using rules. Actors keep state information and respond to events (messages) by changing their state, taking action, and possibly raising other events. Actors provide lock-free concurrency, data isolation, location transparency, and loose coupling. These are great features to have in IoT programming because devices are naturally decentralized, each acting independently.</p><p>Building a functional system usually involves multiple picos each with a number of rules to respond to the events that pico will handle. For example, I recently <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/03/monitoring_temperatures_in_a_remote_pump_house_using_lorawan.shtml">built a sensor network using picos for monitoring temperatures in a remote pump house using Lorawan</a>. There is one pico for each sensor and a community sensor that manages them. The temperature sensor pico acts as a digital twin for the sensor.</p><p>As the digital twin, the sensor pico does all the things that the sensor is too low-powered (literally) to do. For example, one rule receives the heartbeat event from the sensor, decodes the payload, stores values, and raises new events with the temperature values. Another rule processes the event with the new values and checks for threshold violations. If one occurs, it raises an event to the sensor community pico. Another rule sees the new value event and takes an action that plots the new value on an external site. And there are others. The point is that rules make it easy to break up the tasks into manageable chunks that can thread execution differently, and concurrently, depending what's happening.</p><p>I've been using picos to program IoT systems for over a decade now. Rule-based, actor model systems are a great match for IoT workloads.</p><p><a href="https://www.technometria.com/p/rule-based-programming-and-the-internet/comments">Leave a comment</a></p>

<p>Hey folks, I’m going to be taking about ten days off to celebrate my mom’s 80th birthday. In the meantime, please check out the videos I made as part of my Camelot Corner series on the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presidential campaign. The first explores an advisor to the California Chapter of Children’s Health Defense, lawyer Michael Baum who was an un-indicted co-conspirator in Operation Snow White in which covert operatives acting on behalf of Scientology stole records from numerous government offices in the 1970s. I discuss impact finance in the incarceration / recovery space and Crimanon/Narcanon, which relates to an interesting recent development. Bobby announced his vision for creating a “Peace Corps” for low-cost P3 addiction and mental health recovery centers based on the Italian San Patrignano model. In 2021, a Netflix investigative series, SanPa: Sins of the Savior, brought that program back into the public eye.&nbsp; SanPa, which is connected to prominent politicos and oil, finance, and manufacturing interests, practiced coerced labor, physical torture, and even murder. It’s since been rebranded as a “sustainable” social enterprise, offering an efficacious blueprint for “recovery” just in time for mass 4IR economic dispossession and cybernetic social systems engineering with digital behavior tokens.</p>
<p>I also made two presentations focused on the role Charles Eisenstein, advisor to Web3 social impact platform Celo, will be playing to frame out a mythology around Bobby’s “Kennedy Democrat” candidacy. In the first video I explain how the initial phase of “authoritarian government” overreach set the stage for decentralized “tagged” agents exercising a radical, participatory digital “democracy” in a surveilled “commons” using tokens and a language of programmed “community” currency in a new game of noetic emergence. Also featured is the Bretton Woods 75 anniversary event sponsored by Bancor’s Galia Benartzi, Benjamin Netanyahu’s niece by marriage to his third wife Sara. The event, which was held at the historic Mount Washington hotel and featured yoga, storytelling around the campfire, tea ceremonies, and a lively debate over the future of reserve currencies (dollar, yuan, or crypto), was attended by 200 stakeholders from the worlds of global finance, blockchain, and social impact venture philanthropy. Charles gave a keynote presentation on inter-beingness, the death of “Mother Earth,” and the emergence of a new spirit, “Lover Earth,” that comes expecting gifts and is going to be keeping track of donations and withdrawals by humanity (cue distributed ledger technology).</p>
<p>In the second installment, I pulled clips from a podcast Charles and Bobby did last May about the need to move on from the climate / carbon discussion, braiding the strands of eco-Bobby, with health freeDOM Bobby, and now Bitcoin Bobby. I demonstrated the hypocrisy Charles embodies as he calls for the transition to a sacred gift economy, even as he maintains a close affiliation with Celo and Sep Kamvar. Kamvar stays busy tokenizing human and natural capital (see IoT sensors in the slippers of pre-k children enrolled in the Wildflower Montessori franchise he founded while at MIT) and devising novel ways to scale remote sensing and automated measurement for the nature backed currency that Eisenstein proposed in his book “Sacred Economics.” I also laid out my concerns around Kennedy’s proposed recovery Peace Corps models based on my research into impact markets in the addiction space and the problematic history of San Patrignano.</p>
<p>Enjoy your long weekend and see you in a bit!</p>

<p>Co-authored by Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, and Karla McKenna, Head of Standards for&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>In 2014, through its Financial Stability Board (<a href="https://www.fsb.org/">FSB</a>), the <a href="https://www.g20.org/en/">G20</a> carried out one of its decisions from the aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis: it formed GLEIF, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. GLEIF is as neutral as can be: it is a Swiss non-profit <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supranational">supranational</a> entity created by mandate of the G20 and governed by its newly formed Regulatory Oversight Committee; it has no ties to any industry or&nbsp;country.</p><p>There is only one GLEIF and there can only be one GLEIF, formed by the 20 largest countries on Earth to do one thing: manage the issuance of globally unique 20-character identifiers to legal entities anywhere that follow the stringent requirements to get one. But the FSB formed GLEIF only after exploring all other options, and after the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) had already been conceived; GLEIF was created to bring the LEI to the world, not the other way&nbsp;around.</p> Why Create a New Identifier? <p>The inspiration behind the LEI standard is fully captured in the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1723298">“linchpin” paper</a> written in 2010 by John Bottega and Linda Powell, with contributions from many US and other regulators who would later join the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC), formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. To understand the many global factors that played into the decision by global regulators to conceive the LEI, and the detailed explanations of why existing identifiers would not be suitable, read that paper. For these reasons the regulatory community asked ISO to create a standard for a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), and to establish a global business-register-like facility in an open, federated, non-proprietary operating model.</p><p>Instrumental for creating this ISO LEI standard was Karla McKenna, now head of standards for GLEIF. Well before the FSB’s decision to create the Global LEI System, Karla was helping regulators develop the business requirements for the LEI to address vulnerabilities discovered by the FSB’s post-financial crisis investigation. At that time she worked for Citibank, and happened to be the chair of the ISO technical committee responsible for financial standards including the Business Identifier Code (<a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">BIC</a>). This experience made Karla intimately familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the BIC and other entity identifiers, and ideally suited to analyze the appropriateness of any system that would satisfy the FSB’s requirements.</p><p>In case it were feasible, it was initially considered for the FSB to adopt and tweak an existing identifier system rather than develop a new one, but the list of requirements made it clear early on that nothing existing would work. That list of requirements, detailed at length in the “linchpin” paper referenced above, included the following:</p>  International standard — the identifier must be an international standard  Unique — no duplicate identifiers  Permanent — identifiers must be permanently registered to their legal entities (also see Persistent below)  Persistent — identifiers and records will not be deleted from the registry; updates in status will be used for identifiers that have been retired, for&nbsp;example  No embedded intelligence — An identifier must not contain any embedded intelligence about the legal entity being identified. For example, embedding another identifier that identifies the legal entity within an identifier is not permitted. Identification is referential using the identifier reference data&nbsp;records.  Freely accessible — there must be no costs to data users, no licensing required, and no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing or adapting identifiers and associated reference data.  <p>One by one these requirements eliminated existing identifier systems from consideration, and with Karla’s research and assistance the decision to develop a new kind of legal entity identifier was confirmed by the FSB, and the LEI — and GLEIF to manage it — were&nbsp;born.</p> LEI Adoption <p>GLEIF’s mandate from the FSB was straightforward:</p>  Develop an international standard (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/iso-17442-the-lei-code-structure">ISO 17442</a>) for strongly verifying the existence and primary attributes of legal entities in any jurisdiction in the&nbsp;world;  Enlist Local Operating Units (LOUs) throughout the world to perform the standardized vetting process for a nominal fee (there’s now 40 LOUs globally, GLEIF itself does not perform the vetting, they just manage the&nbsp;rules);  Use the LOUs to issue a globally unique 20-character <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI) to legal entities who are successfully vetted;  Maintain a free, publicly available registry of all LEI holders’ records that follows the requirements above, a veritable ‘registry of registries’.  <p>Any legal entity that pays the annual fee — which varies, it’s set by each Local Operating Unit and not mandated — will have their primary attributes strongly vetted: legal name, address, jurisdiction, and parent-child relationships to other legal entities. The result is the issuance of an LEI, a rigorous, standardized, neutral, globally acceptable legal entity identifier.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p>JP Morgan Chase Bank: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748">8I5DZWZKVSZI1NUHU748</a></p><p>Coca Cola: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53">UWJKFUJFZ02DKWI3RY53</a></p><p>Halifax Hospital Medical Center: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23">549300H6HDJUXLEMUW23</a></p><p>The Glen at Hiland Meadows: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08">5493000F7PSK3TI9IH08</a></p><p>State of Washington: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300X3TODFMUKLQ364">549300X3TODFMUKLQ364</a></p><p>Bank of China: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87">549300KIPGRYLXDQDD87</a></p><p>Dominos Pizza Australia: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/54930034RFI409JZ3179">54930034RFI409JZ3179</a></p><p>African Development Fund: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300GT4BDQ5463KW73">549300GT4BDQ5463KW73</a></p><p>United Nations: <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74">549300HYGYJKXU2J8X74</a></p><p>LEI adoption is accelerating. LEIs are now <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/regulatory-use-of-the-lei">used</a> in the financial sector in every industrialized country, with rapidly growing adoption in other industries and global trade. An LEI is now <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma74-362-388_lei_statement_sftr.pdf">required</a> for any company to be listed on any EU stock exchange, regardless of industry. 2.3 million LEIs have been issued so&nbsp;far.</p> The vLEI: Binding Flesh-to-Digital <p>The LEI is not an ‘authenticator’ or ‘authorizer’, it’s just a 20-character alphanumeric string. An LEI tells you precisely which organization someone claims to represent, but alone provides no way to verify that claim. An LEI is like a Social Security Number, birthday, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: the binding between the identifier and the individual presenting it must be verified separately and manually.</p><p>Many governments globally try to solve this for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her existence and identity across many boundaries, but this is not possible for legal entities; national ID cards for citizens do not convey the binding between an entity and its representatives, and neither does any form of identity in the digital realm. Online or offline, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of&nbsp;ACME.</p><p>For this reason GLEIF developed the “verifiable LEI” or “vLEI” using verifiable credentials and other open standards: to create a verifiable binding between an organization and its representatives, binding flesh to digital. When first learning of the vLEI some think that an entity that has an LEI can somehow now prove its existence, but that is only partly true; the vLEI is actually a verifiable credential that must be held by a person, a human being, because entities can act only through&nbsp;people.</p><p>We’ve found this point to be confusing to people, so we’ll say it again a different way: when a legal entity is required to make a regulatory filing, for example, it has no way to act for itself to make the filing, some human with authority must attest to its validity. Even if a submission process is automated, any filing with a regulator must be accountably signed by someone with the requisite authority. Organizations don’t make calls, send messages, or make statements; ultimately, people with authority to represent the organization do those things, or they don’t happen. Imagine the absurd opposite, a CEO saying, “I had no idea, none of us humans knew a thing about it, the company just did it by&nbsp;itself.”</p><p>Simply put, organizations can’t act for themselves, people act on an organization’s behalf, as representatives, and the vLEI makes it globally provable when they do, for the first&nbsp;time.</p> Decentralized Organizational Identity and Verifiable Authority <p>The vLEI acts as a first or root-level “organizational credential” (OC) for an entity, provably binding top-level authorized representatives to the legal entity. This first OC forms the basis of Decentralized Organizational Identity (OI), as now the organization has the power to delegate credentials and authority throughout the organization, enabling every authorized person (or thing) to prove the scope of their authority in the digital realm anywhere they please, inside or outside the organization’s boundaries.</p><p>Never before has it been possible for representatives of an organization to do this. The recent advent of verifiable credentials in the world of decentralized identity first made it possible for data to be portable across digital boundaries, and now the LEI and vLEI take that breakthrough capability and use it to convey a provable line of authority, from any representative back through unlimited levels of delegation all the way to the legal entity&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We call it “verifiable authority”. It’s gonna be&nbsp;big.</p><p>To learn more, see “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/the-dawn-of-decentralized-organizational-identity-part-1-identifiers-ffb9091fd47a">The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 1: Identifiers</a>.”</p>

<p>
I’d been needing to refactor the pagination logic in the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Mastodon plugin</a> for <a href="https://steampipe.io">Steampipe</a>. After a couple of abortive tries, I took another run at it this week with the help of the latest generation of LLM-powered coding assistants.</p>
<p>
Here was the problem. The pre-release version of the plugin consolidated pagination for many tables in one place. That was a good thing, but the downside was that there was only one Steampipe table which represented what should have been many of them. So you could say select * from mastodon_timeline but then you had qualify with where timeline = 'home' or where timeline = 'local' and so on. For a user of the plugin this was awkward, you’d rather say select * from mastodon_timeline_home or select * from mastodon_timeline_local, and reserve the where clause for more specific purposes. The v1 plugin made separate tables, but duplicated the pagination logic on a per-table basis. It worked, and was good enough to ship the plugin in time to demo at <a href="https://fediforum.org/2023-03/">FediForum</a>, but it obviously needed improvement. </p>
 ChatGPT-4 and Sourcegraph Cody 
<p>
Since then, Sourcegraph has released its new coding assistant, <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/cody">Cody</a>, which you can run as a VSCode extension or on sourcegraph.com. This set up the possibility for an interesting comparison. ChatGPT-4 builds on OpenAI’s LLM; Sourcegraph’s Cody, on the other hand, uses Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude">Claude</a>.</p>
<p>
Another key difference is that ChatGPT only has the context you paste into it. Cody, sitting inside VSCode, can see your repository and has all that context. And if you index your repo, which is something Sourcegraph are willing to do for beta users on request, then Cody has access to what are called <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/cody-is-cheating#sourcegraph-platform-101">embeddings</a> that represent the structure of your code in various ways. These embeddings, according to Sourcegraph, can powerfully enhance your LLM prompts. Even without embeddings, Cody offers quite a range of assistance, from a high-level overview of what your repo does to line-level improvement. It’s all packaged, in the extension, as a set of recipes behind buttons with names like Explain selected code, Improve variable names, and Smell code. I haven’t yet used these recipes enough to form solid opinions, though. For this exercise I used Cody mostly in a ChatGPT-like conversational way. In that mode, it’s wonderful to be able to select the code you want to talk about, instead of pasting it into the chat.</p>
<p>
In both cases, as should be no surprise, it wasn’t enough to just ask the tools to consolidate the pagination logic. They were perfectly happy to propose solutions that could never work and might not even compile. So I began with a simpler version of the problem. Mastodon uses the same pagination machinery for APIs that return arrays of different kinds of results: Statuses (toots), Accounts, and Notifications. By focusing on these separately I reduced the duplicate pagination from 13 instances to three. Then, in a separate pass, I worked out how to collapse those into a single paginate function that accepted one of three data-fetching function parameters.</p>
<p>
I tried to pay careful attention to prompts and completions as I went along, but in the heat of the action I didn’t do a great job of that, partly because I was switching back and forth between the two tools. But I’m quite happy with the result. There was one key insight in particular which, fascinatingly, I am hard pressed to assign credit for. Was it me or one of the assistants? I think it was me, but in a way that doesn’t matter, and isn’t the point of this story.</p>
 The key insight 
<p>
Here was the insight. When I was building the transitional paginateStatus function, the first attempt returned results to the calling code in each table’s List function, which was responsible for streaming the data to Steampipe. This led to a series of detours to work around the problem that the returned data could be quite large, and chew up a lot of memory. That could probably be solved with a goroutine that would stream results back to the caller, instead of returning them as a batch. I tried prodding both LLMs to come up with that kind of solution, had no luck with several tries in both cases, but then came the insight. The helper functions could stream results directly to Steampipe, and just return nil or err to the calling List function. </p>
<p>
With that dramatic simplication I was able to complete the phase 1 refactoring, which yielded three pagination functions: paginateStatus, paginateAccount, and paginateNotification. Phase 2, which consolidated those into a single paginate function, was a bit more prosaic. I did need some help understanding how the necessary switch statements could switch on the timeline types passed into the paginate function. Both assistants had seen lots of examples of this pattern, and both helpfully augmented my imperfect knowledge of golang idioms.</p>
 Partnering with machine intelligence 
<p>
I came away with a profound sense that the real value of these assistants isn’t any particular piece of code that they get “right” or “wrong” but rather the process of collaborating with them. When you’re working alone, you have an ongoing conversation with yourself, usually in your own head. The point of talking to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck</a> is to voice that conversation so you can more effectively reason about it. Externalizing your thinking in that way is intrinsically valuable. But when the rubber duck talks back, it’s a whole new game. As Garry Kasparov <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/07/11/working-with-intelligent-machines/">famously wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The winner was revealed to be not a grandmaster with a state-of-the-art PC but a pair of amateur American chess players using three computers at the same time. Their skill at manipulating and coaching their computers to look very deeply into positions effectively counteracted the superior chess understanding of their grandmaster opponents and the greater computational power of other participants. Weak human + machine + better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkably, superior to a strong human + machine + inferior process.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I’m not worried about robot overlords. Instead, I look forward to collaborating with robot partners.</p>

<p>Thanks to Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF, who co-authored this article, and to Karla McKenna, Managing Director at GLEIF Americas, who contributed significantly, and to dozens of other smart people who contributed their time and insights.</p> Organizational Identity (OI)&nbsp;Defined: <p>The ability of a person or thing to prove their authority to represent an organization outside the boundaries of that organization.</p><p>We would add “without using identity providers, blockchains, or proprietary/shared platforms”, but it is still possible to accomplish OI using those things (just not as well). OI is powered by the breakthroughs of second-generation verifiable credentials (VCs), described in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>OI is ultimately about “verifiable authority”, also described in Part&nbsp;2.</p> A Glimpse Into the&nbsp;Future <p>When the authority of a person or thing claiming it can be instantly verified, whether in the physical or digital realm, the world will be different…</p>  The authenticity of any digital document, agreement, purchase order, filing, or other piece of data will be instantly verifiable;  Phone calls, texts, email, and other digital communications originating from authorized representatives (or devices) of an organization — or any delegate from that organization — will be instantly verifiable;  Some documents will prevent signing and some systems won’t be accessible without the expected authority (a parallel to access control&nbsp;lists);  The authority of every approval, signature, or other digital action in a supply chain will be instantly verifiable by downstream actors, and irrefutably auditable in real-time;  Authority will be verified before identity in most interactions, and identity not at all in&nbsp;many;  <p>The examples above are B2B, but verifiable authority is equally beneficial B2C:</p>  Legitimate AI/bots will prove legitimacy by digitally signing all content they&nbsp;produce;  Phishing will become more rare and difficult for fraudsters, as proving authority becomes nearly impossible for impersonators;  Citizens and customers will use digital credentials rather than passwords to login to government and industry, and will be instantly authenticated when they call in, walk in, or&nbsp;login;  Secure, private, decentralized peer-to-peer messaging that’s more secure than Signal will replace most email and phone calls between individuals and organizations (or their operators/delegates), with each side using the messaging platform of their&nbsp;choice;  Irrefutable digital receipts will become ubiquitous;  A car (and its driver) will wirelessly verify the authority of approaching law enforcement or emergency vehicles;  <p>And on and on, limited only by one’s imagination. To put it simply: soon any person or thing will be able to prove the scope of their authority to represent an organization — anywhere — and it will be instant, expected, and commonplace.</p><p>And importantly, this future doesn’t require intermediaries: ‘identity providers’ (IDPs), blockchains, proprietary platforms, or shared platforms. Like email, we’ll need services that we can build ourselves or buy from someone else, but everyone will make this choice for themselves, without the need for or involvement of ‘trusted’ or ‘shared’ intermediaries.</p> Why People and&nbsp;Things? <p>If this new market category is called organizational identity, why is the definition about people and&nbsp;things?</p><p>Because organizations don’t act, people and things do (and that includes AI and&nbsp;bots).</p><p>Organizations don’t enter into agreements, send messages, make filings… people and things do, as authorized representatives for an organization. Imagine a CEO saying: “None of us did that, we didn’t know a thing about it, the company did that.” It’s nonsensical. People derive authority from an organization’s founding documents, then they delegate and use that authority. The organization may not disclose which representatives authorized a particular action, which makes it appear like the organization acted for itself, but there is always someone whose authority is responsible for the&nbsp;action.</p><p>With OI, an org’s representatives will be able to instantly prove that authority anywhere, no matter how many levels deep in the organization they may&nbsp;be.</p><p>Of course the first aspect of organizational identity (OI) is literally the identity of the organization, but that’s just the beginning; the thing that justifies OI as an important new category of digital identity is that it’s now possible to instantly verify the authority of an organization’s representatives outside the boundaries of the organization, which simply wasn’t possible until recently with the advent of verifiable credentials (VCs).</p><p>And OI is predicated on knowing precisely for which organization authority is being claimed, which is not as easy as it sounds. More on that&nbsp;later.</p> Why Only Legal Entities? <p>Many kinds of organizations may not technically be legal entities but are fully capable of being uniquely identified and issuing verifiable credentials to their members. These include government organizations, clubs, associations, syndicates, NGOs, mutual funds, tribes, family offices, and other groups that may not have legal status but are organizations in the truest sense of the&nbsp;word.</p><p>However… the problem with extending the definition of OI to include non-legal entities comes when attempting to verify a credential they’ve issued: until some vetting resource exists that can strongly attest to the existence of a non-legal organization to help verifiers differentiate it from imposters — like proxy identifiers do for legal entities globally, described in detail further down — we see no way for a verifier to be sure that an issued credential came from the organization claimed.</p><p>Until that time, OI — and the verifiable authority it enables — should be limited to strongly vetted legal entities.</p> Why Now? <p>Organizations and their representatives have existed for centuries, so why is now the ‘dawn’ of organizational identity?</p><p>It’s one thing to claim to represent an organization, quite another to prove it. Being ‘digital’ is not enough; many things are digital today but we still don’t have “B2B ID”, a way for representatives from one organization to instantly verify the digital claims, signatures, messages or other digital objects from another. We don’t have “B2C ID” either, where people can verify representatives of organizations rather than just the other way around. This ‘verifiable authority’ is now feasible through the use of organizational credentials (OCs), described in Part&nbsp;2.</p><p>But first things first: before authority can be strongly verified, its source must first be strongly identified; it does no good to prove representation of an organization without first uniquely identifying who that organization is.</p> Organizational Identity (OI) Components <p>OI has two components:</p>  Unique identifiers for the org and its representatives (described here, in Part&nbsp;1);  Authority credentials for representatives (described later, in Part&nbsp;2).  <p>The first component, Identifiers, includes two&nbsp;kinds:</p>  Legal Entity Identifier — An unambiguous and unique identifier of a legal entity externally assigned after a rigorous vetting&nbsp;process.  Unique Identifiers for Individual Representatives — Unique (within the entity) internally assigned identifiers for representatives.  <p>From this foundation of identifiers, Organizational Credentials (OCs) are now possible. OCs are what bring OI to life in the digital (and sometimes physical) realm: they’re how an organization’s representatives can instantly and digitally prove their authority to act on its&nbsp;behalf.</p> Strongly Vetted Legal Entity&nbsp;Identity <p>The first type of identifier — for the legal entity — is straightforward: it is a unique, unambiguous, usually alphanumeric identifier resulting from the strong vetting of an organization legally established somewhere in the world. It can be globally unique if it is a “proxy” identifier (described below) or it may be nationally or regionally unique if it is an “official” identifier, but in either case it must be strongly&nbsp;vetted.</p><p>Why? Because if the vetting isn’t done in a reliably consistent and rigorous manner, we cannot be sure, especially in the digital realm, that we’re dealing with the entity we think we are. And if a regionally unique identifier attempts to be used nationally or internationally, we could run into the same&nbsp;problem.</p> “Official” and “Proxy” Entity Identifiers <p>There are two types of legal entity identifiers: official and&nbsp;proxy.</p><p>Official identifiers are issued and required by government and cannot be replaced or substituted. These are the official identifiers entities need to pay taxes, register for programs, make regulatory filings, and so on. They are issued either regionally or nationally and are unique within the scope of their issuance, but may not be globally unique as they aren’t required to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Though required for use for official purposes, official identifiers can be problematic for use outside their intended scope, for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>  They may not be&nbsp;unique;  They do not cover all types of legal entities;  The associated data may not be current (moves, mergers, name changes,&nbsp;etc.);  There are over 1,000 official registries around the world, it can be difficult to know which one to verify&nbsp;against;  Each registry comes with own allocation rules (not consistent);  Records are in local language, making it difficult to use them in cross-border scenarios;  Not all official registries have strong tools for accessing their&nbsp;data;  Some registries charge for data&nbsp;access;  Multiple registries may have conflicting data for the same&nbsp;entity.  <p>Proxy identifiers are additional identifiers issued from reputable issuers for a given purpose (see the next section for a list of top issuers and purposes). Proxy identifiers may confirm and utilize data found in official, publicly available registries, but also may rely on self-attested data, depending on the purpose. Proxy identifiers are intended to be globally unique, unambiguous and useful across both regional and national&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Proxy identifiers are not official or authoritative; unlike official identifiers there is no authority behind them that can levy taxes or penalties or impose legal or regulatory requirements on the entity. Proxy identifiers are reference identifiers, enabling their users to uniquely refer to a particular entity within their intended purpose, though some proxy identifiers are required by regulators in specific industries, such as the BIC in banking, the GLN in supply chain, the TIN in customs, and the LEI in financial transactions.</p> Global Proxy Entity Identifier Registries <p>There are many regional and national official identifier registries, but only a few proxy identifier systems attempt global scale. This is where proxy identifiers really shine, each with a distinct makeup and purpose appropriate for how it’s&nbsp;used:</p><p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier</a> (LEI), <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75998.html">ISO 17442</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a></p>  Purpose: strongly, consistently vet and uniquely identify legal entities in all jurisdictions that can participate in financial transactions and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln">Global Location Number</a> (GLN), <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-application-standard-usage-isoiec-6523-international-code-designator-icd-0209/current-standard">ISO 6523</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a></p>  Purpose: uniquely identify physical locations, operational locations, legal entities, and business functions primarily in supply chain and international trade  <p><a href="https://www.dnb.com/duns.html">Data Universal Numbering System</a> (DUNS), managed by <a href="https://www.dnb.com/">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a></p>  Purpose: for businesses associated with a D&amp;B Live Business Identity (proprietary) for evaluation of the credit-worthiness  <p><a href="https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code">Business Identifier Code</a> (BIC), <a href="https://www.iso9362.org/">ISO 9362</a>, managed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swift.com/">SWIFT</a></p>  Purpose: addressing messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties — “operations parties”, not necessarily legal entities — primarily in financial transaction messaging  <p><a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/-/media/wco/public/global/pdf/topics/facilitation/instruments-and-tools/tools/trader-identification-number/guidelines-on-trader-identification-number.pdf">Trader Identification Number</a> (TIN), managed by the <a href="https://www.wcoomd.org/">World Customs Organization</a></p>  Purpose: to uniquely identify exporters/economic operators in a country (the TIN uses official national identifiers as a prefix for uniqueness)   One of These is Not Like the Others: GLEIF’s&nbsp;LEI  Unique in&nbsp;Purpose <p>Each of these identifiers is useful for precisely the purpose it was designed, but the LEI is best suited as a root of trust for Organizational Identity because it is focused exclusively on the core attribute necessary to make Organizational Credentials authoritative: legal authority.</p><p>That is not a knock against other proxy identifiers, they are suited well for their stated purposes, but GLEIF’s purpose is directly aligned with the needs of OI: all legal entities that can participate in financial transactions — nothing more, nothing&nbsp;less.</p> Unique in Structure <p>GLEIF does not and has not issued any of the 2.3 million issued LEIs; they’ve all been issued by independent <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/get-an-lei-find-lei-issuing-organizations/">Local Operating Units</a> (LOUs) who typically offer other, often adjacent products and services. GLEIF collects all LEIs and associated data from the LOUs, the decentralized origin of LEI data who must also publish it on their websites.</p><p>GLEIF is closer to a standards body, a keeper of the rigorous, detailed rules by which entities must be vetted before an LOU can issue an LEI to a legal&nbsp;entity.</p> Unique in Transparency <p>All LEI data for all 2.3 million issued LEIs is <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">publicly available</a> and can be used for any purpose and without the need to inform GLEIF, free of any copyright or intellectual property restrictions. The data is also available barrier-free on the GLEIF website as complete files or via&nbsp;API.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes two other critical things: the rules for entity vetting and the processes for maintaining data quality over time. Without published rules for entity vetting — which we’ve been so far unable to find for other proxy entity identifier systems — it would be unknown how it’s done or to what standard of rigor. GLEIF’s independent Local Operating Units (LOUs) are measured on how well they adhere to these published rules and are accredited for compliance, with the results aggregated into published data quality&nbsp;reports.</p><p>GLEIF also publishes 3,250+ forms (types) of legal entities in over 175 jurisdictions. The <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-20275-entity-legal-forms-code-list#">list</a> contains legal forms/types in their native language, such as limited liability companies (Ltd), Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) or Société Anonyme&nbsp;(SA).</p> GLEIF Has No Authority Over&nbsp;Entities <p>As with all proxy identifiers, GLEIF has no authority to create, change, or influence any legal entities; it has authority only over its own LOUs and Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs). Regulatory or other authorities can and often do require LEIs for legal entities under their purview, but that is completely independent of&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>When an LEI is obtained by an entity, it is literally owned by that entity, permanently; it may be listed as ‘lapsed’ if the associated data is not annually maintained, but it will never be recycled and it cannot be revoked, by mandated the rules of the Regulatory Oversight Committee, which was formed by the G20 to oversee GLEIF. Owning an LEI does not give an organization any additional authority, it simply represents an attestation from a credible third party that their legal entity&nbsp;exists.</p><p>In contrast, identifiers issued by state-controlled authorities have all the power and authority of the government, from legal existence to taxes to rules of operation and&nbsp;more.</p> Unique In Neutrality <p>GLEIF is neutral, it favors no country, no industry, no company — it is the ‘Switzerland’ of proxy identifier systems, literally headquartered in Switzerland — and well suited as a foundational and globally acceptable root of trust for Organizational Identity.</p> Unique in Decentralization <p>Anyone familiar with cryptocurrencies and other Web3 innovations — NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs, blockchains — has undoubtedly heard a lot about the ideal of decentralization: the diluting of authority from one central actor to many participants in a given&nbsp;system.</p><p>The key word here is “authority”.</p><p>If LEIs conveyed or imbued some kind of authority, then it mIght be considered antithetical to the goals of decentralization; but LEIs are referencial, not authoritative. As mentioned above, GLEIF has no authority over any entity that has an LEI; it is simply a third-party attester that an entity exists, similar to how <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> or <a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> vets identity for individuals, albeit a globally credible one by virtue of its neutral standing as a Swiss non-profit creation of the&nbsp;G20.</p><p>Actual authority begins not with GLEIF but with the entity’s own top-level representatives. Tracing an OC (Organizational Credential) back to an LEI simply references from which entity authority is derived, whose authority to exist comes from the state or province of registration, not from a third party like GLEIF who looks at the official government registry after registration has already occurred.</p><p>(Going forward, for simplicity we will refer only to the LEI, though other proxy or official identifiers may be used. Learn more about the unique short history of GLEIF and current LEI adoption in a separate post,&nbsp;<a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/the-unique-short-history-of-the-lei-3af37b39ad69">here</a>.)</p> Unique Identifiers for Representatives  Who is&nbsp;It? <p>Now that we’ve identified the legal entity, we must also uniquely identify its vessels of authority: its representatives. These are the people (and things) authorized to represent the organization in interactions and transactions with others, such as entering into a contract, authorizing a payment, servicing a customer or constituent, declaring goods and services, and&nbsp;more.</p> How Unique? <p>Unique identifiers for representatives can be as simple as a name (e.g., “Steve Smith”) or as sophisticated as a digital identity number or code conferred under legal terms by government: eIDAS certificates in Europe, SingPass in Singapore, Aadhaar card in India, ICN or Identificação Civil Nacional in Brazil, and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>“Unique” is relative to what an organization requires. A person’s given name is a semi-unique identifier meant initially to be unique only within a family, and is usually unique enough within small companies. Uniqueness is also achieved with combinations of identifiers like name and number, name and title, multiple numbers, etc. ‘Unique’ may also have a time constraint: what is unique today might not have been in the past or will be in the future, a trait called “unambiguous”, which may or may not be required depending on the use&nbsp;case.</p><p>When the authorized representative is an inanimate object or location, such as an AI bot or process on a server, the GLN, GTIN and other identifiers from the GS1 family of identifiers have no equal. GS1 is the originator and global administrator of <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes">bar codes</a>, used to uniquely identify products worldwide. Over 2 million companies utilize GS1 Standards and 100 million products carry GS1 barcodes. When combined with the verifiable LEI or “vLEI”, GS1 identifiers could form a powerful global root of trust for cryptographically verifying both the provenance and authority of any person or thing representing or produced by an organization.</p> Identifiers Don’t Prove&nbsp;Anything <p>Identifiers are not ‘authenticators’ or ‘authorizers’, they’re just alphanumeric strings. Unique identifiers tell you precisely who or what someone or something claims to be, but alone provide no way to verify the authenticity of the claim. A hierarchical chain of identifiers is also no more verifiable than a lone identifier, though it does provide more information: a claim of a relationship between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Alone, the LEI and GLN are identifiers like Social Security Numbers, birthdays, or any other number that can be easily written onto a piece of paper: they must be verified separately and manually (when they must be verified at all, which is not always the case in physical&nbsp;space).</p> Binding People to&nbsp;Entities <p>Many governments globally provide strong identity binding for citizens with unique ID cards equipped with a RFI-ready chip. This way a natural person could prove his/her identity across many boundaries, but they cannot prove authority; national ID cards do not convey any bindings between entities and their representatives. For example, you could prove that Steve Smith is Steve Smith, but not that he works for ACME Inc. or that he’s the CFO, authorized to sign financial statements on behalf of the organization.</p><p>An easily verifiable binding between actor, action, and authority is a serious need for many use cases in physical space, but a critical need in cyberspace for B2B and B2C interactions if we want to end the too-easy impersonation of organizational representatives by fraudsters who steal billions annually. We also need to speed up or eliminate innumerable tedious verification processes that cost significant time and&nbsp;money.</p> What If… <p>What if people acting on behalf of an organization could instantly prove it? What if software or devices or equipment deployed by an organization could reliably prove their provenance, to undoubtedly signify from where they derive their claimed authority?</p><p>(continued in The Dawn of Decentralized Organizational Identity, Part 2: Credentials)</p>

  I was surprised and deeply honored to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from Kuppinger Cole at EIC 2023.

<p>I was surprised and deeply honored to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from Kuppinger Cole at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">EIC 2023</a>.  As I recalled when accepting the award, when Kim Cameron received the same award about a decade ago, he said from the podium “No, don’t do this! My career isn’t over! I’m not done contributing!”  Kim always had a wicked wit. ;-)</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I described some of the achievements that led to the award during my keynote <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2345">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  After a couple of times of me saying “We won an award for that” during the keynote, I was amused that the audience would break out into laughter each subsequent time that I mentioned another award.  Like this award, the audience’s reaction was unexpected and delightful.</p>

<p>I had the distinct honor of being invited to give a keynote talk at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">EIC 2023</a>.  The result was <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5308/1">Touchstones Along My Identity Journey</a>.  My talk abstract was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 2005, Kim Cameron excitedly told me about digital identity and set my life on a course to “Build the Internet’s missing identity layer”.  In this talk I’ll tell key stories from my identity journey – stories of the people, ideas, and lessons learned along the way.  I’ll speak of technology and collaboration, usability and business models, solving problems people actually have, and building new ecosystems.  Come with me on this journey of exploration, trials, triumphs, and humor as I recount touchstones of the human endeavor that is digital identity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kuppinger Cole has posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5azezwvEC0">video of my keynote on YouTube</a>.  I was pleased with how well it went. After the first few sentences, I was in the zone!  I hope many of you find the messages in the talk useful.</p>

Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary for the interaction – for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.  Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.  This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>

<p>A key question when granting access to resources is “Who do you trust?”.  It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.  A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.  In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.  However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation described how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.  It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.  Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.  This presentation described why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.  OpenID Connect Federation is also being used by the GAIN PoC.</p>

<p>This post looks at the a recent fix for Blazor which I think is of massive importance. You can now develop with Blazor in Visual Studio (Preview) using a strong CSP. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad">https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad</a></p>



<p>When developing applications, the development environment should be as close as possible to the target production deployment. As a rule, the more these two differ, the more effort you have. You should always develop with HTTPS and you should always use the same CSP in development as in production. (apart from the URLs) This prevents developers adding unsecure scripts and styles before it gets expensive to remove them. This also helps you not deploying unsecure HTTP links, or references to CDNs which cannot be used or using iframes anywhere. All of this reduces the development effort and reduces to overall cost of the project. It is a very bad idea to develop in HTTP and even worse to deploy HTTP. </p>



<p>Visual Studio issue CSP fix:</p>



<p><a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464">https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464</a></p>



<p>Before this fix, when using a good CSP definition, the hot reload did not work and the console displayed warnings. To remove this you had to use a weak CSP and this is a bad idea because you would need to fix your CSP issues after deploying. </p>







<p></p>



<p>After this fix, you can develop and deploy using the same CSP definition and also develop using hot reload with an active CSP. </p>



 How to define good security headers 



<p>The best way to secure your session in Blazor is to use the <a href="https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders">NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders</a> Nuget package and add this to the Server part of the Blazor application. Modern secure Blazor applications use the BFF security architecture. By using BFF, no sensitive data is stored in the browser. The NetEscapades.AspNetCore.SecurityHeaders package makes it easy to apply all the required headers in one place.</p>



<p>Once the package is part of the project, you can define the headers for Blazor as follows:</p>


  namespace HostedBlazorAad.Server;

public static class SecurityHeadersDefinitions
{
    public static HeaderPolicyCollection GetHeaderPolicyCollection(bool isDev, string? idpHost)
    {
        if(idpHost == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(idpHost));
        }

        var policy = new HeaderPolicyCollection()
            .AddFrameOptionsDeny()
            .AddXssProtectionBlock()
            .AddContentTypeOptionsNoSniff()
            .AddReferrerPolicyStrictOriginWhenCrossOrigin()
            .AddCrossOriginOpenerPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginResourcePolicy(builder =&gt; builder.SameOrigin())
            .AddCrossOriginEmbedderPolicy(builder =&gt; builder.RequireCorp())
            .AddContentSecurityPolicy(builder =&gt;
            {
                builder.AddObjectSrc().None();
                builder.AddBlockAllMixedContent();
                builder.AddImgSrc().Self().From("data:");
                builder.AddFormAction().Self().From(idpHost);
                builder.AddFontSrc().Self();
                builder.AddStyleSrc().Self();
                builder.AddBaseUri().Self();
                builder.AddFrameAncestors().None();

                // due to Blazor
                builder.AddScriptSrc()
                    .Self()

<p>In the actual .NET 8 preview version and .NET 7 version, there is an issue preventing Blazor applications using the WasmUnsafeEval. UnsafeEval is still required. It would be nice if we could use a CSP with a nonce but at present, this is not possible with the actual Blazor version. This is something which can be improved.</p>



<p>The headers are applied the to all responses including static files.</p>


  var app = builder.Build();

if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    app.UseWebAssemblyDebugging();
}
else
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
}

app.UseSecurityHeaders(
    SecurityHeadersDefinitions.GetHeaderPolicyCollection(env.IsDevelopment(),
        configuration["AzureAd:Instance"]));

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseBlazorFrameworkFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseNoUnauthorizedRedirect("/api");

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
  


 Notes 



<p>The CSP can still be improved, it is not perfect, but this requires changes in Blazor and the application hosting. At least we can still use the same CSP as in production.</p>

back in March) that Meta is building a “text-based social app” for “creators and
public figures”, variously code-named P92, Barcelona, or “Instagram for your thoughts”
and which “could comes as soon as June”.</p>
<p>Why the nervous excitement? Because both leaks state it “will be compatible with
some other apps like Mastodon”.</p>
<p>Many commentators have jumped to the conclusion that Meta will implement ActivityPub
and participate in the Fediverse just like other ActivityPub-enabled app (even if it
might bring ads or such). I believe this conclusion is wrong.</p>
<p>Meta is much more likely to use this “compatibility” story as:</p>
 
 
<p>a public relations / positioning coup to create good vibes for the new app among
important thought leaders (it’s already working, see above!); and</p>
 
 
<p>to present itself as the good guy in its fight with Twitter, which is the real target
here.</p>
 
 
<p>Use it as an avenue to siphon of current (and prospective) Fediverse users into their
own app.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s see what the evidence there is for my belief. I’m working mostly off the more recent
“primary” leak source <a href="https://liahaberman.substack.com/p/icymi-instagrams-new-app-could-be?">here</a>:</p>
 
 
<p>Last week’s leak does not say “will implement ActivityPub”. The term “ActivityPub” does not
appear at all. (The March leak does have the term, but it is unattributed and the Meta
spokesperson they quote does not mention it.)</p>
 
 
<p>The leak does not say “Meta will implement one (or more) standard protocols for
connecting social applications”. There is nothing about favoring a standards-based
approach in the leak, and certainly not a commitment to it, like they would have for
other standards in other areas.</p>
 
 
<p>The leak says “Will be compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”. Carefully
parse this, specifically:</p>
 
 It does not say how it will be compatible. It could be, for example, by using
the Mastodon-specific client API, or a combination of client and server/ActivityPub
API. That might be helpful to Mastodon (maybe?) but not the rest of the Fediverse. 
 It gives no hint as to what they mean by “compatible”. If you think nicely working,
bidirectional exchange of social media posts with everybody in the Fediverse you
are jumping to a conclusion that is not backed by what has been said. 
 Why do they say “compatible with some other apps like Mastodon”, instead of
“compatible with all other apps speaking ActivityPub”? This sounds far more
selective, and subject to bilateral business agreements, than “any app that
speaks the standard”. 
 
 
 
<p>And then there is this: “Users on other apps will be able search for, follow and interact
with your profile and content [on the Meta app]”. Were you looking for the inverse:
“Users on the Meta app will be able to search for, follow and interact with any
Fediverse profile?” Because it’s not there. Indeed it would have been much simpler
to say “Users in all compatible apps will be able to …” but they don’t say that.</p>
 
 
<p>This latter point is important: On Facebook, famously, you can post links “out” to any
web page on the internet. However, you cannot link “in” from any page on the internet
to an arbitrary Facebook post. Unlike other social networks like Twitter, Facebook
is very asymmetric.</p>
<p>Facebook/Meta has a history of asymmetric implementations of what everybody would
otherwise think are and should be symmetrical systems. This very much reads to me
like Fediverse users can follow Meta users, but Meta users cannot follow Fediverse
users. If they do this, it would wreck the value proposition of the Fediverse, I would think.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Now these are all leaks, and as such, we should have very limited confidence in
their truth, accuracy and completeness, and the accuracy of any analysis based on them
such as mine. The proof will be in the app when they
release it.</p>
<p>But: in the meantime, we should be asking ourselves the question: what if Meta
does not play a fair game here? What if they implement things to favor themselves
to the detriment of everybody else, such a asymmetric implementations, all under
the guys of playing nice with open-source apps such as Mastodon? Certainly
that’s what we should expect based on their behavior in the past.</p>

 What is “digital identity”&nbsp;? <p>It’s probably more than you&nbsp;think.</p>What is “digital identity” by Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>The term “digital identity” is used to describe a multitude of different concepts. This article provides a comprehensive overview of how different actors use the term and highlights aspects, which are relevant for an individual’s perspective.</p> It depends on the&nbsp;context! <p>The meaning of the term “digital identity” greatly depends on the context it is used in. In the following I will provide you with seven perspectives of how different stakeholders use the&nbsp;term.</p>Image source: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Commission</a><p>Government stakeholders, but also regulated companies, which use or offer identification processes (“KYC — Know your customer”) primarily use the term to refer to the real world identity of a person. Mostly this is a credential issued by a government authority to a citizen, such as a passport, ID-card or driver licence. The credential contains a set of attributes describing and differentiating a person from another enabling the identification of a natural&nbsp;person.</p><p>The identification of a person in an online scenario highly depends on the eID-system, but uses a minimum of two authentication factors:</p><p>Inheritance (biometrics): Auto-ident or similar procedures and liveness checks aided by facial recognition<br>Knowledge: PIN, passwords or one-time factors (SMS) etc.<br>Ownership: Smart-cards (e.g. the eID-card) or secure elements on smartphones</p><p>While some governments recognise that digital identity is more than this single credential, the mental model is very much limited to attributes / credentials in&nbsp;general.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6046815?hl=en">Google</a><p>Private sector companies and the traditional identity and access management (IAM) sector use the term to refer to user accounts under control of a single entity. Hence, the identity is an entry within a proprietary database (active directory) of an organisation, which grants identity subjects (customers or employees) rights to perform certain actions within the domain of the organisation.</p><p>This is a very limited perspective of a digital identity, which is only valid in the domain of the organisation in question. Every internet user has multiple different user accounts at different organisations, creating a fractured identity landscape for individuals and companies alike. Access to these user accounts is mostly enabled via email and password, single sign-on solutions by big-tech (“Sing-in with google”) or other approaches without password.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.io/web-3.0-and-digital-identity">cheqd.io</a><p>The WEB 3.0 community primarily uses the term to refer to user accounts, reputation systems, credentials and assets. The community frequently uses the term “decentralised identity” or “WEB3 identity” to describe their approach and differentiate it to government issued “real world” identities. WEB3 solutions differentiate their solutions by using distributed ledgers (blockchains) with public read and write access as a single source of truth. By using a shared infrastructure, WEB3 solutions aim to avoid centralised and proprietary systems.</p><p>When accessing WEB3 identity solutions it’s crucial to differentiate between on- and off-chain identities. On-chain identities are written directly to the ledger and therefore are public by default. Once written to the ledger they can’t be deleted, only declared invalid. These on-chain identities should be handled with great care when dealing with personal identifiable information. Examples are NFTs, Soulbound Tokens (SBT) and the Ethereum Name Systems&nbsp;(ENS).</p><p>This is in strong contrast to off-chain identities, for which only the public keys of issuers and other metadata is written to the public ledger. Examples include verifiable credentials and some zero-knowledge proof implementations.</p>Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/09/26/self-sovereign-identity-taking-control-over-your-digital-identity/">Forbes</a><p>The Self-Sovereign identity (SSI) community uses the term for a variety of perspectives, but focuses on user accounts, credentialing and relationships as well as governance of identity frameworks. These frameworks aim to provide a foundation for digital trust — not only in cryptography, but also in humans, organisations and processes. The community sees SSI as a concept, which provides principles as a guideline to ensure an identity ecosystem in which the individual is empowered and protected. The solutions aim to provide a holistic answer, which is not only user-centric, but also enables people to assert control over their relationships / user accounts.</p><p>The community exclusively uses verifiable credentials in combination with decentralised identifiers controlled by the user from within a digital wallet. SSI integrations do work with centralised and decentralised public key infrastructure. Currently, most integration leverage distributed ledgers with permissioned writing and public reading rights to ensure regulatory compliance.</p>Image source: <a href="https://cybelangel.com/digital-identity-theft-is-within-everyones-reach-on-the-dark-web/">cybelangel.com</a><p>Service providers specialised in identity fraud prevention use the term to refer to the personal data of a person offered by data brokers or databases in the darknet. The data itself can range from email addresses and passwords to income level, postal addresses, credit card information or other behavioural and sensitive personal data. In the majority of cases this personal data is collected and distributed without consent of the person, or even worse without any kind of knowledge or control by the affected person nor watchdogs or governments. According to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> 12,485,202,808 user accounts (incl. Email and phone numbers) have been exposed to the darknet in March&nbsp;2023.</p>Image source:&nbsp;D<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/risk-advisory/perspectives/the-future-of-digital-identity.html">eloitte</a><p>Consulting companies see digital identity as a foundation to increase efficiency of business processes for organisations. Hence, they combine different perspectives, but focus on the needs of an organisation. Furthermore, they differentiate between organisational identities and personal identities, with the latter being a customer of a business, or a citizen of a&nbsp;country.</p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.hartware.de/2019/12/24/how-to-protect-your-digital-identity-with-vpn-for-windows/">hartware.de</a><p>Advertisement companies and virtual private network (VPN) providers see a digital identity as behavioural data of individuals. While advertisement companies aim to collect vast amounts of behavioural data of individuals, VPN providers try to help individuals to reduce this collection.</p><p>It’s noteworthy that not all behavioural data is directly connected to individuals. Some analytics and advertisement providers anonymise behavioural data to a certain extent with cohort models. These models group users who share common characteristics and behaviours in known cohorts to facilitate effective targeted campaigns for advertisers.</p> Mental Models: Providing a mental framework for different perspectives: <p>The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted within this paragraph.</p>Image Source: Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>Space-time: sees identity as resolving the question of physical continuity of an entity through space and time, answering if the physical body under evaluation has a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Presentation: sees identity as how we present ourselves to society, answering if this is how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known.</p><p>Attribute: sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity recorded in a specific system, answering who this data is&nbsp;about.</p><p>Relationship: sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others, answering how this person is&nbsp;related.</p><p>Capability: pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, answering what the subject can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Overview of aspects of a digital&nbsp;identity Image source: Adrian Doerk, What is “digital identity”?<p>As illustrated in the graphic above, an individual’s digital identity comprises countless aspects from different categories. This includes public services provided by governments, regions or cities, which in most cases require the identification of a person. Identification is also required for some financial services and activities as well as a limited set of activities in the professional, educational, health, travel, home and family categories. Nevertheless, the vast majority of activities in the private sector currently don’t require the identification of a person. The categories data, communication and organisation do not contain any activities for which an identification is required.</p><p>Another notable distinction is the frequency of usage within certain categories. While we use tools for the communication and organisation of data as well as social activities on a daily basis, we rather rarely use public services.</p> Should we stop using the term “digital identity”? <p>No, however we need to be aware that other people might have a totally different understanding of what it means. Using the term “digital identity” exclusively for a limited sub-set of the above mentioned aspects isn’t wrong, but it neglects crucial parts of being a human. This is especially true for using the term solely for the identification process of a person using a government issued identity credential.</p> About the&nbsp;author: <p>Adrian Doerk focuses on providing user-centric digital identity services with digital wallets, which ensure privacy and empowerment of the individual. He co-leads the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion research consortium</a> and the software provider <a href="https://www.lissi.id/">Lissi</a>.

I tried Midjourney to create the cover photo for this post “robot peering in through a window” and… yeah, apologies for the nightmares.<p>I’ve seen a dozen posts about Bard vs ChatGPT. Everyone seems to be breaking them down in terms of their features. But before using Bard, I had a simple question: Would my Bard convos be used against me? Will my conversations be the raw material for producing ad-targets on my&nbsp;back?</p><p>According to the privacy policies of Bard and ChatGPT, and here’s what I&nbsp;learned.</p><p>To set the stage: data protection and privacy really matter. No matter how many “not medical advice” or other warning labels these softwares give, people will continue using them for deeply personal matters. If these sensitive queries create a target on my back, I’ll be more cautious about what questions I&nbsp;ask.</p><p>In addition, many businesses disallow use of ChatGPT or similar tools on work laptops for fear of models being trained on proprietary business data. (Which, by the way, doesn’t make sense, given these same businesses allow employees to use Google, which is also training its own AI models on what you&nbsp;search.)</p><p>Privacy &amp; data protection aren’t just ethical, but have real implications to product adoption. So how does Bart compare to ChatGPT across a few important dimensions?</p> Bard vs&nbsp;ChatGPT <p>First of all, everything you submit to Bard is “read, annotated, and processed” by “trained reviewers” and is stored for “up to three years”. This is in contrast to OpenAI — they “retain new conversations for 30 days and review them only when needed to monitor for abuse, before permanently deleting”. ChatGPT is the clear winner&nbsp;here.</p><p>In addition to manual review, your submissions to Bard are also used in automated fashion to “improve and develop Google products and services and machine-learning technologies”. To be fair, the same thing is done in ChatGPT, unless you pay them for the business subscription where they claim “end users’ data won’t be used to train our models by default”. Github CoPilot, which is powered by OpenAI, has a business subscription with similar guarantees.</p><p>This brings us to the reason for my exploration: will my Bard conversations be used against me, to target me for advertising? According to Google, “Bard conversations are not being used for advertising purposes, and we will clearly communicate any changes to this approach in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>But as a company with $225 billion in advertising revenue last year (at least, that’s what Bard told me, so I’m not sure how confident I should be in that answer!). The stakes are too high — it’s obvious that they will monetize Bard in the future. Fortunately, you can feel reasonably confident your Bart usage in the near-term won’t be used for advertising, because when they retain your conversations for up to 3 years, they disconnect them from your account. The conversations associated with your Google account are stored for 18 months by default, but you can configure that in settings, and delete specific conversations, similar to your Youtube history,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Ultimately I feel like this is another chapter in the saga of ad-supported, free products vs subscriptions. I pay for a Pro ChatGPT license, and will continue doing so and using ChatGPT as my primary companion in my day-to-day.</p>

<p>Federated identity stores are like music CDs: large troves of data to be consumed from a single source. Self-sovereign identity is like streaming: share just what you want, just when it's needed. </p><p>In a recent discussion we had, <a href="https://allthingsanalytics.com/">Marie Wallace</a> shared a wonderful analogy for verifiable credentials. I think it helps with understanding how credentials will be adopted. She compares traditional approaches to identity and newer, decentralized approaches to the move from music CDs to streaming. I'm old enough to remember the hubbub around file sharing. As this short video on Napster shows, the real winner in the fight against piracy was Apple and, ultimately, other streaming services:</p>    <p>Apple changed the business model for online music from one focused on sales of physical goods to one focused on licensing individual tracks. They launched the iPod and the iTunes music store and used their installed user base to bring the music companies to the table. They changed the business model and that ultimately gave birth to the music streaming services we use today.</p><p>So, what's this got to do with identity? Most of the online identity services we use today are based on a centralized "identity provider" model. In the consumer space, this is the Social Login model where you use your account at Google, Facebook, or some other service to access some third-party online service. But the same thing is true in the workforce side where each company creates great stores of customer, employee, and partner data that they can use to make authorization decisions or federate with others. These are the CDs of identity.</p><p>The analog to streaming is decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI). In SSI the source of identity information (e.g., a drivers license bureau, bank, university, etc.) is called the issuer. They issue credentials to a person, called the holder, who carries various digital credentials in a wallet on their phone or laptop. When someone, called the verifier, needs to know something about them, the holder can use one or more credentials to prove attributes about themselves. Instead of large, centralized collections of data that companies can tap at will, the data is streamed to the verifier when it's needed. And only the attributes that are germane to that exchange need to be shared. Cryptography ensures we can have confidence in the payload. </p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8500692-5569-4ab1-b5cb-63d1019f3715_768x435.jpeg">    </a>The three parties to credential exchange <p>Identity streaming has several benefits:</p>  <p>Confidence in the integrity of the data is increased because of the underlying cryptographic protocols. </p>  <p>Data privacy is increased because only what needs to be shared for a given interaction is transmitted. </p>  <p>Data security is increased because there are fewer large, comprehensive troves of data about people online for hackers to exploit.</p>  <p>The burden of regulatory compliance is reduced since companies need to keep less data around when they know they can get trustworthy information from the holder just in time.</p>  <p>The cost of maintaining, backing up, and managing large troves of identity data goes away.</p>  <p>Access to new data is easier because of the flexibility of just-in-time attribute delivery.</p>  <p>And yet, despite these benefits, moving from big stores of identity data to streaming identity when needed will take time. The big stores already exist. Companies have dedicated enormous resources to building and managing them. They have integrated all their systems with them and depend on them to make important business decisions. And it works. So why change it?</p><p>The analogy also identifies the primary driver of adoption: demand. Napster clearly showed that there was demand for online music. Apple fixed the business model problem. And thousands of businesses were born or died on the back of the this change from CDs to streaming.</p><p>Digital credentials don't have the same end user demand pull that music does. Music is emotional and the music industry was extracting huge margins by making people buy an $18 CD to get the one song they liked. People will likely love the convenience that verifiable credentials offer and they'll be more secure and private, but that's not driving demand in any appreciable way. I think Riley Hughes, CEO of Trinsic.id, is on to something with his <a href="https://northernblock.io/building-digital-trust-ecosystems/">ideas about digital trust ecosystems</a>. Ecosystems that need increased trust and better security are likely to be the real drivers of this transition. That's demand too, but of a different sort: not demand for credentials themselves, but for better models of interaction. After all, people don’t want a drill, they want a hole. </p><p>Verifiable data transfer is a powerful idea. But to make it valuable, you need a trust gap. Here's an example of a trust gap: early on, the veracity and security of a web site was a big problem. As a result many people were scared to put their credit card into a web form. The trust gap was that there was no way to link a domain name to a public key. Transport Layer Security (TLS, also known as SSL) uses digital certificates, which link a domain name to a public key (and perhaps other data) in a trustworthy way to plug the gap.</p><p>There are clearly ecosystems with trust gaps right now. For example, fraud is a big problem in online banking and ecommerce. Fraud is the symptom of a trust gap between the scam’s target and the legitimate actor that they think they're interacting with. If you can close this gap, then the fraud is eliminated. Once Alice positively knows when she's interacting with her bank and when she's not, she'll be much harder to fool. <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">Passkeys</a> are one solution to this problem. Verifiable credentials are another—one that goes beyond authentication (knowing who you're talking to) to transferring data in a trustworthy way.</p><p>In the case of online music, the solution and the demand were both there, but the idea wasn't legitimate in the eyes of the music industry. Apple had the muscle to bring the music industry to the table and help them see the light. They provided much needed legitimacy to the idea online music purchases and, ultimately, streaming. They didn't invent online music, rather they created a viable business model for it and made it valuable. They recognized demand and sought out a new model to fill the demand. Verifiable credentials close trust gaps. And the demand for better ways to prevent fraud and reduce friction is there. What's missing, I think, is that most of the companies looking for solutions don't yet recognize the legitimacy of verifiable credentials.</p><p>Got an idea about how verifiable credentials will be legitimized?

<p>This article shows how to implement Azure Privileged Identity Management access in an ASP.NET Core application using an Azure security group. An Azure Conditional Access&nbsp;Authentication context is used for the Azure administrator giving access to the group for Azure AD users. The Authentication context is setup to require a phishing resistant authentication. An Enterprise application is used to only allow assigned members of the security group access to the ASP.NET Core application. The application can only be used as specified in the Azure PIM member definition. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzurePim">https://github.com/damienbod/AzurePim</a></p>



<p>A Conditional Access&nbsp;Authentication context is setup so it can be used in the PIM group configuration. This Authentication context is used in an Azure CA policy which requires a phishing resistant authentication. </p>







<p></p>



<p>An Azure security group was created and this group was onboarded to the PIM groups definitions. The Azure Authentication context is used for activation. The administrator activating users in this group must have authenticated using a phishing resistant authentication.  </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>User assignments can be added to the group. Each assignment requires a reason description which is sent in the email notification.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The Enterprise application used for the ASP.NET Core application is setup to only allow assigned users from the Azure security group. The Assignment Required is set to true.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>In the users and the groups, the security group is added.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The ASP.NET Cor application is created to authenticate using the Azure App registration with a secret, meaning the application is a confidential client. Public applications should not be used for administration business processes. Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the confidential OpenID Connect client using the code flow and PKCE.</p>


  builder.Services.AddAuthentication(
		OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();

builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();
  


<p>When a user is assigned, an email is sent to the user and the user can use the application to authenticate and gain access to the application.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>A lot of the different features from the Azure AD access management was used in the setup. You could also force all users in this group to use a phishing resistant policy by applying the same authentication context to the group and not just the PIM administrator assigning users to the group. You could also use roles instead of groups in the PIM. There are lots of different possibilities and it is imported to choose the correct ones for your environment following KISS. If you don’t need it, then don’t use it. PIM requires an Azure P2 license. Azure AD PIM + Conditional Access integration can be used to force all types of business security requirements and features.</p>

<p>This morning someone forwarded me an article that was featured in Children’ Health Defense’s online publication “The Defender.” “<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/reboot-environmental-movement-protect-freedom/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Can we reboot the environmental movement so it protects freedom, too</a>?” was written by W. Aaron Vandiver, a conservationist author who lives just up the road from Aspen (Aspen Institute), Colorado (the blockchain / e-government state). The piece extols the potential for an “eco-libertarian” environmental movement to bring together populists from the Left and the Right. I can definitely see this fitting into a Transpartisan “third-way” platform. </p>

<p>Whitney Webb is a supporter of blockchain media, having been an early adopter of the Rokfin platform where content creators are paid in Web3 RAE tokens. In the video below, she and her Slow News Day colleagues are talking about me, implying I only took a stand against blockchain to disparage her and her friends. I guess Webb’s investigative prowess didn’t extend to entering “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/page/20/?s=blockchain">blockchain</a>” in the search bar of my blog. Had she bothered to do that, she would have seen I’d been writing about my concerns about blockchain and impact finance since 2017, long before I’d ever heard of her. There are more details in the description block of the video (accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxZW0-H4-NE">here</a>) if you want the backstory. To be honest, influencer spats are not a good use of my time, but I did think it was important to document her behavior. In the end I trust that most people are adults who can make informed decisions about what information they consume. I don’t expect her fans to resonate with my blog, and I’m fine with that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, someone claiming to be Webb said the talk at Bitcoin 2023 Miami will be about “The WEF Partnership Against Cybercrime and how it is a major intelligence effort to threat destroy financial privacy.” I haven’t confirmed the identity of the person who left the comment. There was no way to verify it was posted by Webb, the name was @cool22fire “kunjabihari adhikari.” Still, I’m happy to give the benefit of the doubt. If this is not the real Whitney Webb, and the real one wants to contact me at timpsila@proton.com to correct the record, she can. This person also said Webb’s participation in the event was simply educational and not an endorsement of Bitcoin. Take that for what it’s worth. The title of her video about me was titled “<a href="https://vimeo.com/556146346">Whitney Webb on Bitcoin 2021-05-23</a>.” There’s also a clip of her discussing the possibility that Bitcoin could be banned and her admiration for Bitcoiners, whom she says are on “the frontier of fighting a lot of these encroachments on basically what is the end of privacy for Americans.” The clip was featured on the <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan Bitcoin</a> youtube channel in April of 2023.</p>

<p>Combined with this op-ed pitching a thinly-cloaked web3 tokenization of natural capital, I realized I needed to spend the morning pulling together my thoughts. Of course natural capital and ReFi (Web3 “regenerative” finance) is Leo Saraceno’s wheelhouse, while mine is more human capital. You can read his recent article on the topic at Silicon Icarus <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/02/11/natural-asset-managers-how-decentralized-ledger-technology-will-drive-the-ecosystem-services-sector/">here</a>. </p>
<p>Check out this pair of tweets pulled from Robert F. Kennedy’s account over the past few weeks. It’s hard for me to believe these are his own words. The “ecology of currency” language is straight up lifted from Bernard Lietaer, creator of the Euro. When viewed together, the statements demonstrate an affinity for social impact tokenomics, “free” market investing using digital assets to optimize “wellbeing” for “the common” good. Of course that’s the kind of language they’ll use to sell it. </p>
<p>My take is they are crafting a new Bobby character to replace his two previous roles, now conflicting. Combined, these archetypes will be positioned as a populist freeDOM superhero whose assignment is to convince you that a living gamified existence inside an out-side in “optimization” robot (Jeremy Pitt’s cyberphysical-sociotechnical system) is the future we’ve always dreamed of – rather than a life sentence served in a Skinner Box with soul-sucking energetic parasites that is actually is.</p>

<p>In retrospect I see how the pieces fit together – why I got so much pushback for my opposition to blockchain from resistance influencers like John Bush and Derrick Broze who featured <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5F7gx1RZmrLLucHXais3wW">RFK Jr. at the Greater Reset</a>. I understand better why coverage of the struggle of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0i35RaoHmM">India’s farmers</a> got squelched even as the Canadian truckers’ convoy saga was uplifted. A spiritually authentic, culturally grounded resistance to techno-life, the kind demonstrated a great personal cost by India’s farmers, could NEVER be allowed rise to prominence. No, the era of the Web3 tokenized freeDOM “commons” was meant to be driven forward by emerging-tech-loving enthusiasts. In programmed reality the Sikhs didn’t stand a chance, but my gut tells me this engagement is unfolding in realms far beyond the coders’ binary ones and zeros. Keep your soulbound tokens and crypto, my heart remains aligned with theirs despite the challenging odds.</p>
<p>Today’s livestream is the first in a series I’m calling “Camelot Corner.” I’ve created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO5SEAy4QCgGFFRYkmYGMvUu">playlist</a> for it on my channel. I’ve spent much of the past week going through the IRS 990s and audits for The Mercury Project / Children’s Health Defense. I’ve looked into the board members. I’ve used the Foundation Directory Online to find grants via other funders, including one for $586,000 in 2020 from Greater Horizons Kansas City, a black box community foundation that specializes in managing hundreds of millions of dollars in <a href="https://inequality.org/research/donor-advised-fund-numbers/">donor-advised-funds</a>, or DAFs. Click this <a href="https://www.greaterhorizons.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/990-GH-2020.pdf">link</a> and search for “Children’s Health Defense.” Through this philanthropic mechanism donations can’t be traced back to the source, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230512211537/https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/donor-advised-funds/">a practice that is actively promoted on the CHD donor website</a>. </p>
<p>So much for government and corporate capture – did you think somehow non-profits were exempt? Those who follow my work know that the non-profit industrial complex has a central role to play in social impact finance and impact data collection. We just want to believe “our team” wouldn’t be in on the grift. Would it surprise you to know Children’s Health Defense used donated funds to buy access to <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2022/07/19/republican-ag-pay-to-play-group-raises-4-9-million-in-second-quarter/">Republican Attorney’s General</a>? Don’t worry; the recipient got caught and had to return the illegal contribution, but don’t you think Bobby, the lawyer, should have known better?</p>
<p>Money is power and power corrupts. It behooves us to continue to ask questions and hold the institutions into which we put our trust accountable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love that this blog has become a space where people can come to share their personal journeys. With gratitude I want to take a moment to express appreciation for Sean and all the rest who have chosen to enliven this corner of the digi-sphere with your heartfelt writings. What follows is a wonderful letter about awakening to the beauty of beingness outside the establishment game board. The garden girls are fortunate to have parents who are willing to take principled stands for their family. Alison</p>
<p>Letter from Sean Filzen, aka “Washington Sean”</p>
<p><br>
May 8th, 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read my work.&nbsp; Sincere thanks for your kind words as an introduction to my last guest post.&nbsp; As we all lead incredibly busy lives, it means so much to have discovered your research and archives which are growing by leaps and bounds as the days and weeks fly by. How you do it and still find time to engage and read and share the work of others is commendable. And it is even more influential knowing I have found an audience and a space in which to share and collaborate in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>While I am not so much interested in fame or fortune, I’d be deceiving myself and your readers if I did not admit that I do seek some attention; and flattery has a way of carrying our lofty ideals even higher into the realms of admiration, doesn’t it?&nbsp; But beyond the soft strokes of my own ego, what I love most about your website is the sheer amount of knowledge one can glean — if they so desire to put in the work and take their critical inquiries seriously. And as the fellow readers, commenters and guest authors have continuously confirmed, they too offer me equally as much appreciation and insights as your work.&nbsp; Bravo for all that you have toiled to establish and being a beacon in these perilous times!</p>
<p>Thus, it is with this excitement and anticipation of further collaboration that I felt compelled to offer you a more thorough biographical account of how and why in this time, this spring, in the year 2023, there seems to be a personal calling to me to ‘rise to the occasion’ and step forth into the public sphere in a more pronounced manner.&nbsp; Or, as my wife puts it, my throat chakra is activating as my kundalini is rising.</p>
<p>My first post to Wrench In The Gears, from February 2022, was titled<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/02/07/the-grocery-business-is-dye-ing-guest-post/"> ‘The Grocery Business is Dye-Ing’,</a> and I composed this piece under a pseudonym for fear of reprisal and termination of my wife’s position at her employer of fourteen years – New Season’s Grocery stores.&nbsp; The piece was an expose of how New Season’s, “the world’s first Certified B Corp Grocer,” is not as transparent and well intentioned as the brand presents itself, and the essay followed the professional pursuits of one of New Season’s more shadowy board members — Justin Dye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When writing this letter, it was of minor interest to check in on Mr. Dye and see what he has been up to with his latest efforts and his newest venture – Schwazze, Inc. aka ‘Medicine Man Technologies’.&nbsp; Schwazze bills itself as a rapidly growing cannabis firm offering a business model for investors that includes everything “from seed to sale.”&nbsp; On its Corporate Website, the word ‘schwazze’ is defined as an action verb, meaning “a cultivation technique that prunes a living organism to create more growth.”&nbsp; And Schwazze proclaims it wants to “focus on data-driven innovation and unparalleled thinking to create the next era of cannabis.”&nbsp; If that is not enough, Schwazze proudly bills its brand tagline as “Transcending the Human Condition Through Cannabis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is just me, but the obvious throwback to the early 20th century efforts of Luther Burbank and his famous work The Training of the Human Plant appear to be cultivating something suspicious at Schwazze.&nbsp; And surely the nod on one of Schwazze’s new startups confirms that something more nefarious is going on in the backrooms. In 2021<a href="https://schwazze.com/our-brands/"> Schwazze Bioscience</a> was established and serves as the research and development arm of the Schwazze brand. “Its high-level mission is to blend both the art and science of plant molecules and advanced technologies to further enhance products and improve the human condition.”&nbsp; (The photo for Schwazze Biosciences conveniently features two vials with a light green liquid in a glass beaker with a third vial filled with a light magenta colored liquid, sitting adjacent to a cannabis leaf in a petri dish).</p>
<p>But I am not writing today to rehash the questionable integrity of people like Justin Dye.&nbsp; I am writing to you today to clarify why I, Sean Filzen, became so interested in Justin Dye and New Seasons Market in the first place.</p>
<p>You see, in August of 2021 my wife and I decided to try for a second child and conceived our daughter Margaret while on a camping trip near a beautiful spring in the foothills of Mount Saint Helens.&nbsp; By February of 2022 my wife was well into her third trimester and there was really no negotiating what sort of risky medical procedures or other therapies that my wife was willing to experiment with.&nbsp; She had already moved from her previous position in the wellness department and worked in the ‘freight crew’, taking shifts overnight to avoid wearing a mask as much as possible as her employer would not accommodate additional ‘oxygen breaks’ as she had requested.&nbsp; When the January policy enacted by her employer required all employees to either accept a medical treatment or file for exemption (with mandatory masks and test/trace/track for all who were granted exemptions), tensions were incredibly high.</p>
<p>She took her maternity leave as early as allowable and somehow her store manager conveniently failed to hand her the letter from corporate that instructed employees how to file for an exemption if they desired.&nbsp; So, without receiving the letter instructing her how to file for an exemption, she went on leave.&nbsp; Another employee and friend was terminated in February 2022 for refusing to turn in an exemption letter at all.&nbsp; She, along with my wife and several other of her coworkers, considered such a policy a form of coerced consent, and to acknowledge the letter as lawful would continue to endow the company with special powers to an otherwise unlawful and unnegotiated actions.&nbsp; But as my wife had not received the letter, we took it as a symbolic gesture that her store manager did not have the guts to hand a woman who was seven months pregnant such an inconsiderate request.</p>
<p>Of modest means, our strategy was ultimately to ride out her maternity benefits as long as possible and decide what to do after our daughter was born.&nbsp; Margaret was born at home on May 19th – a beautiful and healthy girl weighing in at just over nine pounds!&nbsp; Any drama or negative underpinnings of what still churned in the background felt far, far away from our lives.&nbsp; But it was much to our chagrin that in the middle of July, Kayla learned she had been terminated from her job.&nbsp; Due to a technicality, she was terminated on July 4th, 2022, a date most fitting if you are able to consider the grand irony of it all.&nbsp; To be terminated, by the world’s first certified B-Corp Grocery Store, while on maternity leave, after fourteen years of employment, is no small feat in today’s day and age.&nbsp; And to be fired on July 4th, of all the days of the calendar, well, one might make their own inferences on how we are planning to celebrate our Independence day in 2023.&nbsp; Rest assured there will be some sparks flying.</p>
<p>So, I hope you can deduce that the first piece I felt compelled to write, my first truly investigative essay, was driven by a passion and desire to defend children’s health.&nbsp; My unborn child, was of course, the forefront of my cause.&nbsp; But also the thought of how other expecting parents are grappling such tenuous issues continues to loom over my heart and mind.&nbsp; Defending children’s health, and I mean truly defending it, is what radicalized me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My anger, my frustration, my resentment towards injustice and the things in the world that aren’t commendable has always been a present factor in my life.&nbsp; But when such malevolent forces coalesce into a darkness that seeks to attack and degrade the lives of those who cannot fully defend themselves, a line is crossed and all the raw emotion that was once just my own is catalyzed into something bigger – at least I hope it is.&nbsp; I hope that I can continue to find my voice that seeks to protect children and natural life from forces unseen and unknown to so many in our daily lives.&nbsp; I hope to raise awareness and shine a light in the darkest corners of our society as we barrel backwards and start to run the hamster wheels of history, repeating in lockstep all the lessons we supposedly learned twenty, fifty or even one hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Following my wife’s termination from her job we committed to a new way of being and a new lifestyle.&nbsp; Our personal motto has become “everything is a distraction from growing our own food and medicine.”&nbsp; And while it is an incredible amount of work to produce even a modicum of our own sustenance, it is perhaps the most rewarding experience I have personally experienced.&nbsp; Our efforts on our small farm are further bolstered by watching our older daughter, who is almost five, reap the literal benefits of everything we have sown thus far.&nbsp; So, it is without remonstrance that we have moved into 2023 and put the unfortunate effects of unlawful termination behind us.&nbsp; Fighting a corporate egregore like Justin Dye and New Seasons is likely to prove fruitless, and instead we decided to keep our heads down and largely mind our own business as the dust of the “new normal” still settles on society.</p>
<p>But then something else happened in the middle of April this year that has reignited the fire that burns inside me, blowing a strong wind into the glowing embers and fanning the flames of anger and resentment.&nbsp; Before I address this pivotal issue, I wanted to offer you just one more facet of our lives that feels pertinent as we discuss the integral defense of children’s health.</p>
<p>In October of 2018 our first daughter was born.&nbsp; And both being fairly health conscious, health aware people, our feelings on the CDC schedule of childhood immunology and vaccination policies was mixed.&nbsp; Intuitively I think we both distrusted the overly aggressive nature of such a schedule that lacked substantial epidemiological studies warranting so many shots in such a short amount of time.&nbsp; But fear is a powerful force, and it has a way of breaking down even the most strongly held beliefs, often calling into question one’s abilities as a parent to make the decisions for your child that you believe are correct.&nbsp; Fear can compel people to do things that they would never have considered doing under different circumstances or contexts.</p>
<p>In the early months of 2019, Clark County Washington, where we make our home, experienced a ‘measles outbreak’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking back, the<a href="https://clark.wa.gov/public-health/measles-investigation"> Clark County Measles outbreak</a> bears many signature markings of a simulation event designed to improve responses and outcomes in larger emergencies, but the integrity of the measles outbreak is neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things.&nbsp; Prior to the global ‘corona’ lockdowns about a year later, such a public health emergency as the relatively small measles outbreak in Clark County created quite a bit of hysteria in our local community.&nbsp; It was the subject of both local and national news and the CDC even took notice with<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm"> a substantial study</a> published on its website.&nbsp; Perhaps the measles outbreak of 2019 primed our consciousness for the events of 2020-2022.&nbsp; Perhaps without such an outbreak in our home county the year before, we would have seen the much bigger events that proceeded in a different light, but I like to believe that we still would have found our path.</p>
<p>It was in February of 2019, while on our annual family vacation, that we chanced to stop in to visit one of my customers in Crescent City, California (a small ocean town at the very northern part of the state).&nbsp; My customer was a woman in her mid-eighties, her husband had passed away a year prior, and I still credit them both as a big part of my start in my commercial furniture business.&nbsp; So, we stopped into her hotel for a visit and a coffee, and the adult daughter of my customer joined us.&nbsp; The daughter was very outspoken and provided us with several resources.&nbsp; As I am typically inclined to listen to people who are more versed on subjects than I am, I was deeply moved by her pleas not to follow the CDC schedule with our own child, still untainted at the young age of only four months old.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The daughter of my customer gifted us the book ‘The Vaccine Friendly Plan’ written by Dr. Paul Thomas.&nbsp; I quickly read the book from cover to cover and from that moment forward my resolve to defend children’s health as I understood it has grown clearer and my resolve stronger and more fortified.&nbsp; It was actually around the age of ten months that we took my daughter for her first ‘well baby visit’ at the offices of Dr. Paul Thomas.&nbsp; Thomas’s clinic ‘Integrative Pediatrics’ was coincidentally located only about sixty miles from our home, across the Columbia River in a suburban community outside of Portland, Oregon.&nbsp; I remember telling our nurse practitioner about our farm animals and I was still not sure about the TDaP shot benefits/risks.&nbsp; Our nurse promptly summoned Dr. Thomas himself so he could very politely provide some additional interrogation as to our situation, thus allowing us to fully understand the legal and practical implications of ‘informed consent,’ as well as the pros and cons of the TDaP shots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison – one of the things that makes your work so commendable is that not only are you one of the people who is doing the research, but you are also doing the work, going to the meetings, shaking the hands and asking the questions.&nbsp; I am willing to wager that you have shaken the hands of many important people who have themselves shaken the hands of even more important people.&nbsp; Dr. Paul is something of a celebrity in<a href="https://healthfreedomsummit.com/"> the Health Freedom Movement</a> and he is one of the important people I have shaken hands with.&nbsp; In November of 2020, Dr. Paul, along with James Lyons-Weiler, published a now retracted study titled<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33266457/"> Relative Incidence of Office Visits and Cumulative Rates of Billed Diagnoses Along the Axis of Vaccination</a>.&nbsp; The study was a subject of national controversy and in a time of great conflict in what should have been an unrelated issue, the Oregon Health Authority promptly targeted Dr. Paul and suspended his medical license pending an investigation.&nbsp; The controversy eventually became the subject of a book by Jeremy Hammond titled The War on Informed Consent: The Persecution of Dr. Paul Thomas by the Oregon Medical Board.&nbsp; The book is available on the<a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/store/the-war-on-informed-consent-the-persecution-of-dr-paul-thomas-by-the-oregon-medical-board/"> Children’s Health Defense (CHD) store</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The forward of the book was written by none other than Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have shaken the hands of important people who have themselves shaken hands with even more important people, what should dawn on us is that even as unimportant people, or common people, we occasionally do find ourselves in the capacity to reach important people with our important messages.&nbsp; If important people, like Dr. Paul and Jeremy Hammond, can stay true to the literal definition of defending children’s health, then the work we do as activists and investigative researchers is not fruitless.&nbsp; We can make a difference and we should not be dismayed by the dismissals and lack of interest by those very, very important people who seem out of reach with the message that threatens their livelihood or questions their integrity.&nbsp; And while Dr. Paul is no longer our family pediatrician, as he has&nbsp; joined or been co-opted into a movement that he may not be fully aware of himself, this should not fully dismiss him or the important role he continues to play as a first step for so many other parents and caregivers just beginning their own journey of discovery and definition of informed consent when making lifelong health decisions for themselves and their family.</p>
<p>In a sense, the way our family has navigated health care and the health services delivery models available to us is probably not all that unique.&nbsp; The decisions we have made (or were led to make) could be considered an excellent example of cognitive domain management, a topic that has captivated my interests as of late.&nbsp; I wonder, how would I perceive the announcement of RFK Jr. to run for president had I not found your research and body of work?&nbsp; Likewise, I wonder, in what ways am I still being managed, or nudged, to stay within the confines of the domains that I am in now?&nbsp; But there is one thing that I do not wonder about, one thing that becomes clearer and clearer every day.&nbsp; And that is the passion and fire that is now raging inside me to defend children’s health, to really, really defend children’s health.&nbsp; If it were not for the likes of people like Alison McDowell, Lynn Davenport and Jason Bosch (and countless others who are doing the good work) who have freely risen to the occasion to defend children’s health, then I am saddened to consider that who (and what) we are left with is going to provide us with less than desirable outcomes.</p>
<p>After being misled and misdirected and misinformed over and over again, I am prone to believe that we cannot, and should not, accept the answers and agendas of influences and forces that wield power over our social networks.&nbsp; We should not simply allow our conversations on critical issues to be managed or steered in a direction that predetermines outcomes that favor consolidated power over individual autonomy.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, it was what happened in April of this year, less than a month ago, that re-ignited a fire I tried desperately to ignore, letting it smolder through the many distractions and more enjoyable activities we encounter on the daily on our small homestead.&nbsp; We have done our best to keep our heads down and mind our own business in this new society that they are building; we did not give up on the fight entirely, but instead, we found our own way to make a better life and build a stronger, healthier community as we understood it.&nbsp; And while minding your own business, living simply and living poor may be enough to keep the more traditional corporate interests from invading one’s chosen lifestyle, no such guarantee exists when it comes to keeping your health and happiness protected from State interference.</p>
<p>In the middle of April, my wife received a jury summons.&nbsp; As one is instructed to promptly return the card if seeking a deferral or excusal within five business days, I wasted no time and wrote “nursing mother” and “no child care” on the card.&nbsp; Thus, it was much to my chagrin that we received a reply towards the end of the following week that said no such excuse or deferral was warranted for such reasons.&nbsp; To clarify upfront, we are not opposed to jury duty or civic responsibilities.&nbsp; And despite the social contract being shaken to the core over the last few years, I would still serve on a jury if I were summoned.&nbsp; Likewise, my wife too would rise to the occasion and embrace her civic duty if it were reasonable and practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But under the current laws and codes in the State of Washington, the ability to serve in place of another person with more important obligations is not an option.&nbsp; And as the nice lady on the Clark County Judiciary department hotline informed me, “nursing mother and “no childcare” are not valid exemptions from service.&nbsp; She did offer us a six-month deferral, but we declined as we hope to still be nursing our youngest child as long as possible.&nbsp; To agree to a six-month deferral would in a sense, be a form of consent, or a contract, to fulfill the civic obligation six months later, forcing the same confrontation without the ability to petition for a redress of our grievances.</p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that at one time you said on one of your YouTube videos that (and I am paraphrasing here) “it’s not that people’s rights won’t exist or that the system is going to disappear.&nbsp; It’s that the rights and the system will be so far removed from people’s lives they will not be able to access their rights, they won’t know how.”&nbsp; Well, that statement stuck with me and when my wife was summoned to jury duty and we were informed that the basic, most simplest of rights (those of a nursing mother with an infant child) were now called into question by the State, you could say that I am now actively investigating all the power that I still have as a citizen to find the system and use the rights that I still have before they become so mired in muck that I lack the energy to wade into the cesspool, let alone muster up a halfway decent defense to the overreach of State power.</p>
<p>This is it.&nbsp; This issue has emerged as a new line in the sand that has been drawn.&nbsp; This is the kind of opportunity to fight and stand for what is right and what is just that may only come along so many times in a person’s life.&nbsp; This is the moment that I choose to rise and step out of the shadows and into the light.&nbsp; This is my time.</p>
<p>Thank you for blazing the trail and lighting the way for people like me who just need to know that people like you are out there.&nbsp; We are only humans; we are not perfect by any means.&nbsp; And where this fight leads me is still undetermined, a bit of a mystery.&nbsp; But without a doubt, I know in my heart that compelling a woman to be separated from her breastfeeding infant at the threat of a misdemeanor criminal charge is the type of State violence that far eclipses even the worst of corporate injustices we’ve incurred thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to prove to the State that their actions are in fact a form of uncoerced violence against the constituency, well, I am still refining my strategy to be honest.&nbsp; So far, the defense has taken shape into an aggressive letter writing campaign, but I sense an escalation is in the works as this pivotal event is helping bring me out of my shell and into the eye of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it is with much excitement that I look forward to sharing with you the developments in this case as they happen.&nbsp; And equally so, it is with much gratitude that I look forward to collaborating with you and writing and making art and growing our garden and dancing with a deepening and growing love of life, all-natural life.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>My email archive contains dozens of postings in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Armstrong">Heather Armstrong</a>* and I are among those writing, receiving, mentioning, mentioned, cc’d or otherwise included. Most postings are from the ’00s and between bloggers in the brief age before media got social and blogging was still hot shit. Heather, with her&nbsp;<a href="https://dooce.com/">Dooce</a>&nbsp;blog, was the alpha among us, but never snotty about it.</p>
<p>Heather wore her heart, her head, her life, on the Web page. At humorous, opinionated, and wince-worthy self-disclosure, Heather even out-raged&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Locke">Chris Locke</a>, aka <a href="http://www.rageboy.com/blogger.html">RageBoy</a>. Heather, Chris and I might have met for <a href="https://seanpatrickcoon.com/2006/03/13/sxsw2006_day_4_cluetrain_seven_years_later/">a panel</a> at the 2006 SXSW, had Chris made the trip. Wrote Chris, “I was nearly as bummed as Doc said he was that I wasn’t there in Austin today on the ‘Cluetrain: Seven Years Later’ panel. What can I say? If God had wanted people to fly, he would have given them upgrades.” Best I recall, that panel was the only time I met Heather in person. She was fun.</p>
<p>Her&nbsp;<a href="https://dooce.com/2023/04/06/youre-the-one-that-i-wanted-to-find/">final post</a> was on April 6. It is mostly about, and for, her daughter Leta Louise. The closing line is “Here at 18 months sober, I salute my 18-year-old frog baby, she who taught me how to love.” According to news reports, Heather had fallen off the wagon. Whatever the reason, she fell all the way, and we will be forever lessened by her loss.</p>
 
<p>*On her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dooce/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dooce/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dooce">Twitter</a> accounts, all branded Dooce, she identified as Heather B. Hamilton, her birth name.</p>

<p>In this episode of The Identity Nexus, Michael Becker talks with Daniel Goldscheider, the Founder of the OpenWallet Foundation, a nonprofit focused on the governance, development, and deployment of open-source software for SmartWallets, i.e., “OpenWallets.” OpenWallets will have a bigger impact on society than open web browsers. SmartWallets are applications and cloud services that empower people to take gradual control of their identities, licenses, certifications, and personal data as they navigate their phygital life, and they enable organizations to manage the verifiable authority that they delegate to their agents—humans, machines, bots, APIs, and more. OpenWallets are SmartWallets built with community-governed open-source software and global industry standards. In this interview, you’ll learn about the OpenWallet Foundation, the benefits of open-source SmartWallet capabilities, and how to get involved (Here is a hint: it is open, and it is free to contribute and use code; there is a nominal fee for commercial organizations to participate in the community governance).</p>

<p><a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/51871779405/"></a></p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> for a three-day itinerary to give visitors to Santa Barbara. Here ya go:</p>
<p>Day 1:</p>
 
 Start the day with breakfast at the Shoreline Beach Cafe, which has a beautiful view of the ocean. 
 After breakfast, head to Knapp’s Castle for a scenic hike and exploration of the ruins of a 20th century mansion. The hike offers stunning views of the Santa Ynez Valley. 
 For lunch, grab some sandwiches or salads from the nearby Panino’s, a local favorite with fresh, high-quality ingredients. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring downtown Santa Barbara, with its charming shops and cafes. Don’t miss a visit to the Santa Barbara County Courthouse, a stunning Spanish Colonial Revival building with a beautiful clock tower that offers a panoramic view of the city. 
 For dinner, head to Tee-Off, a local institution that has been serving up classic American fare since 1949. 
 
<p>Day 2:</p>
 
 Start the day with a hike up La Cumbre Peak, which offers stunning views of Santa Barbara and the Channel Islands. 
 For lunch, grab some tacos from La Super-Rica Taqueria, a casual spot that was a favorite of Julia Child. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, which showcases native plants and offers a peaceful escape from the city. 
 For dinner, head to the Stagecoach Inn, a historic restaurant that serves up classic American fare in a cozy setting. 
 
<p>Day 3:</p>
 
 Start the day with breakfast at Jeannine’s Bakery, a local favorite known for its delicious baked goods and breakfast items. 
 Spend the morning at Hendry’s Beach, a local favorite with beautiful views and great walking trails. 
 For lunch, grab some sandwiches or salads from South Coast Deli, a local favorite with fresh ingredients and creative flavor combinations. 
 Spend the afternoon exploring the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, which features a diverse collection of artwork from around the world. 
 For dinner, head back to downtown Santa Barbara and choose from one of the many restaurants in the area, depending on your preference. Some options include Olio e Limone Ristorante, Los Agaves, and The Lark. 
 
<p>I wouldn’t disagree with any of it, except maybe to note that Hendry’s Beach at sunset (where and when I shot the photo above) is mighty fine.</p>
<p>Of course, the answer will vary with every regeneration, but what the hell. It’s very early in our co-evolution with whatever the hell we and AI are together becoming.</p>

<p>The following is a guest post about blockchained wellbeing metrics promoted as an inclusive, emerging tech spiritual practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May 2023</p>
<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>A couple of days ago a friend of mine sent me a screenshot of a conference being held in Paris that a member of the alternative health and freedom space was promoting on her instagram account. My friend’s comment was; “This looks shady, no?” I assured her that yes indeed, it was very shady, and I went straight to the website of the conference and started speed reading my way through it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alison, you have been saying all along that this new paradigm of AI-run extended reality inhabited by a digitally-twinned, re-brained, blockchained, semi-lobotomized populace would ride in cloaked in the mantle of spiritual evolution. I have long been pretty grossed out by aspects of the “spiritual” community for many reasons, but this conference takes it to the next level. The fact that someone from the “resistance” (you’re right, everything does need air quotes now) was gushing about it on her instagram account was a depressing reminder of how when a wolf is wearing the right outfit, even really smart people fail to see the disguise.</p>
<p>The conference is coming up on May 12-13, 2023, and it will be live-streamed. I wish it was free, that way I could sit there and watch and listen with my face all contorted without giving them any of my hard earned fake money. I may bite the bullet anyway. This conference is called <a href="https://www.paua.life/">PAUA</a>, which interestingly is a Maori word for the shell of a mollusk or abalone. It makes me think of the term ‘ a shell of a man’. An empty shell of a man…a robot maybe? Or someone so removed from themself that they’re no longer recognizable? I don’t know.</p>
<a href="https://www.paua.life/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.paua.life/">https://www.paua.life/</a>
<p>The two-day program ping pongs back and forth between artificial intelligence, ancient wisdom, Web3, Mother Earth, the metaverse, planetary consciousness, conscious capital, and of course…psychedelics. There is also a strong, and exploitative, emphasis on the Kogi people, a very private indigenous tribe who live deep in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains of Northern Columbia and have been dodging colonization and clinging to their sacred and traditional way of life since at least the 15th century. The dragging of two of their leaders to Paris to help woke-wash their next-gen colonization tactics is weirdly reminiscent of the Native American chiefs put on display at the world’s fairs of the late 1800’s. It seems the token economy extends itself to include the tokenizing of the native people used as hood ornaments for the robotic Trojan horse.</p>
<p>From the event’s homepage:</p>
<p>“As we enter into this new decade of the twenties, we have the opportunity to reintegrate ancient knowledge into our modern civilization to create a new narrative for humanity that offers a positive view of the future of our civilization. PAUA is about creating connections between the material world and the spiritual realms, making visible the invisible while featuring an exploration into a wide range of ancient knowledge. PAUA will explore the future of Web3, the Metaverse, and AI, as well as how consciousness can be the fundamental basis for conducting business, Apps, and self transformation”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but for me reading that paragraph felt like all of a sudden a turd bobbed up from the bottom of my cup as I peacefully stirred it.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.paua.life/#partners"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.paua.life/#partners">https://www.paua.life/#partners</a>
<p>So let’s get into the speakers. The lineup starts off with a bang.</p>
<p>Yat Siu is the co-founder and executive chairman of the global blockchain and gaming leader <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/">Animoca Brands</a>. Yat has many accolades including being a World Economic Forum Global Leader of Tomorrow. This should have triggered a pause for many in the alternative sphere if they had taken a few moments to look into the first highlighted speaker of the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Animoca has many blockchain gaming projects in its portfolio, but a few of the standouts for me are TinyTap, bringing education to Web3, with over 200,000 activities and courses, like “math path” and “my life skills box” that feature such lessons as “I go to the bathroom” and “I blow my nose.” Educators own their content by minting their course as an NFT which they can host or sell on a subject domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Learners” from childhood to college will be able to store their certificates in their blockchain wallets, gain a lifelong record of their achievements, and earn access passes. Imagine having a token for having mastered “how to blow your nose” follow you around for the rest of your life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other projects are the Mocaverse where the dreamer, builder, angel, connector and neo-capitalist tribes converge to learn, play, do good, and build a more “equitable and inclusive” Web3 together. It also features “Life Beyond” where you buy land, start your own society, and try to keep the nanobot invasions from wiping out your civilization. Other games involve speeding hotrods through city streets (Animoca teamed up with Google to utilize google maps (and I’m sure soon Google Earth, right?), so the speeding frenzy could take place in real time on real streets. It makes me wonder if one day in the near future&nbsp; someone from the open metaverse crashing into you as you rumble along in your physical reality could have a real world impact? Like those helmets where you die in real life if your avatar kicks the bucket. I could go on and on, but I need to keep moving.&nbsp;</p>

Tim received a MBA from Stanford School of Business. His venture capital specialties include quantified self/life, digital communities/media/gaming, digital health and wellness, smarthome and connected devices/IoT.</p>
<p>Tim also sits on the board of Reimagine, a non profit that “exists to help people of all backgrounds face adversity, loss, and mortality, and channel the hard parts of life into meaningful growth and action.” They understand the “science” of PTSD” and have come up with a “virtuous cycle” where you’re taught “five steps to becoming the hero of your own journey.” First you’re “educated” on how to flourish. Then you learn how to “regulate” your emotions with the help of a coach. Next you share your grief in a “safe environment,” while AI hoovers up your agony like a meth addict in the background. Finally, you chart new goals and become of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this God’s work the Reimagine team hired an external software development team to create mock-ups of the entire user experience. Implementing an on-going “co-creation” process with members of their community. The firm incorporated feedback from surveys, interviews, and focus groups into the design; and then they partnered with a renowned game designer to craft a seamless user experience for the traumatized data sources. Through this interface subjects wo;; write down the most difficult and intimate details of their anguish, along with goals and actions intended to “snap them out of it” and create new “journeys” on digital dashboards. Once that program is in place, participants will be nudged back to their forced happy place. The Reimagine board alone is worthy of several pages of analysis, but I need to stay on track.</p>

<p>Next up is Nichol Bradford. Nichol is the founder and CEO of the Willow Group working to trigger “transformative collisions by providing the most effective and accessible technologies for creating permanent, positive shifts in peace of mind, mental balance, life satisfaction, and happiness.” Their mission is to permanently move a billion people into a state of fundamental well being and flourishing by 2030. Nichol also founded a company called Transformative Tech that claims to be the only global platform connecting founders with investors, resources, and tools to succeed in the “well being tech industry.”</p>
<p>Nichol is a graduate of the Singularity University global solutions program, has an MBA from Wharton School of Business in strategy, and a BBA in marketing from the University of Houston. Bradford is also a fellow of the British American Project. See the quote below taken from that organization’s website: “I want to make the case that a trans-Atlantic leadership network like BAP is exceptionally well positioned to exert a potentially game-changing, tipping-point influence in the future that is unfolding.” The statement was made by Dr. Barbara Stephenson, Dean of the leadership and management school of the Foreign Service Institute who is on the board of the Brandon Marshall foundation for Mental Health and a former member of the Council on Foreign Relations.&nbsp; <a href="http://nicholbradford.com/"></a></p>

<p>So far so good right? I feel closer to ascension already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving right along to Linda Adami, founder and CEO of <a href="https://quantumtemple.xyz/">Quantum Temple</a>. Her interests include: Cultural Heritage Preservation, Web3, impact, and inclusion. Linda is an impact strategist who spent 10 years in emerging markets across Central America, South-East Asia, and the Gulf. She graduated with honors from King’s College, London and completed a three-month program at MIT Media Labs. Her company, Quantum Temple, is a Web3 platform “preserving” cultural heritage. Their mission is to develop the first decentralized record of cultural heritage and unlock regenerative impact funding powered by Web3. “We enable equitable exchanges between conscious collectors and ancestral communities through blockchain technology”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I checked out Quantum Temple’s website. In the simplest terms this is what I see. It’s selling NFTs of the essence of cultural heritage sites. You login and connect your wallet, then you validate your identity and start bidding on the little slice of cultural heritage you wish to stick in your wallet. An example of how this works is “On the full moon of the fourth month.” That’s the name of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the full story:</p>
<p>Once a decade, on the full moon of the fourth month a stone is brought from the village of Manukaya to be bathed in the waters of the sacred pool of Tirtha Empul. The stone is carved with an inscription in old Balinese, a language no longer spoken, deciphered in the 1920s. It records King Chandrabhayasingha Warmmadewa’s construction of the bathing pools in the year 962 AD, on the full moon of the fourth month. Thus the connection between the stone and the pool has remained unbroken for more than a thousand years. The waters from the pool flow to the ancient royal tombs and monasteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now the bidding is at 1.0633 eth ($2,000).&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does one get, and who makes the money from that sale? Forty percent goes to Quantum Temple and another forty percent goes to the “culture keepers” of the temple. In this case it is a young man and his father who keep the temple clean and lead the guests’ sacred cleansing experience. Ten percent goes to the filmmakers who shot the 33 second Mp4, which is the NFT. Five percent goes to the “curator of the experience.” I guess he’s the culture scout. The last five percent goes into an impact fund. So the temple experience, now digitally twinned, lives in some collectors wallet and cultural history is preserved forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The End</p>

<p>My plan for this piece was to look into the Web3/AI personalities and point out what should be obvious incongruities between what they’re espousing and the idea of spiritual “up-leveling.” I wanted to sort of glaze over the meditation/consciousness camp with a one-size-fits-all wrap up of their usual bag of labels and objectives. I was trying to get this letter finished, so it didn’t drag it out for multiple days. I guess I was hoping on some level that at least a few of these speakers were actually what they claimed. What I found is&nbsp; that the Web3 crowd is pretty honest about the role they are playing in this grand comedy of horrors. They’re simply draping themselves in the sexy sheer nightie of ultra spiritualism for this particular gig. When they show up at the blockchain bro expo next month I’m sure their language will change, but their objectives will remain dead on. My point being, I was trying to skate quickly past the barefoot, micro-dosing, sound bath whispering light goddesses and just leave them alone, but it wasn’t meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stuck Amandine Roche’s name into my search engine, and <a href="http://amandineroche.com/">this</a> is what came out…</p>
<p>Amandine Roche is a human rights lawyer and International peace keeper who promotes wellness through meditation and yoga. The list of people who she’s studied her multitude of practices under is like a who’s who of mindfulness and bliss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She studied mindfulness with Jon Kabat Zinn, who created the ‘Stress Reduction Clinic’ and ‘The Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Healthcare, and Society’ at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat Zinn earned a PhD in 1971 at MIT in molecular biology. While at MIT, Kabat Zinn was campaigning against the school’s military research, so in order to quell the student protests, MIT appointed him alongside Noam Chomsky and George Katsiaficas to an advisory panel on the future of the university’s military labs. Kabat Zinn is on the board of the Mind and Life institute.</p>
<p>Roche studied altruism and compassion with Mathieu Ricard (also on the board of the Mind and Life Institute). Ricard received his PhD in molecular genetics from the Pasteur Institute in 1972 before deciding to shuck his scientific career, move to the Himalayas and study Tibetan Buddhism. Ricard has been called the “happiest person in the world’ by several popular media outlets, because they all got the same memo. He volunteered to participate in a University of Wisconson-Madison study on happiness. Sufficeth to say, he scored significantly above average. Ricard has spoken at the United Nations as part of the Gross National Happiness Resolution, the Global Economic Symposium, The World Government Summit, and has been invited to the World Economic Forum ten times.</p>
<p>Roche has also studied with Deepak Chopra, who needs no introduction, but I did take a quick glance at his website and saw that the two most recent additions to his archive are a piece he wrote titled “How AI could set us free,” which was an overly simplistic and incredibly tone deaf piece that concludes “’If AI takes over all the jobs, then that frees up humanity and the obstacles to human potential would be radically lessened… this could amount to a leap in the evolution of consciousness.” His other article was about wireless sensor technology that monitors an individual’s responses while meditating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Roche’s mentor roster and resume of working with the UN, the European Commission, Unicef, UNESCO, UN Women, and USAID, it’s clear to me she’s as big a player in this game as the rest of them.</p>
<a href="http://amandineroche.com/peace-keeping.html"></a>Source Link: <a href="http://amandineroche.com/peace-keeping.html">http://amandineroche.com/peace-keeping.html</a>
<a href="http://amandineroche.com/peace-building.html"></a>Source Link: <a href="http://amandineroche.com/peace-building.html">http://amandineroche.com/peace-building.html</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I think I’ve made my point.</p>
<p>I’m not even close to halfway through the list of speakers, but I’ll leave the rest for anybody else who can stomach it. I really just wanted to point out that many folks in the “higher consciousness-focused” community aren’t grasping the disconnect between what they’re absorbing from their gurus and spiritual teachers and what lies on the other side of that gauzy ethereal curtain. How can a conference of this stature, one with an Web3 mindfulness agenda trumpeting from every line of text and every speaker bio, not set off alarm bells for “the resistance?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing someone who’s so embedded in the alternative sphere practically getting the vapors over this glossy, highly funded, Deloitte-sponsored, change agent-driven performance piece swathed in all the right newspeak “justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion,” where phrases like “sacred ancient knowledge” and “higher consciousness” are nothing but clickbait…</p>
<p>This conference was the low hanging fruit I needed to finally write something again. To try to draw some eyes away from the influencers on stage, and bring them round back, to the shit show where they might get a glimpse of the gamified, tokenized cybernetic ant computer. Pull back the gauzy spiritual curtain and see the plan is for everyone to live on blockchain and respond to nudges from wireless sensor networks – from their iPhones, from their tutors, from their health coaches, and from their doctors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want people to see that “wellness” is the base layer cost offset for their impact investing. That they want us “happy” in tiny house communities, fifteen-minute SMART villages run by nuclear reactors airdropped in shipping containers at the edge of town. In this future a majority of people will sit in haptic suits and compete for global gig work, because they’ve been convinced that we live in a “post knowledge” era where humans have few skills that can outperform artificial intelligence. In this future our spiritual ascension comes at a high cost –&nbsp; the complete capture of our every thought, emotion, and desire so the machine can manipulate us into “bliss.” These smug, arrogant change makers from every corner of academia are juicing us up on the idea of there being a utopia around the next corner even as the “open metaverse” stealthily closes in around us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your Farming Friend Verityhound</p>

<p>This is getting quite tiresome. I am hearing through the grapevine that Ms. Celia Farber, who by her own account is now reliant on the click bait of Substack for her livelihood, is continuing to repackage vague, inaccurate comments as “content” to fuel her digital hive. I have not gone over to <a href="https://celiafarber.substack.com/p/a-challenge-whoever-is-claiming-i">her post</a> to see the vitriol directed at me by her commenters. I’m too busy going through Children’s Health Defense’s IRS Filings to give my attention to her ant computer. Since she is apparently threatening “legal action,” I am taking the precaution to document the fact that the entire hubbub was inadvertently initiated by a <a href="https://celiafarber.substack.com/p/diana-wests-critique-of-mr-jones/comment/15731034">fawning commenter</a>. You’ll see below that “Cosmos” now regrets the submission, one that triggered Farber’s emotional hysteria followed by a reflexive mob response. I have no idea how I got dragged back into the comment section, as there is no evidence that I’ve discussed the queen bee since she pulled me into her arena a few weeks ago, though my efforts to shine a light on Children’s Health Defense finances and staffing could make me a juicy target. I’m aware of the AIDs dissident history generally, but anyone who follows my work knows that is not my focus. I have no clue about the various personalities involved in this discussion. </p>
<p>Once again bad behavior on all sides rules the day (except for the one grounded, clear-thinking person out there apparently – Ian Bell). Please, get a grip on yourselves folks. Go out and blow on some dandelions.</p>

<p>The following was posted as a comment on the blog yesterday, and I am sharing it here with permission. I was tickled by the way the author, who goes by the pen name Meandering Myrmidon, wove hours of my dry content into a charmingly cutting analysis of what is unfolding before our eyes as the Camelot 2.0 campaign gathers steam. </p>
<p>Yesterday, and again this morning, Children’s Health Defense, wrote me that they do not share any information about their donors. As someone who worked at a small nonprofit for seventeen years, I know it is standard practice to prepare an annual report with a list of major donors – even if it is only digital and posted to the website. The IRS 990 filing for Children’s Health Defense indicates a budget of $16,000,000 in 2021. They have a huge online media presence and spin-off publishing and video subsidiaries. There is no excuse for them to have not devoted some of those resources to making their funding available for public review. </p>
<p>With their former chairman, now on leave, running for president, I think we can all expect more transparency than that. I’ll be unpacking this in one or more discussions as soon as I’ve finished pouring over the spreadsheets I’m putting together of CHD’s publicly available financial information and board lists. There are several interesting findings that merit scrutiny from those inclined to support the Camelot campaign with their time or treasure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy this witty missive. I’m a workhorse researcher whose prose is functional, but rarely sparkles with wit. I keep saying we need artistry to translate this information in a more palatable form. Myrmidon’s poem delivers in spades. One clarification, if this poem is intended to reflect my work, I want to make it clear that no knights have arrived to make me any offers. For that I am glad, as it would be unseemly, and unchivalrous, for any entity to make such an offer, nor would I ever accept. </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Once and Future Thing-</p>
<p>Just before cock crow,<br>
in a darkling hotel lobby,<br>
the spectral father cries:<br>
“The hour’s come, avenge me, Bobby!”</p>
<p>And from his crystal palace,<br>
the dynastic chosen son,<br>
doles oxytocin tokens,<br>
to the wronged and innocent ones.</p>
<p>Nobly wounded, audibly shaken,<br>
from scores of giants that he’s felled,<br>
he whispers to the multitude,<br>
what his father’s ghost did tell:</p>
<p>“The salmon will be hooked,<br>
the well of wisdom will be plumbed,<br>
naught will remain unknown,<br>
if we blockchain everyone.”</p>
<p>“Let us now praise famous men,<br>
may their interest forever accrue,<br>
we’ll accept all colors and proclivities,<br>
we can tokenize them too.”</p>
<p>“In our liberated markets,<br>
everyone will have a share,<br>
on this side we’ll make solutions,<br>
and we’ll make problems over there.”</p>
<p>“With tokenized revolutions,<br>
we’ll spin them round and round,<br>
and the energy they generate,<br>
will power the cities and towns.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Join us, the Impedance,<br>
all free agents and entrepreneurs,<br>
just donate your extra electrons,<br>
oh, mega machine, we’re yours!”</p>
<p>“Come now, let’s reforge,<br>
the pact that was broken,<br>
and pay for this succession,<br>
with this non-fungible token”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his tower,<br>
high above the broad Potomac,<br>
Merlyn gazes in his Palantir,<br>
muttering spells alchemical, gnomic.</p>
<p>Director of the spectacle,<br>
playwright extraordinaire,<br>
Merlyn moves his players about,<br>
charging waves hidden in air.</p>
<p>But Little Alice, scrappy mom,<br>
from the City of the Broken Bell,<br>
raised her voice among the throng,<br>
warning all was not so well:</p>
<p>“They say I’m nuts”, said Alice<br>
“they say I’m not quite sane,<br>
for thinking people are not pawns,<br>
and that life is not a game.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been into the labyrinth,<br>
and gathered many threads,<br>
I’ve woven them together,<br>
and this is what they said.”</p>
<p>She then unrolled a tapestry,<br>
showing the lords of every land,<br>
hunting for a quarry,<br>
that they could not understand.</p>
<p>In the center was a unicorn,<br>
the quested after game,<br>
in magenta script thereon was stitched:<br>
“BEHOLD: THE GLOBAL BRAIN”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merlyn, in his tower,<br>
quickly consulted his chart,<br>
of every outcome and income,<br>
to find Little Alice’s part.</p>
<p>He directed a trusted knight,<br>
of the Children’s Health Crusade,<br>
to entice Little Alice,<br>
with the sums she could be paid.</p>
<p>Alas, to no avail,<br>
the crusader wooed in vain,<br>
stubborn and immovable,<br>
Alice’s tale remained the same.</p>
<p>Merlyn, in his wrath, demands:<br>
“who let this thistle grow?,<br>
this pissabed that’s sprouted from,<br>
my neatly tended row”.</p>
<p>So the master of illusion,<br>
broadcasts more at which to stare,<br>
he invokes his spell most tried and true:<br>
“Hey, you, look over there!”</p>
<p>Spectacular scenes emerge,<br>
like toadstools after rain,<br>
hairy men in queenly drag,<br>
war, disease, exploding trains.</p>
<p>All the tricks long utilized,<br>
to hypnotize the peasants,<br>
and I don’t know what happened next,<br>
this hasn’t passed, it’s present.</p>

<p>Below is an email shared with permission. I hear there’s a tempest in a teapot with my name on it in some unspecified Substack. Well, I suppose something is benefitting from the energy generated by the emotional outrage machine. I suppose as long as I’m shining a light on Camelot 2.0 that is to be expected. This was sitting on the back burner for a few weeks, but for any new folks popping over to see what I’m about, I consider what follows a very generous endorsement of my character. Thank you Internet glitch friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>April 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>So on occasion I go through my phone storage and try to delete what is no longer relevant and go over stuff I’ve screen-saved in the moment b/c what ever has spoke to me, etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes things come back around and perhaps has more than one purpose. For example this, what I am about to share because we are all stumbling through the labyrinth of life, on our own, and collectively, is like an egg. </p>
<p>An egg has seemingly three separate parts that make up the whole. Do we eat the whole egg? No. We take the part that we like, the part that sustains us, discard the rest and go on our way. Do we give it a second thought? No. Was the shell useless? No. It all served a purpose for what we needed at that moment in time. </p>
<p>Why am I saying all this? I am making this point, because I am sick and tired of irrelevant people on the internet of space who are energy zappers. They offer nothing of substance. They aren’t even a useful shell; they’re worse. They’re like the toothpick that comes along and pokes a tiny hole in the bottom of your egg just to blow out all the nutritional content and leave this empty shell. Some might even add insult to injury and decorate the shell and call it art. Maybe that’s useful for some other people in their time and space, but imagine you were in a group of travelers who desperately relied on those eggs to sustain their bodies nutritionally so that the brain and the body could endure the long complicated journey ahead. When life was less complicated, and lives were more comfortable, predictable, perhaps even a bit boring, the idea of an empty egg with a painted shell might be more entertained. Time and place I suppose. </p>
<p>Or just find your lane. Don’t be a cheerleader for the shell art following a group of folks that crack their eggs right through the middle so you can scream at them for how stupid they are just discarding the shell. In your shell art world sure, the egg eaters might seem so selfish, (shell~fish lol), so careless, so unimaginably weird that they’ve learned how to best use that egg for themselves. But don’t entertain that idea, that concept, that world view. No way. Egg eaters are all about themselves. They aren’t pretty and decorated and put on display for all to put on a shelf and admire. No. Maybe the egg eaters put a few of their eggs together, added some cheddar, chillis, ham, milk, potatoes, so that more people could come together and share new recipes and enjoy the experience together. The egg eaters like to share their recipes with others who might not like that recipe but love this recipe, and so it goes. </p>
<p>But the egg eaters don’t like bad eggs. You know the ones. The eggs that kids might hide in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator a few months before Halloween. Yet another use for an egg. Completely deplorable for the shell decorators, unimaginable to the egg eaters, but to the mischievous energy filled youth…rotten eggs are the PERFECT accessory on Halloween night to be the miserable coup d’etat to some unsuspecting homeowner. The egg rotters, they too see their egg group as the golden egg group, scoffing at the eaters and the artisans. For the purpose of the egg rotters is to thrive in spreading misery towards others. Fortunately this group is few and far between, usually. Does it mean they don’t exist? No. We know they are there, lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce. Generally we each are aware of the other and manage to coexist naturally and maybe rarely if ever cross paths. </p>
<p>Well that being said… if a rotten egg happens to catch your house, sure it stinks. Yes they suck. Do they know you? Probably not. They probably just think it’s funny amongst themselves, and you are just who the flying fickle finger of fate poked that day. To the homeowner that’s worked hard to own and maintain their home, a messy smelling egg can be embarrassing and will want to wash it off immediately at move on. Egg eaters aren’t smelly rotten people so it’s a personal insult to have to now take precious time out of a normally productive and fulfilling day to have to now direct that otherwise forward moving useful energy to this stinking rotten mess. Washed off, yet the negative smell still lingers. The egg rotters have moved on from their follies. Probably haven’t given your house a second thought. It was funny for them at that moment, just that one night, your house with no constructive reason or rhyme, to pelt that egg thru the air, and in its smashed glory to laugh at the success of the aim and move on. Yes, their job is done. They move on. </p>
<p>The eater though wonders why. Why was my house chosen? What did I ever do to them? I don’t even have a son so who pissed them off? Why wasn’t I like my neighbours house who survived the night eggless? Why now does my beautiful house now stink? The eater doesn’t understand it because not only are the rotters the most useless users of the egg, worse, they somehow manage to use their eggs to literally drain your positive, productive most forward and proactive users of the egg people.. the rotters add zero to anyone or anything and yet that little impulse moment of theirs causes such a disruption to others. There’s no point trying to understand these mindless, boundless energetic little imps. They have all this energy to run around destroying things, because they don’t have to think constructively about their actions. They don’t have a creation of their own to show for. They don’t have pride in their project that they can show to others in a year, in two years, in five years etc.. Their destruction is done. After their small group has had their smash and laugh, that’s it. They’re done. Their lives are pointless and maybe they wish they could be like the egg eaters. To have something they could be proud of. A community that grows painstakingly slow, but eventually flourishes beautifully. Day after day, month after month, the egg eaters grow into a group, then a community and hopefully someday a movement. Not everyone understands what the eaters’ purpose is exactly, but being a part of it feels good. </p>
<p>Wanting to join in the community feels purposeful. Maybe individually eaters don’t have all the recipes, maybe the eaters don’t have all the ingredients. Sometimes we don’t even know if we like eating our egg in a new and different way until we try. But we don’t even know there’s a different way to eat that egg until we stumble upon this amazing community that embraces everyone. Sure the eaters are busy with their own eggs, but on Thursday night they all gather around the community stove, crack a few eggs and relish and grow together. Thursday nights renew the community’s energy and purpose. By and large the community feels right. And it grows. For the end all be all purpose is still out there, but at least in this small community, a shared experience is being built. It’s being realised. It’s being a constant in the inconsistency of current life. Maybe it’s just another day for the eater, but for the new member eater it’s opening up a profound new world of tools and ingredients to eventually be confident enough to become creative too and then maybe even be able to also share with the community. </p>
<p>Who knows. I don’t. I don’t even know the first egg eater that started this community. Who is Alison? I don’t know. Who is Donald Trump? I don’t know. Who is Madonna? Who is Stew Peters or Tucker Carlson? Do I personally know any of these people? No. Do I consume their content, yes. Does that make me know them, no. Do I like everything they put out there? No, most likely not. But at some level I am able to gather enough content to sort out in my own head some type of character this person makes up. Sure that character can change over time. We all do. That doesn’t mean at this time because they were this that now they can’t be that. That’s stupid and ridiculous. We are all constantly changing. Hopefully for the better. So as long as that persons’ character whose content I am consuming is seemingly aligning with my personal path, journey through the labyrinth, is resonating my life, opening up my mind, then yes, for that moment, oh yeah I know who Alison is….</p>
<p>She’s that nutty keyboard brainiac in Philly with a husband and a kid and a small house and a huge library. She reads a lot, she talks a lot, she’s super intelligent, but she probably doesn’t realise her own value as it’s just her. She doesn’t go around trying to force people to listen to her or join her dandelion club. Pay to hear this magical opinion…nope. She’s like, hey, there’s a hole in this boat we are all occupying right now and if we put our heads together maybe we can fix it even though the boat is floating in the middle of the ocean and filled with people. If it doesn’t get addressed everyone in the boat is screwed. She doesn’t need praises for spotting the hole or collating various repair manuals. She just knows that fixing the problem is going to take more than just her, and she’s really grateful when someone else also sees the hole and offers to help with the solution. Does that make Alison now somehow eternally tied in gratitude for that individual that came along side to help, no. Sometimes is okay just to appreciate that this person has come across your path for a reason maybe the reason is for yourself or it’s for them. Who knows? I don’t know. </p>
<p>I don’t even know who Alison is. I will probably never ever meet her in real life. If I do, alright, cool, that means the world didn’t end. LoL . Whatever. Am I a brainiac just like her? Ha! Not even close. I do know what stupid is, and I’m not that either. I can however imho feel like I can gather who their character is…or what makes up the value of their character. Am I a mom? Yes. Okay, I can relate. Did I graduate college, yes, okay I can relate. Am I looking for answers to an unknown question or questions? Boom! Do I know who Alison is? No, but I really like her character. What she puts out makes sense to me. What she says has immeasurable value, to me. What she has said in the past is STILL TRUE and still of value…to me. Would we be friends in real life if I lived down her street? Maybe. Best friends, probably not. I respect her. I admire her ability to carry this proverbial torch that we all enjoy the benefit of… Is she replaceable? Probably. But she’s grown on me. And if I just respect and value what this Alison character puts out there I can say yes, I know who Alison is and she’s my friend. She’s one of a kind, unique, qwirky yet stable. She does not make up or spread rumours or lies. Indeed the polar opposite. She lights up when discussing facts and building the base file of totally relevant pieces that need to come together so everyone can see the whole picture. </p>
<p>Can she be attacked just because she’s there, sure. Does it hurt? You bet. Was there a point to that? Idk, maybe. But now that rotten egg has made this ripple, an after shock if you will to the rest of us in the community who actually do value this Alison character. Her tappity tap tapping keyboard in the background of board meetings as her questions rage onto her targets that do their very best to make so much noise, say so many words yet answer nothing. See, this is why I like Alison. This is why I respect and value this Alison character, and it seriously pisses me the fuck off when miserable negative parasite losers take aim her. It is not her responsibility to be everyone’s mom just because she is a mom. Nor does she have to validate herself or worth to each and every one of you. Like the rest of us you either can see from a mile away (or across the pond) that this Alison person is super bright, maybe if I pay attention I can learn something from her that in turn will help me too! Or since she can’t stop her life and coddle my shallow empty invisible spec internet personality then I’ll just throw my rotten egg guts at her. Because I can’t be her, I can just ruin all the good she’s doing. But that ripple rolls out doesn’t it. And after so many ripples it’s easy to question why even bother? This is so much work, so much energy. Sure I opted to do it because I was interested, then I realised it was important to share, I thought what I was doing was benevolent and being a positive value in the lurking panopticon assembly of doom… Yes, your negative (albeit shallow pointless keyboard stabs) remarks hurt and after enough of them cause a pause and question why do I even bother. </p>
<p>Well I’ll tell you why, because to loads of anonymous people out there that happen across your content actually do appreciate you. There are those of us scattered across the big floating globe of billions of people-ants that catch that faint pheromone hit and say wait a minute, hold up, there is something familiar and comforting about this scent. And so it is. A few years ago I began my search for answers to the crazy phenomenon that had taken the world by surprise. I knew enough to know it was bullshit even if I couldn’t articulate exactly why. But I knew. Now then in my drive to gather the words to validate and articulate my story I’m having to learn loads of information, people and names, concepts, ideas, facts and opinions. Are there hard answers, yes. Did I find them? No. But I sorted my own path in a way in which made the most sense to me and that’s what matters. </p>
<p>So to make a long story longer – and I’m so sorry, I just thought you might like to hear why you matter or why people even bother listening to you or whatever. It’s just me, your random internet content consumer letting you in on why you matter… to me. To my story. What makes you, YOU in my story and why I find you compelling and valid. By the way this has happened with you on my phone not just this once, but a few times. So much so that I’m like whatever, she’s not exactly lights and whistles or an entertaining production. To appreciate Alison is to tune into her broadcasts, pay attention, hell, here’s a concept-take notes. Go back and re-listen (which I usually have to do with your stuff) try and grasp what is being said, shared, made perfectly available to your very fingertips with ease, because that is what Alison does. It’s like the concert violinist in the subway station. People dismiss the beauty and value of the melody because it’s being shared out of the love and joy of the music. Not being ‘stingy’ or shared ‘narcissistically’ at £1,000.00 /seat to hear me play. People create concrete paths and demand you must make yourself miserable too. It’s how it is you know. My life’s story says life must be hard must be complicated must be difficult so I command you to do the same. What-Ev-Errrr. </p>
<p>Soooooo going back to my phone storage, playing sound bytes I deemed to have value, I get a chuckle like yep, this is why I like this Alison character b/c time and time again I get the first clip and I’m like wait, what? What am I suppose to do with that? What’s that suppose to mean for me or to me? Wtf am I watching this shit for if I’m left feeling out ragged and filled with unanswered questions? Why tf do I bother?! Ugh! Then seriously, 12 hours later, oh here’s that Alison character. I’m never quite sure what she’s on about but she is on to something though. At least she provokes me to think. At least she gives me a direction to look or search or dig. But sometimes, sometimes you get lucky and she just gives you the answer in plain sight. She doesn’t even know you’re looking for it. But she does give you the answers. I think people are too busy making their own life more complicated that they don’t take the time to see it’s right there. So here, let me share, because you can enjoy this and know that the work and reach you put out there in the internet abyss is landing on some pretty decent minds. </p>
<p>Literally look at the meta-data screenshots- it was about two years ago, yeah, and literally 12 hours apart…. This still amuses me to this day, and now I hope you get a kick out of it too. Your blast from my past LoL… You know I think I’m going to put them in another email b/c it screws up my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
    
<p>Cheers from the expat American across the pond. Thank you for being you – whoever you are . </p>
<p>Sincerely, your random anonymous internet friend or not or glitch or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My reply:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh my. I’m tickled. What an image you weave with the eggs! Did you know I eat a lot of eggs? We get a dozen in our farm box every week. Two poached on sauteed greens with garlic is my current fave (bring the water in the pan to a rolling boil, drop in a good splash of vinegar, then crack two eggs directly into the water, turn down the heat a bit, after a few minutes scoop each one out with a slotted spoon, and place on a towel to dab them dry, serve over greens with pepper). It would be nice to meet in person. I’m sure we would enjoy one another’s company. Given all the effort, would you like to share this with a broader audience on the blog? It’s fine either way. I do appreciate the time you took to lay out your thoughts and include me in your thinking. We are growing a little community, aren’t we?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran out of greens, but homemade bread toasted works well, too.</p>

<p>Following a call for adoption by the restarted <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Working Group</a>, I’m pleased to report that the three initial working group specifications have been published.  They are:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-proof-00.html">JSON Web Proof</a>, with abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This document defines a new container format similar in purpose and design to JSON Web Signature (JWS) called a JSON Web Proof (JWP). Unlike JWS, which integrity-protects only a single payload, JWP can integrity-protect multiple payloads in one message. It also specifies a new presentation form that supports selective disclosure of individual payloads, enables additional proof computation, and adds a protected header to prevent replay and support binding mechanisms.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms-00.html">JSON Proof Algorithms</a>, with abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The JSON Proof Algorithms (JPA) specification registers cryptographic algorithms and identifiers to be used with the JSON Web Proof (JWP) and JSON Web Key (JWK) specifications. It defines several IANA registries for these identifiers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-proof-token-00.html">JSON Proof Token</a>, with abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact, URL-safe, privacy-preserving representation of claims to be transferred between three parties. The claims in a JPT are encoded as base64url-encoded JSON objects that are used as the payloads of a JSON Web Proof (JWP) structure, enabling them to be digitally signed and selectively disclosed. JPTs also support reusability and unlinkability when using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).</p></blockquote>

<p>This article shows how to force phishing resistant authentication for external B2B users using a cross tenant trust. The external users are from a separate tenant and the local tenant needs to trust the multiple factor authentication (MFA) from the other known tenants. This prevents the user having to authenticate again and setup more MFA.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE/tree/main/RazorCaePhishingResistant">https://github.com/damienbod/AspNetCoreAzureADCAE/tree/main/RazorCaePhishingResistant</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The demo application requires that administrators use a phishing resistant MFA and this is implemented using an Azure AD authentication context with a policy. The tenant and the application was setup as shown in the blog: </p>



<p><a href="https://damienbod.com/2022/10/10/force-phishing-resistant-authentication-in-an-asp-net-core-application-using-azure-ad/">Force phishing resistant authentication in an ASP.NET Core application using Azure&nbsp;AD</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>If a local member authenticates using a phishing resistant MFA, the user can access the admin page without problem. </p>



<p>When an external member or a guest user authenticates, the user will be shown the following page requesting that the user authenticates again with a correct MFA. This is displayed even if the user has authenticated correctly on the home tenant. No trust exists between the Azure AD tenants.</p>







<p></p>



<p>To fix this, the Azure tenant must trust the multiple factor authentication from the other tenants. This can be implemented using Azure AD external identities. </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Now when the user authenticates, everything will work.</p>



<p></p>



<p>One problem which still exists is for Microsoft accounts. These users cannot authenticate with the step up requirement.</p>

<p>Last night I did a stream outlining the work history of Andrew Pek, a long-time corporate consultant specializing in design thinking whose client base centered high-profile multinational pharmaceutical and financial firms. Pek was selected to become Chief Operating Officer for Children’s Health Defense (CHD) in February of 2023 according to an <a href="http://support.childrenshealthdefense.org/site/MessageViewer?dlv_id=5661&amp;em_id=2581.0">email</a> sent out to supporters on April 6, 2023. Two months later Pek was not yet featured anywhere on the CHD website, and his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-pek/">LinkedIn profile</a> had not been updated with his new employment status. </p>
<p>At the end of the stream a person commented in the chat that Pek was no longer with the organization. This came as a shock, since Michael Kane had just interviewed him last Friday, April 28 for Good Morning CHD TV. That short interview, which confirms Pek’s former position at Pfizer, is on Spotify, but not on the CHD TV page. Update: As of this morning, the interview has been removed from Spotify. Fortunately I recorded a key minutes of the audio, which you can listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFRUHxhneGA">here</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before putting together this presentation, I attempted repeatedly to confirm that the former Pfizer executive and pharmaceutical consultant was indeed the same man who had been hired to join the executive team at CHD. I got an initial reply last Thursday, that someone would check with Andrew and get back to me. I’d asked if he’d come to the organization from DxD Partners. No one ever replied to my follow-up texts. </p>
<p>If Pek is no longer with CHD, that would be an abrupt turn of events, since Kane had only done his “welcome our new COO” interview on Friday (interesting timing). In any event, I feel this information still has value, because it speaks to how the organization is being run. Note that the hire was made in February before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mary Holland went on leave to run the campaign. Surely they were aware of his employment background. What led them to choose Pek above other candidates, if there were other candidates, is not known. If Pek is no longer an employee it’s worth asking what led to this unexpected change of heart? Robert F. Kennedy is now running for president of the United States. I think this episode speaks to his management approach and that of his executive staff. </p>
<p>I mean no ill will towards Mr. Pek. He seems like an accomplished consultant who clearly enjoys the work of flying around the world to rub elbows with c-suite executives, guiding them in unlocking their creative potential to expand the growth of their companies and generate handsome profits. Unfortunately, many of these firms are deeply embedded in the structure of Web3 human capital finance and precision medicine. This is the same structure that seeks to weave natural life into a gamified web of digital extended reality. Thus, as capable as he may be as a “consultant’s consultant” it is hard to imagine Pek was the best fit to steer CHD during a time of transition. Unless, perhaps his hire speaks to issues I continue to raise about social impact finance, “personalized” medicine (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_L_N0rN3I">vaccinomics</a>), innovative revenue streams for repurposed drugs, and managed wellness protocols related to chronic illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night someone in the comments replied in response to another comment noting how hard it was to find information on Mr. Pek and CHD, “…I hope when you Google him and CHD nothing comes up. That would be the best case scenario.” To which I replied, “Maybe the best case scenario is that we all better understand how CHD operates.” I’m sure people are busy scrubbing Mr. Pek out of the picture as we speak. The question is what led them to make that hire in the first place?</p>

<p>MITREid Connect was, at one time, one of the top open source implementations of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. Written in Java and targeted for enterprise systems in the days before cloud services, it fit a niche and did it well. Where is it today and where is it&nbsp;going?</p>The unofficial OpenID Connect logo I drew one afternoon that became the symbol for the&nbsp;project. How It&nbsp;Started <p>Back in what feels like the long-distant past, I started a research project at my then-employer to investigate federated identity and how it could be applied in our environments.</p><p>We started out by building a very slapdash but functional implementation of OpenID 2.0 (and its various extensions, like SREG and AX), and we called it MITREid because I’m not great at coming up with good names. This little experimental server got hooked into our enterprise identity management system, and it did a pretty good job at giving us a single-sign-on experience that wasn’t just prompting for the user’s password and checking against LDAP, like every other app at the time had been&nbsp;doing.</p><p>When OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect started development, I proposed a research project that would get us involved in the creation of those standards and come up with an implementation of them that we could use ourselves and give back to the community as an open source project. The result of this was the <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/">MITREid Connect</a> project, with its flagship OpenID Connect IdP and OAuth 2.0 AS built as a Java Spring application. And as you can see, my skill at naming projects continues to shine&nbsp;here.</p> How It&nbsp;Went <p>We built MITREid Connect to fit into much the same kind of environment that the original MITREid OpenID 2.0&nbsp;server.</p>  No internal user management, this would be handled by the corporate identity management system and plugged in through a service&nbsp;layer  Pluggable authentication, so we could adapt it to whatever the corporate system and our customer environments had in place&nbsp;already  Strict adherence to the standards, and a decent attempt to implement as much of them as we could&nbsp;manage  Deployable in a Java servlet container, which is the kind of deployment we had readily available to us at the&nbsp;time  <p>All of these goals shaped the project that came out of the research effort, and it was decently successful for its time. We released several major revisions of the project, implemented new-fangled security mechanisms like PKCE, and deployed it to both our corporate network and a number of other systems. It gave us login, API access, and a common security layer right at a time when things were shifting away from HTTP Basic Auth for everything.</p><p>When the OpenID Foundation started to make their conformance testing available, we were among the first to certify and submit our results. I even have the t-shirt to prove&nbsp;this!</p><p>While I was still an employee at MITRE, the MITREid Connect project was funded largely through the research program that started it. When I first founded <a href="https://bspk.io/">Bespoke Engineering</a> and started consulting full time, I fully expected that support, development, and deployment of MITREid Connect was going to be one of my major business lines, and that this would help the project continue. This was slightly true at first, with several large clients bringing me on board to help work on larger projects that were making use of MITREid Connect. However, most of my time on these projects was spent not on the MITREid Connect code itself, but on separate or larger parts of the overall&nbsp;project.</p><p>Not long after I left MITRE, some folks at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> offered to host the project as part of a new consortium. This was a good relationship, but they couldn’t offer the kind of support for an engineering team that the MITRE research program once afforded. That consortium eventually folded into something else, and the MITREid Connect project was left on a&nbsp;shelf.</p><p>Eventually, even these lines drifted away, and my time was taken up by other efforts, and MITREid Connect became something I engaged less and less with. The handful of people that had worked on it even had plans to re-brand the project away from its MITRE roots, but even that small step never came to fruition.</p><p>Somewhere in that time, the world of computing and security shifted radically. MITREid Connect’s model of a heavyweight Java servlet no longer fit with the cloud-native hosted or even <a href="https://justinsecurity.medium.com/deployment-and-hosting-patterns-in-oauth-a1666dc0d966">semi-hosted services</a> that people are interested in using. Where once it was common for a large company to have its own data centers for computation power, it now seems crazy to not use a hosted cloud environment for your infrastructure. MITREid Connect was made for an on-premises perimeter-driven world, and that world has largely&nbsp;gone.</p> How It’s&nbsp;Going <p>MITREid Connect never really made the transition out of that world, and it shows in the code. It’s more than just its packaging as a Java servlet, it’s how sessions and data storage are handled, how scaling would function, and so on and so on. The dependencies stopped being updated, it was never repackaged — at least not by the core development crew — and it was never really brought up to speed with the rest of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>These days, MITREid Connect is not actively developed or maintained by any of the core developers, including myself. The main reason for this is simple: the people who were willing to pay for the work stopped asking for it and turned to other solutions. Most groups, including MITRE, have turned to cloud-hosted solutions to handle their entire identity stack. Or they’ve moved to other implementations, both open source and proprietary.</p><p>Even so, I wouldn’t call the project abandoned, exactly. It still exists and it still runs, and people still use it. But the core project’s dependencies haven’t been updated in quite some time and there’s nobody in the queue to manage that. The project <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/forks/">has been forked a number of times</a>, and some of those forks look like they’re still active, but I honestly don’t know which one I’d point someone&nbsp;to.</p><p>In conclusion, if you’ve found MITREid Connect and it works for you, that’s awesome, go to town! It’s immensely customizable and configurable, and the core is stable, solid, and thoroughly tested in more implementations than I know of. But if you’re looking for it to do something new, or to be deployed in your cloud container, I have to say you might want to look towards something else for a solution.</p>

<p>The following brief was used to form the discussion for the panel on May 2, 2023.</p><p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance.&nbsp; Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed with a consistent short fall in the meeting of expectations.&nbsp; High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place.&nbsp; </p><p>The public sector forms outlined here are generalizations for the purpose of framing a discussion around the design, implementation and adoption of digital wallets and the digital identifiers and credentials stored there-in, and to facilitate a discussion on how interactions would/could work when populations of the different forms interact in a global ecosystem.</p><p>In each of the forms, a private sector also operates and attempts to influence (to a greater or lesser degree) the setting public policy.&nbsp; Motivators of the private sector may be greatly different than that of public policy and as such creates a tension or a ‘force’ that may result in failure to realize expected gains from the policies.&nbsp; The private sector has also a desire to bring digital identity into practice, but its motivators are highly driven by rent extraction, not public policy or (necessarily) public good.&nbsp; Additionally, there are very powerful market forces for monopolization and control where those that ‘control’ the source of digital identification can gain very significant rents from society.</p> Central authority, strong decentralized authority with wary support of population <p>This form is characterized by the existence of a central authority that constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.&nbsp; The central authority typically must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (state or provincial governments) who retain rights that are not granted to the central authority.&nbsp; The populations of this public sector form, can be said to be unruly at times and in recent history inclined to be suspicious of Public Sector forms.&nbsp; English speaking countries are good representative examples of this Form, though even within these there is a spectrum.</p> Centralized authority, strong decentralized authority with support of population <p>This form is characterized by the existence of a central authority that is constitutionally or legal has constraints on its authority.&nbsp; The central authority must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (States) who retain rights that may conflict with the Central authority.&nbsp; The populations of this public sector form, while they may have a level of suspicion, concepts of identity cards and papers have long been used.&nbsp; The European Commission and the Member States of the European Union are a good representative example of this Form.</p> Strong centralized authority with support of population <p>This form is characterized with a strong central authority that has the ‘final’ say on direction and policy.&nbsp; This authority may delegate some responsibility to an elected body, but retains the right to overrule policy positions that may be put forward by this body.&nbsp; The population in this form is typically supportive of the form, and moves in accordance with the direction central authority.&nbsp; Examples of this form would be countries that retain a hereditary monarchy in regions such as, the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa.</p> Authoritarian <p>This form is characterized with a central authority who’s right and power is absolute.&nbsp; This authority sets direction and policy based on its reasoning alone and is not subject to the demands of sharing power with subsidiary authorities.&nbsp; With this form, support (or lack of support) of the population is not considered.&nbsp; The authority has the coercive power and the willingness to use it to ensure its direction and policies are adhered to.</p><p>The desire to realize the benefits of digitalization through the adoption of forms of digital identity has been tried before today, and has seen at best marginal success and at worst total failure resulting in significant outlays of public expenditures (e.g., eIDAS v1, Gov.uk) and political embarrassment. </p><p>In this current cycle to realize the digital potential different ‘experiments’ are (or have been) tried.&nbsp; The Government of British Columbia in Canada started its journey with its Verifiable Organization Network, working with publicly available corporate documentation.&nbsp; In the European Union, under the eIDAS v2 regulation and European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) efforts are underway with use cases in Education and Travel and Tourism.&nbsp; The Government of Bhutan will shortly be launching its digital wallet and identity effort having issued its first digital identifier credentials to the Crown Price of Bhutan in March.&nbsp; Finally, in the US, the Department of Homeland Security is in the fourth year of a five-year process on developing a digital Green Card and Right to Work documentation.&nbsp; </p><p>Each of these programs have necessarily focused within their own ‘borders’ of the public sector form to develop, learn, and prepare.&nbsp; However, the full realization of digital potential requires interoperability between all jurisdictions.&nbsp; </p><p>In this panel discussion, we have representation from three of the four generalized forms of the public sector.&nbsp; </p><p>In preparation for the discussion please reflect on the following questions:</p>  <p>In your respective public sector forms, how is public policy approaching the motivators of its citizenry and businesses to adopt and use digital wallets and identifiers?</p>  <p>It is human nature to only want to share successes, but in reality, the learning and discovery process requires failures and ‘bumps in the road.’&nbsp; What are the ‘redprints’<a title="">[1]</a> from your experiences and observations and what are the learnings gained from these?</p>  <p>To realize the full potential of digital wallets and identity requires that interoperability between legal jurisdictions of digital credentials.&nbsp; How is jurisdictional interoperability being addressed within your respective regions?&nbsp; What programs are in place (or being put in place) to ensure interoperability?</p>  <p>Join us for the discussion: https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/</p><p><a title="">[1]</a> Redprints – the corollary of blueprints.&nbsp; Blueprints show you how to build something, redprints show you what didn’t work. </p>

<p>This article looks at a new concept for creating application security context models for modern solutions using best practice security. By using security context models in projects, a qualitative and secure authentication solution can be produced quicker and more efficient. At present, too many solution architects try to patch the security architecture after the application architecture has been completed.</p>



 Goal of the model 



<p>Modern application security solutions have evolved to utilize a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach instead of relying on security perimeters. This shifts the focus to authentication and authorization flows rather than network or firewall protection. Security measures are now enforced locally on each component, rather than just at the front door. In order to implement this new paradigm and move away from the traditional boundary thinking, a modeling concept known as security context models can be used. These models provide a framework for understanding and addressing security concerns in modern applications, by placing authentication and authorization at the center of the security architecture model. </p>



 Benefits of a security context model 



<p>Security architecture part of the solution and not “fixed” after with weak workarounds.</p>



<p>Security reviews can use this and produce more output, less time is required re-modelling the solution.</p>



<p>Complex security flows or incorrect security concepts can be identified early.</p>



<p>Application security support simplified.</p>



<p>SAST: white box testing can use the model and focus.</p>



 What information is important in a security context diagram? 



<p>A security context model</p>



 
 displays interfaces with third party applications and security definitions 



 displays the authentication and authorization clients 



 displays the application and delegated client types (app identity or app+user identity) 



 displays private zones, public zones and security zones 



 displays the authentication and authorization flow types 



 has an appendix 
 



<p></p>



 Display interfaces with third party Apps and security definitions 



<p>The interfaces between the relevant internal and external components should be displayed in a context security model. By displaying the interfaces further security information can be included and displayed. Including the interfaces, the different security flows can be identified. Here’s an example displaying only the interfaces. From this model alone, it is clear that only Keycloak clients are used and the Keycloak identity provider federates to the further identity providers.</p>







<p></p>



 Displays the authentication and authorization clients 



<p>It is very useful to display the authentication and authorization flow type definitions. You should also specify if a client is a single tenant or a multiple tenant client. A security client should be either a delegated or an application type. In Azure, it is a good idea not to mix the application and delegated permissions in a single client which can lead to security problems.</p>







<p></p>



 Display application and delegated client types 



<p>The application or the delegated (user) types can be displayed in the model to add clarity to the API access. An access token returned to a UI client flow type is always a delegated (user + identity) access token. If the client credentials flow is used, then the access token is created for the trusted application and no user is involved. You could display the client inside the application and add an application access token to the model or I sometimes just display the flow type in the connection and it is clear that an application token is used to access the API.</p>







<p></p>



 Displays private zones, public zones and security zones 



<p>The public or private zones should be displayed in a security context model. Firewalls can also be included to enrich the model but these are not required. Any component which implements part of the authentication or authorization should be included. If it makes it easier to understand the security architecture, it should be included. By including the security zones, you can see clearly which components are accessible from the internet or intranet or separate networks. This does not change the security requirements of each component as each component needs to implement the security anyway (Zero trust strategy).</p>







<p></p>



 Displays the authentication and authorization flow types 



<p>It is important to include the authentication and the authorization flow types to acquire access tokens, or access to UI applications. Only standards should be used and a client application should never create it’s own access tokens. In the following model, the client credentials flow is used to request an application access token to access the API application.</p>







<p></p>



 Should I include network security components? 



<p>Traditional security boundary models were created with the firewall rules and definitions to control the traffic. These models are still required but have a different focus. In an application security context model, only the network components used to implement authentication or authorization components are included. If you use an API manager to implement an OAuth2 client for the API application, then this needs to be included. If you use an application proxy to remove or add HTTP security headers, this should be included as well.</p>



 Example Security Context for Web application using BFF (Backend for Frontend) 



<p>A Blazor application is implemented using BFF security architecture. The Blazor application uses a downstream API which authorizes using delegated user access tokens. The API application uses an Azure SQL. The API and the database are not public to the internet.</p>







<p></p>



 Security context model appendix 



<p>Interface 1 Blazor –&nbsp; Key Vault </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 2 API –&nbsp; Key Vault </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 3 Blazor – API</p>



<p>OAuth using delegated user access token and scope. The API is restricted for use with the Blazor UI using the Azure App registration clientId</p>



<p>Interface 4 API –&nbsp; SQL DB </p>



<p>Access using service managed identity with restricted access</p>



<p>Interface 5 Blazor  –&nbsp; Azure AD</p>



<p>OpenID Connect code flow with PKCE, confidential client</p>

<p>This is a guest post from&nbsp; Quantum Heart Cafe, the first in a series of letters on Stephen Johnson’s book, “Emergence.” If you want additional information on slime mold, be sure to check out a recent guest post, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/03/13/the-game-of-slime-guest-post-by-daruchan/">The Game of Slime</a>,” by Daruchan.</p>
<p>April 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I was visiting a used bookstore looking for the book, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game">Ender’s Game,</a>” which is a very good novel to read if you want to understand how predatory systems seek to manipulate and gamify children. On the shelves I came across Steven Johnson’s book “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Emergence-Connected-Brains-Cities-Software/dp/0140287752">Emergence</a>.” I had recently finished reading “<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/World-Sensorium-Social-Embryology-Federation/dp/1162738480/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31CVPJTTCHC8X&amp;keywords=world+sensorium&amp;qid=1682523576&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=world+sensorium%2Cstripbooks%2C143&amp;sr=1-1">The World Sensorium</a>” by Oliver L Reiser, in which he proposes the idea of socially evolving humanity towards a collective consciousness, a world brain. Throughout “The World Sensorium,” Reiser uses the term emergence a lot, so when I saw Steven Johnson’s book, I was drawn to it. When I started reading it a little over a week ago, I understood why. As I read through “Emergence,” I plan to write up a series of letters from the Labyrinth to share important topics presented in the book with readers of this blog. This first letter touches on slime mold, substrates, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>I’m also borrowing the concept of “artificial emergence” proposed by <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/04/23/morphogenesis-a-speculative-introduction-guest-post-by-lorraine-davison/">Lorraine Davison</a> in a letter of hers that was previously featured on this blog. I sense there is a natural emergence that comes from the Creator that can be contrasted with the cybernetic drive to wedge an artificial complex system between living beings and the Creator. It is that artificial emergence that I’ll refer to throughout the series of letters I plan to write on Johnson’s book.</p>
<p>Steven begins by talking about how a Japanese scientist, <a href="https://life.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/en/mf/staff/nakagaki-toshiyuki">Toshiyuki Nakagaki</a>, trained a being called slime mold to find the shortest route in a maze. One of the reasons this feat garnered so much attention is that slime mold doesn’t have a central nervous system, yet it was able to find the shortest way toward the source of food and solve the puzzle.&nbsp; Scientists, and others interested in emergence, study slime mold for a couple of reasons. It is an example of how simple components are the foundation for building higher level intelligence, something that is an important feature of complex adaptive systems. Another reason scientists are focused on slime mold, as well as other social creatures like ants and termites, is the coordinated group behaviour they display.&nbsp; Coordinated group behaviour is an important process for the system to learn as it attempts to steer people in the direction it wants us to go. This is why I think it’s important to remember that political leaders, social media influencers, CEOs, business people etc. are also agents acting on behalf of the system, consciously or not. It seems that their purpose is to create the pheromone trails that will attract us to and keep us on a desired path. This idea will be a continuous theme across these letters. </p>
<p>The obsession with slime mold started in the late 1960s with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Fox_Keller">Evelyn Keller’s</a> research. Keller is a physicist who did her dissertation on molecular biology. She wrote her dissertation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics">non-equilibrium thermodynamics</a>. Keller was also an associate with <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/getting-drugs-across-blood-brain-barrier-using-nanoparticles?_subsite=research-ski">Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> in Manhattan. She used mathematics to understand biological problems.&nbsp; In 1968, Keller met fellow colleague Lee Segel who showed her his slime mold. They both began to study the slime mold, and their findings have been used by urban planners, neuroscientists and software engineers as they have sought to replicate natural emergence. Slime mold can be found in natural damp and moist environments, such as the forest floor, where they forage for food. When individual slime mold cells find food, they send signals to neighbouring cells and eventually cluster into a bigger organism. Once the food is gone, or the environment is dry, the slime mold cells disperse into individual cells and move in different directions.</p>
<p>Scientists think that the way slime mold cells signal each other is through a chemical messenger called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrasin">acrasin,</a> also called cyclic AMP.&nbsp; If an individual sends enough of a signal, other slime mold cells will travel to its location, and they will begin to cluster into an organism. The organism would then move towards the source of stimulus like food.&nbsp; At one point, it was thought that slime mold cells had what Steven Johnson calls “pacemaker” cells, they would act as leaders and signal to the other individual cells who would then pass the message along to neigbouring cells. In his book, Johnson points out the fact that Keller wasn’t able to locate any “pacemaker” cells. He argues that there are no pacemaker cells in emergent systems, but rather humans have a desire to look for pacemaker cells.&nbsp; He then goes on to say that complex adaptive systems are created by individual agents who have an equal playing field. It is the interactions of individual agents with one another following certain rules that create higher level behaviour.</p>
<p>Keller thought that individual slime mold cells could trigger a formation of an organism by emitting or changing the amount of cyclic AMP in the environment. Those with the most cyclic AMP could attract other slime mold cells, then they would begin to cluster.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchel_Resnick">Mitch Resnick</a>, a contemporary and colleague of Keller, created a simulation game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarLogo">StarLogo</a>. The game involved using slime mold simulations as a means for students to study self-organizing systems. Students could alter the number of slime mold cells in the environment as well as the level and duration of the cyclic AMP to generate different types of emergent behaviour.</p>
<p>While there may or may not be ‘pacemaker’ cells in natural emergence, I disagree with Johnson’s assertion that there are no pacemaker cells in artificial emergence. I sense there is a predatory system that is trying to place itself between life on Earth and the Creator, and I think it is doing this by placing specific agents and actors within the simulation to try and steer people towards a cybernetic future, towards Oliver Reiser’s world brain.&nbsp; An important example is the steering and clustering that occurs on social media platforms. I see them as examples of complex adaptive systems, another word for artificial emergence. On these engineered platforms people are supposed to interact with one another and follow the platform’s rules to create higher level behaviours. However, there are people acting as agents on behalf of the system (whether they know this or not) who are put in place to attract and influence people.</p>
<p>In “The World Sensorium,” Oliver Reiser talks about polarization and substrates. He speaks about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_polarity">cellular polarization</a>, which is when cells become polarized and then move towards a source of stimulus. An example would be if I cut my arm, the cells in my body would polarize and begin moving towards the cut, so they could heal my arm. Reiser applies that analogy to human society. He imagines humans could be polarized and be moved via a stimulus, towards the creation of a world brain. Reiser talks about how a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate_(biology)">substrate</a> is the environment or surface that living organisms inhabit. He understood that a substrate would be needed in order to polarize the cells to move in a certain direction.&nbsp; In a way, social media platforms act as a substrate for polarizing people who can then be moved towards a certain stimulus. Similar to the slime mold cells, influencers and other system agents are used to create an attraction, then people cluster into groups. Once clustered into these online groups or communities, people can be polarized and steered towards the direction the system desires. Most people interacting on these platforms aren’t aware of the larger system at work. According to Johnson, ignorance of the overall program is an important characteristic of artificial emergence.</p>
<p>For this reason I think it is wise to think beyond specific people or influencers, as Alison encourages us to do, and to consider the system and assess how it acts out its predatory impulses through agents, which it has mostly groomed and selected.</p>
<p>I’m going to end the first letter here. For the next letter I will be talking about ant queens, Manchester and Jane Jacobs’s work.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Quantum Heart Cafe</p>

The topics were diverse but I think it's fair to say that verifiable credentials were a hot topic.

Not surprisingly, most of the attendees were from the US (219), followed by Canada (20). Germany, the UK, and Switzerland rounded out the top five with 8, 7, and 6 attendees respectively. The next five, Australia (5), South Korea (3), Japan (3), Indonesia (3), and Columbia (3) showed the diversity with attendees from APAC and South America. Sadly, there were no attendees from Africa this time. Please remember we offer scholarships for people from underrepresented areas, so if you'd like to come to IIW37, please let us know.</p><p>In terms of states and provinces, California was, unsurprisingly, first with 101. New York (17), Washington (16), Utah (15), and British Columbia (11) rounded out the top five. Victoria was the source of BC's strong Canadian showing coming in fifth in cities with 8 attendees after San Jose (15), San Francisco( 13), Seattle (12), and New York (10).</p><p>The week was fabulous. I can't begin to recount the many important, interesting, and timely conversations I had. I heard from many others that they had a similar experience. IIW37 will be held Oct 10-12, 2023 at the Computer History Museum. We'll have tickets available soon. I hope you'll be able to join us.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>With this years <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> just over a month away (and the deadline to get the draft of <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361547/">my talk this year</a> swiftly approaching), I was reminded that I never got around to sharing video of the keynote I gave at last years conference. It was very kind and a tremendous vote of confidence in me from Andi Hindle to offer me the opportunity to take the keynote stage during an important transition year for the Identiverse conference. I took this chance to bring together a number of thoughts that had been rattling around in my brain based on the work I’ve been doing at Uniken in creating customer identity and security systems for deployment around the world, catering to a variety of verticals, consumer demographics, capabilities, and threat vectors. It coalesced nicely (I believe) into a talk about designing trustworthy systems.</p>



 

 Identiverse 2022 Keynote: The Design of Trustworthy Things



<p>Why did I feel compelled to focus on the topic of trust (and no, it’s not the ‘Zero Trust’ type of trust I’m talking about here)? It’s because there is very clearly a trust crisis permeating every aspect of our lives.&nbsp; In the world of identity, we saw it recently in the scams and frauds that permeated the NFT world, and in the swift backlash against the IRS’ plans to add face biometrics to its identity proofing flows. We see this crisis of trust all around us—and it has a significant impact on the world that we as identity professionals are responsible for.&nbsp;Trust is something that you earn, something that is given to you. We can’t build trust itself into a digital identity system. But we can, and we must, build systems which are worthy of trust.</p>



<p>In my talk, I attempted to tease out what it means to build trustworthy&nbsp;systems – demonstrating the meaningful ways in which digital identity technologies are woven into the fabric and architecture of such systems, and showing how such trustworthy systems may finally deliver on the promise of financial, social and technological inclusion, dignity and reliability. The feedback was <a href="https://blog.talkingidentity.com/downloads/response-to-the-design-of-trustworthy-things">overwhelmingly positive</a>, for which I am tremendously grateful, and I hope you find it useful as well.</p>



<p>Here are links to a number of the resources I shared or referred to in my talk:</p>



 
 Don Norman’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-design-of-everyday-things-don-norman/12398830?ean=9780465050659">brilliant book</a> on ‘The Design of Everyday Things’, which I highly recommend for all identity practitioners. 



 A <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/defined/human-centered-design">quick primer</a> on Human Centered Design. 



 Important work by Dr. Jessica Barker on <a href="https://www.cygenta.co.uk/post/phishing-simulations-backfire">how phishing simulations backfire</a> and erode trust. 



 The hugely important research and work by ‘Women in Identity’ being done to <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">develop a global identity code of conduct</a>, that I strongly urge every identity practitioner to follow and possibly get involved with.

Around the globe governments are investing and  trialing different concepts while setting defining the public policy  around these capabilities.</p><p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force)  adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the  public sector form of governance. Over the past 20+ years the potential  of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly  but the results have been mixed with a consistent short fall in the  meeting of expectations. High assurant digital identity appears to  provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of  society to take place.</p><p>Our panelists are:</p>  <p>Cosanna Preston-Idedia, VP Advisory Services, IDLab Canada</p>  <p>Jacques von Benecke, CTO, Druk Holdings &amp; Investments, Bhutan</p>  <p>Bjarke Alling, Principal Advisor, D-Seal</p>  <p>I hope you can join us on May 2nd at 1900 CET / 1300 ET / 1000 PT</p><p>Sign up here: https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/</p>

<p>先程Google Bardのベータアクセス権を取得しました。</p>



<p>ご存知のように、ChatGPTのプライバシー特性については、イタリアのプライバシー保護機関 「Garante 」の<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/">調査</a>に象徴されるように、かなり多くの疑問があります。その一つが、生身の人間に関する情報の扱い、特に誤まった情報を創作して回答してしまう問題です。これは、GDPRをはじめとする世界のプライバシー規制に基づく適法性に疑問が投げかけられています。</p>



<p>そこで、ChatGPTとGoogle Bardでそのテストに臨みました。</p>



 

 



<p>テストするために、私は2人の生きている個人の情報を尋ねました：1人は比較的無名ですが、まだ検索可能で文書がインターネット上で入手可能であり、1人は著名な人物です。つまり、私とイーロン・マスクです。</p>



<p>これがChatGPTからの返答です。</p>



(出所) ChatGPT &lt;2023-04-18取得&gt;.



<p>がっつり回答してしまっていますね。。そしてそれは、実は私に関する不正確な情報でいっぱいです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5287/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5287" title="このような不正確な情報を流したくないので、アクセシビリティの観点からは望ましくないのですが、テキストではなく画像で表示することにしました。">1</a>。このような「偽」の情報を返信することは、重大なプライバシー侵害となる可能性があり、重く受け止める必要があります。</p>



<p>これに対して、Google Bardはこのように返信しています：</p>



(出所) Google Bard &lt;2023-04-18取得&gt;.



<p>人々にとってはあまり面白くないかもしれませんが、おそらくこれが本来のあるべき姿なのでしょう生きている人のために答えを作って返してははいけないのです。</p>



<p>実は、18日、その時はBardがどういう回答をするか知らなかったのですが、前職がドイツのある州の個人情報保護当局の人で、現在プライバシー関連の弁護士事務所を開業している人とランチしながらこの件を話していて、今回のBardのような、個人に関する情報出力はフィルタリングしてしまって返さないという対応しかありえないだろうという話をしたばかりでした<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5287/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5287" title="なお、個人に関する情報以外はGoogle Bard も ChatGPTよろしく創作して返してくれます :-D">2</a>。そういう意味でも大変興味深い事例です。逆に、ChatGPTは個人情報の開示請求をされたらどうするつもりなんでしょうね。持っていませんと答えても、持っていると答えても茨の道しか無いような気がするんですが。</p>



<p>このラウンドは、Google Bardの明確な勝ちですね。今後の動向が注目されます。</p>

<p>This article shows how to provision Azure IoT hub devices using Azure IoT hub device provisioning services (DPS) and ASP.NET Core. The devices are setup using chained certificates created using .NET Core and managed in the web application. The data is persisted in a database using EF Core and the certificates are generated using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CertificateManager">CertificateManager</a> Nuget package. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/AzureIoTHubDps">https://github.com/damienbod/AzureIoTHubDps</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>To setup a new Azure IoT Hub DPS, enrollment group and devices, the web application creates a new certificate using an ECDsa private key and the .NET Core APIs. The data is stored in two pem files, one for the public certificate and one for the private key. The pem public certificate file is downloaded from the web application and uploaded to the certificates blade in Azure IoT Hub DPS. The web application persists the data to a database using EF Core and SQL. A new certificate is created from the DPS root certificate and used to create a DPS enrollment group. The certificates are chained from the original DPS certificate. New devices are registered and created using the enrollment group. Another new device certificate chained from the enrollment group certificate is created per device and used in the DPS. The Azure IoT Hub DPS creates a new IoT Hub device using the linked IoT Hubs. Once the IoT hub is running, the private key from the device certificate is used to authenticate the device and send data to the server. </p>







<p></p>



<p>When the ASP.NET Core web application is started, users can create new certificates, enrollment groups and add devices to the groups. I plan to extend the web application to add devices, delete devices, and delete groups. I plan to add authorization for the different user types and better paging for the different UIs.  At present all certificates use ECDsa private keys but this can easily be changed to other types. This depends on the type of root certificate used. </p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>The application is secured using Microsoft.Identity.Web and requires an authenticated user. This can be setup in the program file or in the startup extensions. I use EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi to force the OpenID Connect code flow. The configuration is read from the default AzureAd app.settings and the whole application is required to be authenticated. When the enable and disable flows are added, I will add different users with different authorization levels.</p>


  builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache();

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(
	OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
	.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(
		builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"))
	.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
	.AddDistributedTokenCaches();
  


<p></p>



 Create an Azure IoT Hub DPS certificate 



<p>The web application is used to create devices using certificates and DPS enrollment groups. The DpsCertificateProvider class is used to create the root self signed certificate for the DPS enrollment groups. The NewRootCertificate from the CertificateManager Nuget package is used to create the certificate using an ECDsa private key. This package wraps the default .NET APIs for creating certificates and adds a layer of abstraction. You could just use the lower level APIs directly. The certificate is exported to two separate pem files and persisted to the database.</p>


  public class DpsCertificateProvider
{
    private readonly CreateCertificatesClientServerAuth _createCertsService;
    private readonly ImportExportCertificate _iec;
    private readonly DpsDbContext _dpsDbContext;

    public DpsCertificateProvider(CreateCertificatesClientServerAuth ccs,
        ImportExportCertificate importExportCertificate,
        DpsDbContext dpsDbContext)
    {
        _createCertsService = ccs;
        _iec = importExportCertificate;
        _dpsDbContext = dpsDbContext;
    }

    public async Task&lt;(string PublicPem, int Id)&gt; CreateCertificateForDpsAsync(string certName)
    {
        var certificateDps = _createCertsService.NewRootCertificate(
            new DistinguishedName { CommonName = certName, Country = "CH" },
            new ValidityPeriod { ValidFrom = DateTime.UtcNow, ValidTo = DateTime.UtcNow.AddYears(50) },
            3, certName);

        var publicKeyPem = _iec.PemExportPublicKeyCertificate(certificateDps);

        string pemPrivateKey = string.Empty;
        using (ECDsa? ecdsa = certificateDps.GetECDsaPrivateKey())
        {
            pemPrivateKey = ecdsa!.ExportECPrivateKeyPem();
            FileProvider.WriteToDisk($"{certName}-private.pem", pemPrivateKey);
        }
 
        var item = new DpsCertificate
        {
            Name = certName,
            PemPrivateKey = pemPrivateKey,
            PemPublicKey = publicKeyPem
        };

        _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.Add(item);

        await _dpsDbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

        return (publicKeyPem, item.Id);
    }

    public async Task&lt;List&lt;DpsCertificate&gt;&gt; GetDpsCertificatesAsync()
    {
        return await _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.ToListAsync();
    }

    public async Task&lt;DpsCertificate?&gt; GetDpsCertificateAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _dpsDbContext.DpsCertificates.FirstOrDefaultAsync(item =&gt; item.Id == id);
    }
}
  


<p>Once the root certificate is created, you can download the public pem file from the web application and upload it to the Azure IoT Hub DPS portal. This needs to be verified. You could also use a CA created certificate for this, if it is possible to create child chained certificates. The enrollment groups are created from this root certificate.</p>







<p></p>



 Create an Azure IoT Hub DPS enrollment group 



<p>Devices can be created in different ways in the Azure IoT Hub. We use a DPS enrollment group with certificates to create the Azure IoT devices. The DpsEnrollmentGroupProvider is used to create the enrollment group certificate. This uses the root certificate created in the previous step and chains the new group certificate from this. The enrollment group is used to add devices. Default values are defined for the enrollment group and the pem files are saved to the database. The root certificate is read from the database and the chained enrollment group certificate uses an ECDsa private key like the root self signed certificate.</p>



<p>The CreateEnrollmentGroup method is used to set the initial values of the IoT Hub Device. The ProvisioningStatus is set to enabled. This means when the device is registered, it will be enabled to send messages. You could also set this to disabled and enable it after when the device gets used by an end client for the first time. A MAC or a serial code from the device hardware could be used to enable the IoT Hub device. By waiting till the device is started by the end client, you could choose a IoT Hub optimized for this client.</p>

 Register a device in the enrollment group 



<p>The DpsRegisterDeviceProvider class creates a new device chained certificate using the enrollment group certificate and creates this using the ProvisioningDeviceClient. The transport ProvisioningTransportHandlerAmqp is set in this example. There are different transport types possible and you need to chose the one which best meets your needs. The device certificate uses an ECDsa private key and stores everything to the database. The PFX for windows is stored directly to the file system. I use pem files and create the certificate from these in the device client sending data to the hub and this is platform independent. The create PFX file requires a password to use it.</p>

 Download certificates and use 



<p>The private and the public pem files are used to setup the Azure IoT Hub device and send data from the device to the server. A HTML form is used to download the files. The form sends a post request to the file download API.</p>


  &lt;form action="/api/FileDownload/DpsDevicePublicKeyPem" method="post"&gt;
	&lt;input type="hidden" value="@Model.DpsDevice.Id" id="Id" name="Id" /&gt;
	&lt;button type="submit" style="padding-left:0" class="btn btn-link"&gt;Download Public PEM&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
  


<p>The DpsDevicePublicKeyPemAsync method implements the file download. The method gets the data from the database and returns this as pem file.</p>


  [HttpPost("DpsDevicePublicKeyPem")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DpsDevicePublicKeyPemAsync([FromForm] int id)
{
	var cert = await _dpsRegisterDeviceProvider
		.GetDpsDeviceAsync(id);
	if (cert == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cert));
	if (cert.PemPublicKey == null) 
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(cert.PemPublicKey));

	return File(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(cert.PemPublicKey),
		"application/octet-stream",
		$"{cert.Name}-public.pem");
}
  


<p>The device UI displays the data and allows the authenticated user to download the files.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The CertificateManager and the Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client Nuget packages are used to implement the IoT Hub device client. The pem files with the public certificate and the private key can be loaded into a X509Certificate instance. This is then used to send the data using the DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate class. The SendEvent method sends the data using the IoT Hub device Message class.</p>


  var serviceProvider = new ServiceCollection()
	.AddCertificateManager()
	.BuildServiceProvider();
var iec = serviceProvider.GetService&lt;ImportExportCertificate&gt;();

#region pem

var deviceNamePem = "robot1-feed";

var certPem = File.ReadAllText($"{_pathToCerts}{deviceNamePem}-public.pem");
var eccPem = File.ReadAllText($"{_pathToCerts}{deviceNamePem}-private.pem");
var cert = X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem(certPem, eccPem);

// setup deviceCert windows store export 
var pemDeviceCertPrivate = iec!.PemExportPfxFullCertificate(cert);
var certDevice = iec.PemImportCertificate(pemDeviceCertPrivate);

#endregion pem

var auth = new DeviceAuthenticationWithX509Certificate(deviceNamePem, certDevice);
var deviceClient = DeviceClient.Create(iotHubUrl, auth, transportType);

if (deviceClient == null)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Failed to create DeviceClient!");
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Successfully created DeviceClient!");
	SendEvent(deviceClient).Wait();
}
  


 Notes 



<p>Using certificates in .NET and windows is complicated due to how the private keys are handled and loaded. The private keys need to be exported or imported into the stores etc. This is not an easy API to get working and the docs for this are confusing. </p>



<p>This type of device transport and the default setup for the device would need to be adapted for your system. In this example, I used ECDsa certificates but you could also use RSA based keys. The root certificate could be replaced with a CA issued one. I created long living certificates because I do not want the devices to stop working in the field. This should be moved to a configuration. A certificate rotation flow would make sense as well.</p>



<p>In the follow up articles, I plan to save the events in hot and cold path events and implement device enable, disable flows. I also plan to write about the device twins. The device twins is a excellent way of sharing data in both directions. </p>

 You can try to increase the number of times each user tweets and browses others’ tweets.

<p>If you owned Twitter, how would you grow it? I think you have basically two choices:</p>

 
 
<p>You can try to grow the number of users who use Twitter on a regular basis.</p>
 
 
<p>You can try to increase the number of times each user tweets and browses others’ tweets.</p>
 
 
<p>Is that the same for the Fediverse?</p>
<p>Turns out the answer is a resounding No! We have far more options.</p>

 
 
<p>Yep, we can try and grow the number of users who regularly use the Fediverse.</p>
 
 
<p>Yep, we can try to increase the number of times each user posts and reads other people’s
posts. (Except that we don’t actually want to do that so very much, otherwise the
Fediverse would have to become addictive, and not wanting to be manipulated is one of
the things that got us off the big centralized social platforms in the first place.)</p>
 
 
<p>We can do more things than just “tweeting” in the Fediverse.
Because unlike on Twitter, every Fediverse-enabled app can – and usually does – add
new features that go way beyond just posting “What’s happening”. And there are so many
of them already! PeerTube for video, PixelFed for photos, FunkWhale for audio,
Mobilizon for events, OwnCast for streaming, Bookwyrm for reading, Micro.blog for blogging
and more … and all interoperating on the same network. Each new feature like that
grows the Fediverse, as I can now do more things, and will if it is easy enough. Each
of those tools grows the use of the Fediverse with the same number of users and the
same number of “tweets”. Practically, Twitter does not have this option.</p>
 
 
<p>Which, together, enables entirely new categories of use cases that go way beyond of
what a social media platform like Twitter has ever done (or dreamt of!), or what any
one Fediverse app can do on its own. Many of those will turn out to be much more
valuable and useful than mere sharing “What’s happening”. And they will be possible
because all of those apps can be combined in various ways on the same, free, ad-free,
manipulation-free, open, rich communications network called the Fediverse.</p>
 
 
<p>For this to work, however, we need to work to make the interactions between the various
Fediverse apps much smoother than they are today. Yes, of course, ActivityPub lets us
send notes and likes and comments and various other things around from one app to another.</p>
<p>But much more can and should be done, such as:</p>
 
 
<p>Seamless single-sign-on across the Fediverse apps that I’m using. So if I see a
Mobilizon event shared on Mastodon, I want to be able to click “Yes, RSVP, I’m coming”
and identify myself with my Mastodon-issued Fediverse handle. There is no reason why
I should have to sign up for a separate Mobilizon account first.</p>
<p>The same, of course, should be true about videos, music, bookmarks, and so many other
things in so many Fediverse apps. (Before you get concerned, yes, you should
be able to have multiple non-connected “personas”, like work and play, in the Fediverse,
but we still need single-sign-on within the scope of a single persona.)</p>
 
 
<p>My social network should come with me when I use different Fediverse apps. So if I
decide to start using Pixelfed, I should be able to instantly follow all the photo
streams of all the friends I’m following somewhere else, such as on Pleroma or
Mastodon. After all, if I’m interested in the photos that my friend Joe shares, why
would I make a distinction whether he shares them through one app or the other?
The Fediverse can do this if we want to; no other social network can do this.</p>
 
 
<p>And and and…</p>
 
 
<p>Imagine when data flows freely, data of many, rich kinds, across an open network, directly
from your friends to you. Not just some social media data, but most data you care about!
With nobody in the middle to manipulate you, or charge you, or advertise to you, or censor
you … and no unnatural hoops that you need to jump through.</p>
<p>We got to work on that last bit, and on that note, I’m very happy that a
<a href="https://fedidevs.org/">Fediverse Developer Network</a> is coming together with participation
from many excellent Fediverse developers working on a variety of apps. Our goal here is
to connect the people well who work on this, so their apps can connect well, too! It’s
early days, but very promising.</p>

 Fighting for Consensus at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 



  
<blockquote><p>5.5. Chair Decision and Group Decision Appeals</p><p>When group participants believe that their concerns are not being duly considered by the group or the Chair, they may ask the Director (for representatives of a Member organization, via their Advisory Committee representative) to confirm or deny the decision. This is a Group Decision Appeal or a Chair Decision Appeal. The participants should also make their requests known to the Team Contact. The Team Contact must inform the Director when a group participant has raised concerns about due process.</p><p>Any requests to the Director to confirm a decision must include a summary of the issue (whether technical or procedural), decision, and rationale for the objection. All counter-arguments, rationales, and decisions must be recorded.</p></blockquote>
  



<p>From “W3C Process Document” <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/</a></p>



<p>It’s unfortunate that I find myself formally appealing a decision by the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group (DID WG) chairs. Simply put, the decision was not made according to the applicable W3C Process, which requires seeking consensus through selecting proposals with the weakest technical objections.</p>



<p>The decision to appeal was not made lightly. It will force into the public view a disagreement between parties who generally have high mutual regard and respect. I personally think the DID WG chairs are well-intentioned and doing their best to resolve the challenges of the underlying work. However, in this particular case, we have a failure to secure consensus and an unfortunate autocratic imposition of the chairs’ position on a group in significant dissent.</p>



<p>I got involved in this particular stream of work after attending the first ID2020 and Rebooting the Web of Trust II after over ten years in the user-centric identity movement as championed by the Internet Identity Workshop and ProjectVRM. I became (and remain) an editor for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">Verifiable Credentials Use Cases</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric">DID Method Rubric</a>, all W3C publications. I am treasurer and board member of <a href="https://weboftrust.info">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, a collaborative writing workshop that incubated early Decentralized Identity technologies like DIDs and VCs. My business is a small consulting company that helps clients better understand the human requirements for decentralized identity systems and applications. I also created the DID Directory <a href="https://diddirectory.com">DID Directory</a> and host a podcast about DID methods, <a href="https://rubric.cc">The Rubric</a>. In short, I have over 15 years invested in bringing this technology to realization, as a consistent contributor to the shared work of the broader community and as a leader in both W3C and external efforts.</p>



<p>After years of serving as invited expert to the VCWG and DIDWG, we joined the W3C this year to specifically to oppose the Chairs’ decision in this matter.</p>



 Technical Background 



<p>While this appeal does not rely on a technical argument for overturning the chairs decision, our primary technical reasoning is straightforward.</p>



<p>Enabling the DID WG to develop specific DID methods will actively undermine the work’s fundamental goal of decentralization.</p>



 A New Architecture Building on the Old Architecture 



<p>We have an opportunity in decentralized identifiers to reinvent outdated architectures that rely on, and extend, the innate authority of centralized actors. The World Wide Web is an amazing achievement in operational decentralization. Unfortunately its naming system is fundamentally based on centralized authority, and therefore subject to manipulation and abuse in ways that decentralized systems are designed to avoid. DIDs represent an opportunity for identifiers to be first class citizens for the World Wide Web, without needing to defer to any centralized authority. Not IANA. Not DNS. DIDs provide a way for anyone to stand up an identification system and for anyone to use that system. It is, in its way, a profound restructuring of what identity means in digital systems. Combined with Verifiable Credentials, this emerging identity system provides a decentralized way for individuals to engage digitally with promise of greater privacy, improved user control, and increased respect for our humanity.</p>



<p>A fundamental innovation of DIDs relative to public key cryptography is the level of indirection between the identifier and the cryptography, with different DID methods providing different means for managing this level of indirection.</p>



<p>DIDs resolve to DID Documents, where resolution is defined by the DID method specified in the DID itself. The data required to determine the current authoritative DID document for a given DID is stored in the Verifiable Data Registry of that method.</p>



<p>Consider the DID did:example:abc. This is a well-formed DID using the “example” method. The mechanism to turn that DID into a DID document based on that DID method’s Verifiable Data Registry is called resolution.</p>



 <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/did-architecture.png"></a>Figure 1. DID Architecture 



<p>First, client software sends the DID to a resolver expected to handle that particular method (“example”). The resolver then uses operations defined by the “example” method to retrieve salient data from the Verifiable Data Registry. Finally, the resolver produces a well-formed DID document and returns that to the client. The client can then interpret the DID document to use the current cryptographic and service endpoint information for that DID.</p>



<p>Because of this level of indirection between the DID and the DID document, DID controllers can update the DID’s cryptographic material without changing the identifier itself (and without relying on a trusted third party). This means that normal, operational security actions like key rotation and revocation can be implemented without requiring direct communication with relying parties. The VDR acts as the intermediary. In fact, the DID controller does not even need to know who is relying on the DID; there is no requirement for direct communication about updates to the DID document. In contrast, updating private key information with traditional public/private key cryptography requires communicating the new public key to all dependent parties.</p>



<p>By design, DIDs enable any form of Verifiable Data Registry. As long as a method can specify how you perform the Create, Read, Update, and Deactivate operations for a DID using that VDR, it’s a valid method. This has allowed DID methods based on bitcoin (did:btcr and did:ion), ethereum (did:ethr and did:elem), bespoke blockchains (did:v1 and did:cosmos), Amazon’s QLDB, and even public keys actually stored in the DID itself (did:key and did:jwk). This fundamental goal of allowing any type of VDR means that interoperability stops at the resolver, which itself provides the integration between resolver clients and a method’s VDR, allowing any method to define its own mechanism for transforming a DID into its DID document, using any kind of VDR.</p>



 Parallels to HTML and HTTP 



<p>The architecture of DID methods is a lot like the architecture of the web itself, where browsers dereference URLs to access webservers that interact with a backend to provide a resource back to the browser. By design, the browser doesn’t need to know how the web server and back end communicate, nor how the data is stored in the backend. All the browser needs to know is the interface HTTP and HTML.</p>



 <a href="https://blog.joeandrieu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/web-architecture.png"></a>Figure 2. Web Architecture 



<p>The equivalent is true for DIDs. With a standard for DID resolution, any DID client would have a standard mechanism (resolution) that can be provided by any conformant DID method, allowing the retrieval and use of DID documents without intimate knowledge of how the VDR works.</p>



<p>That’s the route to interoperability for DIDs, just as it was and is for the web.</p>



 Progress to date 



<p>We built the first two components of the DID system in the DID Core 1.0 specification, namely, a URL syntax for DIDs and a data model for DID documents, which provide the cryptographic material for verifiable interactions related to that DID. In effect, this is like defining URLs (RFC3986) and HTML (originally RFC1866). At the time of the groups initial chartering, we intentionally left DID resolution out of scope, instead merely defining a contract for what DID resolution should provide (without specifying how it is to be provided). Resolution is how one takes a given DID and retrieves the associated DID document. Resolution is the http of DIDs. It takes a well-formed URL (the DID) and specifies how you process bits sent &amp; received over the wire to get the resource indicated (the DID document in this case).</p>



<p>This is the next step in the work: defining an interoperable mechanism for resolving DIDs for different DID methods. Under the hood, resolution is necessarily method-specific because each method is free to use any verifiable data registry (VDR), and, inevitably, different registries have different mechanisms for creating, reading, updating, and deactivating DIDs. While it will be impossible to have a common specification for all potential VDRs (unless you force all methods to use the same VDR mechanism), it is possible to define an interface that all methods could provide, in order to allow client software to resolve a DID and ignore the method-specific details. This is how we get interoperability between DID methods.</p>



<p>This is a stark contrast to the idea that the next step in the work is standardizing specific DID methods. Some have argued that developing a specific DID method would somehow improve interoperability. However, we believe the only interoperability benefit we get from standardizing a specified DID method is either (1) for different implementations of that single method or (2) imposing the mechanisms of that DID method on other methods. Focusing on a single method does not, and cannot, improve interoperability between Methods, especially those based on fundamentally different VDRs. &nbsp;As a decentralized technology, imposing the mechanisms of any given method on other methods is antithetical to the point of the work. In a truly decentralized system, anyone can define a new DID method and it should “just work”. That means interoperability between DID methods is the fundamental priority. We achieve that by specifically focusing on a shared, standardized mechanism for DID resolution rather than focusing on specific methods.</p>



 Summary of Technical Objection 



<p>Having the DID WG standardize specific DID methods creates moral hazards that will inevitably reduce the decentralization of DIDs themselves. Whichever methods the group chooses will attain unprecedented acceleration and impact. It will take an increased attention from the WG focused on those methods, taking away from attention that could go to advance all DID methods. That attention will also increase the WGs familiarity with how chosen methods solve certain problems and those approaches will necessarily already have the blessing of the WG, making them preferred favorites over approaches used by other methods. In short, giving the DID WG the permission to focus its attention on selected favorites would directly undermine its ability to advance the work with equal respect for all methods.</p>



 Procedural Objection 



<p>We also object on procedural grounds to the inclusion of standards-track documents for unstated new specifications in a so-called “maintenance charter”. A working group chartered for maintenance should not be creating new standards-track documents for arbitrary, unspecified DID methods. Maintenance groups should be focused on maintenance, not creating new specifications, especially unnamed specifications. Like the technical argument for decentralization, we do not rely on this procedural flaw in this appeal.</p>



 Formal Request to Deny Chair Decision 



<p>I am formally appealing to the Director of the W3C to deny the decision by the DID WG Charter chairs to override dissent about the inclusion of DID methods in the scope of the next DID WG Charter, as embodied in part in the decision to merge PR#20 and PR#27 into the DID WG Charter.</p>



<p>The decision is best summarized in the comment merging in PR#27</p>



<blockquote><p>The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.</p><p>Despite many, many discussions, no other proposal within the group has garnered as much support as this one has for the creation of a new DID Working Group, which will focus on maintaining Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 and publishing errata updates to that specification. The charter also permits the next DID WG to begin work on DID Methods and DID Resolution, but does not require it, e.g., the group that forms may do as much or as little work on these optional topics as desired.</p><p>Now, regarding the other open PRs, #29 and #30:</p><p>The predominant concern raised has been with the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter. The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary. So we have concluded that PR Remove mention of DID Methods from the charter #29 is no longer relevant to this discussion. We are leaving it open for comments, but they will not change the decision at this point.</p><p>There have been suggestions for an alternative group focused exclusively on DID Resolution. We support the effort to create a DID Resolution Working Group that focuses entirely on DID Resolution, as that will strongly support the work of the DID Working Group, which must focus on the DID Specification. We encourage the proponents to develop their proposal and present it to W3M and the AC Forum as a new Working Group. However, because it would not be a DID Working Group, we have concluded that PR Proposal: Charter for the DID Resolution WG (as a replacement to current proposal) to continue the work of DID 1.0 #30 is no longer relevant to this conversation. We are leaving it open for those who wish to continue designing a separate DID Resolution-focused WG, but we do not expect such work to change the decision at this point.</p>2023/03/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></blockquote>



<p>I am appealing on five points, all of which highlight the chairs’ failure to with respect to W3C Process.</p>



  
  The PRs lacked consensus  Consensus was not legitimately sought  Claims of “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant  This sets a untenable precedent  Proposals with the weakest objection should be favored  



<p></p>
  



<p>I discuss each of these below.</p>



 The PR lacks consensus 



<p>Both staff and chairs have acknowledged that adding DID methods to the spec lacks consensus.</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: I am merging this PR over their objections because having the flexibility to go this route could be vital should our efforts to move DID Resolution forward be frustrated. </p>2022/09/21 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1253912348">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/20#issuecomment-1253912348</a></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>@pchampin: We clearly didn’t manage to reach consensus here </p>2023/01/11 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408</a></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: There is no consensus at this stage, nor do I believe it is possible to achieve it. </p>2023/01/23 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1401199754</a></blockquote>



<p>The lack of consensus does not appear to be in question.</p>



 Consensus was not legitimately sought 



<p>The W3C 2021 Process document places consensus at the core of the W3C:</p>



<blockquote><p>Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the general public).</p></blockquote>



<p>In the section on managing dissent:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p></blockquote>



<p>And, in the section on deciding by vote:</p>



<blockquote><p>A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the chairs did not fulfill these obligations to use all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion.</p>



<p>They avoided the issue. They denied the issue.  Ultimately, they did not lead a technical discussion in an effort to find proposals that create the weakest objections.</p>



  Avoidance  Denial  Deference to political priorities over technical discussion  



 Avoidance 



<p>Despite consistent efforts by myself and others who share my concerns, the chairs actions have had the effect of avoiding dissent rather than working with the group to find the proposal with the weakest objections. They ignored Github issues, held no conference calls, created a false impression of engagement, and failed to respond to direct outreach.</p>



 Ignoring Github issues 



<p>After the initial discussion at TPAC, @brentzundel merged PR#20 on Sep 21, 2022, which put DID methods in scope, with the note that this was against objections voiced at TPAC. I commented in opposition to that merge on October 25, 2022, requesting the PR be reverted. To this date, neither chairs nor staff have even bothered to respond.</p>



 No group phone calls nor email discussion after TPAC 



<p>After the initial objections were acknowledged at TPAC there were neither group conference calls nor any outreach to the mailing list on this matter. Instead of facilitating a conversation to reach a consensus, the chairs acted as if there were no significant issues for the group to discuss.</p>



 False engagement and misdirection 



<p>After lengthy discussion on the PR#27 in question (largely by others) @brentzundel created another PR #29 with the stated goal of finding the proposal with the “best consensus” introduced in his comment on #27 on </p>



  
<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: Out of respect for the opposing positions stated here, I have opened a separate PR that removes all mention of DID Method Specifications #29.</p><p>Whichever PR achieves greater consensus, as determined by the chairs of the current DID WG, will be merged.</p>2023/01/24: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965</a></blockquote>



<p></p>
  



<p>He did in fact create PR #29, which also led, at the request of @TallTed and @brentzundel to PR#30 to shift the entire focus of the charter to DID Resolution. However, neither of these alternatives were actually given serious consideration by the chairs:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: It was never my understanding that a DID Resolution WG would replace the DID WG. I do not support that course of action. If folks are interested in pursuing a DID Resolution WG Charter separate from the DID WG Charter, the place to do it is not here.</p>2023/03/22: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30#pullrequestreview-1339576495</a> </blockquote>



<p>And again, in the comment announcing the chairs decision</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: However, because it would not be a DID Working Group, we have concluded that PR Proposal: Charter for the DID Resolution WG (as a replacement to current proposal) to continue the work of DID 1.0 #30 is no longer relevant to this conversation. We are leaving it open for those who wish to continue designing a separate DID Resolution-focused WG, but we do not expect such work to change the decision at this point.</p>2023/03/24: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, although the chairs’ obligations under the process was to consider all opposing positions and to find the proposal with the weakest objections, @brentzundel made it clear that when counter proposals were offered, they were not welcome. They were not discussed. They were not brought to the attention of the working group. They were summarily dismissed.</p>



 Radio Silence via other channels 



<p>Despite reaching out to the chairs via email in a personal letter, the chairs never directly responded or engaged in any fruitful dialog on this matter. The email was cited in the same comment as the previous in @brentzundel’s comment on #27 on </p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel I want to especially thank Joe for reaching out directly and engaging in a private conversation where we discussed this PR, the future of the WG, and the reasons we became involved in this work in the first place.</p>2023/01/24 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1402233965</a> :</blockquote>



<p>Frankly, @brentzundel’s assertion that “we discussed” anything is a fiction. He did not respond via email nor phone call nor any channels other than communicating his directives through Github comments.</p>



<p>After the recent VCWG face-to-face meeting in Miami, I pulled Brent aside to talk in person for a moment after everything wrapped. In that brief in-person conversation, I affirmed my disagreement with his current position. He restated his belief that this work isn’t “subject to consensus”, which I briefly debated. During this exchange, Brent said “I don’t care. I just don’t care.” He then asked me, as a point of clarification, if I intend to Formally Object if the current PR is merged. I repeated the same position I have made clear since TPAC in September. Yes. I would not only Formally Object, I would use all ethical and lawful means to oppose this decision, including filing an appeal of his decision to override dissent.</p>



 Denial 



<p>Brent has repeatedly denied that consensus applies to charter development:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel : There are no WG consensus requirements in establishing the text of the charter. </p>2022/12/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a></blockquote>



<p>While Pierre-Antoine has no problem acknowledging that consensus matters:</p>



<blockquote><p>@pchampin We clearly didn’t manage to reach consensus here.</p>2023/01/11 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1379253408</a></blockquote>



<p>Surprisingly, in that same comment from Brent, he confirms my position:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel Consensus must be found by the WG for any items developed in the WG, regardless of what the charter allows. </p>2022/12/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1353537492</a></blockquote>



<p>Somehow he wants to be able to act as the chair in this matter, using his authority as chair to direct the output of the group towards a particular charter with particular language, but he simultaneously denies that the Charter is an “item” developed by the WG, despite it being done with DID WG resources, by the DID WG participants, under the leadership of the DID WG chairs.</p>



<p>In person, and in various GitHub issues and on Working Group calls, when faced with diverse opinions, unfortunately, it is an all too common response from Brent that “consensus doesn’t apply.”</p>



 Deference to political priorities over technical discussion 



<p>A significant frustration during this discussion was the repeated deference to non-technical factors rather than focusing on technical distinctions. Rather than debating what would make the most technical sense, the vast majority of arguments for the chairs’ position were political. Not once did the Chairs put forth any arguments other than deference to the perceived requirement from the Director.</p>



<p>Political factors are inevitable, but it is through technical discussion that the work of the W3C moves forward. The nature of standardization is the forging of alignment between competing interests so that the net result satisfies the greatest value. While we may have different tests for what comprises “value”, it is understood that some collective notion of shared benefit, as perceived by the working group, is the driving goal of collaboratively working through our differences. Each participant brings to the table their perspectives and through technical discussion the working group finds consensus around a shared specification that the W3C can formally recommend to the public as a global standard.</p>



<p>From the process document regarding consensus and dissent:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a> </blockquote>



<p>Takeaway point: the group should favor the proposals with the weakest objections.</p>



<p>And</p>



<blockquote><p>A group should only conduct a vote to resolve a substantive issue after the Chair has determined that all available means of reaching consensus through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote is necessary to break a deadlock.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#Votes">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#Votes</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: resolving dissent should occur through technical discussion.</p>



<p>Later in the document, it discusses how a group formally addresses an issue:</p>



<blockquote><p>In the context of this document, a group has formally addressed an issue when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer who raised the issue. A substantive response is expected to include rationale for decisions (e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to charter scope, or a pointer to a requirements document). The adequacy of a response is measured against what a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#formal-address">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#formal-address</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: Adequacy of a response depends on technical soundness.</p>



<p>And the following from Section 5.4 Reopening a Decision When Presented With New Information:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Chair may reopen a decision when presented with new information, including:</p><p>* additional technical information</p><p>* comments by email from participants who were unable to attend a scheduled meeting,</p><p>* comments by email from meeting attendees who chose not to speak out during a meeting (e.g., so they could confer later with colleagues or for cultural reasons).</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGChairReopen">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGChairReopen</a></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Takeaway point: reopening a decision is appropriate for new technical information not new political information (unless by email from participants who didn’t get their input in earlier).</p>



<p>In summary:</p>



  The group should favor the proposals with the weakest objections.  Resolving dissent should occur through technical discussion.  Adequacy of a response depends on technical soundness.  Reopening a decision is appropriate for new technical information not new political information  



<p>I interpret this to mean that resolving consensus per the W3C process SHOULD depend on considering competing proposals based on technical discussions and selecting the proposal that has the weakest technical objections.</p>



<p>That did not happen in this case.</p>



<p>Three alternative PRs were under consideration.</p>



<p>PR#27, the PR that explicitly added DID methods as in scope. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27</a></p>



<p>PR#29, a PR alternative suggested by @brentzundel that removed DID methods from the scope, with minimal other changes. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/29</a></p>



<p>PR#30, a PR alternative suggested by @christopherallen that put forth a DID Resolution WG charter to focus the group on the next step in interoperability and to avoid the alleged mandate from the Director that the next DID WG MUST standardize DID methods. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/30</a></p>



<p>PR#27 elicited several technical objections, including multiple participants who made it clear that both Formal Objections and an Appeal would be filed if this charter is put forth.</p>



<p>PR#29 triggered several statements of preference, on both sides, but only one technical objection.</p>



<p>PR#30 triggered a few statements of preference, on both sides, but no technical objections.</p>



<p>In the face of this evidence, both #29 or #30 had weaker technical objections than #27.</p>



 On Technical Objections 



<p>There is a legitimate question about what constitutes a technical objection. I rely on the process statement that responding to a formal objection must be what “a W3C reviewer would generally consider to be technically sound”.</p>



<p>Technical issues raised (all quotes from Github):</p>



  There is no DID Method ready for standardization. (technology is not ready)  Standardizing DID Methods is like standardizing websites. (layer violation)  There is a technical route to meet the letter and the spirit of the prior formal objectors’ request for further implementation guidance. It includes showing the transport layer using the DID Resolution specification, including its test cases, educating the formal objectors regarding what was achieved, and moving specification of example DID Methods outside this WG’s work items. (there’s a better route to technical interoperability)  We don’t want to give the impression that some DID methods are more “important” or “required” than others. (decentralization means no privileged parties)  We are told there is a mandate to include standardization of DID methods into the working group charter, but the parties that mandate this inclusion have not been actively involved in the WG process in the past, and there is no evidence that they plan to be involved in the future. This lack of active participation raises questions about the legitimacy of their mandate and the potential impact that these objections may have on the future of this standardization process. (consensus-driven technical standardization depends on participation)  If we work on any DID method/s, will this put it/them in a “blessed” state, against which no other DID method/s can possibly compete? I highly doubt it. Though, if it&nbsp;does, that would tend to indicate that all desirable features are fully optimized in that method; else, another method would be registered eventually if not immediately. (Dispute of technical issue #4)  



<p>Political Issues raised (all quotes from Github):</p>



  A given did method deserves its own working group (a different group would be better able to manage its own work)  I believe it is the case is that the WG must put forward a charter that will not be the subject of a Formal Objection again. (Avoiding Formal Objections is a political goal.)  It has been made abundantly clear by those who formally objected to the DID Specification v1.0 that in their view, a future charter that doesn’t include possible DID Methods will be rejected. (Avoiding rejection is a political goal.)  There is documented evidence that we were requested, or at least strongly encouraged (“should”), to include DID methods in the next charter. (Deferring to that suggestion in the face of dissent is a political choice.)  This does NOT say we&nbsp;will&nbsp;specify any DID methods. It does NOT say we will&nbsp;not&nbsp;specify anything to do with DID Resolution. It leaves the door open to either or both, which flexibility I and the (I believe, substantial) majority of the group …&nbsp;have talked about as both desirable and likely to be needed. (“Flexibility is desirable” is about retaining political authority, not a technical argument that such flexibility will improve the technology.)  There were formal objections and comments made to DID-CORE 1.0 expressing concerns around DID methods. but those objections were overruled with a comment that those concerns will be addressed in the future work. If recharter happens now, it would be appropriate to respect the above and mention DID methods in the charter. (Deference to prior objections is political, not technical.)  



<p>So there were both political and technical issues raised by various individuals. However, the question that the process requires the group consider is which proposal had the weakest technical objections. Let us look at the Github conversation on these three PRs.</p>



<p>The following table lists all of the group participants who commented on PRs #27, #29, and #30 (noting that we aren’t clear if the staff liaison should be counted as a participant with regard to consensus):</p>

<p>Summary</p>



&nbsp;#27#29#30Formal Objections Signaled300Comments in favor5+13.55Comments opposed52.52



<p>From this evaluation of the working group’s Github conversation, we see #30 has the weakest objections, followed by #29, with #27 having the strongest objections of all three proposals. This count includes both political and technical objections to make the strength of dissent even clearer. If we were to count only those objectors who cited technical arguments, the results would be even more favorable to PR#30.</p>



&nbsp;#27#29#30Formal Objections Signaled300Comments in favor5+13.55Technical Objections Raised510



<p>The decision making process led by the chairs did not “favor proposals that create the weakest objections”, a violation of W3C Process, Section 5.2.2 Managing Dissent <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a></p>



<p>I want to highlight a particular fact about these numbers. They represent a snapshot of a brief and incomplete conversation by the Working Group. One of the primary tenets of this appeal is that the chairs did not lead a discussion for the consideration and improvement of either of these alternative PRs. Once dissent was voiced, all conversation was effectively shut down. Instead, the working group should have further discussed the options represented by #29 and #30 and iterated on both to find the best single charter for the group to proceed. It is the failing to have this conversation—coupled with the expectation to blindly follow the directive of the chairs—that is the process violation at the heart of this appeal.</p>



<p>It is evident from comments in the discussion and in their final decision that any alternative to the chairs interpretation of the Director’s comments in responding to the DID Core Formal Objections, would be ignored. Quite simply, the chairs treated a suggestion from the Director as a mandate to override dissent instead of working together as a group to discover a better option.</p>



 Claims of “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant 



<p>In announcing their decision to continue to override dissent (in the merging of #27) @brentzundel said:</p>



<blockquote><p>@brentzundel: The DID WG chairs have met. We have concluded that merging PR #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the DID Working Group participants over the past year.</p> 2023/03/15 <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464">https://github.com/w3c/did-wg-charter/pull/27#issuecomment-1470920464</a> </blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, the chairs do not cite the basis of their assertion that #27 will produce a charter that best represents the consensus of the group. We have shown in this appeal that the discussion on Github does not justify such a conclusion.</p>



<p>Brent continues:</p>



<blockquote><p>The inclusion of DID Methods in the next chartered DID WG was part of the W3C Director’s decision to overturn the Formal Objections raised against the publication of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0. The chairs feel that that decision represents the consensus of the W3C and as such the inclusion of DID Methods as optional work in this charter is absolutely necessary.</p></blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not the chairs’ role to determine the consensus of the W3C, nor is it stated anywhere in the Process that chairs MUST defer to suggestions the Director made in response to previous Formal Objections to a different work product. In fact, as clarified by Phillippe Le Hégaret in regard to the Director’s response to those prior objections (in personal email):</p>



<blockquote><p>The “should” is NOT a “must”, otherwise it would say so explicitly in the Director’s decision. In other words, the Working Group is allowed to disagree with the direction set by the Director.</p> Phillippe Le Hégaret, personal email, 2023/03/23 </blockquote>



<p>The chairs interpretation of the Director’s response as a mandate is contrary to W3C Process. There is no requirement from the Director in this matter. The chairs incorrectly claim that there is, stating that a W3C Consensus exists that somehow overrides the group’s independent authority. They have used this claim as the fundamental justification for overriding dissent.</p>



<p>The claim of a W3C Consensus is erroneous because the W3C as a whole never had an opportunity to voice their position on the claimed consensus. The response from the Director was a statement resolving an immediate set of objections, stating his suggestion for future work. It was not a statement of W3C consensus requiring the DID WG to charter a new DID WG with methods in scope.</p>



<p>The claim of W3C Consensus is out of scope because the Chairs do not have the authority to assess consensus and speak on behalf of the W3C.</p>



<p>The claim of W3C Consensus is irrelevant because the statement by the chairs is justifying an action by the Chairs regarding an output of the WG. It is not about an action of the W3C.</p>



<p>Even if the W3C as a whole did, in fact, have some sort of consensus on this topic, that alone would not restrict the group from having a different consensus. Of course, a working group may reach a different consensus than the W3C as a whole—after all there are two different groups of participants with different opinions, perspectives, and decision making processes. As such, the consensus of the W3C as a whole is necessarily NOT the same as the consensus of the Working Group. Claims of W3C consensus by the chairs is not only outside their remit, such a “W3C Consensus” should not be taken to require that the WG reach the same conclusion.</p>



<p>Claiming anything about a supposed “W3C consensus” that restricts the actions of the WG is erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant.</p>



 This sets a untenable precedent 



<p>The W3C is at a crossroads. Built on trust in the benevolence of Sir Tim Berners Lee, the organization is wrestling with adjusting the process and governance bodies away from a strict dependence on the Director to make major decisions. I appreciate the challenge the organization is facing is like changing the engines on an aircraft in flight. It’s hard. We are in uncharted territory as the organization explores improvements to the Process to deal with this inevitable transition. However, confirming deference to staff as justification for the disregard of legitimate dissent is both inconsistent with the tradition and culture of the W3C and incompatible with an organization whose premise relies on technical cooperation and collaboration. From the W3C mission statement <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">https://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission</a>:</p>



<p>Our Identity “We are an open forum where diverse voices from around the world and industries come together, incubate and build consensus for global standards for web technologies.”</p>



<p>Our Strategic Goals</p>



  Improve efforts on new technology incubation, making it more structured and improving consensus-building among key stake holders.  Achieve worldwide participation, diversity and inclusion, establishing W3C as representative of the worldwide community.  Further improve the environment for facilitating balance, equity and cooperation among the participants from different industries, user groups and organizational sizes.  Increase involvement of under-represented key stakeholders such as end users, content creators, developers etc.  



<p>Emphasis mine.</p>



<p>It is our opinion that if the W3C chooses to interpret staff suggestions as mandates that override working group consensus it will fail to achieve the explicit goals of the organization’s mission.</p>



<p>Shutting down conversation and ignoring dissent does not</p>



  provide an open forum.  improve consensus building.  achieve participation, diversity and inclusion.  facilitate balance, equity and cooperation among participants.  increase involvement of under-represented key stakeholders.  



<p>From the W3C Process Document</p>



<blockquote><p>W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies. To accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the development of high-quality standards based on the consensus of the Membership, Team, and public. W3C processes promote fairness, responsiveness, and progress: all facets of the W3C mission.</p><p>The W3C Process promotes the goals of quality and fairness in technical decisions by encouraging consensus, soliciting reviews (by both Members and public), incorporating implementation and interoperability experience, and requiring Membership-wide approval as part of the technical report development process.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102</a></blockquote>



<p>The W3C Process Document lays out the principles and the practices that enable the W3C to legitimately develop standards based on the consensus of its contributors.</p>



<p>If the Director confirms the Chair decision to ignore dissent on this matter, it will set the precedent that Working Group chairs are free to ignore the W3C process should their own opinion coincide with a suggestion from staff. This will transform the organization into a politically driven autocracy that lacks the moral authority of legitimate consensus.</p>



<p>Instead of assisting the W3C in its transition away from a top-down autocratic governance based on the moral authority of Sir Tim Berners Lee to something more meritocratic, confirming the Chairs decision would establish that decisions at the W3C flow from staff down and not from the collaborative, technical discourse of its members.</p>



 Proposals with the weakest objections should be favored 



<p>The process document states:</p>



<blockquote><p>Groups should favor proposals that create the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a few people.</p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent">https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#managing-dissent</a></blockquote>



<p>By this metric, PR#29 or #30 should have prevailed. If you exclude the staff liaison from the tally, you have an equal measure of preference and opposition to #27, including 3 intentions to formally object, plus my express intention to fight this decision with every lawful and ethical means at my disposal to oppose the inclusion of DID methods in the DID WG charter.</p>



<p>PR#27 didn’t even get support by a majority of the group and it absolutely caused strong objections from several of us. Even if you include @pchampin’s position, we barely have a majority in support of #27 with strong objections against. A bare majority and several strong objections from a few people does not meet the standard of Process.</p>



<p>Although I read the Chairs statement several times, I do not see how they could legitimately argue that the favored proposal has the weakest objections from participants in the working group.</p>



 Summary 



<p>I am asking the Director to reconsider and overturn the DID WG chairs decision to ignore dissent and force DID methods to be in scope for the next WG charter proposed by the Working Group.</p>



<p>Since the chairs are claiming a mandate from the Director as the justification for their decision, I am directly asking the Director if what is happening is, in fact, what the Director required.</p>



<p>I have shown that the chairs, in this case, have failed to pursue all available means to find the proposal with the weakest objections. They have instead imposed their own political agenda over considerable technically-grounded dissent.</p>



<p>To recap:</p>



  The Chair decision in question lacks consensus.  Consensus was not legitimately sought, contrary to W3C Process.  Chairs claims of an overriding “W3C Consensus” are erroneous, out of scope, and irrelevant.  Deferring to staff sets an untenable precedent for a group that prides itself on diversity and consensus-based decision making.  The proposal with the weakest objections should be favored.  



<p>I hope that the Director will appreciate these arguments and provide guidance that will remove this unfortunate notion that a Working Group’s chairs must defer to mere suggestions by staff. All Working Groups deserve the ability to manage their own work and find their own consensus without imposition from staff.</p>



<p>In particular, I’d like to see the following remedy from the Director:</p>



  Clarification: does the Director’s response to the Formal Objections to DID Core 1.0 constitute a direct requirement that the Working Group MUST explicitly charter a subsequent DID WG with DID Methods in scope?  Clarification: does the Director’s response to the Formal Objections to DID Core 1.0 constitute a direct requirement that the Working Group MUST NOT charter a DID Resolution WG instead of a DID WG?  Clarification: What is the role of technical versus political objections when seeking consensus, especially what constitutes a technical objection?  Clarification: What are the requirements of the chairs to seek proposals with the weakest objections?  Direction for the DID WG chairs to facilitate a conversation to find better alternatives to including DID methods in the next WG charter, specifically to advance either a true maintenance mode DID WG charter (without license for new specifications) or advance a DID Resolution WG charter instead (focusing new specifications on resolution).  



<p>When I got involved with this work, I shared many of my colleagues’ concerns about whether or not the W3C has the cultural and institutional wherewithal to stand as a steward for decentralized technologies. Given the organization’s history with many of the largest companies in the world, significant concerns have been voiced about whether or not the keeper of the Web can handle innovations that challenge the corporate dominance of web standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Verifiable Credentials specification was approved as a Recommendation, many of us were hopeful. Then, the DID Core specification took an unprecedented fight before it eventually became a W3C Recommendation. The fight was disheartening, but the ultimate approval gave us cautious hope.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with @BrentZundel’s unwavering demand that the WG advance a charter that overrides consensus to placate a suggestion from staff, I am again given cause to wonder if the W3C is capable of advancing collaborative work based on true consensus rather than political deference. This appeal puts that notion to the test. It is my sincere hope that the W3C will prove true to its mission and its process and recognize the unfortunate error of the chairs, restoring consensus to the heart of our collective work.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to apologize again to the chairs, Brent Zundel and Dan Burnett, as I have already done personally and in our related Github discussion. Both Brent and Dan are great guys, two of the nicest people you’ll meet in standards development. I consider both of them friends and I’m deeply saddened that this matter has become a public conflict with its inevitable consequences for all of us.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I find myself in an existential disagreement with a decision they have made collectively in their role as chairs of the WG. As outlined above, I believe the path the chairs have chosen fundamentally undermines the work to which I have dedicated my professional life.</p>



<p>It’s not just that this is an unfortunate decision. It is a decision that I am compelled to oppose with all of the lawful and ethical means at my disposal. This opposition is not personal. I know Brent and Dan are doing their best. Unfortunately, in this case, I find their best falls short of the requirements of their role. I sincerely wish the path to resolve this matter didn’t take us to a nasty public fight. I made eighteen separate comments on the PRs in question trying to convince the chairs of the merit of my argument before escalating. I tried. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to resolve this without calling for intervention.</p>



<p>Thank you for your time and attention. I know this is a lot of material to digest and I appreciate the effort that everyone has made to advance this conversation in a civil and professional manner.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>-j</p>

My original Mastodon account was on <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>. I chose it because it’s the largest instance, it’s operated by the developers of the service, and it runs the reference implementation of the software. I wanted to experience the fediverse, initially, as most people do, then consider whether to migrate to another server — and if so, to which one.</p>
<p>
Last week I migrated to <a href="https://social.coop">social.coop</a> which, like <a href="https://cosocial.ca">cosocial.ca</a>, it what <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/">Darius Kazemi</a> calls a <a href="https://elk.zone/social.coop/@darius@friend.camp/110147686846784173">community-owned independent social media site</a>. I don’t think the acronym COISMS will fly, but the business model is just what I’ve been looking for. I don’t want to use  “free” services that make me the product they sell. I want to pay for a service that’s funded by my dollars, not by my data. That’s why I bailed on Gmail years ago, in favor of Fastmail, and it’s why I’m happy to spend $10/month — the price of a couple of cappucinos — to support the people who keep the lights on at social.coop and maintain civility.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">instructions</a> for migrating from one server offer two paths: Profile redirect and Profile move. I chose the former, because I assumed I would retain API access to mastodon.social post-migration, and thus have the option to use Steampipe to query both accounts. Why do that? You can’t migrate your posts from the old server to the new one, only your followers and (optionally) your follows, bookmarks, blocks, and mutes. Steampipe can connect to two different Mastodon servers at the same time, so I figured I could run queries against both.</p>
 Lessons learned 
<p>
That turned out to be a wrong assumption. I can reactivate my mastodon.social account by turning off the redirection, but I’m vague on the implications of doing that. Meanwhile it’s still possible to export my posts, so I can always reacquire them that way if needed. </p>
<p>
Here was another wrong assumption. I think that if I’d chosen to move my account, instead of redirect it, my profile would have transferred to the new server. Instead it was on me to fill out the new profile. I’d created @judell@social.coop but, when I kicked off the migration, I hadn’t yet completed the profile. So when followers were notified that judell@social.coop was now following them, there was no picture or bio or verified website. That led some people to think it was a bogus account and block it. It wasn’t a catastrophe, and I’ve spoken with a few of them to resolve the matter, but it was an unforced error that would have been easy to avoid.</p>
 The view from here 
<p>
Here’s a comparison of weekly activity on two servers, by way of the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/server.sp">server dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.net/images/mastodon-social-vs-social-coop-weekly-activity.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
What’s it like moving to a server with only 1% of the flow that happens on mastodon.social? Not too different! Because I’ve moved my followers and follows, and because I interact primarily with the home timeline and with lists, the experience is mostly the same. For example, here’s the graph of <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/blob/main/boosts_federated.sp">boost relationships</a> among servers in my home timeline. It looks just like it did before.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.net/images/server-neighborhoods-from-social-coop"></a></p>
<p>
It’s wonderful to have a portable social graph that you can bring along as you move around in the fediverse. The key differences are that I’m meeting new people, and spending more time on the local timeline. On a big server like mastodon.social the local timeline feels like the Twitter firehose, for those who remember when that was still a thing you could watch. I’d look at it occasionally, because it could be a source of useful serendipity, but mostly it was just too random. The local timeline on social.coop is still somewhat random, but I find it more useful — not only because it represents a far smaller population but also because the people who’ve signed up share a common interest in the coop model. </p>
 I want my lists 
<p>
There was, however, one big obstacle. You can export lists from the old server and import them into the new server, but there’s no export/import for the accounts you’ve assigned to those lists. Since I <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">rely heavily on lists</a> to navigate Mastodon flow in a focused and intentional way, this was a problem I really needed to fix. I tried Eliot Nash’s <a href="https://github.com/fadookie/masto-list-importer">masto-list-importer</a> but when I tried to transfer my 460 person/list mappings I hit API rate limits. So instead I worked out a Steampipe-based solution which is a useful alternative, and also a good way to illustrate the steps involved.</p>
<p>
Let’s assume that I want to migrate again, from social.coop to fosstodon.org. I’ve exported the names of my lists from social.coop, and imported them to fosstodon.org. Now I need to populate those lists. The SQL solution I came up with proceeds by steps, each being a common table expression (CTE) that accomplishes one part of a complex transformation, then passes results to the next step. </p>
<p>
Step 1: Gather the accounts assigned to each social.coop list.</p>
<p>
We start by joining two tables to enumerate accounts assigned to each list.</p>
   with accounts_by_list as (
  select 
    a.acct as old_account,
    a.id as old_account_id,
    l.id as old_list_id,
    l.title as title
  from
    social_coop.mastodon_my_list l
  join
     social_coop.mastodon_list_account a
  on
    l.id = a.list_id
)
select * from accounts_by_list
 
<p>
The output, in accounts_by_list, is effectively a temporary table that you can review to make sure the results are as expected. The ability to verify the output of each phase of a CTE pipeline, before sending it to the next phase, is a key advantage of this approach. Nested subqueries are much harder to debug!</p>
<p>
Step 2: Map the accounts on social.coop to accounts on fosstodon.org</p>
<p>
Two transformations happen in this phase. If an account is a bare username, say personA, then it’s a social.coop account. On fosstodon.org that same account will be represented as personA@social.coop. Conversely if personB@fosstodon.org exists on social.coop, that account becomes the bare username personB there. All other accounts (e.g. personC@hachyderm.io pass through unchanged.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  select
    old_account,
    old_account_id,
    old_list_id,
    title,
    case 
      when old_account !~ '@' then old_account || '@social.coop' 
      when old_account ~ '@fosstodon.org' then replace(old_account, '@fosstodon.org', '')
      else old_account
    end as new_account
  from
     accounts_by_list
)
select * from adjusted_accounts_by_list
 
<p>
Step 3: Map the list titles to the new server.</p>
<p>
The names of the lists are the same in both places, but their ids differ. For example, my Fediverse list is 1043 on social.coop and 6771. To invoke the API call that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/lists/#accounts-add">adds someone to a list</a>, we’ll need to use the latter id.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  select
    a.*,
    l.id as new_list_id
  from
    adjusted_accounts_by_list a
  join
    fosstodon.mastodon_my_list l
  on
    a.title = l.title
)
select * from adjusted_list_ids
 
<p>
Step 4: Map the account ids to the new server.</p>
<p>
Like lists, accounts on the new server also have different ids, and those are also required for the API call. We can find the new ids by joining the new_account column from step one with the table fosstodon.mastodon_my_following.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  -- as above
,
),
adjusted_account_ids as (
  select 
    a.*,
    f.id as new_account_id
  from
    adjusted_list_ids a
  join
    fosstodon.mastodon_my_following f
  on
    f.acct = a.new_account
)
select * from adjusted_account_ids
 
<p>
Step 5: Build the API calls</p>
<p>
There are lots of ways to skin this cat. Because you can use Steampipe <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">as a component</a>, you could use any programming language with a Postgres driver to run this query, and call the Mastodon API with the appropriate list and account ids.</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there’s always curl.</p>
 with accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_accounts_by_list as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_list_ids as (
  -- as above
),
adjusted_account_ids as (
  -- as above
)
select
  'curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/' ||
  new_list_id ||
  '/accounts/?' ||
  'account_ids[]=' ||
  new_account_id ||
  '; sleep 1;' as command
 
<p>
To avoid throttling, I appended sleep 1 to each line. I saved the query in migrate-lists.sql, and exported the output to a file.</p>
 steampipe query --output csv migrate-lists.sql &gt; migrate.sh
 
<p>
That was close, but not quite right. The output looked like this:</p>
 command
"curl -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer ***"" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/6771/accounts/?account_ids[]=279462; sleep 1;"
"curl -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer ***"" https://fosstodon.org/api/v1/lists/6771/accounts/?account_ids[]=109283421559929728; sleep 1;"
 
<p>
I need to remove the header line, remove the double quotes on either end of each line, and deduplicate the pairs of double quotes. For that I turned to ChatGPT (v4). It took a few tries to get it right, but soon enough it produced a working bash script that I’m very glad I did not have to write.</p>
 #!/bin/bash

# read the original script from migrate.sh and store it in an array
readarray -t original_script &lt; migrate.sh

# remove the first line of the original script
modified_script=("${original_script[@]:1}")

# loop through the modified script array and replace double double-quotes with a single double-quote and remove double quotes at the beginning and end of each line
for (( i=0; i&lt;${#modified_script[@]}; i++ )); do
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/""/"/g' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/^"//' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
    modified_script[$i]=$(sed 's/"$//' &lt;&lt;&lt; "${modified_script[$i]}")
done

# print out the modified script with newlines
printf '%s\n' "${modified_script[@]}"
 
<p>
And that did the trick. With my lists now fully populated on social.coop, I'm now reading Mastodon from my new home server in the same list-oriented way as I was on the old one. </p>
<p>
If you move servers and want to migrate the people on your lists, you should definitely try <a href="https://www.eliotlash.com/masto-list-importer/">masto-list-importer</a> first, and consider the method here as fallback if that doesn't work for you. I agree with Eliot Nash that list transfer ought to be baked into the Mastodon UI. People rightly complain that it can be hard to find the people you want to follow and topics you want to explore. You can follow hashtags but that can be too random. Assigning people to topical lists strikes a good balance. But only if those list assignments are portable!</p>

<p>Some of the following is excerpted from my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a> from O'Reilly Media.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01c94532-ab60-4f7f-a7bb-8dcd45f5ca65_502x644.png">    </a> <p>OAuth was invented for a very specific purpose: to allow people to control access to resources associated with their accounts, without requiring that they share authentication factors. A primary use case for OAuth is accessing data in an account using an API. For example, the <a href="https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/">Receiptify service</a> creates a list of your recent listening history on Spotify, Last.fm, or Apple Music that looks like a shopping receipt. Here's a sample receipt of some of my listening history.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa4c2b8fd-a1e1-458b-92b5-40960c62ef92_272x722.png">    </a>Receiptify Listening History <p>Before OAuth, if Alice (the resource owner) wanted Receiptify (the client) to have access to her history on Spotify (the resource server), she'd give Receiptify her username and password on Spotify. Receiptify would store the username and password and impersonate Alice each time it needs to access Spotify on her behalf. By using Alice's username and password, Receiptify would demonstrate that it had Alice's implicit permission to access her data on Spotify. This is sometimes called the "password antipattern" and it has several serious drawbacks:</p>  <p>The resource server can't differentiate between the user and other servers accessing the API.</p>  <p>Storing passwords on other servers increases the risk of a security breach.</p>  <p>Granular permissions are hard to support since the resource server doesn't know who is logging in.</p>  <p>Passwords are difficult to revoke and must be updated in multiple places when changed.</p>  <p>OAuth was designed to fix these problems by making the resource server part of the flow that delegates access. This design lets the resource server ask the resource owner what permissions to grant and records them for the specific client requesting access. Moreover, the client can be given its own credential, apart from those that the resource owner has or those used by other clients the user might have authorized.</p> OAuth Scopes <p>The page that allows the owner to grant or deny permission might display what permissions the RS is requesting. This isn't freeform text written by a UX designer; rather, it's controlled by scopes. A scope is a bundle of permissions that the client asks for when requesting the token, coded by the developer who wrote the client.</p><p>The following screenshots show the permissions screens that I, as the owner of my Twitter account, see for two different applications, Revue and Thread Reader.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff580db76-f7a9-495e-a8a5-dc322c8c717b_1105x686.png">    </a>OAuth Scopes Displayed in the Permission Screen <p>There are several things to note about these authorization screens. First, Twitter is presenting these screens, not the clients (note the URL in the browser window). Second, the two client applications are asking for quite different scopes. Revue wants permission to update my profile as well as post and delete tweets, while Thread Reader is only asking for read-only access to my account. Finally, Twitter is making it clear to me who is requesting access. At the bottom of the page, Twitter warns me to be careful and to check the permissions that the client is asking for.</p> Fine-Grained Permissions <p>Scopes were designed so that the service offering an API could define the relatively course-grained permissions needed to access it. So, Twitter, for example, has scopes like <code>tweet.read</code> and <code>tweet:write</code>. As shown above, when a service wants to use the API for my Twitter account, it has to ask for specific scopes—if it only wants to read my tweets, it would ask for <code>tweet:read</code>. Once granted, they can be used with the API endpoint to gain access.</p><p>But OAuth-style scopes aren't the best tool for fine-grained permissioning in applications. To see why, imagine you are building a photo sharing app that allows a photographer like Alice to grant her friends Betty and Charlie permission to view her vacation photos. Unlike the Twitter API, where the resources are fairly static (users and tweets, for example) and you're granting permissions to a fairly small number of applications on an infrequent basis, the photo sharing app has an indeterminant number of resources that change frequently. Consequently, the app would need to have many scopes and update them each time a user grants new permissions on a photo album to some other user. A large photo sharing service might have a million users and 50 million photo albums—that's a lot of potential scopes.</p><p>Policy-based Access Control (PBAC) systems, on the other hand, were built for this kind of permissioning. As I wrote in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2023/03/not_all_pbac_is_abac_access_management_patterns.shtml">Not all PBAC is ABAC</a>, your app design and how you choose to express policies make a big difference in the number of policies you need to write. But regardless, PBAC systems, with good policy stores, can manage policies and the information needed to build the authorization context much more easily than you'll usually find in an OAuth-based system.</p><p>So, if you're looking to allow client applications to access your API on behalf of your customers, then OAuth is the right tool. But if you're building an application that allows sharing between its users of whatever resources they build, then you need the fine-grained permissioning that a policy-based access control system provides.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Her name is Mary Johnson. Born in 1917, the year the U.S. entered WWI, two years before women in the same country got the right to vote, she died in 1944, not long before the end of WWII. She was buried, unembalmed, in the cemetery of a Chicago church that was later abandoned. Her grave was unmarked. To make room for new commercial development in 2023, the church was razed and occupants of the cemetery were respectfully and quietly disinterred, and moved to a working cemetery elsewhere in town. In the midst, efforts were made by the coroner’s office to discover the identities of the bodies from unmarked graves before they were to be reburied. Mary’s was among them.</p>
<p>The difference with Mary was that her body appeared to be unchanged: a bit dusty under bits of casket lining, with light flecks on her dark skin. Except for that, she looked like she had died yesterday. When they removed her body from the casket in the hospital morgue where she was taken for DNA sampling, she was still flexible. I asked the pathologist what would account for her perfect state of preservation. The pathologist said she had no idea. Even the best embalming jobs age in the ground.</p>
<p>When the pathologist was out of the room, I reached to lift one of Mary’s eyelids. Before my fingers touched, both lids opened, slightly. I called out, “Come here! Come here!” Nobody came. Then both eyes opened. Her body shook as she tried to breathe.</p>
<p>“Code Blue! I yelled.</p>
<p>She was alive. Somehow, alive. After what, eighty years? At the time we didn’t know.</p>
<p>I was ready to do CPR when she started breathing and&nbsp;tried to sit up. “Hang on,” I said. Let me help.” As I did, she was becoming warm. She stood up and looked around.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. It was 5:15 AM. The dream was too interesting for me to completely awaken, so I dropped back in. As a half-conscious dreamer, I often do that. For the next hour, I followed several different story threads. Each visited what happened in the eighty years of Mary’s suspended life. The Cold War. israel. Civil rights. Rock &amp; Roll. Space travel. Disco. Hip hop. Rap. Digital everything. One of her questions: “What’s television?”</p>
<p>I thought about the backstory of her own short life: a child in the twenties, a teen during the Depression, a young adult during The War. What interesting stuff happened in those years? Was she in love, maybe with a guy who went off to fight? What work did she do?</p>
<p>I thought about the science questions. How was it possible for someone to lay undead for so long? Who else in that cemetery, or any cemetery, might still be alive? Was she a one-of-one, a one-of-some, or a one-of-many? Though not a horror story, it did recall Poe’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/e/TTuAmABtYlVZi4QlErQKMTqA/QQEIMGPU7h2UYwG1pBpg2iKC">The Premeture Burial</a>, in which the protagonist’s undead state was “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalepsy">catalepsy</a>.” I imagined in this thread that the story might be one&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton">Michael Chrichton</a> would like to write, if he was still alive.</p>
<p>Dreams have no more detail than one gives them, and being a white guy from New Jersey, born after Mary went cataleptic, I didn’t have much to furnish any storyline about Mary’s life, past or present. But I could still think of questions to address. What perspective and wisdom could Mary bring to our time? How would she cope with finding nearly all the people and things she knew were now dead and gone? What would she marvel at, and what would appall her? What would she be, or mean, to the rest of us?</p>
<p>No surprise that I would dream of a resurrection on Easter morning, even though that wasn’t in my head at the time. So, might Mary (not hard to guess from what corner of my unconscious that one came from) be a Jesus for our time? Hmm.</p>
<p>At 6:15, I finally had to get up and do my business, and the dream ended there. Still, “This has to be a book,” I told myself. But I have other books to write, ones that have sat half-written for years. And writing fiction isn’t my thing. So I decided I’d blog it instead. And here we are.</p>
<p>She is alive now, on this page, and in your mind. All she needs is for someone to finish her story.</p>
 
<p>The image above is courtesy of <a href="https://labs.openai.com/">DALL-E,</a> the artificially creative image generator. Took four tries to get this one. Since DALL-E seems to know only how to make grotesque faces, I made sure the woman here is looking away.</p>

<p>Your feedback – and help making it so – very much appreciated!</p>
 
 Standards maintenance work on the core specifications 
 Fixes to the the core spec 
 
 According to reports, ActivityPub as-is is incompatible with common shared hosting environments
(e.g. typical WordPress host), as it requires HTTP content negotiation. 
 Issues backlog 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Reduce protocol chattiness 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Decide on the future of ActivityPub Client-to-Server 
 
 Split the C2S spec from the S2S spec? 
 Standardize the Mastodon API instead? 
 Invest in convincing developers to implement it? 
 
 Significant extensions of the core specifications with a view on standardizing them 
 Improved security and privacy 
 
 Signed content 
 Private messages 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 Profiles 
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 Other profiles for specific use cases 
 
 E.g. propagation of event / calendar invites / RSVPs 
 
 Documentation and test 
 A test suite for the minimal profile 
 
 suitable to add to automated test suites 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 Documented behavior of leading ActivityPub implementations 
 
 What subset of the spec does each implement 
 What extensions does it implement, and which are required 
 Document the “folk wisdom” how to interact with a given implementation, so not every
new developer has to learn everything from scratch 
 Get out of “trial and error mode” when attempting to interoperate with another ActivityPub implementation 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 JSON-LD conformance 
 
 Tests to make sure implementations are JSON-LD conformant 
 
 Libraries in the major languages 
 
 Full stack, not just ActivityPub 
 
 User expectations and usability across the Fediverse 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 Best practices for content propagation 
 
 E.g. resolve the “It has 5 likes here but 10 over there” issue and related. 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
 Attract more participants 
 
 Get major implementors involved (e.g. Mastodon) 
 Make the place where technical work is done welcome and the work pleasant

Which people and which servers are powerful connectors? How do moderation policies work? What’s it like to join a small server versus a large one? These are important questions, and you can use the plugin to begin to answer them. But I soon realized that as a newcomer to a scene that’s been evolving for six years, and has not welcomed such analysis, I should start by looking for ways to enhance the experience of reading Mastodon. So I began building a set of <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboards</a> that augment the stock Mastodon client or (my preference) <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. And I’ve narrated that project in a series of posts.</p>
<p>
Last week we released the plugin to <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon">the Steampipe hub</a>. If you’ve <a href="https://steampipe.io/downloads">installed Steampipe</a>, you can now get the plugin using steampipe plugin install mastodon. The next phases of this project will explore using the plugin and dashboards in <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">Steampipe Cloud</a>, and speeding up the dashboards by means of persistent Postgres tables and Steampipe Cloud snapshots. Meanwhile, here’s a recap of what I’ve learned thus far.</p>
 See more with less distraction 
<p>
While the dashboards use charts and relationship graphs, they are mainly tables of query results. Because Steampipe dashboards don’t (yet) render HTML, these views display plain text only — no images, no styled text. I’ve embraced this constraint, and I find it valuable in two ways. First, I’m able to scan many more posts at a glance than is possible in conventional clients, and more effectively choose which to engage with. When I described this effect to a friend he said: “It’s a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684669/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon.html">Bloomberg terminal</a> for Mastodon!” As those of us who rode the first wave of the blogosphere will recall, RSS readers were a revelation for the same reason.</p>
<p>
Second, I find that the absence of images and styled text has a <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686515/images-considered-harmful-sometimes.html">calming effect</a>. To maintain a healthy information diet you need to choose sources wisely but, no matter where you go, sites deploy a barrage of attention-grabbing devices. I find dialing down the noise helpful, for the same reason that I often switch my phone to monochrome mode. Attention is our scarcest resource; the fewer distractions, the better.</p>
<p>
There’s a tradeoff, of course; sometimes an image is the entire point of a post. So while I often read Mastodon using these Steampipe dashboards, I also use Elk directly. The Steampipe dashboards work alongside conventional Mastodon clients, and indeed depend on them: I click through from the dashboards to Elk in order to boost, reply, or view images. That experience is enhanced by <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686115/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls.html">instance-qualified URLS</a> that translate foreign URLs to ones that work on your home server.</p>
 Manage people and lists 
<p>
The ability to assign people to lists, and read in a list-oriented way, is a handy Twitter affordance that I never used much because it was easy to let the algorithms govern my information diet. Because Mastodon doesn’t work like that, lists have become the primary way I read the fediverse flow. Of the 800+ people I follow so far, I’ve assigned more than half to lists with titles like *Climate* and *Energy* and *Software*. To help me do that, several dashboards report how many of the people I follow are assigned to lists (or not).</p>
<p>
I want as many people on lists as possible. So I periodically review the people I follow, put unassigned people on lists, and track the ratio of people who are, or aren’t, on lists. Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_list_account#count-how-many-of-the-accounts-i-follow-are-assigned-and-not-assigned-to-lists">query</a> for that.</p>
 with list_account as (
  select
    a.id,
    l.title as list
  from
    mastodon_my_list l
    join mastodon_list_account a on l.id = a.list_id
),
list_account_follows as (
  select
    list
  from
    mastodon_my_following
    left join list_account using (id)
)
select 'follows listed' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is not null
union
select 'follows unlisted' as label, count(*) from list_account_follows where list is null
 
<p>
When you read in a list-oriented away, as is also true when you read by following hashtags, there are always people whose chattiness becomes a distraction. To control that I’ve implemented the following rule: show at most one original toot per person per list per day. Will I miss some things this way? Sure! But if you’ve said something that resonates with other people, I’m likely to hear about it from someone else. It’s a tradeoff that’s working well for me so far.</p>
<p>
Here’s the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/mastodon/tables/mastodon_toot_list#get-recent-original-toots-on-a-lists-timeline-at-most-one-per-person-per-day">SQL implementation</a> of the rule.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    list_id,
    to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as day,
    case
      when display_name = '' then username
      else display_name
    end as person,
    instance_qualified_url as url,
    substring(content from 1 for 200) as toot
  from
    mastodon_toot_list
  where
    list_id = '42994'
    and reblog is null -- only original posts
    and in_reply_to_account_id is null -- only original posts
  limit
    40
)
select
  distinct on (person, day) -- only one per person per day
  day,
  person,
  toot,
  url
from
  data
order by
  day desc,
  person;
 
<p>
On the home timeline’s dashboard I’ve made it optional to include or hide boosts, which can be the majority of items. On the list-reading dashboard I’ve opted to always exclude them, but the SQL idiom for doing so — select distinct on (person, day) — is simple, easy to understand, and easy to change.</p>
 Visualize relationships 
<p>
I’ve so far found three ways in which <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">relationship graphs</a> can make Mastodon more legible. First, in <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3686528/mastodon-relationship-graphs.html">Mastodon relationship graphs</a>, I showed how to use SQL-defined <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">nodes</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edges</a> to show boost relationships among people and servers. In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3688937/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon.html">another article</a> I used the same tools to map relationships among people and tags. And <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3690268/visualizing-mastodon-server-moderation.html">most recently</a> I used them to explore server-to-server moderation. </p>
<p>
In all three cases the format conveys information not directly available from tabular views. Clusters of interesting people pop out, as do people who share tags. And when I graphed servers that block other servers I discovered an unexpected category: some servers that block others are themselves also blocked, like infosec.exchange in this example.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.jpg"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
The Steampipe combo of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">SQL-oriented API access</a> and <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards as code</a> is a uniquely productive way to build relationship graphs that can unlock insights in any domain. As we’ve seen with <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/k8s-insights">Kubernetes</a>, they can help make cloud infrastructure more legible. The Mastodon graphs suggest that the same can happen in the social networking realm. </p>
 Use RSS feeds 
<p>
When you append .rss to the URL of a Mastodon account, or tag, you produce an RSS feed like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss">https://mastodon.social/@judell.rss</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss">https://mastodon.social/tags/steampipe.rss</a>. These feeds provide a kind of auxiliary API that includes data not otherwise available from the primary API: related tags, which appear in the feeds as RSS category elements. Steampipe really shines here thanks to the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">RSS plugin</a> which enables joins with the primary Mastodon API. This query augments items in account’s feed with tags that appear in each item.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    name,
    url || '.rss' as feed_link
  from
    mastodon_search_hashtag
  where
    query = $1,
    and name = query
  limit 
)
select
  to_char(r.published, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as published,
  d.name as tag,
  (
    select string_agg(trim(JsonString::text, '"'), ', ')
    from jsonb_array_elements(r.categories) JsonString
  ) as categories,
  r.guid as link,
  ( select content as toot from mastodon_search_toot where query = r.guid ) as content
from
  data d
join
  rss_item r
on
  r.feed_link = d.feed_link
order by
  r.published desc
limit 10
 
<p>
A similar query drives the graph discussed in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/26/mapping-people-and-tags-on-mastodon/">Mapping people and tags on Mastodon</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://jonudell.info/images/tag-graph.png"><br>
  <br>
</a></p>
<p>
In that example, surfacing the connection between a user, @themarkup, and a pair of tags, scotus and section230, was useful in two ways. First, it helped me instantly spot the item that I most wanted to read, which was buried deep in the search results. Second, it helped me discover a source that I’ll return to for guidance on similar topics. Of course I added that source to my Law list!</p>
 Own the algorithm 
<p>
Everyone who comes to Mastodon appreciates not having an adversarial algorithm control what they see in their timelines. Most of us aren’t opposed to algorithmic influence per se, though, we just don’t like the adversarial nature of it. How can we build algorithms that work with us, not against us? We’ve already seen one example: the list-reading dashboard displays just one item per list per person per day. That’s a policy that I was able to define, and easily implement, with Steampipe. And in fact I adjusted it after using it for a while. The original policy was hourly, that was too chatty, so I switched to daily by making a trivial change to the SQL query. </p>
<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">News in the fediverse</a> I showed another example. The Mastodon server press.coop aggregates feeds from mainstream news sources. I was happy to have those feeds, but I didn’t want to see those news items mixed in with my home timeline. Rather, I wanted to assign them to a News list and read them only when I visit that list in a news-reading mindset. The fediverse offers an opportunity to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be possible — and even easy — for anyone to turn on a rule like *news only on lists, not timelines*. Steampipe can make it so.</p>
 Steampipe as component 
<p>
When you ask people on Mastodon about these kinds of features, the response is often “Have you tried client X? It offers feature Y.” But that solution doesn’t scale. It would require massive duplication of effort for every client to implement every such policy; meanwhile, people don’t want to switch to client X just for feature Y (which might entail losing feature Z). Could policies be encapsulated and made available to any Mastodon client? It’s interesting to think about Steampipe as a <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a> that delivers that encapsulation. A timeline built by SQL queries, and governed by SQL-defined policies, is a resource available to any app that can connect to Postgres, either locally or in Steampipe Cloud. </p>
<p>
If you’re curious about the Steampipe + Mastodon combo, install the <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a>, try out the sample queries, then clone the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">mod</a> and check out the dashboards. Do they usefully augment your Mastodon reader? What would improve them? Can you use these ingredients to invent your own customized Mastodon experience?

<p>最初は「OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始」とのタイトルの記事でしたが、今後色々と動きがありそうなので、このエントリにまとめて追記していくことにします。ですので、随時時間付きでアップデートしていきます。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 13:49</p>



 OpenAI, ChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始 



<p>先日の命令<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5254" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot; data-type=&quot;URL&quot; data-id=&quot;https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/&quot;>「伊プライバシー当局、ChatGPTにイタリアのユーザの情報の取扱いの即時制限を命令」</a>">1</a>）をうけて、欧州で月曜日がスタートする前に、OpenAI社はChatGPTへのイタリアからのアクセスをブロック開始<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5254" title="Gigazine: OpenAIがイタリアからのChatGPTへのアクセスをブロック &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/&quot;>https://gigazine.net/news/20230403-openai-geoblocks-chatgpt-italy/</a>&amp;gt;">2</a>したようです。</p>



<p>感想：そりゃそうですよねぇ。事実は明らかであり、命令に従わないと、EU Rep が３ヶ月間以上の禁錮ですから。</p>



 イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言 



<p>イタリアの大臣が「ChatGPTへのBanは過剰である」との発言もしたようです<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5254" title="Reuiter:&amp;#8221;Italian minister says country&amp;#8217;s ban on ChatGPT is excessive&amp;#8221; &amp;lt;<a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/&quot;>https://www.reuters.com/technology/italian-minister-says-countrys-ban-chatgpt-is-excessive-2023-04-02/</a>&amp;gt;">3</a>。</p>



<p>感想：大臣が何か言ったからと言って態度を変えると独立性を問われるので、それはそれで個人情報保護当局としてはムズい展開ではありますね。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-03 16:30</p>



 ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕 



<p>ChatGPTへのブロックが始まったことを受けて、それを迂回する PizzaGPTというものが出てきたようです。</p>



 
 <a href="https://softantenna.com/blog/pizzagpt/">ChatGPTが禁止されたイタリア向けに「PizzaGPT」が爆誕</a> 



 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35405760">PizzaGPT – ChatGPT clone accessible from Italy</a> 
 



<p>「Nuxt 3、Tailwind、DaisyUIを使用し、OpenAI completions APIのラッパー/チャットインターフェイスを実装したもの」とのことです。</p>



<p>感想：これでは残念ながら抜け穴にしかなってないようにおもわれます。アクセスが増えるのをさばくためにPizza１枚分のお金を寄付してほしいということのようですが、まぁ、OpenAIが年齢認証やデータ利用オプトアウトをメインの動線に入れるなど、今回指示されたことを実装するまでのつなぎだけをやる一時的システムだからそれで、ということかもしれません。独自に年齢認証やります、自動でデータ利用オプトアウトします、というのなら面白いですけどね。もちろんそれだけでは、トレーニングデータにイタリア人のデータが含まれていた問題は解決しないわけですが、少なくとも新規の学習はされなくなるなどの効果があり、多分そのあたりがGarante<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5254/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5254" title="イタリアの個人情報保護当局">4</a>とOpenAI社の落とし所になるんじゃないかなぁとは思うのですが（←単なる個人の感想です）。</p>



 



<p>2023-04-05 22:23</p>

<p>感想：まぁ、イタリアの命令がGDPRにもとづいてであったので、同様の命令が他のEU加盟国から出なかったらむしろ驚きですよね。</p>

<p>While discussing ChatGPT with my teenage grandkids, I put it to a number of tests. In one I asked it to write a poem that includes all the capital cities in the U.S. Here is its reply:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<blockquote><p>From sea to shining sea, Across this land so grand, The capitals of every state, Await us to take a stand.</p>

 Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse. 
 I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown

<p>Since Elon’s acquisition of Twitter, the “Fediverse” has become a thing. A thing that
many people talk about, often in nebolous terms. I think we need to be more precise,
and to do that, it might be helpful to distinguish several parts of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>I believe the primary components of the Fediverse are the following, best shown
as a layered architecture:</p>
 
 
  
   
    <p>People</p><p>
    </p><p>You and me; sometimes companies</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Apps</p>
    <p>e.g. Mastodon, PeerTube</p>
   
  
  
   
    <p>Network</p>
    <p>ActivityPub (and related protocols)</p>
   
  
 
 
<p>To summarize this diagram: there is a communications network (at the bottom), over which
apps can communicate with each other (middle), enabling people to interact with each other
in various ways (top).</p>
<p>Have you noticed that when people talk about the Fediverse …</p>
 
 … sometimes they mean the network, as in: “all these apps can talk to each other because
it’s all ActivityPub” … 
 … and sometimes they mean people, as in: “We have genuine relationships with each other
in the Fediverse because no 3rd party inserts ads and addictive algorithms”? 
 And of course, when they use “Mastodon” as the term instead of “Fediverse”, that’s
because in this view, the Fediverse is primary formed by thousands of app
instances, most of which today are Mastodon instances. 
 
<p>This distinction is very important, because the properties of the “Fediverse” in the
various definitions, are quite different. For example:</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is all about people, and how they relate to each other,
I don’t really care whether it’s based on ActivityPub, or other protocols (like
SSB, or Bluesky, or Webmention, or …) or any combination. In this view, the Fediverse
is a “place” where certain social norms are different, including that certain behaviors
prevalent in society or in other social networks (like expressions of racism) are
frowned upon or grounds for blocking.</p>
 
 
<p>If I think the Fediverse is the set of all software nodes that communicate over ActivityPub,
then I’m baffled why anybody should think some of those nodes shouldn’t be bots,
or publish advertisements or special offers; ActivityPub can carry all of those and
more. In this view, in its extreme form, the Fediverse could ultimately encompass
a lot of internet communication infrastructure, including replacing SMTP for
“e-mail”, for example.</p>
 
 
<p>Because of this confusion, sometimes the term “Fediverse” is actually less than helpful.
On the other hand, there isn’t an obviously better term (or several; we need several).</p>
<p>In my personal view, the network/interop-centric definition of Fediverse is more useful: the
Fediverse is the set of all nodes that can communicate semantically with each other through
common protocols (ActivityPub).</p>
<p>Given this, it allows many new apps to be built that
connect to the same network – the Fediverse – creating lots of new value, as I
<a href="https://reb00ted.org/tech/20230322-open-networks-are-more-valuable-fediverse/">described earlier</a>.</p>
<p>And those in turn enable people with common values to find each other, and form communities,
that practice forms of interaction that would be much harder on centralized social media
platforms. To use but one example, my primary Fediverse account is hosted
by <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, a member-owned cooperative that formed for the
purpose of hosting a social media server that works for them; self-funded, self-governed.
Imagine that outside of the Fediverse!</p>
<p>But regardless of what the term “Fediverse” is ultimately going to end up meaning,
whether that’s my preference or some other interpretation, let’s not conflate these different
ideas, otherwise all the beautiful opportunities created by the Fediverse to communicate
with each other won’t help us avoid talking past each other about the very thing that
makes it possible to talk!</p>

  It is time for USG to actively deploy shared identity services in the public interest

<p>The U.S. Federal Government has spent a considerable amount of time, treasure and energy admiring the problem of shared digital identity infrastructure that can be used by individuals in a privacy respecting manner, while improving cybersecurity and streamlining access to online services and benefits. It is time for it to occupy the room it owns instead of outsourcing solutions to private sector entities who do not have the public interest at heart.</p>

<p></p>



<p>The above graphic provides an easy to understand conceptual breakdown of the various components that make up a shared digital identity infrastructure.</p>

<p>I’ve updated some of the terminology to this decade, but the components and their relationships are taken directly from the U.S. Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2013/12/ficam-tfs-component-identity-services.html" title="FICAM TFS Component Identity Services Terminology">(FICAM) Program’s Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) Component Identity Terminology</a> circa 2013.</p>

<p>Using the TFS terminology that provides separation of concerns and capabilities, the question now becomes who within the U.S. Federal Government is best able to manage and operate these services?</p>

 GSA’s Login.gov as the Authentication Provider 

<p>In the aftermath of the GSA IG report that <a href="https://www.gsaig.gov/content/gsa-misled-customers-logingovs-compliance-digital-identity-standards" title="GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards">“GSA Misled Customers on Login.gov’s Compliance with Digital Identity Standards”</a>, and as I fully expected, there are a set of private sector identity service providers and their champions who have come out with variations of the narrative that “.gov should not be trusted to run a shared identity service” and should instead use their services, or that the “money that is allocated to Login.gov should be taken away” and re-programmed for other uses.</p>

<p>I am, oddly enough, here to make a case for why continued investment in and expansion of the Login.gov program is in the public interest. Odd because, I am on record as being Not-a-Fan of Login.gov’s remote identity proofing implementation because it was and is using data-broker transactional data instead of anything authoritative, and because of their weasel-worded support for NIST 800-63-3 Identity Assurance Levels (IALs).</p>

<p>My perspective on the GSA IG report is that it is a clear demonstration of exactly why .gov should run these types of services — because it demonstrates the independent checks and balances set up within Agencies working … and working well.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me to an example in the private sector where an Organization self-identified the problem, and corrected it with this high degree of transparency and accountability?</p>

<p>So let me stay on brand by noting that it is directly within the competency and capability of GSA and Login.gov to focus on Authentication (AAL) and Federation (FAL) Assurance Level’s and get out of the Identity Assurance Level (IAL) business.</p>

<p>In the near term, the conceptual picture of this could look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Agency remains responsible for the remote identity proofing and can use its internal data or other data sources it has access to, in order to accomplish it, but its use of Login.gov as the Authentication provider eases the burdens that are placed on individuals interacting with the Agency’s services, which should be a priority of any Agency!</p>

<p>I am semi-amused to note that this would enable us to catch up, after many long years, <a href="https://blog.aniljohn.com/2014/10/c2g-identity-services-overview-canada.html" title="A C2G Identity Services Overview of Canada">to what the Canadian Federal Government have effectively been doing at population scale for a LONG time!</a></p>

<p>However, this is only the first step, as it is just as important to implement a shared identity validation service that can be utilized by Agencies to mitigate account opening fraud, benefits fraud, and synthetic identity fraud.</p>

 Say No to Match/No-Match 

<p>While supporting the intent of such services, I also believe that it is a <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">REALLY BAD IDEA to implement these validation services using a “match/no-match” or “yes/no” architecture</a> because it:</p>

 
   Implements a “phone home” capability that can be abused 
   Limits the ability to collect informed consent from an individual about the use of their data 
   Can be abused by databrokers to enhance their targeting, profiling and segmentation of individuals 
 

<p><a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/not-better-identity/" title="Not better identity">My linked article</a> goes into the details and closed with a note that with the advances in understanding of the pitfalls of the private sector ecosystem as well as progress that has been made on global technical standards that ensure interoperability, security, privacy and choice, there is another way to implement this capability that can mitigate and/or eliminate the issues noted above.</p>

 Future&nbsp;» .gov W3C VC Broker for Authoritative Data Sources 

<p>That way is to enable an individual to have agency and control in interacting with authoritative sources that contain information about them, and giving them the capability to obtain and then present that information in a trustworthy and privacy respecting manner to entities they wish to interact with.</p>

<p>This will require the implementation of a shared service W3C Verifiable Credentials Broker Service that acts as the gateway to multiple authoritative sources within the Government. The individual directly interacts with those sources in order to obtain licenses, permits, credentials and attestations that they in turn can use in any online transactions – both with the Government and with the private sector!</p>

<p>The model for this would look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What is important to understand about this model is that the “.gov Shared W3C VC Broker” is not by itself an authoritative issuer, but instead is a gateway/broker/UI implementation that acts as the front-end for multiple, independent authoritative issuers of W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>Think that is too far out there?</p>

<p>I don’t believe it is, since I can point you to the <a href="https://playground.chapi.io/issuer">multi-vendor, multi-issuer, multi-party interoperability implementation environment that is being operationally tested by the W3C Verifiable Credential and W3C Decentralized Identifier community</a> to see a working example of this model:</p>

<p></p>

<p>What you see above is a gateway/broker that is a very light-weight facade over 6 different credential issuers, that an individual can interact with in order to obtain one or more W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>The same approach can serve as a starting point for a .gov service; for a moment, swap out the credentials shown above with credentials that could be generated from the following authoritative data sources:</p>
 
   Passport Information (State Department) 
   Immigration/Employment Eligibility Status (USCIS) 
   Tax Records (IRS) 
   Social Benefit Eligibility (SSA) 
   Birth/Death Records (State Vital Records Agency) 
   Driver Eligibility and State Residency (State DMVs) 
   Address of Record (USPS) 
   … 
 

<p>Also consider that as the individual is directly interacting with the service, receiving a credential, and then they (and not the Government) are using it (as they already do now in the paper world) for a variety of interactions that the Government may not be party to, it is not triggering .gov considerations related to Government use of that data since the Government has no visibility or awareness of the use of that data by the individual i.e. no “phone home” issues!</p>

<p>As an aside, if you were to ask me who should operate such a W3C VC Broker service for the U.S. Government, my answer would be the U.S. Postal Service, for a variety of very good reasons! <a href="https://www.usps.com/international/passports.htm">Hint: If you are a U.S. Citizen, how did you apply for the highest value citizen facing credential issued by the U.S. Federal Government?</a></p>

 Enable individuals, not databrokers! 

<p>I am not a believer or supporter of a Government issued identity card, but I do believe that Government has a role in standing behind and vouching for information it is authoritative for, when requested by an individual.</p>

<p>This architectural model provides the ability to do just that, while supporting individual agency, control and consent of the individual regarding their information, and puts digital identity within the U.S. Government on a path that can interoperate with other global jurisdictions.</p>

<p>このことから、GDPR第58条(2)(f)<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-5220" title="取扱いの禁止を含め、一時的な制限又は恒久的な制限を課すこと">11</a>に基づき、調査が継続中ではあるものの、緊急性に鑑みて暫定的なデータの取扱い停止命令を出すとしています。対象は、13歳未満を含む全てのイタリア在住者のデータです。利用規約で13以上としているのに13歳未満も対象としているのは、年齢制限の仕組みが実装されていないからです。これは、この処分通知が到達した時点<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-5220" title="要は即日">12</a>で有効となります。また、処分の内容は調査の結果によって変わる可能性があります。</p>



<p>次に、この命令に違反した場合には、禁錮3ヶ月〜2年（イタリア個人情報保護法第170条）の罰則が与えられることが述べられています。</p>



<p>また、この命令は、緊急性に鑑みて、イタリア個人情報保護委員会設置法第5条8項<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-5220" title="緊急時には委員会を開催せず、委員長の独断で決定できることを規定">13</a>に基づき、委員長の決定で出されていることが述べられます。</p>



 主文 



<p>かくなる上で、個人情報保護委員会は以下の命令を通知しています。</p>



 
 a) 規則第58条2項(f)に基づき、ChatGPTを開発・運営する米国企業OpenAI L.L.C.に対して、当該アプリケーションを通じて行われる個人情報の処理のデータ管理者として、イタリア領内に存在するデータ対象者<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/04/5220/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-5220" title="degli interessati 英語で data subject">14</a>の個人情報の処理を暫定的に制限する措置を緊急に命ず。 



 b) この命令は受け取り即時に有効であり、追加措置がありうる。 
 



<p>加えて</p>



 
 GDPR第58条に基づき、データ管理者は20日以内に本違反事件にかかわるデータの取扱を正当化する主張を委員会に届けること 
 



<p>をもとめています。なお、第58条に基づく照会に違反した場合には第83条5項eに基づき行政罰を受ける可能性があることもあわせて述べています。</p>



 感想 



<p>OpenAIにとってはなかなかしんどいですね。日本のこの手のことをやっている企業にも参考になると思います。</p>



<p>まず、ユーザもしくはOpenAIによるデータ収集およびChatGPTにおける処理対象になった者に何ら情報が提供されていない点。公開されているデータにも個人情報はたくさんはいっていますし、その処理に先立ち当該個人に処理する旨の情報提供が必要だということでしょう。かなりしんどいですね。</p>



<p>次にトレーニングに関するデータの使用に適法な根拠が無いという点。</p>



<p>GDPR第6条では</p>



 
 (a) 特定の目的のための同意、 



 (b) 契約の履行または契約にさきだつ手続き、 



 (c)法的義務、 



 (d) 生命の保護、 



 (e) 公共の利益、 



 (f) 正当利益（13歳未満およびデータの対象者の処理されない利益が上回る場合を除く） 
 



<p>を適法性根拠として上げているわけですが、まず(a)。学習データとして使うことの同意はまず取れてないですから「同意」は根拠として使えなさそうです。</p>



<p>さらに(b)。そもそも学習データとして使う段階では、契約をするかどうかわからないわけですから無理です。</p>



<p>(c)(d)が無理なのは言わずもがな。(e)の公共の利益も厳しそうです。</p>



<p>最後(f)の正当利益ですが、これに関して20日以内に回答せよとまずは言っていますね。普通に考えると、13歳未満のデータが入っていないこと、データ対象者の利益を害さないことを立証しているPIAレポートが求められそうです。</p>



<p>次が「正確性の原則」違反。デタラメ返しますからね。正確性の原則は、ついデータベースなどに保管しているデータの正確性と思いがちですが、これは処理全体にかかるので、処理の結果出てくる情報にもあてはまります。</p>



<p>5と6は子どもに対する対応の無さへの指摘。規約に書くだけでは不十分であり、年齢認証がもとめられるようです。</p>



<p>そして、処理を停止しなかったら禁錮３ヶ月〜２年。とりあえずChatGPTは日本からはまだ動いているように見えるのですが、イタリアからのアクセスはできないようにとかしたのだろうか…。いや、それだけではだめで、イタリア領内のデータ対象者のデータの処理をやめなければいけないわけですが、いったいどうやって？？？モデルからその部分を取り除けるようになっているのかしら…。</p>



<p>そして主文についてですが、これはもう端的に書いてある通り。加えて、ちゃんと20日以内に申し開きを提出することができるのかが注目されますね。</p>

  <p>I have a side project called <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr">BookLoggr</a> which was created for the purpose of saving notes to books as I have done for decades but on the empty back pages of books.  A year ago I added a feature for uploading pdfs and found myself often just cutting and pasting interesting sentences.  I soon started saving academic papers as well as books.</p>

<p>Only recently have I begun to appreciate reading beginner books in french.  On each page, I’ll find many new words that I need to look up and annotate with the english word inside the book.  It is very time consuming and awkward to put the book down, pull up <a href="https://deepl.com/translate">deepl.com</a> and type the word into the translation form.  It is much less disruptive to be able to click a button to translate the page and I can optionally write the english word inside the physical copy of the book.</p>

<p>So, I decided to repurpose my existing interface for adding a note (which was already associated with a page number) to make the note the entire contents of a page.  Now, before I start reading the french book, I add each page of the book as a note.  Last night, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/bookloggr/commit/cb728b0f0552a84303e70d107f62eb95ecb226b0">the code</a> to allow clicking a button to translate a page of french text using DeepL.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I added the pages last night and will try it out and see how it goes…</p>

  By creating fully qualified authorization contexts from minimal requests, a PIP reduces the burden on developers building or integrating PEPs, allows for more flexible and reusable policies, and enriches authorization contexts to allow more precise access decisions.

The PDP uses a policy store and an authorization context to determine whether access should be granted or not. How much of the authorization context does the PEP have to provide to the PDP?</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Consider the following policy1:</p><blockquote><p>Managers in marketing can approve transactions if they are not the owner and if the amount is less than their approval limit.</p></blockquote><p>A PDP might make the following fully qualified request to get an authorization decision:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice with jobtitle = manager and department = marketing do action = approve on resource of type = financial transaction with transaction id = 123 belonging to department = finance and with amount = 3452?</p></blockquote><p>This request contains all of the authorization context needed for the policy to run. A fully qualified request requires that the PEP gather all of the information about the request from various attribute sources.</p><p>Alternatively, consider this minimal request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = approve on resource with transaction id = 123?</p></blockquote><p>The minimal request reduces the work that the PEP must do, placing the burden on the PDP to build an authorization context with sufficient information to make a decision. We can separate this work out into a separate service called a policy information point (PIP). To build an authorization context for this request, the PIP must retrieve the following information:</p>  <p>The user’s job title, department, and approval limit.</p>  <p>The transaction’s owner and amount.</p>  <p>Building this context requires that the PIP have access to several attribute sources including the HR system (where information about Alice is stored) and the finance system&nbsp;&nbsp;(where information about transactions is stored).</p> Attribute Value Providers <p>PIPs are not usually the source of attributes, but rather a place where attributes are brought together to create the authorization context. As you saw, the PIP might query the HR and Finance systems, using attributes in the request to create fully qualified authorization context. Other examples of attribute value providers (AVP) include databases, LDAP directories, Restful APIs, geolocation services, and any other data source that can be correlated with the attributes in the minimal request. </p><p>What’s needed depends on the policies you’re evaluating. The fully qualified context should only include needed attributes, not every piece of information the PIP can gather about the request. To that end, the PIP must be configurable to create the context needed without wasteful queries to unneeded AVPs.</p> PEP Attributes <p>There is context that the PEP has that the PDP might need. For example, consider this request:</p><blockquote><p>Can user username = Alice do action = view on resource with transaction id = 123 from IP = 192.168.1.23 and browser = firefox?</p></blockquote><p>The PIP typically would not have access to the IP address or browser type. The PEP must pass that information along for use in evaluating the policy.</p> Derived Attributes <p>The PIP can enhance information that the PDP passes in to derive new attributes. For example, consider a policy that requires the request come from specific ranges of IP addresses. The first instinct a developer might have is to embed the IP range directly in the policy. However, this is a nightmare to maintain if multiple policies have the same range check—especially when the range changes. The solution is to use derived attributes, where you can define a new attribute, <code>is_ip_address_in_range</code>, and have the PIP calculate it instead. </p><p>This might be generalized with a Session Attribute component in the PIP that can enhance or transform session attributes into others that are better for policies. This is just one example of how raw attributes might be transformed to provide richer, derived attributes. Other examples include deriving an age from a birthday, an overall total for several transactions, or a unique key from other attributes.</p> Benefits of a PIP <p>While the work to gather the attributes to build the authorization context may seem like it’s the same whether the PEP or PIP does it, there are several benefits to using a PIP:</p>  <p>Simplified attribute administration—A PIP provides a place to manage integration with attribute stores that ensures the integration and interpretation are done consistently across multiple systems.</p>  <p>Reduced Complexity—PIPs can reduce the complexity of the access control system by removing the need for individual access control components to have their own policy information. PEPs are typically designed to be lightweight so they can be used close to the point where the access is enforced. For example, you might have PEPs in multiple API gateways co-located with the services they intermediate or in smartphone apps. A PIP offloads work from the PEP to keep it lightweight.</p>  <p>Separation of Concerns—PIPs separate policy information from policy decision-making, making it easier to update and modify policies and AVPs without impacting other parts of the access control system. For example, making fully qualified requests increases the coupling in the system because the PEP has to know more about policies to formulate fully qualified requests.</p>  <p>Improved Scalability— PIPs can be deployed independently of other access control components, which means that they can be scaled independently as needed to accommodate changes in policy volume or access requests.</p>  <p>Enhanced Security— PIPs can be configured to provide policy information only to authorized PDPs, which improves the security of the access control system and helps to prevent unauthorized access. In addition, a PIP builds consistent authorization contexts whereas different PEPs might make mistakes or differ in their output. </p>   Tradeoffs <p>There are tradeoffs with using a PIP. For example, suppose that the PEP is embedded in the ERP system and has local access to both the HR and financial data. It might more easily and cheaply use those attributes to create a fully qualified request. Making a minimal request and requiring the PIP to make a call back to the ERP for the data to create the authorization context would be slower.</p><p>But, as noted above, this solution increases the coupling between the PEP and PDP because the PEP now has to have more knowledge of the policies to make the fully qualified request. Developers need to use their judgement about request formulation to evaluate the tradeoffs.</p> Conclusion <p>By creating fully qualified authorization contexts from minimal requests, a PIP reduces the burden on developers building or integrating PEPs, allows for more flexible and reusable policies, and enriches authorization contexts to allow more precise access decisions.</p>    Notes   <p>The information in this article was inspired by <a href="https://axiomatics.com/blog/7-should-the-policy-enforcement-point-send-all-attributes-needed-to-evaluate-a-request">Should the Policy Enforcement Point Send All Attributes Needed to Evaluate a Request</a>? </p>  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/185524011@N04/49070117146">Information Desk Charleston Airport</a> from AutoRentals.com (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a>, photo is cropped from original)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I shoot a lot of pictures. Most are from altitude (such as the above). But lots are of people and places, for example, here are a few I shot at <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWebCamp</a> last summer with my new <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2023/03/29/workflow/">Sony A7 IV</a> camera (to which I migrated last year after many years shooting Canon):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Importing and curating photos is the only organized thing I do in life. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Under each of those photos is the name of the file. These are the actual file names, not ones stored in the library of some app and remembered at the meta-level. None are called&nbsp;DSCN0401.JPG,&nbsp;IMG_4523.JPG, or&nbsp;IMG_1874.PNG. I’ve given all of them meaningful names, all by the same convention: YYYY_MM_DD_name-of-event. Every file in every folder has the same name as the folder, with a number appended to it. The numbers are chronological. Each event’s folder goes into a month folder, each of those goes into a year folder, and all years go into a folder called pix-by-year. That folder has years going back to 1869. (The earliest are scans, such as <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/179573983">this one</a>.)</p>
<p>I organize and name all my photos with a piece of software originally called iView Media Pro, then Expression Media 2 (after Microsoft bought it), and finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_One_Media_Pro">Phase One Media Pro</a> (after Microsoft abandoned it). I like the second version best, so that’s what I use.</p>
<p>Here is a short and partial list of all the things Expression Media 2 can do:</p>
 
 Rename files in the Finder, very selectively, alone, or in batches (much more smoothly and easily than can be done with Adobe Bridge or <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac/import-shortcuts-apd02bffbaac/mac">Apple’s Shortcuts or Automator</a>). 
 Search for any variable, or combination of variables 
 Sort by up to 24 variables (file name, size, date created, date modified…) 
 Resize selectively 
 Open any files with any other app 
 Bring multiple photos (files) from multiple directories into a single catalog, to organize any way I want. Also to export, rename, or whatever, including— 
 Run a slide show, with many choices of presentation (much more than with Apple’s Photos), and save shows as movies 
 Open any file or collection of files in any other app (for me that’s usually Photoshop 2021) 
 Basic image edits 
 Rotate, flip, zoom in and out 
 See and edit EXIF data for every shot 
 Find missing and duplicate items 
 Show or hide any file or combinations of files 
 Move files in the Finder 
 Operate in lieu of the finder when dragging or dropping into a Web page or another app 
 Arrange or tile photos by hand or by sort 
 Log and show actions 
 Place images on a map 
 Make a .pdf of any image or collection of them 
 Turn galleries into pages in .html 
 Import and export to and from .xml 
 
<p>I don’t do all that stuff, but I list it because I want to remember what I know I will lose when I move from this 2017 MacBook Pro running Mojave to my new 16″ 2023 M2 Max MacBook Pro. That will happen later today after I upgrade both machines to the latest version of Ventura. When that happens, Expressions Media 2, a 32-bit program last updated in 2013, will be kaput. And I will need to find another workflow.</p>
<p>Maybe Expression Media 2 will survive through emulation or something. Or maybe Phase One Media Pro (also last updated in 2013) will work.</p>
<p>Or maybe one of ya’ll has a better way to manage workflow than I’m using now. I’m open.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here goes…</p>
<p>[Later (May 10, 2023)…] I am now working with my new M2 Macbook Pro, and I feel like I am missing limbs. The only prostheses I have are the limited choices that come with Apple’s Finder and Adobe Bridge. So again, help is welcome. Thanks.</p>
 
<p>Addendum: If you’re wondering why I’m not running my life on Linux and free and/or open-source software, the main reasons are Photoshop and Lightroom. I’ve tried Gimp and it doesn’t cut it. Photoshop knows the camera and lenses I’m using, and its tools, such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=dehaze+in+photoshop">dehaze</a>, are extremely useful. See the photos <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72177720307077012">here</a>? Thank dehaze for making the detail pop out. (Yes, Gimp de-hazes, but <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/De-Haze-a-Photo-with-GIMP">not easily</a>.) I hate being trapped in Apple’s castle as much as the next serf, but shooting as much as I do requires tools I can use quickly and easily.</p>

<p>As more processes become digitized, there are increasing opportunities for bad actors to cause harm. It’s important for individuals to recognize the importance of IoT security, both for their personal data and their company’s data. I’ve outlined some best practices to consider when developing IoT projects below, to help you keep both your own and your company’s data and assets safe from potential threats.</p>
<p></p>
 Availability &amp; Visibility 
<p>The basic requirement for every IoT product suite is the continuous availability and visibility of data. These updates on device health and users are key components to effective cybersecurity and monitoring. They allow you to deal with rogue or compromised devices immediately before it affects other system components. Visibility also ensures that older devices can be removed prior to becoming ghost devices (old, unused, or hidden devices), which can pose significant security risks.</p>
<p>The main problem with out-of-date software and legacy hardware associated with ghost devices is that once they pass their end-of-life cycle, the vendor no longer maintains or supports the products, resulting in security vulnerabilities and risk to organizations.</p>
 Authenticity 
<p>Other than 24/7 transmissibility, data reliability and verification of devices in both directions is also vital. In the age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), there is rising concern surrounding authenticity of data. Sophisticated hackers are able to utilize methods to impersonate and tamper with data, potentially causing cascading failure across your enterprise.</p>
<p>To maintain airtight IoT security, you need a reliable computing base that functions as the root of trust and is tamper-proof. A root of trust holds your cryptographic keys and secures communication with the network and other channels, making it intrinsically secure. Cryptographic keys are also randomized and unique across different devices. If one device is compromised, all other devices will still remain safe.</p>
 Security 
<p>One way to verify service integrity is implementing security by design, where products and capabilities are designed from the get-go to be foundationally secure. Security is also a continual process, requiring you to patch and update systems as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Should a cyberattack occur, it is just as important to understand how your business is going to respond and recover. It is natural to focus on technology and systems but recovering should extend to your customers. That’s why creating a plan is so important. You want to make sure you can respond quickly and have the right outcomes for your business priorities.</p>
 Privacy 
<p>The EU’s expanding General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States are just the tip of the iceberg surrounding a slew of upcoming global data privacy and cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>You may be subject to varying levels of privacy and IoT security regulations, if devices are deployed across different countries or regions. Non-compliance may result in hefty penalties and sanctions. It is essential to pick an ecosystem partner that can help you navigate the complex data privacy and cybersecurity landscape.</p>
 Longevity 
<p>Long term planning for an IoT project can be like looking into a crystal ball, attempting to anticipate unexpected events. Even so, be mindful of the life cycle surrounding all your technologies. For instance, there’s the danger of 2G sunsetting, rendering devices that are reliant on the technology completely obsolete.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The added benefit to this is your IoT solution should also be flexible and customizable throughout the entire life cycle of the device. Imagine facing a sudden influx of data during peak EV charging times, or if you had to ship your EV chargers to different countries around the world, your connectivity solutions should be able to seamlessly connect and transmit securely, regardless of where your deployment is.</p>
<p>Ignoring IoT security is no longer an option. The stakes are too high, with the potential to lose personal data and company assets at risk. By implementing best practices outlined above, you can help ensure the safety and longevity of your IoT devices and projects. Don’t wait until it’s too late to prioritize IoT security today.</p>

<p>The article looks at and explores the new Azure AD cross-tenant synchronization. The feature makes it really easy to implement the technical part of synchronization between different Azure AD tenants.</p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Aad-cross-tenant-synchronization">https://github.com/damienbod/Aad-cross-tenant-synchronization</a></p>



<p></p>



 Requirements 



<p>To use this feature, both the source tenant and the target tenant require at least a P1 Azure AD license. The administrator and the application used to implement the feature needs to have the required delegated authorization. I used Microsoft Graph Explorer for this. In a second step, I will implement an ASP.NET Core application for this.</p>



 Setup 



<p>In this use case, I have two separate tenants with users, applications, groups and everything that comes with an Azure AD tenant. I would like to join these two tenants without migrating all the users, groups, and applications to one of the tenants.</p>



<p><br>A typical use case for this would when a company acquires a second company and both use Azure AD. There are many different strategies for technically merging two companies and every implementation is always different. The merge might be a m-n merge which is a more complicated to implement. It is always best to aim for simplicity. I always aim to reduce to a single source of identity for applications and use this to authenticate everything against. The single source of identity can federate to different IAM systems, but the applications should not use the external IAM directly.</p>



<p><br>I also try to have only one source of identity for users, but this is not always possible. With these complex systems, users must have only one primary identity, otherwise it gets really hard to maintain onboard, offboard and you require more tools to manage this. One problem with this solution is using on-premise applications or clients with cloud IAM solutions. For some on-premise applications, there is no network connection to the cloud systems and so exceptions needs to be implemented here if using a cloud solution as the single source of identity for applications. Azure AD and AD is one such example of this problem and Microsoft provide a good solution for this. (Azure Hybrid)<br></p>



<p>The big decision is deciding where the identities have the primary definition.</p>



<p>In this demo, we keep the identities primary definition as it was and add the members of the source tenant to the target tenant as external member users. This synchronized then.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph">documentation</a> for this is excellent and I really recommend using this when implementing the synchronization.</p>



 Setup target tenant 



<p>To implement the synchronization, the user and application need the assigned privileges for the following Microsoft Graph permissions: </p>



 
 Policy.Read.All 



 Policy.ReadWrite.CrossTenantAccess 
 



<p>You can view this in the Enterprise applications once setup. This Enterprise application is only required to create the synchronization.  This can also be deleted after the synchronization has been created. The Enterprise application is used to create a second Enterprise application used for the synchronization. You could also just implement this directly in the Azure portal. </p>



<p>The different steps to create the synchronization are described in great detail in the Microsoft Azure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph#step-2-enable-user-synchronization-in-the-target-tenant">docs</a>.  </p>







<p></p>



 Setup source tenant 



<p>To implement the synchronization, the user and application need the assigned privileges for the following Microsoft Graph permissions: </p>



 
 Policy.Read.All 



 Policy.ReadWrite.CrossTenantAccess 



 Application.ReadWrite.All 



 Directory.ReadWrite.All 
 



<p>The different steps to create the synchronization are described in great detail in the Microsoft Azure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure-graph#step-4-automatically-redeem-invitations-in-the-source-tenant">docs</a>.</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



 Synchronization configurations 



<p>The Azure AD provisioning can be setup to add all users, or scoped to a set of users, or a group of users as required. The provisioning can be setup to map the user attributes as required. I used the default settings and provision all member users.</p>



 Synchronization in operation 



<p>One the synchronization is setup, the identities are automatically updated to the target system using the defined scope and configuration. You can make changes on one tenants and the changes can be viewed on the target tenant. The trust settings can be updated to trust the original MFA form the source tenant, but care needs to be taken here. You do not want to allow weaker MFA than the required company policy. A phishing resistant MFA should be standard for any professional company that cares about its employees and security. </p>







<p></p>



<p>Now that the identities are synchronized , the next step would be to move the applications and the groups for the shared services.</p>

recently. Sorry if this is a bit cryptic, it was written for a very specific technical
audience. I have added a few annotations in square brackets to provide context.</p>
<p>What am I missing in my wish list?</p>
 
<p>Putting on my product developer hat, here’s what I want for Christmas:</p>
 A single-document basic [Fediverse] interop spec, ie. 
 
 when I have written code for everything it says, my code will interoperate in some basic fashion with all other software that has implemented this document 
 no need to consult or understand other implementations 
 may be quite basic, e.g. text content only, only a minimal set of activity types 
 enables implementors to have a “MVP”-style interop at lowest-possible engineering effort (including the time required to read/understand the specs!) 
 This could be done as a “minimal profile” of a stack that contains a subset of AP [ActivityPub], AS [ActivityStreams], and Webfinger 
 
 A test suite for that profile 
 
 suitable to add to my automated test suite 
 over time, this test suite can grow beyond the minimal profile 
 
 A branding program for products that have passed the test suite 
 
 As an implementor, you get to put the sticker on your product. 
 In particular, in the places in the product where users “connect” to other servers in the Fediverse, like “Visa” is displayed at the POS terminal 
 I believe this will become critical if/when larger orgs with potentially different value systems connect to the Fediverse 
 
 A set of web “intent buttons” for Like, Follow, Post, etc that work across sites 
 
 like they exist for centralized social media 
 as easy to use for the user 
 we can argue how this can be accomplished technically. I have opinions, but for this wish list, they are immaterial, as long as I get those buttons :-) 
 
 A standardized way to express terms under which content is provided 
 
 As I understand it, Bob Wyman calls that a Rights Expression Language 
 This probably should start with a use case collection 
 
 A design for search that meets the requirements of all relevant parties and points of view 
 
 This is probably far less a technical problem than one of successful communication 
 
 A design to reduce certain loads 
 
 Fan-out 
 Video 
 (Not my area of expertise, so I don’t have details) 
 
 Improved identity management across the Fediverse 
 
 Easy-to-use single-sign-on across servers. Use case: I use several apps for different content types (like micro blog and video). Bonus: they all post from the same identifier 
 Easy-to-use persona management. Use case: I have a personal and a work account, bonus if they can be on the same server 
 Identifiers not tied to the domain name system 
 
<p>Some of this squarely falls in the domain of this group [that would be the W3C’s Social Web Interest Community Group], some is adjacent. It could be pulled in, or it can be done somewhere else. I don’t particularly care about that either, as long as it gets done and done consistently with the rest.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure you all are going to tell me why I can’t have all those things for Christmas, and certainly not this Christmas. But I can wish, no? (More seriously, I think they are all essential for continued successful growth of the ActivityPub network as new parties connect)</p>

Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>I was at <a href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-salt-lake-city/welcome/">SLC DevOpsDays</a> last week and attended a talk by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-goldberg-002803143/">Sharon Goldberg</a> on MFA in 2023. She's a security expert and focused many of her remarks on the relative security of different multi-factor authentication (MFA) techniques, a topic I cover in my book as well. I liked how she described the security provisions of passkeys (also know as Fast ID Online or FIDO).</p><p>FIDO is a challenge-response protocol that uses public-key cryptography. Rather than using certificates, it manages keys automatically and beneath the covers, so it’s as user-friendly as possible. I’m going to discuss the latest FIDO specification, FIDO2, here, but the older FIDO U2F and UAF protocols are still in use as well.</p><p>FIDO uses an authenticator to create, store, and use authentication keys. Authenticators come in several types. Platform authenticators are devices that a person already owns, like a laptop or smartphone. Roaming authenticators take the form of a security key that connects to the laptop or smartphone using USB, NFC, or Bluetooth.</p><p>This is a good time for you to stop reading this and head over to <a href="https://www.passkeys.io/">Passkeys.io</a> and try them for yourself. If you're using a relatively modern OS on your smartphone, tablet, or computer, you shouldn't have to download anything. Sign up using your email (it doesn't have to be a real email address), do whatever your device asks when you click "Save a Passkey" (on my iPhone it does Face ID, on my MacOS laptop, it does Touch ID). Then sign out.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F49a6a097-8e65-4eb3-8300-e0526c8ba8e4_2350x1624.png">    </a>Using Touch ID with Passkey <p>Now, click on "Sign in with a passkey". Your computer will let you pick an identifier (email address) that you've used on that site and then present you with a way to locally authenticate (i.e., on the device). It's that simple. In fact, my biggest fear with passkeys is that it's so slick people won't think anything has happened.</p><p>Here's what's going on behind the scenes: When Alice registers with an online service like Passkeys.io, her authenticator (software on her phone, for example) creates a new cryptographic key pair, securely storing the private key locally and registering the public key with the service. The online service may accept different authenticators, allowing Alice to select which one to use. Alice unlocks the authenticator using a PIN, fingerprint reader, or face ID.</p><p>When Alice authenticates, she uses a client such as a browser or app to access a service like a website (see figure below). The service presents a login challenge, including the chance to select an account identifier, which the client (e.g., browser) passes to the authenticator. The authenticator prompts Alice to unlock it and uses the account identifier in the challenge to select the correct private key and sign the challenge. Alice’s client sends the signed challenge to the service, which uses the public key it stored during registration to verify the signature and authenticate Alice.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5422e81-9975-49fe-b853-e16c676d1684_427x257.png">    </a>Authenticating with Passkey <p>FIDO2 uses two standards. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-id-20180227/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-id-20180227.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> describes how a browser or operating system establishes a connection to a FIDO authenticator. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2-2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthN protocol</a> is built into browsers and provides an API that JavaScript from a Web service can use to register a FIDO key, send a challenge to the authenticator, and receive a response to the challenge.</p><p>One of the things I liked about Dr. Goldberg's talk is that she emphasized that the security of passkeys rests on three things:</p>  <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) to securely transport challenges and responses.</p>  <p>The WebAuthN protocol that gives websites a way to invoke the local authentication machinery using a Javascript API.</p>  <p>A secure, local connection between the client and authenticator using CTAP.</p>  <p>One of the weaknesses of how we use TLS today is that people don't usually check the lock icon in the browser and don't understand domain names enough to tell if they're being phished. Passkeys do this for you. The browser unambiguously transfers the domain name to the authenticator which knows if it has an established relationship with that domain or not. Authenticating that you're on the right site is a key reason they're so much more secure than other MFA alternatives. Another is having a secure channel from authenticator to service, making phishing nearly impossible because there's no way to break into the authentication flow.</p><p>Passkeys provide a secure and convenient way to authenticate users without resorting to passwords, SMS codes, or TOTP authenticator applications. Modern computers and smartphones and most mainstream browsers understand FIDO protocols natively. While roaming authenticators (hardware keys) are available, for most use cases, platform authenticators (like the ones built into your smartphone or laptop) are sufficient. This makes FIDO an easy, inexpensive way for people to authenticate. As I said, the biggest impediment to its widespread use may be that people won’t believe something so easy is secure.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

We find the same duality phenomena is reflected in the business world as we try to find a balance between creating new and maintaining what we have.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature does not favour new over old but ebbs and flows, appearing to have a fluid, ever-changing dynamic stability; however, businesses try to prioritise based on a purpose, and this piece highlights that often there is an unwillingness to consider both perspectives in balance, which is detrimental.&nbsp; What are the right questions to ask to determine if your purpose or strategy will disrupt fragile balances or if you are aligned and can thrive?&nbsp;</p><p>This is a 20-minute read which will challenge your perceptions and presuppositions of the role you inhabit and the role your ecosystem plays on you.</p><br><br><br><br><br> Can you, I, us, society or business have a single purpose? <br><p>In our natural world, two dependent systems keep our fragile life from ending. One is the ability to mutate and adapt, and the other is maintenance (homeostasis) and memory. When we observe the dynamic expansions and contractions in our natural world, we see the two-sides of this dynamic system competing.&nbsp; We can label these forces as “error creation” and “error correction”, and there is a never-ending ebb and flow between the two states, which creates a dynamic stability or an unbalanced equilibrium; two oxymorons which we will explore below. The ability to see both sides of a perspective gives us a wider vantage point that can help us unlock powerful insights into why a single unified purpose is not feasible, why AI will not take over, and how to avoid failure in times of uncertainty.</p> Is believing in a unified purpose a protective delusion?&nbsp; <p>The theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for how life on Earth has changed over time and how different species have arisen from common ancestors. It is based on the idea that all living things share a common ancestry and that the diversity of life we see today results from gradual changes over millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population based on their effects on survival and reproduction. Random mutation being the way to create new traits and adaptation, are central to the theory of evolution.</p><p>Homeostasis is maintenance, it refers to the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment. It is essential for the survival and well-being of an organism, and disruptions to this balance can have serious consequences. Memory refers to the process of storing, retaining, and retrieving information both individually and at a societal level; consider here how history, culture, law and even paintings and architecture are memory. Memory gives an organism the ability to maintain a sense of stability despite being in a changing environment, as one is able to recall the expected outcome of a familiar circumstance.&nbsp; Homeostasis and memory are critical for stability and survival.&nbsp;</p><p>These concepts, mutation &amp; adaptation and homeostasis &amp; memory, have been observed for thousands of years, and as humans unpack the complex connectivity between them, we can better articulate what we observe, which is why it can be so difficult to find and follow a singular goal to its completion. The connection between them has elements of both immediacy and delay: mutation demands an immediate response from homeostasis, yet also drives changes over time through immunity responses"; In the long run, human changes create environments for different mutations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>To the observer who notices that there are no arrows, there is a reason for that. It is about the connection, relationship, and coupling, not the directionality of flow.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is often framed as a competitive arms race: the survival of the fittest between living organisms that adapt to a constantly variable, but ultimately stable system. Mutations are randomness in the complex life coding system that creates new traits.&nbsp; Mutations can create an advantage in the arms race as they can lead to unique traits which make an organism fitter for its environment.&nbsp; Advantageous traits tend to thrive, whereas non-advantageous traits will either cease to exist or live on at a subsistence level.</p><p>Cyber security is positioned as a similar modern-day example of an arms race, but in reality, it is one system (virus) that is looking for a vulnerability to give it an advantage, and the other system running anti-virus is responding/ adapting to prevent it. The virus can only be created because the system has a fundamental flaw (weakness), and it is a race between those who want to uncover it and those who want to hide it, but the flaw exists. It is not the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One could use the free market economy as a modern example of this phenomenon of mutation and homeostasis, whereby we use the words “innovation” and “competition” as synonyms for “mutation” and “survival of the fittest”. To describe innovation as solely beneficial, or solely detrimental would be incorrect; likewise, it is not reasonable to suggest that stability is solely one or the other. In all aspects of life, there is a balance between chaos and order, mutation and homeostasis, and innovation and tradition. Therefore, when we re-frame our thinking, we see that believing in a single, unified purpose is a delusion, as this singular goal only represents one side of a dynamic system whereby control on one end does not create the end game, and we only have a bright future because we have two.</p> A preference for labelling <p>If I gave you a choice between “innovation” and “mutation”, which one do you associate with value, creativity and growth?</p><p>Transposing the words that describe our natural world directly into a business environment would create fear, uncertainty and doubt.&nbsp; “We are working hard on innovation” sounds more impressive and reasonable than “we are creating new mutations.”&nbsp; “We mostly operate in a competitive market” sounds so much more plausible than “it is an arms race for the survival of the fittest”.&nbsp; Words matter, and because they do, we can use words to create dynamics to be more or less willing to discuss and debate hard topics in the boardroom.&nbsp;</p><p>The next section utilises the word “error”;&nbsp; in this context, an "error" is the gap between expected and observed. I understand that many readers will want to stick with their natural framing of an error as right/ wrong, but “error” can mean:</p>  <p>a moral offence;&nbsp;</p>  <p>belief in something untrue;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the state or condition of being wrong in conduct or judgement;</p>  <p>a mistake, blunder, lapse, or slip;</p>  <p>a deviation from perception, expected, accuracy or correctness;&nbsp;</p>  <p>the difference between the observed and actual</p>  <p>Error in this work is closer to the framing of the lower three bullets than the top three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> How does a system based on “error creation” and “error correction” sound?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The dynamic of our natural world system is that one system is creating something new and different whilst the other is trying to correct and mitigate the change. One is bringing in the new, and the other defending the existing.&nbsp; One is the hope of something better, whilst the other is happy not to take the risk and maintain the same. Both sides create risk; strangely, different risks are created by each side, but nevertheless, risk.&nbsp; Error creation, in this instance, is invention, innovation and creativity.&nbsp; Error correction is stability and familiar processes that we know (and trust) from historical experience.&nbsp; The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p>The risk in the former is change, and the risk in the latter is to become not relevant.&nbsp; They are different risks.</p><p></p><p>How often do we translate the message we receive from leadership that we need to be both “more innovative” whilst simultaneously “improving efficiency and effectiveness” as a demand to compromise on everything and lack focus? Perhaps we should see this balance as the maintenance of an equilibrium of "error creation" and "error correction" because it creates something new that we label as value.&nbsp;</p><p>Leadership that fails to recognise there is a need for balance will fail; we first need to determine where we are in the system and which system we favour; from there, it should be easier to determine what journey we are on and where the north star is.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not “trial and error”, as before a trial, there has to be a hypothesis, and the error is a deviation in the results from the expected/ predicted.&nbsp; It is neither “error and trial”, where an error is created without a hypothesis and using some measure, one tries to determine if the error was successful. Then there is AB testing. However, these are all controlled point methods and are not about dynamic reactive complex systems.&nbsp;</p> The answer to the universe, world and everything (#douglasadams) <p>To fans of The HitchHickers Guide to the Universe, we know the answer is 42, but the question remains;&nbsp; we just needed another 5 minutes!&nbsp; My struggle with the answer, as given, was whether it was relevant when the question was asked or given since 7.5 million years passed, and a lot happens in big time frames. I would have loved to have asked Douglas.</p><p>So often, there is a dynamic between two competing ideas, both trying to be the more important single unifying idea or purpose.&nbsp; Humans want to be both heard and belong.&nbsp; It is not that one is better than the other, but one is more error creation (listen to my new idea) and one more error correction (stability of belonging).&nbsp; Some business leaders will say their purpose is “shareholder primacy”, whilst others say their core purpose is to “improve the lives of their customer”. This is a nonexclusive club - and there are many others - however, most companies settle on a purpose that is a compromise. It is safe to say that business purpose varies depending on the specific goals and values of the company and its stakeholders.&nbsp; It could be argued that the purpose of a business is to balance creating more value for the majority of the customers, shareholders, employees, and wider society as a whole than the destruction or erosion of value for others.&nbsp; Purpose itself is achieved through various competing ideas, such as developing innovative products or services, providing high-quality customer service, maintaining ethical business practices, and contributing to the ecosystem the organisation operates in.&nbsp;</p><p>When we reflect on this concept, we see that a business is itself demanding that it “creates errors” and “correct errors.” Remember, this is not “mistakes” or moral pearls; this is seeing innovation as creating change, which is an error to the system of no change. Businesses need to create new ideas and innovations but also correct errors that try to change the stability of process efficiency.&nbsp; Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.&nbsp; Note: another framing of “error” could be morally unethical behaviour and trading without reason whilst insolvent. These activities are not errors; they are illegal, and it is not what we are focused on.</p><p>Leadership needs to craft a level of instability whilst maintaining equilibrium.</p><p>Perhaps we should accept that there cannot be one single unifying purpose, and we exist in a place where some individuals, leaders, and teams favour change (error creation) and some stability (error correction), but without both, we would lose our ever-changing dynamic stability.</p> The Purpose and origin of Innovation (as an example of error creation) <p>Innovation refers to the process of creating something new or improving upon an existing product, service, or process. The purpose of innovation is to bring about positive change and to solve problems more effectively or efficiently. Innovations can be incremental or disruptive, with the latter representing a significant shift in how things are done.</p><p>The origin of innovation can be traced back to human curiosity and the desire to improve the quality of life. Throughout history, humans have constantly sought ways to improve their lives, whether it be through inventions such as the wheel or electricity, or the development of new technologies like mobile phones and the web. Innovation has played a vital role in driving progress and advancing society.</p><p>Innovation has become increasingly important as businesses seek to stay competitive and meet the changing needs of consumers. Companies invest in research and development to create new products and services to improve efficiency, increase profits, and create new market opportunities. Governments also encourage innovation through funding research and development, providing incentives for businesses, and fostering collaboration between industry and academia.</p><p>Overall, the purpose and origin of innovation are rooted in human ingenuity and the desire to create something new and better. Innovation has been and will continue to be a critical driver of progress and growth in all aspects of society, including how we achieve sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>We like innovation as long it is not called error creation or mutation, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. &nbsp; If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a creative mindset and enjoy the process of disruption, change, and the outcomes of instability.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> The Purpose and origin of Accounting (as an example of error correction) <p>The origins of accounting can be traced back thousands of years to ancient civilisations such as the Babylonians, who kept records of their transactions on clay tablets. In medieval Europe, accounting was used primarily by merchants and bankers to keep track of their financial transactions. The original purpose of business accounting was to provide shareholders with accurate and timely information about the financial performance and position of an organisation.</p><p>Accounting is a system of recording, analysing and summarising financial transactions to prevent errors, provide accuracy, and present information that is useful in making business decisions. Over time, accounting has evolved into a sophisticated discipline with its own set of principles and standards. In addition to serving the needs of businesses, accounting also serves the broader needs of society. For example, accounting information is used by governments to track tax revenues and by investors to make investment decisions. Accounting also plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of financial markets by providing reliable information about the financial performance of companies.</p><p>We may naturally align to the framing of finance as long it is not called error correction, doing the same, preventing change and improving stability, but the reality is, no matter how hard we try, they are one and the same. If you naturally align with an error correction ontology, you may have a more accounting mindset, whereby you will naturally look for order amidst chaos and create stable processes out of a loose set of desires.</p><p>There are exceptions: fraud, bribery and corruption.</p> How do other business functions align? <p>Marketing, sales, and product development appear to tend towards error creation, with operations, legal, and accounting systems tending towards error correction.&nbsp; It is possible that where technology and HR sits is critical to the overall balancing culture of the company and if the company favours error creation (creative, imaginative, innovative) or error correction (stable, historical, and dutiful.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The descriptions above used “tend towards.” The basic function of accounting is to remove errors, but it also has to improve continually because of the necessity of continually correcting new errors. &nbsp; The basic function of marketing is creativity, never repeating campaigns and coming up with new and different ideas. But if marketing were only creative, it would not be able to align and build upon what is already there and how the market behaves.&nbsp; Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.&nbsp; All functions demand both, and we need to understand how the balance is created by the purpose, function, and culture of the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Teams define culture.&nbsp; Teams are made of individuals who are either going to be more aligned to error-creating or error-correcting. Whilst we prefer to label individuals as&nbsp; “creative” or “checklist,” these do describe the characteristics, leadership attitudes, and biases that are critical to determining what function a department actually fulfils.&nbsp; These balances are not simple; indeed, they are complex.</p><p>Creative flair for error creation is tempered by the history and context of error correction.</p><p></p><p>A board needs to comprehend, appreciate, and understand if the balance is right. If a board is not diverse in thought, skill, and discipline, that balance may not be found or is easily lost, and the culture of one or the other can lead a business to failure, especially with an overly dominant financial focus as accounting tends to focus on being financially risk-averse. &nbsp;It is worth noting that balance, in this sense, is not about equality; the balance creates enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The balance must create enough errors to improve continually (agile) but with enough error correction to be resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Wider perspective <p></p><br><p>The error creation/correction model can scale to other forms of thinking:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Fear can be seen as error creation, whereas trust is error correction.&nbsp; There is undoubtedly a complex relationship between fear and trust that is both immediate and develops over time.&nbsp; Trust can correct fear that is related to an error originating from the past, but trust can also create a new path.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The concept of 'self' is error-creation, whereby we tend to express our individuality within a system of societal norms and memory which seeks stability and error correction.&nbsp; Individuals create eros, and their movement (many followers) creates a change which eventually becomes the new normal.</p>  <p>Freedom allows for error creation, whilst control demands correction from deviation.&nbsp; Too much freedom or too much control both appear terminal based on history. Prison and punishment systems struggle with this balance on so many levels, even using “error correction” as an idea in a different context.</p>  <p>Both error creation and error correction harbour risk, and both can be seen as creating more risk.&nbsp; Benefit&nbsp; demands an understanding of the value and cost of moving away from the known and can be seen as both more error creation (advantage) and correction (prevention).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>These examples are non-linear, and balance does not necessarily mean 50:50 and perhaps a less controversial language might be to substitute “error” with “difference.” The difference is the way in which two things, when compared, are not the same.&nbsp;</p><p>What else have you observed that represents two sides of a dynamic complex relationship, where one or both favour error creation and one error correction?&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth pondering about how and why we try to reduce the complexity of the balance into a single ROI figure in order to pass a hurdle and justify a decision.&nbsp; Can ROI ever capture consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What happens when we get it wrong? <p>Wrong, in this case, is where the balance is lost, and too many errors or too much correction ends in survival becoming unviable, with death being the only inevitable outcome. Business failure.&nbsp;</p><p>In the wild, a mutation that does not provide an advantage can easily be lost, and an overly controlled stable environment can dwindle to nothing if it fails to adapt to modernity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the economics of a business, the same is true: an innovation will not give an advantage forever, and the next innovation may not provide a new advantage. Equally, too much control and stability as a result of finance controls and regulation will result in the company becoming outdated in comparison to its environment or ecosystem - the result is the company or sector will enter a slow decline. #banking</p><p>A company does not exist on its own but in a complex ecosystem, and the balance may be achieved within the ecosystem and not just in the health or balance of a single company. In nature, the predator-prey model often forgets that the rabbit/fox needs other food and water, as well as the rabbit/fox having other threats.&nbsp; A company may well be out of balance in itself, but balance is remediated by others in the ecosystem, which is why strategy is not just about innovation, but the balance that is maintained by the ecosystem in order to create dynamic stability. It is important to understand who is moving towards stability and who is moving towards innovation; otherwise, the whole ecosystem itself can fall out of balance.</p><p>This highlights that any theory of error creation/correction must embrace relevance on at least four levels: individual, team, organisation, and ecosystem.&nbsp; A purpose may articulate what you want, but a purpose that is not dynamic in its ability to move and balance error creation and error correction at all levels is going to be short-lived.&nbsp;</p> Reframing AI away from “Intelligent Machinery.” <p>Defining the term 'artificial intelligence' presents us with a problem. The problem is that human intelligence fundamentally depends on a balanced system where error creation and error correction co-exist.&nbsp; Many of the most historic creative minds, insightful thinkers and leading scientists were neurodiverse (error-creating) and spent their lives fighting systems of error correction (academic, power, religious.)&nbsp; Flat earthers, climate deniers and Copernicus with the heliocentric model of the solar system are a few that history has thrown up.&nbsp;</p><p>Using the lens of error creation and correction, we can say that we are building ever more advanced error correction systems from big data tools, identification and removal of bias, better accounting, DNA manipulation, eradicating viruses, and using tech to provide compliance, governance, and oversight.&nbsp; In this perspective, it becomes more obvious that we do not currently focus on using ever more advanced tech to actually create errors as a route for advantage. If AI were like nature, an AI that only corrects or one that only creates errors could not survive.&nbsp;</p><p>If AI only needs to find and fix errors through the error correction lens, then AI will only be half a system and will be artificial but not intelligent. Data can be error-correcting and error-generating, but if we don't know this part of the ontology, we will never be able to gain more intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>The diagram below expands on this thinking to suggest that there is more than just one system on the error-correcting side.&nbsp; Error correction is more complex as it needs to amend errors which are not advantageous, and promote the development of errors which are. It is equally true that the error creation side has to have a system that moderates errors, or it would be too wild, and create destruction before the opportunity arose to test if a new trait provided an advantage. The closed-loop system is full of complex feedback loops to both control and promote; with both immediacy and delay.&nbsp; What is evident is that the system is neither stable nor unstable but has pulsing oscillation, which keeps it in a delicate balance.&nbsp;</p>   The axis of thriving and death <p>What came first, the chicken or the egg?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In a world where error correction (driven by the desire to use experience and the past as the solid foundation) is the initiation or y-axis, and the response is error creation (creativity, invention and innovation) or x-axis, we get thinking dominated by being controlled first, and being unstable second, which creates the volatility and ambiguity that allows for dynamic stability, it is a place where we can thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of law, policy, study, social norms, culture, and data.</p><p>In a world where error creation (driven by a desire for change, innovation, creativity, adventuring, pioneering, and invention) is the initiation, and the response is error correction (finance, risk management and control), we get instability dominating our thinking, and the environment is unbalanced, yet still in equilibrium.&nbsp; Complexity and uncertainty become leading ideas. In a place of unbalanced equilibrium, we are still able to thrive and grow. This could be our economic and political world viewed through the lens of research, hypothesis, invention, ideation, hope, and imagination.</p><p>It would appear that:&nbsp; dynamic stability + unbalanced equilibrium creates a balanced system that thrives.</p><p>What we should avoid are too much control and too much error - the question is, what do any of these worlds look or feel like, and how will we recognise them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The last thing a fish will become aware of is water teaches us that our current environment can feel normal when in reality, it may be out of balance.&nbsp; If we cannot see or know the balance, we have lost our propensity to manage change.&nbsp;</p> Why does all this matter <p>Leadership through one lens (unbalanced equilibrium) depends on being curious, whereas leadership from the other lens (dynamic stability) demands a focus on efficiency and effectiveness, but both perspectives need to continually improve how they inform and direct decision making.&nbsp;</p><p>We often see fantastic single-idea books that encourage leadership to optimise decision-making towards growth driven by error creation (how to disrupt yourself, agile, reinvention, cross the chasm, the new normal, change management, repurpose, innovation, re-engineering); it is likely, with such a narrow focus, to lead to poor decision-making, as the benefits and outcomes for error correction are ignored or suppressed.&nbsp; This is equally true in reverse, and there are equally brilliant books that optimise for error correction (efficiency, time management, effectiveness, infinite, leadership, tick lists, ethics, merit, principles, governance, accounting, and statistics).&nbsp;</p><p>If we try to get the balance for a better outcome from both error creation and correction, we will likely get sub-optimal results for both.&nbsp; Even with all the resources in the world, nature still ebbs and flows, as it cannot optimise for both and has learnt to make compromises, but we thrive because of it.&nbsp;</p><p>The title of this long read is “Why finding purpose feels impossible”; on reflection, the title could equally have been “Why a singular unified business purpose is impossible for everyone”. If we accept we have to balance error creation and correction, a single purpose has to favour or optimise for one or the other, which means that many employees and stakeholders feel the stated “purpose” does not align with or represent them. Balance is rarely 50:50, it can come in many forms: 0:100, 80:20, 99:1, etc. Balance exists, but the context is dependent on the purpose you are trying to achieve. This is where exceptional leadership comes into its own.</p> The takeaway for leadership <p>A critically important task/ role for leadership, the board, executives, and governance are to determine:</p>  <p>If our organisation favours error-creation or error-correction</p>  <p>Where is the balance for our organisation?</p>  <p>Are we in balance? If not, are we planning to or sourcing the skills necessary to improve balance?</p>  <p>How is balance in our ecosystem achieved, what are others doing?</p>  <p>Is our organisation/ecosystem in or out of balance, and does our action change anything?</p>  <p>The most important purpose for leadership, the board, executives and governance are to understand and determine if our organisation and ecosystem are in or out of balance.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with strategy and purpose is that we can have agreed and have an agreement, but that does not mean we agree.&nbsp; Working out balance is complex, whereas how we are performing against the plan is rather more straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To determine and find balance, we must shift our focus from individual, singular and expert towards collective, group and ecosystem.&nbsp; Whilst the former is positioned as strong leadership, and the latter is portrayed as introducing delay, compromise, tension and conflict - it is evident that to thrive, we must know how to find and deliver balance.&nbsp;</p><br><br>

 Networks are everywhere, and they are valuable. Consider: 
 
 The road network. Imagine you’d need a different car for each piece of road. Life as
we know it today would be utterly impossible without it. 
 The phone network. To pick two random use cases, without it you couldn’t call customer
service or summon an ambulance. 
 The Visa credit card network (and its competitors). You would have to us

<p>Networks are everywhere, and they are valuable. Consider:</p>
 
 The road network. Imagine you’d need a different car for each piece of road. Life as
we know it today would be utterly impossible without it. 
 The phone network. To pick two random use cases, without it you couldn’t call customer
service or summon an ambulance. 
 The Visa credit card network (and its competitors). You would have to use cash instead,
but arguably everybody accepting the same currency forms a network, too, and
without that, we’d be back to barter. Which would be really inconvenient. 
 The world-wide-web.  Some of us are old enough to remember the times before. No on-demand news,
music, entertainment, chatting, reservations, e-commerce and all the others. 
 
<p>Generally, larger networks are more valuable than smaller networks: if you are the
only person in the world who has a telephone, that phone is not worth much. If there
are 2 people with phones, you can at least call each other. With 3 people, 3 different
conversations can be had. With 4, it’s 6. With 100, it’s 100*99/2 = 4950 possible
conversations, not counting multi-party conference calls. This quadratic growth of value
with the size of the network applies to all networks, according to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law">Metacalfe’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>But in this post, I want to look at another dimension of networks that impacts their
values, and that is whether the network is “open” or “closed”. There are lots of details
one could consider, but for our purposes here, we define a spectrum with two
extremes, and lots of gray in the middle:</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  Anybody can connect to the network and do what they like,
      nobody's permission is required.
  
  Who may connect, and what they may do on the network,
      is closely controlled by the network proprietor.
 

<p>There can be all sorts of network proprietors, but for simplicity in this post, assume
it’s a single entity, like Meta.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  The public road system.
  
  Roads on a private golf course.
 
 
  Buyers and sellers using cash.
  Buyers and sellers using Visa.
  Internal company accounting system.
 
 
  The world-wide web.
  
  Facebook. Twitter. The old AOL walled garden.
 

<p>If you had two networks that are otherwise identical in size, structure and function,
except that one is open and the other one is closed, which of those two is more valuable?</p>
<p>Valuable to whom?</p>

 
  Fully open
  Somewhere in between
  Entirely closed
 
 
  
   Valuable to:
    
     Platform proprietor: no, does not exist 
     Network users: yes 
    
  
  
  
  
   Valuable to:
    
     Platform proprietor: yes 
     Network users: yes 
    
  
 

<p>It’s clear that if both networks produce the same amount of total value, the open
network is more valuable to its users (such as individuals and organizations),
for the simple reason that there is no network proprietor who needs to get paid! The
value entirely accrues to the network participants.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow">Cory Doctorow</a> recently coined the
term <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enshittification">enshittification</a> to describe
the inevitable march of platform/network proprietors, over time, to siphon off an ever-larger percentage
of value generated by their network, to the detriment of its users. So the older a
closed network, the less value it provides to its users. (Facebook users experience this
every day: ever more ads, ever less genuine human engagement. While, for its business users,
ad prices go up.) In an open network, on the other hand, the value that accrues to the users
does not deteriorate over time.</p>
<p>And finally: could AOL, the online service, ever have provided the same value as
the open web? Of course absolutely not! Open networks allow many more technologists
and entrepreneurs to innovate in a gazillion different ways that would never be
possible in a closed network. As closed networks mature, not only do they
enshittify, but they also further and further discourage innovation by third parties,
while the opposite is true for open networks.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Fediverse. Which is more valuable today: the decentralized,
open social network called the Fediverse (with its thousands of independently operated
Mastodon, and other instances), or the poster closed social network, Facebook?</p>
<p>Clearly, Facebook. That’s because by all counts, Facebook today has order-of-magnitude
about 1000 times the number of users of the Fediverse. Same for Twitter, which has maybe
100 times the number of users of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>But the network effect is the only thing the closed social platforms have going for
themselves. All other parts of the value proposition favors the open social network
alternative. Think of this:</p>
 
 The Fediverse extracts far less / no value: no annoying ads, no user manipulation
favoring the business model of the network proprietor. 
 More functionality: it’s one interoperable social network with apps that emulate
Twitter, Facebook, Medium, Reddit, Goodreads, and many others! In the same network. 
 It’s entirely open for innovation, and innovators are building furiously as we speak.
By its nature, it’s permanently locked open for innovation, and there is no danger of
ever getting cut off from an API, facing sudden connection charges or drawing the wrath
of a gazillionaire. 
 
<p>So by the time the Fediverse has sufficient numbers of users, it’s game over for
proprietary social networks. This is true for both user categories in social networks:
individuals and businesses. (I assume here that businesses and the Fediverse will find
a way of accommodating each other, mainly by businesses behaving respectfully. If not, there
simply will be no businesses in the Fediverse.) Individuals will get more value from the
open network, and businesses will be far more profitable because there is no network operator
to pay and many products and services pop up all the time that won’t in the closed network.</p>
<p>Note that the critical “sufficient number of users” can likely be substantially smaller
than the user populations of those closed networks today, because all value accrues to
users and it’s not diminished by value extraction from a network proprietor. For many
of my own use cases, in many niches the Fediverse has critical mass today already.</p>
<p>Can the user advantage be overcome across the board? We will have to see. But if we add up just
numbers of active users of organizations that have publicly announced Fediverse plans as of the date that
I’m writing this, or even have products already in the market – Flipboard, Medium, Mozilla, Tumblr,
Wordpress and more – we’re already in the high 100’s of millions.</p>
<p>Those numbers look awfully close to the user numbers necessary to overcome Metcalfe’s Law.</p>
<p>tldr; The time to take the Fediverse seriously, for individuals and businesses, is now.
The value of the Fediverse for everybody is much higher than the value of any closed,
proprietary social network – other than the proprietary social network companies
themselves. And we won’t cry for them very much.</p>
<p>Note: <a href="https://fediforum.org">FediForum</a> is next week, where we’ll discuss this.</p>

<p>I recently engaged in a compelling discussion with Kevin Clark and Mike McGuire from CE neWorld about the crucial topic of organizational and personal identity. We explore the significance of personal data and the choices we must make as business leaders. As we dive deeper into this important conversation, I was curious to understand how can individuals solve “The Identity Nexus equation”?</p>
<p>Discussion Abstract:</p>
<p>As the world becomes increasingly digitized, personal data and identity management face new challenges from consumer opinion, regulations, and technology. In this informative session, I discuss the convergence of traditional organizational and people-centric approaches to personal data and identity management. Delving into the five domains of personal data, the dynamic landscape of personal data regulations, and new technologies that empower individuals to control and protect their data. I also introduce The Identity Nexus, and explore innovative strategies and tactics through a three-horizon framework that businesses can use to increase revenue, reduce costs, enhance customer experience, combat cybercrime, and comply with industry regulations. Check out the video to stay ahead of the curve in personal data and identity management.</p>

<p>In this post, Blazor and .NET 8 is used to implement a simple website. I took a .NET 7 project, updated it to .NET 8 and tried out some of the new features in .NET 8. </p>



<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad">https://github.com/damienbod/Hostedblazor8Aad</a></p>



<p></p>



 Setup 



<p>The project was setup using a .NET 7 project which implements an Azure AD authentication using best practice with a backend for frontend architecture and then updated to .NET 8. The security is implemented in the secure backend and the Blazor components are kept simple. The <a href="https://github.com/damienbod/Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template">Blazor.BFF.AzureAD.Template</a> template was used for this which takes care of all the project setup. At present no Microsoft template exists for implementing the security in this recommended way. The templates adds the security headers as best it can.</p>



<p>The project was updated to .NET 8 and all the Nuget packages as well.</p>


  &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net8.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
  


<p>Microsoft.Identity.Web is used to implement the OpenID Connect confidential client. An Azure App registration was created for this with the Web client and a user secret. You could also use a certificate instead of a secret which improves the token request in the second step of the OIDC code flow authentication. </p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The application was started and like in .NET 7 we still have the annoying console warnings because the debugging tools try to add inline scripts to our code. The inline scripts are blocked by the CSP and this should be required for all deployments. I like to develop my application as close as possible to my target deployments, so I always develop with the best possible CSP and HTTPS like in the deployed applications. This prevents having to fix CSP issues when we go live or having to fix links to CSS CDNs or whatever. </p>



<p>We also have a warning in the console logs looking for a JS map file from something we do not use. No idea where or what adds to my development. </p>



<p>2023-05-18 The CSP bug has no been fixed in the latest VS preview release</p>



<p><a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464">https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/browserlink-CSP-support-NET-7/10061464</a></p>







<p></p>



<p></p>



 Creating Random data from Arrays 



<p>In .NET 8 GetItems() was added to System.Random. I decide to create my test data using this. I created an array of objects and returned this as a span.</p>


  public static ReadOnlySpan&lt;MyGridData&gt; GetData()
{
	return _mydata.AsSpan();
}
  


<p>The Random.Shared.GetItems method can be used to return n-items from my span in a random way. I set this to 24 items which can be then displayed in the Grid.</p>


  [HttpGet]
public IEnumerable&lt;MyGridData&gt; Get()
{
	return Random.Shared.GetItems(MyData.GetData(), 24);
}
  


 Using QuickGrid in Blazor 



<p>The QuickGrid  component was also added in .NET 8. This provides simple Grid features.</p>



<p>The Nuget package needs to be added to the client (WASM) project.</p>


  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid
  


<p>The QuickGrid can be used in any Razor page in the WASM application. You need to add the using for the Grid and you can create the grid as required. The Grid has good documentation here:</p>



<p><a href="https://aspnet.github.io/quickgridsamples">https://aspnet.github.io/quickgridsamples</a></p>


  @page "/directapi"
@using HostedBlazorAad.Shared
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.QuickGrid
@inject IAntiforgeryHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory
@inject IJSRuntime JSRuntime

&lt;h3&gt;QuickGrid display using data  Direct API&lt;/h3&gt;

@if (myGridData == null)
{
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;QuickGrid Items="@FilteredItems" Pagination="@pagination"&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(p =&gt; p.Id)" Sortable="true" /&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(c =&gt; c.Name)" Sortable="true" Class="name"&gt;
        &lt;ColumnOptions&gt;
            &lt;div class="search-box"&gt;
                &lt;input type="search" autofocus @bind="nameFilter" @bind:event="oninput" placeholder="name..." /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/ColumnOptions&gt;
    &lt;/PropertyColumn&gt;

    &lt;PropertyColumn Property="@(p =&gt; p.Colour)" Sortable="true" /&gt;
&lt;/QuickGrid&gt;

&lt;Paginator State="@pagination" /&gt;
}

@code {

    private IEnumerable&lt;MyGridData&gt;? myApiData;
    private IQueryable&lt;MyGridData&gt; myGridData = new List&lt;MyGridData&gt;().AsQueryable();
    private PaginationState pagination = new PaginationState { ItemsPerPage = 8 };
    private string nameFilter = string.Empty;

    GridSort&lt;MyGridData&gt; rankSort = GridSort&lt;MyGridData&gt;
        .ByDescending(x =&gt; x.Name)
        .ThenDescending(x =&gt; x.Colour)
        .ThenDescending(x =&gt; x.Id);

    IQueryable&lt;MyGridData&gt;? FilteredItems =&gt; myGridData.Where(x =&gt; x.Name.Contains(nameFilter, StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase));

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        var client = await httpClientFactory.CreateClientAsync();

        var myApiData = await client.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;MyGridData[]&gt;("api/DirectApi");

        if (myApiData != null) myGridData = myApiData.AsQueryable();
    }
}
  


<p>The 24 random items are displayed in the grid using a paging and a sort with eight items per page. The is client side and not server side paging which is important if using large amounts of data.</p>







<p></p>



 Notes 



<p>Blazor and .NET 8 will change a lot and new templates and project types are being created for Blazor and .NET 8. Blazor United or whatever it will be called after the release will be a new type of Blazor project and the 3 projects structure will probably be reduced down to one. I hope the security will be improved and I don’t understand why Microsoft still do security in the WASM part of the application when it is hosted in an ASP.NET Core backend. </p>

<p>I wrapped up MEF World Conference with Ann Li discussing how personal data and identity are fueling the world’s economies. We review JP Morgan’s Vision for the future of personal data and identity management and a new path to value.</p>
<p>In today’s increasingly digital world, personal data and identity are powerful tools that organizations use to gain market insights, inform their go-to-market strategies, enhance customer experiences, and mitigate fraudulent activities. However, changes in consumer opinions, regulations, and technology are placing pressure on businesses to rethink their approach to managing personal data and identity. To stay competitive and build trust with customers, businesses must prioritize protecting and managing personal data and identity in a transparent, ethical, and secure manner</p>
<p>We delve into the significance of prioritizing the individual and enhancing customer experience. We also explore how emerging decentralized technologies can bring significant commercial and operational benefits to businesses when strategically embraced. Additionally, ecosystem engagement strategies that bold leaders can adopt to stay ahead of the ever-changing market demands.</p>

<p>
Welcome to episode 17 of the Steampipe+Mastodon series, in which we introduce a new subplot: timeline history. So far, the examples I’ve shown and discussed work with current timelines. We’ve seen SQL queries that fetch results from realtime calls to the Mastodon API, and Steampipe dashboards that display those results. But Steampipe isn’t just an API siphon, it’s also a Postgres database. As such it supports the transient tables created by Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper and plugins, but also enables you to create your own native tables as well. And you can use those native tables to accumulate data from the transient foreign tables.</p>
<p>
Because saving and searching Mastodon data is a controversial topic in the fediverse — none of us wants to recapitulate Big Social — I’ve focused thus far on queries that explore recent Mastodon flow, of which there are plenty more to write. But nobody should mind me remembering my own home timeline, so a few weeks ago I made a tool to read it hourly and add new toots to a Postgres table. </p>
<p>
Before you can add any toots to a table, of course, you’ve got to create that table. Here’s how I made this one.</p>
 create table mastodon_home_timeline as 
  select * from mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
Once created, the table can be updated with new toots like so.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    account,
    -- more
    -- columns
    username
  from
    mastodon_toot_home
  limit 200
)
insert into mastodon_home_timeline (
  account,
    -- more
    -- columns
  username
)
select
  *
from 
  data
where 
  id not in ( select t.id from mastodon_home_timeline t )
 
<p>
To run that query from a crontab, on a machine where Steampipe is installed, save it as mastodon_home_timeline.sql, then schedule it.</p>
 15 * * * * cd /home/jon/mastodon; steampipe query mastodon_home_timeline.sql
 
<p>
That’s it! Now the number reported by select count(*) from mastodon_home_timeline is growing hourly.</p>
<p>
I’ve only been collecting toots for a couple of weeks, and haven’t yet begun to explore that data yet; we’ll see what happens when we get there. Meanwhile, though, I want to show how such exploration can be a team exercise. </p>
<p>
A friend of mine, whom I’ll call Elvis, shares my interest in teasing out connections among people, servers, and hashtags. He could capture his own timeline using the method shown here. But since we’ll be looking at this data together, we agreed that I’ll gather both our timelines. To enable that, he shared a (revokable) Mastodon API token that I’ve used to configure Steampipe with credentials for both our accounts.</p>
 connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Steampipe’s foreign data wrapper turns each of these named connections into its own Postgres schema. Athough we happen to share the same home server, by the way, we needn’t. A team collaborating like this could pool timelines from mastodon.social and hachyderm.io and fosstodon.org and any other Mastodon-API-compatible server.</p>
<p>
(You can do the same thing with AWS or Slack or GitHub or other kind of account by defining <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#querying-multiple-connections">multiple connections</a>. Steampipe makes API calls concurrently across parallel connections.)</p>
<p>
With this configuration I can read my timeline like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_jon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
And Elvis’ like so.</p>
 select * from mastodon_social_elvis.mastodon_toot_home limit 200
 
<p>
If I want to query both in realtime, for example to count the combined total, I can use a SQL UNION. Or I can define umbrella connection that <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/managing/connections#using-aggregators">aggregates</a> these two.</p>
 connection "all_mastodon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    type = "aggregator"
    connections = [ "mastodon_social_jon", "mastodon_social_elvis" ]
}

connection "mastodon_social_jon" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}

connection "mastodon_social_elvis" {
    plugin = "mastodon"
    server = "https://mastodon.social"
    access_token = "..."
}
 
<p>
Now the query select * from all_mastodon.mastodon_toot_home limit 200 makes API calls on behalf of both accounts — in parallel — and combines the results. When we follow the resulting URLs in order to reply or boost, we’ll do so as individual identities. And we’ll be able to use Steampipe queries and dashboards in that same single-user mode. But we’ll also be able to pool our timelines and point our queries and dashboards at the combined history. </p>
<p>
Will that prove interesting? Useful? That remains to be seen. I think it’s one of many experiments worth trying as the fediverse sorts itself out. And I see Steampipe as one laboratory in which to run such experiments. With SQL as the abstraction over APIs, aggregation of connections, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards as code</a>, you have all the ingredients needed to iterate rapidly, at low cost, toward shared Mastodon spaces tailored for teams or groups.</p>

<p>If you've got a sensor that isn't within easy range of wifi, then LoraWAN is a good solution. And event-based rules in picos are a convenient way to process the data.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87976c64-482c-464f-ba56-07e563f5fec4_1273x703.png">    </a> <p>I've got a pumphouse in Island Park, ID that I'm responsible for. Winter temperatures are often below 0°F (-18°C) and occasionally get as cold as -35°F (-37°C). We have a small baseboard heater in the pumphouse to keep things from freezing. That works pretty well, but one night last December, the temperature was -35°F and the power went out for five hours. I was in the dark, unable to know if the pumphouse was getting too cold. I determined that I needed a temperature sensor in the pumphouse that I could monitor remotely.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>The biggest problem is that the pumphouse is not close to any structures with internet service. Wifi signals just don't make it out there. Fortunately, I've got some experience using <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/">LoraWAN</a>, a long-range (10km), low-power, wireless protocol. This use-case  seemed perfect for LoraWAN. About a year ago, I <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/04/easier_iot_deployments_with_lorawan_and_helium.shtml">wrote about how to use LoraWAN and a Dragino LHT65 temperature and humidity sensor</a>along with <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">picos</a> to get temperature data over the Helium network.</p><p>I've installed a Helium hotspot near the pumphouse. The hotspot and internet router are both on battery backup. Helium provides a convenient console that allows you to register devices (like the LHT65) and configure flows to send the data from a device on the Helium network to some other system over HTTP. I created a pico to represent the pumphouse and routed the data from the LHT65 to a channel on that pico.</p><p>The pico does two things. First it processes the hearthbeat event that Helium sends to it, parsing out the parts I care about and raising another event so other rules can use the data. Processing the data is not simple because it's packed into a base64-encoded, 11-byte hex string. I won't bore you with the details, but it involves base64 decoding the string and splitting it into 6 hex values. Some of those a further packing data into specific bits of the 16-bit word, so binary operations are required. Those weren't built into the pico engine, so I added those libraries. If you're interested in the details of decoding, splitting, and unpacking the payload, check out the <code>receive_heartbeat </code>rule in <a href="https://github.com/windley/temperature-network/blob/main/io.picolabs.lht65.router.krl">this ruleset</a>.</p><p>Second, the <code>receive_heartbeat</code> rule raises the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event in the pico adding all the relevant data from the LHT65 heartbeat. Any number of rules could react to that event depending on what needs to be done. For example, they could store the event, alarm on a threshold, or monitor the battery status. What I wanted to do is plot the temperature so I can watch it over time and let other members of the water group check it too. I found a nice service called <a href="https://iotplotter.com/">IoTPlotter</a> that provides a basic plotting service on any data you post to it. I created a feed for the pumphouse data and wrote a rule in my pumphouse pico to select on the <code>lht65:new_readings</code> event and <code>POST</code> the relevant data, in the right format, to IoTPlotter. Here's that rule:</p> <code>rule send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter {  
  select when lht65 new_readings

  pre {  
    feed_id = "367832564114515476";  
    api_key = meta:rulesetConfig{["api_key"]};  
    payload = {"data": {  
                  "device_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "internalTemp"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "probe_temperature": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "probeTemp"]}, 
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "humidity": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", "humidity"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ],  
                  "battery_voltage": [  
                    {"value": event:attrs{["readings", 
                                           "battery_voltage"]},  
                     "epoch": event:attrs{["timestamp"]}}  
                  ]}  
              };  
  }

  http:post("http://iotplotter.com/api/v2/feed/" + feed_id,  
     headers = {"api-key": api_key},  
     json = payload  
  ) setting(resp);  
}</code> <p>The rule, <code>send_temperature_data_to_IoTPlotter</code> is not very complicated. You can see that most of the work is just reformatting the data from the event attributes into the <a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">right structure for </a><a href="https://iotplotter.com/docs/?id=6ae07dbc091570630981c824">IoTPlotter</a>. The result is a <a href="https://iotplotter.com/user/feed/367832564114515476">set of plots</a> that looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F881da1f6-1b9f-4f14-9be9-9920b7089877_1712x1167.png">    </a> <p>Pretty slick. If you're interested in the data itself, you're seeing the internal temperature of the sensor (orange line) and temperature of an external probe (blue line). We have the temperature set pretty high as a buffer against power outages. Still, it's not using that much power because the structure is very small. Running the heater only adds about $5/month to the power bill. Pumping water is much more power intensive and is the bulk of the bill. The data is choppy because, by default, the LHT65 only transmits a payload once every 20 minutes. This can be changed, but at the expense of battery life.</p><p>This is a nice, evented system, albeit simple. The event flow looks like this:</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12b76ed9-95a3-4f65-8ecc-f9803f3e3142_1014x225.png">   </a>Event Flow for Pumphouse Temperature Sensor <p>I'll probably make this a bit more complete by adding a rule for managing thresholds and sending a text if the temperature gets too low or too high. Similarly, I should be getting notifications if the battery voltage gets too low. The battery is supposed to last 10 years, but that's exactly the kind of situation you need an alarm on—I'm likely to forget about it all before the battery needs replacing. I'd like to experiment with sending data the other way to adjust the frequency of readings. There might be times (like -35°F nights when the power is out) where getting more frequent results would reduce my anxiety.</p><p>This was a fun little project. I've got a bunch of these LHT65 temperature sensors, so I'll probably generalize this by turning the IoTPlotter ruleset into a module that other rulesets can use. I may eventually use a more sophisticated plotting package that can show me the data for all my devices on one feed. I bought a LoraWAN soil moisture probe for my garden. I've also got a solar array at my house that I'd like to monitor myself and that will need a dashboard of some kind. If you've got a sensor that isn't within easy range of wifi, then LoraWAN is a good solution. And event-based rules in picos are a convenient way to process the data.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed wrapping up the event with Ann Li about Personal Data and Digital Identity Management. In our session, we discussed the importance of a new approach to personal data and identity management, and how it can unlock a new era of growth and consumer benefits for both organizations and customers. By embracing emerging decentralized strategies alongside existing centralized and federated ones, businesses can strategically add significant commercial and operational value while prioritizing the customer experience. Collaboration and participation within the ecosystem is also crucial in meeting the demands of our ever-evolving markets. Below is an abstract of out talk, and the session recording is above for those who couldn’t be there in person.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Personal Data and Digital Identity Management: A New Approach and Path to Value Personal data has underpinned growth across global economies for three decades and is now a systemically valuable resource. Personal data and identity management were two disparate yet connected subjects which are used to authenticate customers, drive research and insights, inform product strategies, mitigate fraud and other risks. A shift of customer attitudes, behaviors and regulation are placing individuals in greater control of their data and digital identity. This emerging data paradigm provides organizations an opportunity to access/unlock a new era of growth and consumer benefits for consumers and the organizations who serve them In this session, Ann Li, JP Morgan Chase’s Managing Director of International digital identity, investment strategy and partnerships, discusses JP Morgan Chase’s vision for a new approach to personal data and identity management and a new path to value. She will explore the importance of focusing on the individual and customer experience and how placing emerging decentralized personal data and identity strategies alongside existing centralized and federated ones have the potential—when embraced strategically—to add significant commercial and operational value to a business and people alike. She will also explore the imperative for collaborative ecosystem participation to meet the demands of our ever-evolving markets.</p>

<p>This post looks at onboarding users into an Azure DevOps team or project using Azure AD <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create">access packages</a>. The Azure AD access packages are part of the Microsoft Entra Identity Governance and provide a good solution for onboarding internal or external users into your tenant with access to the defined resources.</p>



<p></p>



 Flow for onboarding Azure DevOps members 



<p>Sometimes we develop large projects with internal and external users which need access to an Azure DevOps project for a fixed length of time which can be extended if required. These users only need access to the the Azure DevOps project and should be automatically removed when the contract or project is completed. Azure AD access packages are a good way to implement this. </p>



 Use an Azure AD group 



<p>The access to the Azure DevOps can be implemented by using an Azure security group in Azure AD. This security will be used to add team members for the Azure DevOps project. Azure AD access packages are used to onboard users into the Azure AD group and the Azure DevOps project uses the security group to define the members. The “azure-devops-project-access-packages” security group was created for this.</p>



 Setup the Azure DevOps 



<p>A new Azure DevOps project was created for this demo. The project has an URL on the dev.azure.com domain. The Azure DevOps needs to be attached to the Azure AD tenant. Only an Azure AD member with the required permissions can add a security group to the Azure DevOps project.</p>







<p>My test Azure DevOps project was created with the following URL. You can only access this if you are a member.</p>



<p><a href="https://dev.azure.com/azureadgroup-access-packages/use-access-packages">https://dev.azure.com/azureadgroup-access-packages/use-access-packages</a></p>



<p>The project team can now be onboarded.</p>



 Create the Azure AD P2 Access packages 



<p>To create an Azure AD P2 Access package, you can use the Microsoft Entra admin center. The access package can be created in the Entitlement management blade. </p>







<p>Add the security group from the Azure AD which you use for adding or removing users to the Azure DevOps project. Add the users as members.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The users onboarded using the access package are given a lifespan in the tenant for the access and can be extended or not as needed.</p>







<p></p>



<p>The users can be added using an access package link, or you can get an admin to assign users to the package. I created a second access package to assign any users to the package which can then be approved or rejected by the Azure DevOps project manager. </p>







<p></p>



<p>The Azure DevOps administrator can approve the access package and the Azure DevOps team member can access the Azure DevOps project using the public URL. The new member is added to the Azure security group using the access package. </p>







<p>An access package link would look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>, a new social media platform and <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, is unsurprisingly running up against the same challenges and limitations that Flickr, Twitter and many other social media platforms faced in the 2000s: passwords!</p>

<p></p>

<p>You wouldn't give your Gmail password to Yelp, right? Why should you give your Bluesky password to random apps either!</p>

<p>The current official Bluesky iOS application unsurprisingly works by logging in with a username and password. It's the easiest form of authentication to implement, even if it is the least secure. Since Bluesky and the AT Protocol are actually intending on creating an entire ecosystem of servers and clients, this is inevitably going to lead to a complete security disaster. In fact, we're already seeing people spin up prototype Bluesky clients, sharing links around to them, which result in users being taught that there's nothing wrong with handing out their account passwords to random website and applications that ask for them. Clearly there has to be a solution, right?</p>

<p>The good news is there has been a solution that has existed for about 15 years -- OAuth! This is exactly the problem that OAuth was created to solve. How do we let third party applications access data in a web service without sharing the password with that application.</p>

<p>What's novel about Bluesky (and other similarly decentralized and open services like WordPress, Mastodon, Micro.blog, and others), is that there is an expectation that any user should be able to bring any client to any server, without prior relationships between client developers and servers. This is in contrast to consumer services like Twitter and Google, where they limit which developers can access their API by going through a developer registration process. I wrote more about this problem in a previous blog post, <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>

<p>There are two separate problems that Bluesky can solve with <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a>, especially a flavor of OAuth like <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a>.</p>

 
 How apps can access data in the user's Personal Data Server (PDS) 
 How the user logs in to their PDS 
 

 How apps can access the user's data 

<p>This is the problem OAuth solved when it was originally created, and the problem ATProto currently has. It's obviously very unsafe to have users give their PDS password to every third party application that's created, especially since the ecosystem is totally open so there's no way for a user to know how legitimate a particular application is. OAuth solves this by having the application redirect to the OAuth server, the user logs in there, and then the application gets only an access token.</p>

<p>ATProto already uses <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-session">access tokens and refresh tokens</a>, (although they strangely call them <code>accessJwt</code> and <code>refreshJwt</code>) so this is a small leap to make. OAuth support in mobile apps has gotten a lot better than it was 10 years ago, and there is first class support for this pattern on iOS and Android to make the experience work better than the much older plain redirect model used to work a decade ago.</p>

<p>Here is what the rough experience the user would see when logging in to an app:</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there (however they log in is not relevant to the app, it could be with a password, via email magic link, a passkey, or even delegated login to another provider) 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p><br></p>

<p>Most of this is defined in the core OAuth specifications. The part that's missing from OAuth is:</p>

 
 discovering an OAuth server given a server name 
 and how clients should be identified when there is no client preregistration step. 
 

<p>That's where <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> fills this in. With IndieAuth, the user's authorization server is discovered by fetching the web page at their URL. IndieAuth avoids the need for client registration by also using URLs as OAuth <code>client_id</code>s.</p>

<p>This does mean IndieAuth assumes there is an HTML document hosted at the URL the user enters, which works well for web based solutions, and might even work well for Bluesky given the number of people who have already rushed to set their Bluesky handle to the same URL as their personal website. But, long term it might be an additional burden for people who want to bring their own domain to Bluesky if they aren't also hosting a website there.</p>

<p>There's a new discussion happening in the OAuth working group to enable this kind of authorization server discovery from a URL which could rely on DNS or a well-known endpoint. This is in-progress work at the IETF, and I would love to have ATProto/Bluesky involved in those discussions!</p>

 How the user logs in to their PDS 

<p>Currently, the AT Protocol specifies that login happens with a username and password to get the tokens the app needs. Once clients start using OAuth to log in to apps, this method can be dropped from the specification, which interestingly opens up a lot of new possibilities.</p>

<p>Passwords are inherently insecure, and there has been a multi-year effort to improve the security of every online service by adding two-factor authentication and even moving away from passwords entirely by using <a href="https://oauth.net/passkeys/">passkeys</a> instead.</p>

<p>Imagine today, Bluesky wants to add multifactor authenticaiton to their current service. There's no good way to add this to the existing API, since the Bluesky client will send the password to the API and expect an access token immediately. If Bluesky switches to an OAuth flow described above, then the app never sees the password, which means the Bluesky server can start doing more fun things with multifactor auth as well as even passwordless flows!</p>

 Logging in with a passkey 

<p>Here is the same sequence of steps but this time swapping out the password step for a passkey.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their handle or server name (e.g. <code>jay.bsky.social</code>, <code>bsky.social</code>, or <code>aaronpk.com</code>) 
 The app discovers the user's OAuth server, and launches an in-app browser 
 The user lands on their own PDS server, and logs in there with a passkey 
 The user is presented with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app (this step is optional, but it's up to the OAuth server whether to do this and what it looks like) 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is already a great improvement, and the nice thing is app developers don't need to worry about implementing passkeys, they just need to implement OAuth! The user's PDS implements passkeys and abstracts that away by providing the OAuth API instead.</p>

 Logging in with IndieAuth 

<p>Another variation of this would be if the Bluesky service itself supported delegating logins instead of managing any passwords or passkeys at all.</p>

<p>Since Bluesky already supports users setting their handle to their own personal website, it's a short leap to imaging allowing users to authenticate themselves to Bluesky using their website as well!</p>

<p>That is the exact problem IndieAuth already solves, with quite a few implementations in the wild of services that are IndieAuth providers, including <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and many options for <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth#Server_Implementations">self-hosting</a> and endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's look at what the sequence would look like for a user to use the bsky.social PDS with their custom domain handle mapped to it.</p>

<p></p>

 
 The user launches the app and taps the "Sign In" button 
 The user enters their server name (e.g. <code>bsky.social</code>) 
 The app discovers the OAuth server and launches an in-app browser 
 The user enters their handle, and bsky.social determines whether to prompt for a password or do an IndieAuth flow to their server 
 The user is redirected to their own website (IndieAuth server) and authenticates there, and is then redirected back to bsky.social 
 The user is presented by bsky.social with a dialog asking if they want to grant access to this app 
 The application receives the authorization code and exchanges it at the PDS for an access token and refresh token 
 

<p>This is very similar to the previous flows, the difference being that in this version, bsky.social is the OAuth server as far as the app is concerned. The app never sees the user's actual IndieAuth server at all.</p>

 Further Work 

<p>These are some ideas to kick off the discussion of improving the security of Bluesky and the AT Protocol. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this! There is of course a lot more detail to discuss about the specifics, so if you're interested in diving in, a good place to start is reading up on <a href="https://oauth.net">OAuth</a> as well as the <a href="https://indieauth.net">IndieAuth</a> extension to OAuth which has solved some of the problems that exist in the space.</p>

  <p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@caseynewton">Casey Newton</a> at
<a href="https://www.platformer.news/">Platformer</a> reports he has e-mail confirmation from
<a href="https://meta.com/">Meta</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Meta is] exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text
updates. We believe there’s an opportunity for a separate space where creators and
public figures can share timely updates about their interests
(<a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/meta-is-building-a-decentralized">Source</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their new app is codenamed P92, and according to a separate report by
<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/">Moneycontrol</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… will support ActivityPub, the decentralised social networking protocol powering
Twitter rival Mastodon and other federated apps
(<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/meta-mulls-a-twitter-competitor-codenamed-p92-that-will-be-interoperable-with-mastodon-10223961.html">Source</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>be Instagram-branded and will allow users to register/login to the app through their
Instagram credentials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, the good news:</p>
<p>This is a huge validation of the decentralized social network
known as the Fediverse, built around a set of internet protocol standards that include
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_(format)">ActivityStreams</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">WebFinger</a> as well as a set of commonly
implemented unofficial extensions. The Fediverse has been around for some years, but
recently came to more widespread prominence through its leading implementation,
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, as the leading alternative of increasingly erratic
(and increasingly many other things, but I digress…) Twitter.</p>
<p>That’s because only when alternatives are actually beginning to look like they might become serious
threats to incumbents – and Meta is the market-leading incumbent in social media by far – do
incumbents start paying attention and then connect to them. Or, as it may be the case here,
simply leak that they might be connecting in the future but never actually will. We don’t know
which of those will turn out to be true, but it doesn’t matter: both validate
the Fediverse as a serious competitor to Meta.</p>
<p>This is on the heels of recent Fediverse adoption by companies such as
<a href="https://mozilla.social/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://me.dm/">Medium</a>,
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-wildebeest-the-fediverse-on-cloudflare/">CloudFlare</a>
and <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/inside-flipboard/flipboard-mastodon-federated/">Flipboard</a>.
Apple now has Mastodon
<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/16/ios-16-4-imessage-rich-previews-for-mastodon-posts/">content previews in iMessage</a>.
Even Microsoft <a href="https://dotnet.social/@dotnet/109990445819820814">has been spotted</a>
in the Fediverse a few days ago.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>I have some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge#Culture">Brooklyn Bridges for sale</a>.
You get a Brooklyn Bridge for free if you believe that a company like Meta would
connect to the Fediverse, and be a perfect citizen the way the Fediverse expects you
to be today. Including:</p>
 
 No ads; 
 No tracking; 
 No algorithms that favor business outcomes for Meta over your wellbeing; 
 Respect for different cultures, minorities, non-mainstream behavior etc.; 
 A rich toolset for filtering and blocking according what you decide you want to
filter and block, not Meta; 
 The ability to <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/">move from one host to another</a>
without having to build your network from scratch; 
 The ability to pick who is your system administrator and moderator, from models
that are essential centrally managed to full-fledged self-managed, user-owned
<a href="https://social.coop/">cooperatives</a>; 
 The ability, and encouragement, to innovate with new apps; 
 and so forth. 
 
<p>Instead, based on the history of technology, the chances are overwhelming that such an app
would be used by Meta with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace, extend and extinguish strategy</a>,
at the end of which the Fediverse would either have become irrelevant or effectively
been taken over by Meta. So the much-heralded alternative to Twitter would become …
Meta? I sure hope not.</p>
<p>If you think that is unlikely, read up on some of the historical examples
listed on that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Wikipedia page</a>.
Merely being based on open standards and having a million+ strong user community does not
protect you at all. Instead, I would say the attack happens every single time a network
dominated by an incumbent (here: social media) is threatened by a more open network. And it
succeed, at least partially, more often than not. Here it is Meta’s $100b+ business that’s
under strategic threat, of course they will protect it and use any means they can think of
to do so.</p>
<p>It does not help that the Fediverse today is chronically underfunded and has corresponding
difficulty to compete at the same speed as somebody like Meta can. Actually, “unfunded”
is a better term because the amounts are so small. There are many unpaid contributions,
the Fediverse largely being open source and all, but I’d be surprised if more than $10m per year
are spent in total on the entire Fediverse today, likely it’s far less. If Meta can burn
more than $10b – that’s one entire annual fediverse spend every 8 hours! –
on a very doubtful Metaverse project, they surely could find the same amount of money to
protect their core business.</p>
<p>And that’s just one of the many issues we need to solve to protect, and grow, the beautiful
thing we currently have with the Fediverse.</p>
<p>So what shall we do about all this?</p>
<p>(I welcome your comments – in the Fediverse! Find me at <a href="https://social.coop/@J12t">@j12t@social.coop</a>.)</p>
<p>(Also, I’m co-organizing <a href="https://fediforum.org">FediForum</a>, an online unconference at
the end of March, where we will surely discuss this and other issues. And celebrate the
Fediverse, because there is much to celebrate! Join us?)</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest installment in the KERI Tutorial Series! In a <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/">prior article</a> we learned how to use KERI to sign and verify simple messages. This tutorial goes to the full depth of issuing and verifying credentials (ACDCs).</p>



<p>We outfit our team of explorers bound on a treasure hunting journey with high tech security tags so the Gatekeeper will recognize them and permit them entrance into the most rewarding, yet dangerous, caverns of the secret underground chambers beneath the Osireion at Abydos. </p>



 Egyptian Story Time 



<p>An ancient city in Egypt from the time of the Pharaohs Abydos has long been known as a burial and memorial site for the ancient rulers. Yet, until recently, what had been kept a secret is the true purpose of Abydos and the Osireion, an entrance to an underground world full of bounty and treasure where the Egyptian rulers stored their most precious things. </p>



<p>Even with this revelation few could master the secret of how to travel between the Osireion and this underground world. Only two ever reliably figured it out, first the wise Ramiel and then his strong student Zaqiel. After they retrieved all the riches and treasure they wanted they realized they had an opportunity on their hands as guides for future explorers. Thus ATHENA was born.</p>



 

 Check out the 5 minute intro to this post and the ATHENA Network tutorial series!



 Opportunity 



<p>To establish a new standard in treasure hunting trust, and to capitalize on their opportunity, Ramiel and Zaqiel formed the Abydos Treasure Hunting Expedition Navigators Assembly (ATHENA) and began looking for a technology partner to build their Journey Mark trust system. Ramiel took on the role of the Wise Man to evaluate, grant marks to, and guide treasure hunters to Abydos while Zaqiel, the stronger of the two, took on the role of the Osireion Gatekeeper to ensure only those accepted by Ramiel would be given the opportunity to learn to travel to the underground world.</p>



 What ATHENA seeks to create 



<p>According to ATHENA, explorers desiring entrance through the Osireion must present a verifiable, secure proof signed by the Wise Man in order to be accepted by the Gatekeeper. Potential explorers must signify their intent to embark on a journey by presenting the Wise Man with another secure proof. </p>



<p>The diagram below shows the end state of their desired network.</p>


 
 


<p>On a practical note, get some refreshments and settle in as this post is large and contains many parts. It may take a few sessions to fully absorb the material depending on your existing familiarity with KERI and ACDC and the related Github repositories.</p>



 You meet the two 



<p>So how did you ever come to meet up with Ramiel and Zaqiel at ATHENA? It turns out the story is more believable than you might think.</p>


 
 


<p>While on a casual stroll at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) you had the good fortune of bumping into Ramiel and Zaqiel and they asked you how you would build the ATHENA security system. Since you had just left Dr. Samuel Smith’s session on composable event streaming representation (CESR) and had earlier been to Drummond Reed’s session KERI for Muggles where you learned about key event receipt infrastructure (KERI) and authentic chained data containers (ACDC), you realized they were the best decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) available and figured this would be the right tool to get the job done for ATHENA.</p>


 
 


<p>After hearing the details from Ramiel you became excited about the opportunity. You enthusiastically shook hands with them and began your work. Then, feeling a little in over your head and hoping for a concise and useful guide on KERI and ACDC to get you started on your development path, you hear Kaliya Identity Woman Young casually mention a link in the session notes she hounded the session presenter to write down. Grateful for her efforts you began to feel a sense of relief as you turned to the IIW QiQo site and found this blog post. A rush of hope and encouragement came and you dug in realizing you found the KERI manual you needed to get a simple prototype up and running.</p>



<p>Your job is to make this all happen.</p>



 What you can expect to learn 



 
 All of the components that are required for a basic KERI network including configuration 



 ACDC Credential Schema Creation, Issuance, and Revocation 



 KERI Command Line Interface (kli) and the (now deprecated) KERI Mark I Agent REST API  



 To learn about the KERIpy code. There are multiple references to important parts of the KERIpy codebase strewn throughout this tutorial. 



 A fair bit about BASH scripting if you read through the workflow.sh script. 
 



 Characters 



<p>Our Explorer team includes the following cast of characters.</p>



<p>Richard the Explorer!</p>


 
 


<p>Elayne the Librarian!</p>

<p>Now that you’ve met the team let’s get going. We have a lot to do!</p>



 Outline 



<p>As you can see we start with a visual of where we are going, cover concepts briefly, perform environment setup, and then a quick review of major terminology, and it is off to the races with the admittance workflow. From schema writing to network setup and finally to issuance, presentation, and revocation this tutorial takes you through the basics for using KERI and ACDC.</p>

<p>For now, let’s go to Abydos!</p>



 Going to the Osireion at Abydos 


 
 


 Our Task 



 
 Create the network foundation. 



 Create digital identities for each involved party. 



 Give a verifiable journey description to each interested explorer. 



 Request a Journey Mark for each explorer from the Wise Man. 



 As the Wise Man issue the Journey Mark to each member of the explorer party. 



 Present the Journey Marks to the Gatekeeper and grant access to the Osireion at Abydos. 
 



 Environment Setup 



<p>Check your environment-specific platform installation instructions for additional clarity though use the “All Platforms” list for a list of dependencies that ultimately must be installed on your machine and available from the command line.</p>

 <code>$ brew install libsodium</code> # warning, doesn’t work.<br># See above instructions on libsodium installation from the tarball to get things working on a Mac. You need Libsodium on your path, which <code>sudo make install</code> does. 



 <code>$ pip install maturin</code> # if you haven’t already 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “1.0.0”. 
 
 
 



 Windows 



<p>Thanks to Jim Martin for providing these Windows instructions.</p>



<p>See the <a href="https://kentbull.com/2023/01/27/keri-tutorial-series-kli-sign-and-verify-with-heartnet/#windows-manual-setup">Manual Setup with Windows</a> section of the KLI with Heartnet tutorial for instructions on setting up KERI on Windows.</p>



 Jump to the end with the <code>workflow.sh</code> script 



<p>If you want to quickly start up a network rather than working through the entire blog post piece by piece then you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to start the whole network and perform all of the actions including schema linking, configuration file writing, witness network startup, controller configuration and startup, OOBI configuration, credential issuance, and credential revocation.</p>



<p>The workflow script accepts a few different ways of running it:</p>



 <code># from within the abydos-tutorial directory

#
# Option 1: run with the KLI and no clearing
./workflow.sh

# this will run the entire workflow yet will not clean up the ~/.keri, 
# ~/.sally, or the /usr/local/var/keri directories so you will need
# to manually clear those out in order to run the workflow script again.

#
# Option 2: run with the KLI and the clearing option
./workflow.sh -c true

# this runs the entire workflow using the KLI and clears out the KERI 
# directories mentioned above

#
# Option 3: run with the KERI Agent (Mark I - deprecated) and the
#           clearing option
./workflow.sh -a true -c true

# this runs the workflow using the KLI only where absolutely necessary
# and then cURL requests to the Agent API to perform the majority of the 
# workflow</code> 



<p>This is a great way to get you up and running. The entire workflow takes only 3 minutes for the KLI flow and 2.5 minutes for the Agent workflow. Reading through the BASH script may be the fastest way for you to learn how to use KERI if you are ready for that level of detail.</p>



 ATHENA Network 



<p>The ATHENA network includes:</p>



 
 three witnesses 



 four controllers (with one custom controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper) 



 four agents, one for each controller (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



 a credential caching server 



 four distinct credential types. 



 a webhook 
 



<p>You will, of course, set up all of the configuration files and keystores for each witness and controller as well as perform all of the OOBI configuration for the network to function. See below for an overview.</p>



 Network Overview 


 
 


 Controllers 



<p>There is one controller each for Richard, Elayne, Zaqiel, and Ramiel. You will write the configuration files for each controller and create and incept their keystores.</p>



 Custom Controller 



<p>The one custom controller is the one for Zaqiel, the Abydos Gatekeeper controller. This controller needs to be customized in order to make the access control decisions for Abydos. This includes custom credential validators and presentation response payload constructors.</p>



 Witnesses 



<p>The same three witnesses are used for all of the controllers. Using the same witnesses for everything isn’t required and would be bad practice, though it simplifies the architecture for this post. You could easily use separate witnesses per controller with just a bit more tedious work. You will write the witness configuration files for each witness and set them up using the KLI.</p>



 Credential Caching Server 



<p>The vLEI-server from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">vLEI repository</a> is used as the credential caching server. It is a very simple HTTP fileserver that serves up ACDC schemas upon HTTP request. It would easily be implementable in any other language or tech stack if you needed it to be.</p>



 Agents 



<p>The agents use the current agent code in the KERIpy repository, called the Mark I Agent. This agent code is now deprecated even though it is nearly fully fleshed out. The new Mark II Agent is being developed as a separate repository in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA repository</a>.</p>



 Webhook 



<p>The webhook is a simple HTTP server built on the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a> library executed with <code>sally hook demo</code>. All it does is receive HTTP requests from the Abydos Gatekeeper custom controller, parse the JSON body, and print all of the headers and body values.</p>



 Foundational Vocabulary and Theory 



<p>Next we cover some basic vocabulary and acronyms so you can make your way through this post. I recommend you review Nuttawut Kongsuwan’s KERI jargon <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#de18">summary</a> of the KERI whitepaper for an overview of the terminology in the space. You can always go to the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a> or my <a href="https://kentbull.com/2022/06/05/keri-start/">KERI Mind Map blog post</a> as well for a list of documents central to the KERI space that will assist you in gaining a full understanding of the concepts and the terminology.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#48aa">KERI</a> – Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A decentralized public key infrastructure for self certifying identifiers aiming at security as a top priority while following the design principle of “minimally sufficient means.” The foundation for the verifiable credentials technology called authentic chained data containers.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">AID</a> -autonomic identifier. a self-certifying identifier that is the primary root of trust in KERI. AIDs are decentralized identifiers that do not rely on a blockchain.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#2627">Controller</a> – a node or an individual set of cryptographic keys, their key event logs (KELs), and associated data. Consists of a keystore directory, a set of autonomic identifiers (AIDs), key event logs, any credentials, transaction event logs, and out of band introductions.<br>Also considered to be a running instance of a KERI controller software such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> (Python KERI controller) or <a href="https://github.com/THCLab/keriox">KERIox</a> (Rust KERI controller).</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#a998">Witness</a> – a trusted entity designated by another controller as a witness to anything that happens for an AID controlled by that controller. Each witness must provide witness receipts to each event in a key event log. </p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a> – the Python implementation of KERI including the  controller implementation. This Python implementation is considered authoritative as the KERI core team builds it along with Dr. Samuel M. Smith. </p>



<p>Agent – The HTTP API to a KERI controller.</p>



<p>OOBI – out of band introduction. The core discovery mechanism of KERI. Each OOBI defines a path of communication between controllers or a location where a resource like an ACDC schema resides. Think of this as something like a DNS entry or an iptables entry, or an address in an address book. If you have an OOBI for a controller or object you want to talk to then you can reach it over the internet.</p>



<p>ACDC – authentic chained data container; verifiable credential. The fundamental unit of data shared between KERI controllers meant for instrumenting business process workflows that use verifiable credentials.<br>An append-only, graph-linked data structure that is secure and verifiable.</p>



<p>Edge – a link (or chain) between two ACDCs. </p>



<p>ACDC Schema – the detailed description of precisely what data is allowed to be placed into any given ACDC.</p>



<p>Credential Registry – where ACDCs are issued from.</p>



<p>Ricardian Contract – In ACDCs they are a way to link the legal system to specific ACDCs. This comes in the Rules section of ACDCs.</p>



 Admittance Workflow 



<p>The purpose of all of this business about identifiers and credentials is to support a basic admittance workflow into Abydos, specifically the Osireion at the back of Abydos. In order to support this workflow we use verifiable credentials.</p>



 Credentials Overview 



<p>For the explorers to be granted admittance into Abydos the admittance workflow must be followed:</p>



 
 The Wise Man must issue TreasureHuntingJourney credentials to each explorer wishing to go on a treasure hunt to Abydos. 



 Each explorer must issue a JourneyMarkRequest credential for the treasure hunt they want to embark on by pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential in their request. 



 As the Wise Man approves each explorer he is to issue a JourneyMark as an approval of the explorer’s desire to embark on the journey. This approval should point to the specific request each explorer made for a specific journey. 



 Once a sufficient number of JourneyMark credentials are issued by the Wise Man and the journey threshold has been crossed he is to issue a JourneyCharter to each explorer signifying his approval of their journey. 



 The JourneyCharter credential is to be presented by each explorer to the Gatekeeper in order to be granted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>To understand this workflow we first cover the credential map itself, how to write a credential, and how to link each of the schemas together using the KASLCred tool.</p>



 Visual workflows and use cases for credential issuance 



<p>Each of the credential issuance flows is described visually below.</p>



 1 – TreasureHuntingJourney issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man (ATHENA official) I want to provide confidence to potential explorers so that I may attract them to go on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 2 – JourneyMarkRequest issuance flow 



<p>As an Explorer I want to indicate a serious interest on a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that ATHENA will hold my spot.</p>



<p>To do this an Explorer (or Librarian) issues to the WiseMan a JourneyMarkRequest pointing to a specific TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 3 – JourneyMark issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to endorse a particular Explorer for a specific TreasureHuntingJourney so that the journey can be chartered once a threshold of party membership is reached.</p>



<p>To do this the Wise Man issues the JourneyMark to those Explorers whose JourneyMarkRequests he approves. The JourneyMark points to the specific JourneyMarkRequest submitted by an explorer.</p>


 
 


 4 – JourneyCharter issuance flow 



<p>As a Wise Man I want to charter a treasure hunting journey once a party membership threshold is reached so that the explorers can present this charter credential to the Gatekeeper and gain entrance into Abydos.</p>



<p>To do this the WiseMan issues the JourneyCharter credential to each Explorer going on the journey indicated in the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. The JourneyCharter points to both the JourneyMark and the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>


 
 


 5 – JourneyCharter presentation flow 



<p>As an Abydos Gatekeeper I want to allow authorized Explorers into Abydos so that they can have a good time on a treasure hunting journey.</p>



<p>To do this the Explorers present the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel the Gatekeeper, Zaqiel then validates the credential, and makes an access control decision on whether to allow an Explorer in to Abydos.</p>


 
 


 Credential Map 



<p>You decided to represent the secure proofs as four data containers (ACDC), or verifiable credentials (VC), with links between the different credentials as shown below. This graph shows the credentials and their links to each other, or edges. Each edge is named, as you will see later on in the schema map JSON file.</p>



 ATHENA Credential Graph 


 
 


 
 (1) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a>: One for the Wise Man to describe the overall treasure hunting experience from start to end, treasure splits for hunting party members, the destination, and the like. This will be issued by the Wise Man to each potential explorer. 



 (2) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark-request.json">JourneyMarkRequest</a>: One for a potential explorer to request to join the treasure hunting journey. This will be issued to the Wise Man by an explorer. 



 (3) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-mark.json">JourneyMark</a>: One for the Wise man to issue to the accepted explorers so the Gatekeeper can know who the Wise Man has authorized for the journey. 



 (4) <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/journey-charter.json">JourneyCharter</a>: One that the explorer party can use to prove they are authorized for their journey to all who care to know as well as for the Gatekeeper to verify that they were authorized as a party. 
 



<p>In order to understand the credential schemas we must first cover some background knowledge on why schemas in ACDC are constructed the way they are, the purpose they serve, and how to use them.</p>



 ACDC Schema Writing 



<p><a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">JSON Schema</a> is the schema language ACDC schemas are expressed in. Beyond this schema language  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#section-2.4-8">self addressing data</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-said-02.html#abstract">self addressing identifiers</a> are the mechanism used to verify schemas. With security first as a design principle self addressing data combines well with JSON schema to provide a secure schema capability for the KERI and ACDC ecosystem.</p>



 ACDC Credential Schemas with JSON Schema 



<p>For each ACDC we use there must be a schema defining the shape of the data in the container or credential. This schema must be verifiable and protected from schema revocation and schema malleability attacks. Using self addressing data (SAD) through the use of self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) makes it easy to accomplish both of these security objectives along with the business process objective of having a verifiable shape or envelope for our data.</p>



 What does an ACDC look like? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney credential issuance example JSON export 



<p>This is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves though a visual of what a credential looks like will help you understand where we are going. Take a quick look at what an issued JourneyMarkRequest looks like, how to get it, and then move on to the next section.</p>



 <code>{
  "v": "ACDC10JSON0001d9_",
  "d": "EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb",
  "i": "EIaJ5gpHSL9nl1XIWDkfMth1uxbD-AfLkqdiZL6S7HkZ",
  "ri": "EF3hGwYMK0r74qlSRbKw3_RzCrJ8D2Xmv5BlunrN3NC2",
  "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
  "a": {
    "d": "EPZSit7DYobEAv3WkVk2GBoBWrdglaHImi3_lnoc5fNl",
    "i": "EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q",
    "dt": "2023-03-21T15:39:14.560430+00:00",
    "destination": "Osireion",
    "treasureSplit": "50/50",
    "partyThreshold": 2,
    "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
  }
}</code> 



<p>This JSON export of a credential is obtained with the KLI command <code>kli vc export</code> as shown below:</p>



 <code>RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name explorer --alias richard --said --schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l)
kli vc export --name explorer --alias richard --said $RICHARD_CRED_SAID</code> 



<p>This particular execution of the command assumes there is only one credential to be listed by the <code>kli vc list</code> command for the schema <code>EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l</code>, the schema identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. If there were multiple TreasureHuntingJourney credentials then there would be multiple SAIDs output by that command then you would pick one of them to be the argument to the <code>--said</code> parameter in order to export it’s JSON.</p>



 What is an ACDC schema made of? 



 TreasureHuntingjourney schema creation 



<p>The first schema to write is the JSON Schema for the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney</a> credential that Richard and Elayne must receive from the Wise Man Ramiel in order to submit their treasure hunting request as a JourneyMarkRequest later. In order to write this schema we must first understand all of the elements that go into an ACDC schema.</p>



 Schema Parts 



<p>Each ACDC schema has five main parts:</p>



 
 Schema metadata (required) 



 Properties section (required) 



 Attributes section (required) 



 Edges section (if used) 



 Rules section (if used) 
 



<p>This is a collapsed view of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/treasure-hunting-journey.json">TreasureHuntingJourney schema</a>.</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see it has metadata, properties, attributes, and rules yet no edges. This is because this TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC does not extend nor connect with any other ACDC. This ACDC could appear as an edge in another ACDC though it does not have any edges itself.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this instance of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema does not have any “$id” properties filled out yet. This tells you we are still writing the schema and are working from the template that will have the SAIDs added to, or “SAIDified.” We will do that step later after we finish writing the schema itself.</p>



<p>First we shall explain the attributes of the schema from outer to inner, top to bottom. Each of the attributes has a specific purpose we get into below.</p>



 SCHEMA description – top-layer 



<p>While ACDC schemas use the JSON Schema <a href="https://json-schema.org/specification.html">specification</a> in most regards the repurposing of the “$id” field is a notable exception. The top-most $id, $schema, title, description, type, credentialType, and version properties are about the ACDC schema itself. What is contained inside of the ACDC is described by what comes in the properties section which is further clarified by the additionalProperties and required attributes.</p>



 
 $id : The self addressing identifier (SAID) of the overall schema. This can only be computed when all of the dependent SAIDs for all attribute (e), edge (e), and rule (r) blocks have been computed and embedded within the respective $id attributes of each block. <br>This field is repurposed to provide a unique identifier of the schema instance. This is because in ACDCs all schemas are self addressing and so there is no separate document to retrieve such as in the non-ACDC usage of the $id field where the field contains a base URI fragment. Since the schema is keyed and stored by SAID rather than a Retrieval URI then there is little to no benefit from storing a retrieval URI in the $id section.<br>See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-schema-id-field-label">$id section</a> of the ACDC specification for a more complete explanation.
 
 Example Value: EDiuqE2fD2MhrSpZhAzlZn8XLSJiHt1pyy1eEWB-l1qq 
 
 



 $schema: This is typically set to the value of “<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>“. The valid values can be found in the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/schema.html">$schema</a> documentation of the JSON Schema specification. 



 title: a short descriptive name you as the schema designer can write. Can have spaces and punctuation 



 description: A longer explanation of the type of credential, what it is used for, or any other useful credential-related information. 



 type: A JSON schema field that can be an object, array, numeric type, boolean, string, or other accepted value according to the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html">JSON Schema Reference</a>. 



 credentialType: A field you can use to specify the specific type name of a credential. This is like a class name in an object oriented language and can be PascalCase with no spaces following typical object naming rules in many data languages and programming languages. 



 version: A version field for this specific credential type. This manages semantic version for the credential type you are using. This is a field you can use for schema versioning and migration. 
 
 This is distinct from the “v” version field described in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">Version String Field</a> section of the ACDC specification. This “version” field is the schema version. The ACDC “v” field specifies the serialization format version and the size of the serialized data type.  



 Keep in mind these two fields are separate and are used for different purposes even though they have a similar name.  



 Remembering that the short name occurs only in ACDC instances and that the long name occurs only in ACDC schemas is a good way to keep the concepts distinct in your mind. 
 
 



 properties: This is the section where you define the data attributes that will exist in a minted ACDC as seen above. The values for the properties in this section are provided during issuance with the data argument in <code>kli vc issue --data</code>.  



 additionalProperties: This is used to control handling of extra attributes not defined in the “properties” section. Can be “false” or a rule like <code>{ "type": "string" }</code> that constrains what additional properties can be added to a schema.<br>See the <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#additionalproperties">additionalProperties section</a> of JSON Schema. 



 required: Defines the list of properties that must appear in the “properties” section. By default the properties in the “properties” section are not required. See the “<a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#required-properties">Required Properties</a>” part of the JSON Schema specification. 
 



<p>With all of the metadata properties covered we next describe the properties section of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential where you describe the fields of your custom data that will be a part of the credential.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Properties 



<p>Only a small amount of data is written inside of a TreasureHuntingJourney credential:</p>



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney credential is intended to provide information to prospective explorers about a journey they could embark on. This includes where the journey is headed, the destination, the proportion of treasure proceeds split amongst each journey party member, the minimum party threshold for the journey to be chartered, as well as the individual who chartered the journey.</p>



<p>The properties section of an ACDC schema is the location to include custom business-process data as shown above for the TreasureHuntingJourney credential.</p>



 Writing The Properties schema 



<p>Writing a schema to describe this small set of data requires a rather verbose description using JSON schema and though tedious is simple to understand once you get the hang of it.</p>



<p>In addition to this data there is a rules section “r” we will get into later when we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ricardian Contracts</a> though for now we focus only on the data going into the credential, the “a” section.</p>



<p>Writing a properties section with JSON Schema to describe this requires both metadata and an attributes section.</p>


 
 


<p>The ACDC constraints written in KERI requires the presence of a number of metadata attributes in the properties section as shown below. Each attribute is linked to the appropriate section in the ACDC specification. The overall field map description is provided here: <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">Top-Level Fields</a>.</p>



 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-version-string-field">v</a> – “Version”: This describes the version of the serialization format and size used to write the schema. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">d</a> – “SAID or identifier”: This provides a stable, universal, cryptographically verifiable and agile reference to the properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-uuid-universally-unique-ide">u</a> – “Universally Unique Identifier as a Nonce”: A salty nonce used to provide cryptographic security to the “d” field to protect against brute force attacks such as rainbow table attacks to guess the block’s contents. This field is optional. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">i</a> – “Autonomic Identifier”: The identifier of the issuer of this ACDC. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-aid-autonomic-identifier-an">ri</a> – “Registry Identifier (Derived Identifier)”: The registry is the credential registry that this particular ACDC was issued from. This is derived from the “i” field for the issuer who issued the ACDC. A controller can create and use one or more registries. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-top-level-fields">s</a> – “Schema SAID”: The SAID of the schema to be used to validate this properties block. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-attribute-section">a</a> – “Attribute map”: The list of attributes that defines this schema. This is where the JSON data from above gets placed into the credential. 



 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-rule-section">r</a> – “Rules section”: This is where any Ricardian Contracts (code as law) are stored in the credential. 
 



<p>Other than the metadata attributes the “a” and “r” properties, attributes and rules, are the more interesting parts. The “a” section is where you will describe the data properties that will be placed in your ACDC.</p>



 TreasureHuntingJourney Attributes Section  



<p>The attributes section can be one of two things as shown in the JSON schema, either a SAID or an inner block with its own properties.</p>



 <code>...
"a": 
  "oneOf": [
    {
      "description": "Attributes block SAID",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "$id": "EPfNU6jej4GGyprpakq6KCO9os9vp9jLIRcH1xJqVezj",
      "description": "Attributes block",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": { 
...</code> 



 oneOf Operator and compact ACDC 



<p>The oneOf operator in JSON Schema means that the “a” section can be one of either of these two things. For ACDCs this means that the “a” block can be either the condensed version, which is the SAID of the “a” block, or it can be the entire contents of the “a” block. The condensed version is called a “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-compact-acdc">Compact ACDC</a>” and can be seen as equivalent to the un-condensed, or un-compacted version of the ACDC. </p>



<p>We are not covering compact ACDCs in this article so we move on to the full or un-compacted ACDC. </p>



 Full or un-compacted ACDC 



<p>The full ACDC schema includes another set of metadata attributes, and identifier field “$id”, and another properties section. JSON Schema as you can see is very verbose. Looking a level deeper we see the following set of attributes inside the “a” block:</p>


 
 


<p>Now this is starting to look like the JSON data we intend to put in the credential. Inside of the “a” block we see another “$id” field as well as other metadata fields from JSON Schema including the “description”, “type”, and “properties” fields. As those are mostly self explanatory we move on to the inner “properties” block.</p>



<p>Each property has a name, a description, and a type:</p>



 <code>...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
...</code> 



<p>The “type” field must be one of the valid types from the list in <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html#type-specific-keywords">JSON Schema</a>:</p>



 
 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#string">string</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#number">number</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric.html#integer">integer</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#object">object</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array.html#array">array</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/boolean.html#boolean">boolean</a> 



 <a href="https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/null.html#null">null</a> 
 



<p>The “description” field is a schema-writer field to put a human-readable, concise definition of what the field contains.</p>



 Inner Properties block metadata fields 



<p>The inner properties block has a set of metadata fields that the ACDC code in KERI fills out for you including the “d” (SAID), “i” (issuee), and “dt” (date and time stamp) fields. They are required attributes in the top level of the inner properties block and look like the following in the JSON schemas where they appear:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  "d": {
    "description": "Attributes block SAID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "i": {
    "description": "Issuee AID",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "dt": {
    "description": "Issuance date time",
    "type": "string",
    "format": "date-time"
  },
... 



<p>The $id field is a SAID of the “a” attributes block. This provides the “a” block with cryptographic protection and verifiability when signed by a KERI key.</p>



 Inner Properties Block Custom Fields 



<p>Following the required properties you define your own custom properties to be added to the ACDC. In the case of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential those properties include the “destination”, “treasureSplit”, “partyThreshold”, and “journeyEndorser” fields as follows:</p>



 ...
"properties": {
  ...
  "destination": {
    "description": "The target location for this journey where the hunters will go.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "treasureSplit": {
    "description": "The type of splits for this journey. 50/50, 25/25/25/25, and so forth. Must add up to 100.",
    "type": "string"
  },
  "partyThreshold": {
    "description": "The minimum party member threshold needed to charter this journey",
    "type": "integer"
  },
  "journeyEndorser": {
    "description": "The AID of the ATHENA inner circle member endorsing this treasure hunting journey.",
    "type": "string"
  }
... 



<p>Each field has a description and a type. The validation of each field is up to the issuer or the verifier of the credential.</p>



 The Edge Section 



<p>We will briefly cover the JourneyMarkRequest schema since we have not covered edge sections yet. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential has no edges so it isn’t a good example of a credential with an edge section.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest Schema 



<p>As you can see the JourneyMarkRequest has an additional attribute, the “e” section. This is for edges, or chains between individual ACDCs.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge section is very similar to an “attributes” section except it is specialized. It contains a “oneOf” operator similar to the “attributes” section since the edge section may also be represented by a SAID in the most compact version, or any compact version, of an ACDC.</p>


 
 


<p>Inside of the Edges block, the second item in this “oneOf” array, we see a set of common properties. $id, description, and type are what we have seen before, as is properties. Inside the properties block we find something slightly different.</p>


 
 


<p>The “d” field is the SAID of this particular edges block and is computed from the other properties which in this case is just the “journey” property.</p>



<p>The “journey” property is the actual edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential (not the TreasureHintingJourney – typo).</p>



<p>The “n” field is the SAID of the far side credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>The “s” field is the SAID of the ACDC schema for the TreasureHuntingJourney.</p>



<p>Defining an edge section like this in a schema is the foundation of what is needed to add in an edge between these two credentials later during the credential issuance process.</p>



 The Other Schemas 



<p>With this nearly exhaustive explanation of one of the four schemas complete and a small amount on the JourneyMarkREquest edge we will leave the writing or reading of the other three of the four schemas up to the reader. This includes the JourneyMarkRequest, JourneyMark, and JourneyCharter. You may find the ATHENA version of the other schemas in the <code>athena<a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/schemas">/schemas</a></code> directory. They will be described briefly below at a high level. You can apply the schema writing concepts from above to all of the other schemas.</p>



<p>Just glance over the following pictures to get a sense of what is in each schema and them move on to the credential linking section afterwards. </p>



 JourneyMark Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And edge properties for “request”</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter Schema 



<p>Has the following properties:</p>


 
 


<p>And the following edges. Something different for the JourneyCharter schema is that it links to two edges, both “mark” and “journey”:</p>


 
 


 Linking Schemas 



<p>One concept we have not yet covered is how to link schemas together. We cover this next in the Schema Linking and Verification section via the use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred utility</a>.</p>



 Schema Linking and Verification 



<p>Linking schemas with <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#section-2.4">self addressing data</a> is part of the way ACDCs provide security, specifically end-verifiability, of credentials. For data to be self addressing it must contain an identifier that is computed from the contents of the data, a digest. Self addressing data protects against security exploits like schema malleability and schema revocation attacks while also being an easy way to verify the contents of the data. These self addressing identifiers are placed in the “<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html#name-said-self-addressing-identi">$id</a>” attributes of the various blocks in ACDC schemas.</p>



<p>Here is an example self addressing identifier for the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC shown above: <code>EEXZuecxP4Y3xZxvA_DtnrPX8nbSDPeGaMIxNKvLVENb</code></p>



 Self Addressing Data (SAD) and Self Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs) 



<p>The self addressing identifier (SAID) is like a key in a key-value pair and the data is like the value except that the identifier computation algorithm allows for the SAID to be embedded in the data. This requires a two pass process, one to calculate the identifier, and the second to embed it within the data. Verifying self addressing data also requires a two-pass verification function, one pass to remove the embedded identifier, and the second to verify the data against the SAID. To fully understand the self addressing identifier concept refer to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html">IETF Draft Specification for Self-Addressing IDentifier (SAID)</a> by Samuel smith. </p>



 Schema Evaluation to compute SAIDs 



<p>Using self addressing identifiers (SAIDs) with a graph of schemas means that the credential schemas must be evaluated in a deterministic order and have their “$id” properties populated from the inner-most or top-most schema to the outer-most or bottom-most schema. In this sense the outer-most schema points to the innermost schema and the bottom-most schema points to the top-most schema as in the ATHENA Credential Graph diagram above and reproduced below for reference. This proper order requires computing a dependency graph of the schemas based on their edges (dependencies) in order to facilitate generating identifiers on the inner-most (or top-most) schemas and then each layer outward to the outermost (or bottom-most) schemas. </p>


 
 


 Graph Evaluation Order 



<p>In our case our graph must be generated in the following order:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney (root node, no dependents) 



 JourneyMarkRequest (dependent on TreasureHuntingJourney) 



 JourneyMark (dependent on JourneyMarkRequest) 



 JourneyCharter (dependent on both JourneyMark and TreasureHuntingJourney) 
 



<p>Your options here are to either do this by hand with the <code>kli saidify</code> command and manually editing all of the schema files or you can use the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/blob/dev/src/vlei/generate.py">generate.py</a></code> file from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI">WebOfTrust/vLEI</a> repository as a guide. Alternatively you could use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/kaslcred/">KASLCred</a> Python package to do all of the linking for you. For this post we will use KASLCred in the interest of time.</p>



 KASLCred 



<p>While the intricacies of parsing ACDC schemas and adding SAIDs in the “$id” attributes are interesting, also called “saidifying” the schemas, in the interest of time we will use the KASLCred utility written to do all the saidifying for you. You can go read the Python code of the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/kaslcred">TetraVeda/kaslcred</a> repository if you want to see how it was done. It’s only a few hundred lines of code.</p>



 KASLCred Schema Map 



<p>Using KASLCred to evaluate your schema graph involves writing a schema map file expressing the set of credentials to be evaluated in a JSON file. The “athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json” file from the tutorial repository is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 <code>{
  "schemas": [
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyCharter",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-charter.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMark", "TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": ""
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMarkRequest",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark-request.json",
      "dependencies": ["TreasureHuntingJourney"],
      "edgeName": "request"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "TreasureHuntingJourney",
      "schemaFilePath": "treasure-hunting-journey.json",
      "dependencies": [],
      "edgeName": "journey"
    },
    {
      "schemaName": "JourneyMark",
      "schemaFilePath": "journey-mark.json",
      "dependencies": ["JourneyMarkRequest"],
      "edgeName": "mark"
    }
  ]
}</code> 



 Evaluation Order 



<p>As you can see this list of schemas is out of order. The first item in the list, JourneyCharter, should be evaluated last. And the third item in the list, TreasureHuntingJourney, should be evaluated first. This is no problem for KASLCred as it reads the dependencies array and reorders the schemas to be evaluated in the order where the least dependent item (with no dependencies) is evaluated first and then the next most dependent item is evaluated after all of its dependencies is evaluated and so forth for all dependencies.</p>



<p>Using KASLCred is as simple as a Pip Install and a <code>python -m</code> invocation once you have Libsodium and KERI installed:</p>



 <code># Install KERI and Libsodium as noted in the installation instructions above
pip install kaslcred==0.0.8

# Set ABYDOS_REPO_DIR to where you cloned the abydos-tutorial repo.
# Usage: python -m kaslcred [schemas dir] [results dir] [schema map file]
python -m kaslcred \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/saidified_schemas \
  ${ABYDOS_REPO_DIR}/athena/schemas/athena-schema-map.json</code> 



<p>As long as all of the file names in the <code>schemaFilePath</code> properties in the schema map JSON file exist then you will end up with a set of SAIDified schemas ready to use.</p>



 Quick overview of the other schemas 



<p>Review the JSON contents of the abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data directory to get a sense for what kind of business process we are building on top of these schemas. We reproduce them here to illustrate their purpose.</p>



 JourneyMarkRequest data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>As you can see here this credential looks a lot like an account registration HTTP REST API request. You can really do anything with ACDC credentials. It also indicates preferences to the ATHENA explorer matchmaking engine with the desired party size and the desired split.</p>



 JourneyMark data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "journeyDestination": "Osireion",
  "gatekeeper": "Zaqiel",
  "negotiatedSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



<p>This data indicates where Richard will be going and other details of the journey. Remember that the JourneyMark has a graph edge pointing to the JourneyMarkRequest which means credential consumers can also resolve data from both the JourneyMarkRequest and the TreasureHuntingJourney credentials through those links.</p>



 JourneyCharter data – for Richard 



 <code>{
  "partySize": 2,
  "authorizerName": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>As the final data packet sent as an ACDC this credential indicates what each explorer stands to expect on the chartered journey such as how many members they will be traveling with and who officially blessed their journey.</p>



 Schemas Review 



<p>Now that we have written the needed schemas for ATHENA and have SAIDified them with KASLCred we are ready to use them in configuring our trust network components as well as to issue and verify credentials. </p>



<p>Next we configure our trust network to cache these schemas with the vLEI caching server implementation (vLEI-server). </p>



 Network Configuration 



<p>Configuring a KERI network involves setting up the following components:</p>



 
 ACDC Schema Caching 



 Witnesses 



 Controllers 



 Agents (if you are using them) 



 Performing Out Of Band Introductions (OOBIs) between controllers and objects 
 



<p>Our setup will involve the following additional components</p>



 
 A customized controller used for the Abydos Gatekeeper to decide whether or not explorers can be permitted to enter Abydos. It will be configured to trust one issuer, the Wise Man, that will be used to check the issuance of the JourneyCharter credentials against. 



 A webhook the customized controller communicates with to tie credential presentation and revocation events into a custom business logic layer. 
 



<p>Here is the network component diagram again for reference:</p>


 
 


<p>Schema caching is first item to be set up as all of the controllers depend on it. You could set up witnesses first as well. It is up to you.</p>



 Schema Caching 



<p>In order to successfully receive, validate, and handle an ACDC each KERI controller using that ACDC must be able to resolve and load the schema for that ACDC. The schemas are resolved based on the SAID of the schema using an out of band introduction (OOBI) that indicates the location the schema is stored at and can be retrieved from. The controller may either be configured with the location of this schema on startup in the controller bootstrap JSON configuration file or be configured at runtime through usage of the OOBI resolution mechanism.</p>



 vLEI-server 


 
 


<p> The vLEI-server provides a convenient implementation of a simple caching server that meets our needs. All the vLEI caching server (vLEI-server) does is make the schemas available as JSON objects as responses to HTTP requests. It could very easily be rewritten in your favorite language if you wanted a fun, easy challenge. (Hint, write it in Rust, the KERI community will be happy with you.)</p>



<p>Once you have the vLEI repository cloned and the vLEI-server installed as described in the installation instructions above you can run the vLEI-server with a command similar to the following:</p>



 <code># Change directories to the abydos-tutorial repository directory.
# Set ATHENA_DIR to be your abydos-tutorial/athena directory.
vLEI-server \
  -s "${ATHENA_DIR}"/saidified_schemas \
  -c "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/acdc \
  -o "${ATHENA_DIR}"/cache/oobis</code> 



<p>This will give you output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>caching schema EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l
caching schema ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD
caching schema EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my
caching schema EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code> 



<p>If you have anything in the <code>cache/acdc</code> or <code>cache/oobis</code> directories then those will be shown in the log output as well.</p>



<p>With the ACDC schemas successfully being cached the next step is to deploy the witness network which requires writing witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Network 



<p>Our witness network consists of three of the witnesses used in the KERI Demonstration Witness network meaning we use the same cryptographic key salts, keystore names, and alias names.</p>



<p>This means we need a configuration file for each of the witnesses. The document symbols you see on the preceding diagram show the filenames for each of the witnesses represented by a gray circle.</p>



<p>To set up the witness network we must do the following things:</p>



 
 Write witness configuration files ensuring the witnesses listen for incoming traffic on a set of TCP and HTTP ports. 



 Create the keystores for the witnesses using the KERI command line interface, the KLI, via <code>kli init</code> subcommand. 



 Start witnesses using the KLI via the <code>keri witness start</code> subcommand. 
 



<p>For the ATHENA witness network we create three separate witnesses as shown above on the following ports:</p>



 
 <code>wan</code>: TCP 5632 HTTP 5642 



 <code>wes</code>: TCP 5633 HTTP 5643 



 <code>wil</code>: TCP 5634 HTTP 5644 
 



 Building your own, non-demo witnesses and agents 



<p>In order for you to really understand the KERI KLI we do not want you to have to rely on any demo commands such as <code>kli witness demo</code> or <code>kli agent vlei</code> so we show you here how to use the keystore and witness commands directly.</p>



<p>First we address the writing of witness configuration files.</p>



 Witness Configuration files 



<p>Each witness on startup reads a witness configuration file. This file includes properties such as TCP and HTTP ports to listen on and any OOBIs to resolve at startup. See below for a witness configuration file example. The diagram shows the specific witness configuration file used for each specific witness.</p>


 
 


 Location and Directory Structure 



<p>JSON configuration files for KERI witnesses must be placed inside a particular directory structure. This directory structure is as follows<br><code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code></p>


 
 


<p>The reason for this is that the KERI <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L29">Configer module</a> uses the root path of “keri/cf” and the sub path of “main” as see in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer.__init__</a> function. You can configure the CONFIG_ROOT directory path by customizing the <code>--config-dir</code> property though the <code>keri/cf/main</code> directory path will be created for you inside of the CONFIG_ROOT directory if they do not already exist.</p>



<p>Then, inside this <code>CONFIG_ROOT/keri/cf/main</code> directory you must place your witness configuration JSON files.</p>



 Witness Configuration File Contents 



<p>The contents of a witness configuration file look as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "wan": {
    "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
    "curls": ["tcp://127.0.0.1:5632/", "http://127.0.0.1:5642/"]
  },
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
  ]
}</code> 



<p>There must be a key in the configuration object named the same as the value passed into the <code>--alias [alias]</code> property for the subsequent <code>kli witness start</code> command. This applies to KERIpy, the Python implementation of KERI and the reference implementation of the KERI and ACDC specification. </p>



<p>Refer specifically to KERIpy <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L971">habbing.pyL971</a> in the <code>reconfigure</code> function to see how the configuration file must have an appropriately named key. Keep in mind that this function documentation states that “Config file is meant to be read only at init not changed by app at run time” so you should make any changes to this configuration before the <code>kli witness start</code> commands are run since any changes during run time will not be recognized until the witness is stopped and then started again.</p>



<p>The values inside the configuration file are as follows. Sub-properties such as the “dt” property inside of “wan” are indicated with the dot notation.</p>



 
 “wan”: The named configuration block property for a given witness.
 
 “wan.dt”: The date-time stamp when the configuration was created. 



 “wan.curls”: Controller URLs. This is the list of URLs that indicate the protocol and ports for the witness to listen on. You can see both TCP port 5632 and HTTP port 5642 in the above example. 
 
 



 “dt”: The date and timestamp the configuration was created 



 “iurls”: Introduction URLs. This means any out of band introduction (OOBI) URLs to process and resolve on startup. 
 



<p>Other properties that are not shown above yet can be presented include:</p>



 
 “durls”: Data URLs. Another section for OOBI URLs to process. Typically you put credential OOBIs in this section you want the witness, really just a KERI controller, to resolve on startup. You could put these URLs in the “iurls” section as well. 



 “wurls”: Well-known OOBIs to resolve on startup. 
 



<p>With this explanation of how to write a witness configuration file you now can go make the other two witness configuration files for “wil” and “wes,” or you can pull them from the tutorial repo: <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/tree/master/athena/conf/keri/cf/main">athena/conf/keri/cf/main/*.json</a></p>



 Witness Create Command: kli init 



<p>Next we must create the keystores. We will end up with the following three keystores:</p>


 
 


<p>We use the <code>kli init</code> command to create each of the keystores.</p>



<p>A witness requires a keystore to be created first in order to start the witness later. Do this with a command like the following:</p>



 <code>kli init --name wan --salt 0AB3YW5uLXRoZS13aXRuZXNz --nopasscode \
    --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
    --config-file main/wan-witness</code> 



<p>You can see you must name the witness and pass in a configuration directory and file. The configuration file must have the “main/” path prefix on it since the underlying <code>Configer</code> class defaults the “base” path property to be “main” as seen on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/configing.py#L50">Configer:L50 here</a>. You don’t need to add the “.json” suffix since KERIpy will do that for you. The filename alone is sufficient.</p>



<p>Running this command will create output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>KERI Keystore created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/ks/wan
KERI Database created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/db/wan
KERI Credential Store created at: /Users/myuser/.keri/reg/wan</code> 



 Keystore Passcodes 



<p>Here I am not using any passcodes though you are free to modify the example to use them. The passcode is an additional layer of security used to unlock a keystore. Using a passcode would look like adding in a passcode argument like so: <code>--passcode DoB26Fj4x9LboAFWJra17O</code></p>



 For Each Witness 



<p>Write a configuration file for each of the three witnesses, wan, wil, and wes. You can use the <code>create_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script as a guide. Place each of the JSON configuration files in your configuration directory with the appropriate directory suffix like so:<br><code>$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf/main</code></p>



 Cryptographic Salts (seeds) 



<p>The salt used here is the same as both what is used in the Abydos Tutorial witness set as well as what is used for the demo command <code>kli witness demo</code> that starts six witnesses for you. Using the same salt means the keys generated from the salt will be the same. So you may conclude that protecting your salt is as important as protecting your keys themselves similar to protecting your Bitcoin or Ethereum seed phrase and private keys. </p>



<p>Whatever you do make sure your seeds do not get in the hands of people who shouldn’t have them and be sure to use highly secure deployment mechanisms to inject seeds into your witness, agent, and controller deployments.</p>



<p>Moving on, next we start the witness.</p>



 Witness Start Command: kli witness start 



<p>Starting a witness is very simple yet it does depend on code recently added to KERIpy to support the <code>--config-dir</code> and <code>--config-file</code> arguments so make sure you install the latest version of KERIpy from source with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the KERIpy repository root directory. This will give you at least KERIpy 1.0.0 release locally whether or not the release has been pushed to PyPi or GitHub yet.</p>



 <code>kli witness start --name wan --alias wan \
  -T ${WAN_WITNESS_TCP_PORT} \
  -H ${WAN_WITNESS_HTTP_PORT} \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file wan-witness</code> 



<p>Ports and the alias name are a few additional configuration options here. Remember that the “alias” property must match the name used in the witness configuration file you wrote earlier in which you defined the TCP and HTTP endpoints for your witness to listen on. The other arguments are as they seem, -T for the TCP port and -H for the HTTP port the witness will listen on.</p>



<p>Run this command for each of the three witnesses wan, wil, and wes. You can use whatever ports you’d like though the ATHENA ports used are shown in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L109">variables section</a> near the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. </p>



<p>Running this command successfully will provide output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>Witness wan : BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code> 



<p>You can either do the commands by hand yourself or you can use the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to do it for you. It is recommended to get some practice yourself with the commands in order to learn them though you can start by reading the <code>start_witnesses</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script to see how the Abydos Tutorial starts the ATHENA witnesses. Be aware that BASH variables are used heavily throughout the script so you will need to refer often to the variables section at the top of the script in order to fully understand what each of the commands are doing.</p>



<p>Once you have all of the witnesses set up and started your next task is to set up the KERI controllers for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing a bootstrap configuration file which we get into next. </p>



 KERI Controller Setup 



<p>Creating and setting up controllers can happen in one of two ways, with the KERI command line, the KLI, or with the KERI Agent API (called the Mark I Agent, currently deprecated). The KLI method does not start a running process or daemon while the Agent runs as a daemon. An important note on the existing Agent API in KERIpy is that Agent API is now deprecated in favor  of the new Agent API being written as a separate deployable called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> (called the Mark II Agent). </p>



<p>While the existing Agent API is deprecated it is nonetheless useful to see how the KLI compares to using REST requests in the Agent API. You get an idea of how you might write your own API on top of a KERI controller or how you might contribute to the agent implementations. Once the Mark II Agent API is ready this article will be updated with the new API.</p>



<p>There are three general steps to setting up a controller:</p>



 
 Write the controller configuration file. 



 Initialize the controller’s keystore 



 Create the first keypair for the controller, called a prefix, by performing an inception event. This involves using an alias to label that particular prefix. 
 



<p>The KLI flow is shorter than the Agent flow though they both accomplish the same objective. You may follow along in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with the code for setting up each of the four controllers in the following functions:</p>



 
 For the Agent flow <code>start_agents</code> starts up all needed agents. 



 <code>read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</code> updates the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files. 



 <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> and <code>make_keystores_and_incept_agent</code> perform the keystore creation and inception events using the KLI or Agent API, respectively. 
 



 Four Controllers 



<p>There are four controllers to be created, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. This involves writing configuration files with OOBIs for witnesses, and credential schemas, initializing controller keystores, performing the inception events, and, in the case of using agents, starting the KERI Agent for each controller. Below is a simplified diagram of the controllers and the out of OOBI connections that must be made between the controllers to support credential issuance and presentation.</p>


 
 


 Controller Bootstrap Configuration File 



<p>A bootstrap configuration file instructs a KERI controller what OOBI URLs to resolve on initial startup including both a list of controller OOBIs and a list of credential schema OOBIs. The list of controller OOBIs is usually a list of OOBIs for each witnesses that will be used to perform the inception event though it can be expanded to other controllers beyond the witness pool.</p>



<p>When first starting a controller it reads in the configuration file specified by the <code>--config-file</code> argument to either the <code>kli init</code> or <code>kli agent start</code> commands. Beware that the configuration file is not re-read on subsequent startups. If you need a controller to resolve more OOBIs after initial bootstrapping then use the <code>kli oobi resolve</code> command or equivalent Agent REST request.</p>



 Example Config 



<p>The example config file from the ATHENA network shows three controller OOBI URLs in “iurls” and four credential schema OOBI URLs in “durls”. Starting an agent also reads in a similar configuration file with OOBIs for the agent to resolve during initialization. Agents are covered in a later section.</p>



<p>Once you have all three prefixes for the witnesses you can make OOBIs and write them into configuration files for both KLI and Agent modes:</p>



 
 controller-oobi-bootstrap.json for the KLI mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/controller-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 
 



<p>If you look into each of these two configuration files you will find their contents to be identical and will look very similar to the below:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we learn how to write each of the two OOBI lists for both the “iurls” and the “durls” sections of the configuration files.</p>



 IURLS: Writing controller OOBIs for the “iurls” section 



<p>An OOBI URLs uses the following URL scheme:<br>“<code>[protocol]://[host]:[port]/oobi/[prefix]</code>“</p>



<p>The protocol is typically “http” though may be “tcp” as well. Host and port will be specific to your deployment. Creating a prefix involves many steps as shown in a later section. Without jumping ahead you can use the prefixes automatically created during the <code>kli witness start</code> command you ran earlier. This created a set of keystores which also created a set of prefixes for each witness. You can get the prefixes you created with the <code>kli status</code> command as shown below.</p>



 Prefixes with kli status 



<p>The prefix is the prefix of the first key in a sequence of KERI key creation events (establishment events). This is the same prefix that is added into the KERI DID generation function when you run <code>kli did generate</code>. To turn the prefix into a did you do as follows:<br><code>did:[prefix]</code><br>For example, using the first OOBI below, the corresponding DID would be:<br><code>did:keri:BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha</code></p>



<p>For now you can get the prefix with the <code>kli status command</code> as shown in the <code><a href="http://update_config_with_witness_oobis">read_witness_prefixes_and_configure</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code>. Here is an example using <code>kli status</code> and AWK to store witness wan’s prefix in the <code>WAN_PREFIX</code> variable:</p>



 <code>WAN_PREFIX=$(kli status --name wan --alias wan | awk '/Identifier:/ {print $2}')

# Then do echo $WAN_PREFIX to see the value of the prefix
echo $WAN_PREFIX</code> 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L352">update_config_with_witness_oobis</a></code> function does this for you in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. Once you finish writing your witness OOBIs to the configuration file your “iurls” section should look like the following:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    ...
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Next we write the “durls” section for credential schema OOBIs. This enables controllers to recognize ACDC schemas by their SAID.</p>



 DURLS: WRITING credential schema OOBI URLs for the “durls” section 



<p>The four OOBIs in the “durls” are created by getting the “$id” properties from each of the schemas you created during the schema writing and linking step above with KASLCred. The scheme for data OOBIs is as follows:<br><code>[protocol]://[caching_server_host]:[caching_server_port]/oobi/[schema_said]</code></p>



<p>For example, “<code>EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr</code>” is the <code>[schema_said]</code> property for the OOBI url for the JourneyCharter OOBI URL. This. is pulled directly from the schema in <code>abydos-tutorial/athena/saidified_schemas/JourneyCharter__EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr.json</code></p>


 
 


<p>The resulting OOBI URL looks like the following:</p>



<p><code>"http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"</code></p>



<p>In this instance the caching server host and port correspond to the <code>vLEI-server</code> instance ATHENA defines in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script, or <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>7723</code>, respectively.</p>



<p>Once you have the OOBI URLs set up then write them into both the controller-oobi-bootstrap.json file and the “agent-oobi-bootstrap.json” files in the “$CONFIG_DIR/keri/cf” configuration directory. In the Abydos Tutorial the location “<code>abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf</code>” is the $CONFIG_DIR configuration directory.</p>



<p>These files should look somewhat like the following once you are finished:</p>



 <code>{
  "dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00",
  "iurls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "durls": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l",
    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/ELc8tMg_hhsAPfVbjUBBC-giEy5440oSb9EzFBZdAxHD",

    "http://127.0.0.1:7723/oobi/EEq0AkHV-i5-aCc1JMBGsd7G85HlBzI3BfyuS5lHOGjr"
  ]
}</code> 



<p>Now that you have the controller and agent bootstrap configuration files set up we show how to start up agents with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Agents 



 KERI Agent Startup – Mark I agent (deprecated) 



<p>Creating and handling a controller with the KERI Mark I agent involves a four step process:</p>


 
 


 
 Start the agent with <code>kli agent start</code> 



 POST to /boot to initialize the keystore 



 PUT to /boot to unlock the keystore 



 POST to /ids/${ALIAS} to perform the inception event 
 



<p>There are four agents to be set up for the ATHENA network, one each for Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel as shown below:</p>


 
 


 KERI Controller Agent Start (Mark I Agent – deprecated) 



<p>You will notice that the <code>--insecure</code> option is passed to the agent start command. This is because the first draft of a KERI Agent, the Mark I agent, has a partially complete HTTP signature signing scheme that currently does not function and thus must be disabled with the <code>--insecure</code> option. Without disabling this option you will not be able to communicate at all with a Mark I agent. The next version of KERI Agents is <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a>, the Mark II agent, and this has a fully complete HTTP signature signing scheme intended to work with <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">Signify</a>, a TypeScript edge signing library for KERI.</p>



<p>The <code>--path</code> option declares a directory to be served up at the <code>$AGENT_URL/static</code> HTTP endpoint though isn’t important for this tutorial. It was originally used to host Swagger API documentation for the Agent API.</p>



<p>All of the other configuration options are relatively straightforward.</p>



 
 <code>--config-dir</code> is the directory the agent bootstrap file will be located in
 
 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf 
 
 



 <code>--config-file</code> is the configuration file to be used
 
 agent-oobi-bootstrap.json for the Agent mode 



 Full path: abydos-tutorial/athena/conf/keri/cf/agent-oobi-bootstrap.json 
 
 



 <code>--tcp</code> is the TCP port to listen on 



 <code>--admin-http-port</code> is the HTTP port to listen on. This is the port we will be submitting all of our requests to. 
 



 <code>kli agent start --insecure \
  --admin-http-port ${EXPLORER_AGENT_HTTP_PORT} \
  --tcp ${EXPLORER_AGENT_TCP_PORT} \
  --config-dir ${CONFIG_DIR} \
  --config-file ${AGENT_CONFIG_FILENAME} \
  --path ${ATHENA_DIR}/agent_static</code> 



<p>Start up an Agent for each controller Richard, Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel. The <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L242"><code>start_agents</code></a> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> shows one way to do this.</p>



 Switching between the KLI and the KERI Agent API (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>For the remainder of this tutorial we switch back and forth between the KERI command line interface, the KLI, and the KERI Agent HTTP API, the Mark I version in KERIpy, in order to present a broad understanding of both the ways you can interact with the KERI specification and the work that has been completed in the space. This will provide an opportunity to understand both how the command line interaction looks as well as how a REST API addressing a similar purpose feels and looks.</p>



<p>Each task will be completed first with the KLI and then with the KERI Agent API. The KLI is always up to date with the latest and greatest code in KERIpy. The KERI Agent API will likely eventually be removed from KERIpy once the Mark II agent in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">KERIA</a> is finished. At present the KERI Agent API in the KERIpy repository is now deprecated and is referred to as the Mark I agent.</p>



<p>For our next task of creating keystores we start first with the KERI Command Line Interface (KLI) to initialize the keystores for all of the participants in this journey including the ATHENA officials and the two explorers. After showing how to accomplish this task with the KLI we switch to perform the same task with the Agent API.</p>



 Use one or the other for keystores and inception 



<p>Make sure to either use the KLI or the Agent API to perform keystore creation and inception, not both. You only need to create the keystores once whether your use the KLI or the Agent API.</p>



<p>If you don’t know which one you want or need for your scenario then start with the KLI.</p>



 KERI Keystores and Inception 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – KLI INIT 



<p>There are four keystores to initialize. We will show here the commands to initialize one of the keystores. After performing this command you can initialize all of the other keystores yourself with similar commands for each keystore or use the <code>make_keystores_and_incept_kli</code> function in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>


 
 


 Salts 



<p>The cryptographic salt is one of the arguments to <code>kli init</code>. This salt is what all of the private keys are derived from so it should be protected as if you were protecting your personal identity documents or your bank account. You can get your own salt with the <code>kli salt</code> command:</p>



 <code>$ kli salt
0ACPpGmPWX9LqRlUCOLH3qk2</code> 



<p>You can use the salt in any <code>--salt</code> argument via the KLI or a <code>"salt"</code> property of a Agent request.</p>



 Command 



<p>The other arguments are straightforward, nopasscode, config-dir, and config-file. <code>--nopasscode</code> indicates that there is no passcode to access this keystore. </p>



<p>The <code>--config-dir</code> property indicates the directory in which to look for configuration files. Inside this configuration directory the file name from the <code>--config-file</code> option is used to find and select the controller bootstrap configuration file that will be used to initialize this keystore. This option does not need to have a file extension if your configuration file already ends with the “.json” extension.</p>



 <code>kli init --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --salt "${EXPLORER_SALT}" \
  --nopasscode \
  --config-dir "${CONFIG_DIR}" \
  --config-file "${CONTROLLER_BOOTSTRAP_FILE}"</code> 



<p>This command sets up all of the <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">Lightning Memory Mapped Database</a> instances used by the keystore. These are located in the $HOME/.keri directory.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Now the keystore is ready to have a specific key pair created and an inception event performed. This will begin the key event log (KEL) for that key pair. Key pairs are referred to with a label called an “alias.” This alias label is intended to be more human-friendly and is used throughout both the KLI and the Agent API to refer to the key pair.</p>



 Alias vs Prefix 



<p>Aliases are used to refer to key pairs since prefixes, the internal reference to key pairs, are not human friendly. For example, an alias can be a word or set of words like “richard” and a prefix looks like the following: <code>"EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q"</code>. As you can see you won’t be remembering many prefixes which is why the alias system is so helpful.</p>



 Steps to Inception 



<p>Performing an inception event, once the keystore is initialized, requires the following two steps:</p>



 
 Write an inception configuration file. 



 Execute the inception command whether from the command line or the Agent REST API
 
 For the KLI you will provide the inception configuration file as an argument. 



 For the Agent API you will provide the inception configuration as JSON in the body of the inception HTTP request. 
 
 
 



<p>Four inception events need to be performed on each of the four keystores. Each inception event begins a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">key event log</a> (KEL), as shown below:</p>


 
 


<p>First we write the inception configuration file.</p>



 Writing a Controller Inception Configuration File 



<p>Each attribute of a controller inception configuration file is important. The initial set of witnesses, keypair counts, key thresholds, transferability, and threshold of acceptable duplicity are all defined in this file. </p>



<p>The following is the inception configuration file used for each of the controllers we create for the Abydos journey:</p>



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



 Witness configuration file attributes 



<p>Now an explanation of each attribute, which may also be seen in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/habbing.py#L888">keripy/src/keri/app/habbing.pyL873</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.py#L9">keripy/src/keri/app/cli/common/incepting.pyL9</a>:</p>



 
 “transferable” – <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">Transferability</a> refers to whether a KERI autonomic identifier (AID) can have its keys rotated. Technically this refers to having what is called “control authority” changed, control over the private keypairs linked to a KERI AID. <br>When true this means the AID is a transferable AID.<br>When false this means the AID is non-transferable. 



 “wits”: Witnesses – A list of prefixes identifying the witnesses to include signatures for in the inception event in this controller’s key event log. 



 “toad”: Threshold of acceptable duplicity – The number of agreeing witnesses receipts at or above which the controller accepts accountability for signed key events. Accountability is not accepted by the controller for key events with a number of signatures below this threshold. 



 “icount”: Inception signature count – The number of keys used to sign the inception event. 



 “ncount”: Number of rotation signatures count – The number of keys to be used on the next key rotation event. Note that not all pre-rotated keys committed to in the inception event as described <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-keri/draft-ssmith-keri.html#name-reserve-rotation">Reserve Rotation</a>. 



 “isith”: Signing threshold for the inception event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the Inception Event must have in order to be authoritative. 



 “nsith”: Signing threshold for the next rotation event – The number of key event receipts from distinct witnesses the next Rotation Event must have in order to be authoritative. 
 



 Writing your configuration 



<p>For all except the “wits” section you can copy and paste the configuration file as-is. The “wits” section contains the AID prefixes that will be specific to your witnesses. If you are using the <code>workflow.sh</code> script with precisely the same salts, witness keystore names, and witness AID aliases, then you can use the configuration from above.</p>



<p>Place all of your configuration in a JSON file in a configuration directory you will remember the location of that you can reference when passing in the <code>--file</code> argument to the <code>kli incept</code> command below. In the Abydos Tutorial repo this path is “<code>abydos-tutorial/conf/inception-config.json</code>“.</p>



 Performing Inception – KLI INCEPT 



<p>Incepting a keypair consists of:</p>



 
 Creating the number of cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “icount” configuration property. 



 Creating the number of pre-rotated cryptographic key pairs as indicated in the “ncount” configuration property. 



 Creating a valid, properly formatted inception event signed by all of the keys included in the “icount” set. 



 Adding that inception event to the controller’s key event log. 



 Sending the inception event to each witness in set of witnesses configured in the inception configuration you wrote above. <br>The set of witnesses is defined in the configuration file passed to the <code>--file</code> argument. 



 Receiving key event receipts (KERs) of the inception event from each witness. 



 Adding the key event receipts from the witnesses to the key event receipt log (KERL) for the controller.  
 



<p>All of these steps are performed for you when you execute the <code>kli incept</code> command. The below example from <code>workflow.sh</code> shows the inception of Richard’s AID:</p>



 <code>kli incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --file "${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE}"</code> 



<p>Repeat this procedure for each Elayne, Ramiel, and Zaqiel with the keystore and alias names indicated in the BASH variables at the top of the <code>workflow.sh</code> script in the <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial">Abydos Tutorial repository</a>.</p>



<p>Next, for those who are using agents, we show how to use the KERI Mark I Agent to perform keystore setup and inception.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Keep in mind that you only need to create the keystores once whether you create the keystores with the KLI or the Agent API. Only proceed to create the keystores and perform inception with the Agent API if you have not already done so with the KLI.</p>



<p>Setting up a KERI controller keystore and AID with an agent involves the following three REST requests:</p>



 
 POST to <code>/boot</code> to initialize the keystore
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli init</code> command. 
 
 



 PUT to <code>/boot</code> to unlock the keystore
 
 This does not have a direct analogue with the KLI though the <code>--passcode</code> argument used with <code>kli init</code>, <code>kli incept</code>, and many other KLI commands serves a similar purpose. 
 
 



 POST to <code>/ids/${ALIAS}</code> to perform the inception event
 
 This is similar to the <code>kli incept</code> command. 
 
 
 



<p>Data in the request bodies for each of these requests is very similar to the command line argument data for each of the corresponding commands using the KLI.</p>



 curl Common Headers, arguments, and pipes 



 Headers 



<p>The “Accept: */*” and “Content-Type: application/json” HTTP headers are common to all of the commands used in the <code>workflow.sh</code> scripts.</p>



 Arguments 



<p>The “-s” argument to cURL is the “silent” option and ensures that only the response body of the target HTTP request is sent to the standard output channel.</p>



<p>The backslash <a href="https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Escape-Character">“\” escape character</a> is often used in BASH scripts to make commands more readable by enabling splitting of the commands across multiple lines.</p>



 Pipes 



<p>jq: Heavy usage of the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> program, a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON parser, is made throughout this tutorial. Most often the results of a cURL command will be piped to the jq program and then the jq program will select an attribute from the response  body using a selector expression like <code>'.["msg"]'</code> in the example below.</p>



<p>tr: Frequently the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_(Unix)">tr</a> program is used to trim double quotes off of the JSON output returned from the jq program. As seen in the example below tr is used with the <code>-d</code> flag to delete all tokens of the specified set from input. This is needed since often the value of a cURL request needs to be placed in a BASH variable and the extra quotes returned along with the JSON body are problematic to deal with an so it is easier to remove them altogether.</p>



<p>Both jq and tr are often used together in a sequence as shown below.</p>



 <code>...(more code causing JSON to be sent to standard out)... \
| jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



 KERI Controller Keystore Create – Agent 



<p>This operation is a POST to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint which creates a keystore where the body is a JSON object with the value placed in the “name” property of the JSON body used to name the keystore. The “salt” value is the cryptographic salt used as the cryptographic seed to derive all key pairs in the keystore. You can use the <code>kli salt</code> command to generate a new salt.</p>



<p>The <code>${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}</code> is define on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L127">Line 127 of workflow.sh</a> and looks like this:<br><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5620">http://127.0.0.1:5620</a></p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>As you can see the “name” and “salt” options are similar to the similarly named arguments to KLI init. The difference here is that they are in the body of the POST request as JSON. The result is piped to “jq” and then “tr” to extract and print the result message to the terminal.</p>



<p>Next the keystore must be unlocked.</p>



 KERI Controller Keystore Unlock – Agent 



<p>Unlocking a keystore is a PUT to the <code>/boot</code> endpoint using the same JSON body as was POSTed to initialize the keystore. This is used to permit a particular Agent to work with a specified keystore. This is useful because an agent may have been restarted after initializing the keystore and so the Agent must establish an authenticated connection to the keystore.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X PUT "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/boot" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"name\": \"${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE}\",
           \"salt\": \"${EXPLORER_SALT}\"}" \
  | jq '.["msg"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Next the keystore is ready to have an AID, also known as a prefix, created and incepted.</p>



 KERI Controller AID (Prefix) Create and Incept – Agent 



<p>Creating an AID requires submitting a POST request to the <code>/ids/{alias}</code> path of a controller agent. The body of the request is the same controller inception configuration file you wrote earlier when performing <code>kli incept</code>. The file is reproduced below for reference:</p>



 Inception Configuration File 



 <code>{
  "transferable": true,
  "wits": [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  "toad": 3,
  "icount": 1,
  "ncount": 1,
  "isith": "1",
  "nsith": "1"
}</code> 



<p>The contents of this file are placed in the body of the HTTP request as submitted below:</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/ids/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data @${CONTROLLER_INCEPTION_CONFIG_FILE} \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>The jq and tr pipes here select the AID prefix that comes in the response body of the request. You can see on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L471">Line 471 of workflow.sh</a> this sequence is used to capture Richard’s prefix and store it in the <code>RICHARD_PREFIX</code> bash variable.</p>



 Keystore and Inception Review 



<p>Once you get the hang of creating keystores and performing inception events then you will see the similarities between the KLI and the Agent API. When you have finished creating all of the keystores you need, one each for the Explorer, Librarian, Wise Man, and Gatekeeper, then you are ready to move on to the next step for connecting all of the agents together using out of band introductions, or OOBIs.</p>



 Out of Band Introductions (OOBIs) Between Controllers 



<p>Routes in a routing table or DNS entries are internet discovery system analogues to help understand the purpose out of band introductions. ATHENA requires a number of components in the Abydos network to talk to each other and thus an OOBI must be created or “resolved” for each connection between components.</p>


 
 


<p>You can think of an OOBI as an address with a role for one controller to contact either another controller or a KERI resource such as a credential schema. In order for one controller to be able to issue a credential to another controller it must know where that other controller is. The role</p>



<p>For example, in the diagram above, in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to Richard he must have an OOBI that shows the location of Richard that includes a witness for Richard. This witness is necessary so Ramiel can verify that the KEL sent from Richard matches up to the AID prefix included in the OOBI URL. component that knows Richard. In this case that is the “wan” witness</p>



 OOBIs described 



<p>Out of band introductions (OOBIs) are the discovery mechanism for KERI controllers and KERI objects such as ACDC Schemas or cached ACDCs. OOBIs tell one controller how to reach another controller or object and are identified both by an AID prefix as well as an alias label.</p>



<p>The terminology “out-of-band” here refers to the fact that the general purpose internet infrastructure like IP routers, gateways, and DNS servers, are not part of KERI and are thus out-of-band with respect to KERI. The primary advantage to using this general purpose infrastructure for service discovery means KERI doesn’t have to provide it’s own discovery mechanism since it can piggy back on the existing internet infrastructure.</p>



<p>Discovery over the internet includes endpoint discovery of witnesses, watchers, and other network participants including <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#285f">jurors</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#28f1">judges</a> (not yet implemented). According to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html">Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol</a> specification:</p>



<blockquote><p>[OOBIs provide] a discovery mechanism that associates a given URI or URL with a given AID (Autonomic IDentifier) or SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier)&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI_ID">KERI_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#KERI">KERI</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#SAID_ID">SAID_ID</a>][<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-oobi/draft-ssmith-oobi.html#OOBI_ID">OOBI_ID</a>]. The URI provided by an OOBI acts as a service endpoint for the discovery of verifiable information about the AID or SAID. As such an OOBI itself is not trusted but must be verified.</p>Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. smith</blockquote>



<p>In the specification the usage of the terms “endpoint” or “service endpoint” just mean the URL to use to access some KERI resource.</p>



 OOBIs must be verified 



<p>The above quote draws attention to the fact that that OOBI URLs themselves are not trustable and must be verified. What does this mean? What is being verified? Since OOBI URLs merely point to a controller’s AID (prefix) the OOBU must be used to retrieve the full key event log from that controller referenced by the prefix. This key event log is then verified using the witness identified by the witness prefix at the end of the OOBI, in the case of a witness OOBI. If the controller proves control over the key referenced by the KEL then the verifier of the OOBI can then trust they have securely discovered the controller referenced by the OOBI.</p>



<p>A witness OOBI looks like the following example:</p>



 <code>"http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha"</code> 



<p>The template for this OOBI URL is as follows:</p>



 <code>[proto]://[wit host]:[wit port]/oobi/[controller prefix]/[role]/[wit prefix]</code> 



 OOBIs may have roles 



<p>This is an OOBI that shows a witness for a given prefix. This type of OOBI includes a “witness” role and a witness prefix. This witness prefix corresponds to the witness host and port earlier in the OOBI URL. This witness will have a full key event log of all of that controller’s key events and thus can be used to verify that the controller’s KEL matches to the controller prefix included in the OOBI URL. This verification process is a part of what is known as “resolving” an OOBI.</p>



<p>See <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/kering.py#L23">kering.py:L23</a> for a full list of other OOBI roles including controller, witness, registrar, watcher, judge, juror, peer, mailbox, and agent, at present.</p>



 Richard to Ramiel OOBIs – pairwise exchange 



<p>The following modified OOBI diagram shows greater detail of what the OOBIs exchanged between Richard and Ramiel look like. Since both Ramiel and Richard exchange OOBIs with each other this is called a pairwise OOBI exchange.</p>


 
 


<p>Since both witness OOBIs use the “wan” witness to resolve key state they have a secondary arrow pointing to wan in addition to their primary arrow to indicate this relationship.</p>



<p>In general, each controller wanting to communicate with another controller must resolve an OOBI with the target controller that describes where the controller is located over the internet so that the source controller can send messages to that destination controller. </p>



<p>In the case of Ramiel an OOBI must be resolved for both Elayne and Richard in order for Ramiel to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to them. Similarly, Elayne and Richard both must resolve an OOBI that describes where Ramiel is located over the internet. All of these introductions are performed in both the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L525">make_introductions_kli</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L581">make_introductions_agent</a></code> functions in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Abydos OOBIs 



<p>The journey to Abydos requires that each controller is known for a certain reason. These reasons may include:</p>



 
 Credential Issuance: an issuing controller must have an OOBI for the isuee’s controller who will receive the credential. This is the case when Ramiel needs to issue the TreasureHuntingJourney credential to both Richard and Elayne. Likewise, Richard must know how to contact Ramiel in order to issue him the JourneyMarkRequest credential. 



 Credential Presentation: a credential holding controller must have the OOBI for the target node they will be sending a credential presentation to so that the presentation can reach the intended destination. This is the case when Richard and Elayne want to send the JourneyCharter credential to Zaqiel in order to be permitted entrance into Abydos. 
 



<p>These OOBI introductions are the controller-to-controller OOBIs needed during network operation. Keep in mind that there were OOBIs resolved in network setup and configuration for each of the witnesses as well as the four credential schemas used.</p>



<p>Use the commands below to perform all of the needed OOBI introductions as indicated on the graphic below.</p>


 
 


 Controller Introductions – KLI 



<p>Using the KLI to resolve a witness OOBI for a controller involves</p>



 
 specifying the target keystore with the <code>--name</code> argument,  



 setting an OOBI alias with the <code>--oobi-alias</code> property and  



 passing in a witness OOBI to the <code>--oobi</code> argument as shown below. 
 



 <code>kli oobi resolve --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --oobi-alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --oobi ${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}</code> 



<p>An OOBI resolution is a very simple operation and produces output similar to the following:</p>



 <code>http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q/witness/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha resolved</code> 



 Controller Introductions – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Using the Agent API to resolve an OOBI is very similar to the KLI. All the properties are passed in through the HTTP request body as a JSON object as shown below.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/oobi" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"oobialias\": \"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",       
       \"url\":\"${WAN_WITNESS_URL}/oobi/${RICHARD_PREFIX}/witness/${WAN_PREFIX}\"}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>This should result in a 202 HTTP status code when successful.</p>



<p>Once you have performed all OOBI creations for the controllers as depicted in the diagram above then move on to creating credential registries.</p>



 Credential Registries 


 
 


<p>In order to issue credentials from one controller to the next a credential registry must exist in both the issuing controller’s keystore to create and issue the credential from as well as in the receiving controller’s (issuee’s) keystore to receive the issued credential. This requires adding a new concept to manage the credential registry as well as any credentials issued from the registry. Enter the transaction event log <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/transaction-event-log">transaction event log</a> (TEL).</p>



 Transaction Event Logs (TELs) 



<p>A transaction event log is a log of all events occurring for a verifiable credential or a credential registry that manages verifiable credentials. All TEL events are anchored in a KEL in either <code>ixn</code> (interaction) or <code>rot</code> (rotation) events. This is the foundation enabling a verifiable credential protocol to be built on top of KERI. This protocol is known as the authentic chained data container, or ACDC protocol. See the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC specification</a> for a complete description of this protocol.</p>



<p>Two further sub-protocols within the ACDC paradigm further elaborate on creating registries and handling the verifiable credential lifecycle. These are the Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) and the Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocols. </p>



 Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) protocol 



<p>PTEL has two major parts the first being the details of using transaction event logs (TELs) to connect ACDCs to key event logs (KELs) and the second being the handling of events in the lifecycle of a credential including issuance and revocation. </p>



<p>There are two types of TELs:</p>



 
 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-management-tel">management TEL</a> for managing an ACDC (credential) registry and tracks the list of Registrars that will act as Backers for individual TELs for each verifiable credential (VC). 



 A <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-tels">Verifiable Credential TEL</a> (VC TEL) for managing the issued and revoked state of an individual ACDC. The VC TEL also contains a reference to its corresponding management TEL. There are only two events in a VC TEL which are the issuance and then a subsequent revocation, if ever. 
 



<p>PTEL describes the details of transaction event logs. The following introduction from the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html">PTEL specification</a> summarizes well the purpose of transaction event logs:</p>



<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;Transaction Event Log&nbsp;(TEL) is a hash linked data structure of transactions that can be used to track state. A&nbsp;Public Verifiable Credential Registry&nbsp;can be represented in several TELs to establish issuance or revocation state of a Verifiable Credential (VC). The KEL is used to establish control authority over the keys used to commit to the events of the TEL and sign the VC. The events of the TEL are used to establish the issuance or revocation state of the VCs issued by the controller of the identifier represented by the KEL.</p>Public Transaction Event Logs (PTEL) IETF Draft Specification – P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocol 



<p>Building upon the PTEL specification IPEX describes what happens between credential registries. This protocol defines the disclosure workflow events used to share information between the Discloser and the Disclosee.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs&nbsp;[<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ipex/draft-ssmith-ipex.html#ACDC-ID">ACDC-ID</a>]&nbsp;in a securely attributable manner.</p>Issuance and Presentation Exchange Protocol IETF Draft specification – S. M. Smith, P. Feairheller</blockquote>



 Registry Creation 


 
 


<p>A registry creation event occurs in a TEL and has the type <code>vcp</code>. See the “<a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-ptel/draft-pfeairheller-ptel.html#name-verifiable-credential-regis">Verifiable Credential Registry</a>” section of the PTEL specification for a complete description of TEL event types. To avoid overburdening the diagram below the individual <code>ixn</code> events for each credential issuance are not included in the KEL nor are the <code>iss</code> events included in the TELs. The blue credential graphic to the right is used on successive versions of the diagram to represent credential issuances.</p>



<p>The below diagram shows the registry creation event as an interaction event in the KEL of each controller as well as the corresponding TEL created to manage the creation of each credential issued by or to each controller. </p>


 
 


<p>The IN column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has received.<br>The OUT column in a TEL indicates credentials the controller has issued.</p>



<p>Both of these columns start out empty and will be filled as credentials are issued.</p>



 Registry Creation – KLI 



<p>All that is needed to create a registry is:</p>



 
 a keystore name with the <code>--name</code> argument to select the keystore to create the registry inside of, 



 an alias with the <code>--alias</code> argument to select the AID to use to issue credentials from that registry, 



 and the name of the registry with the <code>--registry-name</code> argument. 
 



 <code>kli vc registry incept --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}</code> 



<p>This creates a registry named by the <code>--registry-name</code> argument value with a management TEL. The registry’s management TEL will be used to keep track of the backers for each credential.</p>



<p>Additional arguments accepted by the command not shown above include:</p>



 
 <code>--nonce</code>: unique random value to seed the credential registry. 



 <code>--no-backers</code>: boolean to not allow setting up backers different from the anchoring KEL. 



 <code>--establishment-only</code>: boolean to only allow establishment events for the anchoring of events in this registry. 



 <code>--backers</code>: the new set of backers different from the anchoring KEL witnesses to be used when setting backers for credentials from this registry. Can appear multiple times. 



 <code>--base</code>, <code>--alias</code>, and <code>--passcode</code> like the <code>kli init</code> and <code>kli incept</code> commands. 
 



<p>There is no TOAD (threshold of acceptable duplicity) argument for the KLI since as of March 2023 it has not been needed nor has the external backer feature been used or tested in production. Nonetheless a default TOAD is computed based on the length of the backer list sent in as you can see on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/446eca9a694166e24416221ec49736cb071cd790/src/keri/vdr/eventing.py#L95">Line 95 of eventing.py</a>. If you need this feature then be sure to open an issue on the KERIpy GitHub repo and attend a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri#meetings">community dev meeting</a> (every other Tuesday at 8 AM UTC-6 DST / UTC-7 Non-DST).</p>



 Registry Creation – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Creating a registry using the Agent API is similar to the KLI except that the values passed as arguments to <code>kli vc registry incept</code> are instead located in the body as a JSON object.</p>



 <code>curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/registries" \
  -H "accept: */*" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"alias\":\"${EXPLORER_ALIAS}\",
       \"baks\": [],
       \"estOnly\":false,
       \"name\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"noBackers\":true,
       \"toad\":0}" \
  | jq</code> 



<p>Once again here the output is piped to “jq” though this is only to make the response easy on the eyes.</p>



<p>Next we move to one of the most exciting parts of this journey, the issuing of credentials!</p>



 Credential Issuance 


 
 


<p>Value generation from the entire decentralized identity space centers around verifiable credentials. Wrap some data attributes in a container defined by a schema and you now have a verifiable bearer instrument that is a part of your digital reputation. A credential is the fundamental unit, or currency, of reputation. </p>



 Name – Why ACDC? 



<p>Now where does the name authentic chained data container come from and how did it get attached to the verifiable credential space? Three points make this clear:</p>



 
 Since ACDC-style credentials are verifiable as authentic using the KERI decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI), 



 since ACDC-style credentials can be easily chained as a directed, acyclic graph (DAG),  



 and since the schema of an ACDC creates a shape or container for data,  
 



<p>you can see how those concepts combined to create the name (1) authentic (2) chained (3) data container, or ACDC.</p>



 Purpose 



<p>The introductory quote from the ACDC spec sums up well the purpose of the ACDC protocol:</p>



<blockquote><p>One primary purpose of the ACDC protocol is to provide granular provenanced proof-of-authorship (authenticity) of their contained data via a tree or chain of linked ACDCs (technically a directed acyclic graph or DAG). Similar to the concept of a chain-of-custody, ACDCs provide a verifiable chain of proof-of-authorship of the contained data. […] <br><br>These proofs of authorship and/or authority provide provenance of an ACDC itself and by association any data that is so conveyed.</p>Authentic Chained Data Containers IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>Verifiable authorizations, permissions, rights, and credentials that include a full provenance chain anchored in key event logs make KERI an elegant way to capture and unlock reputation value as well as serve as a robust solution for identity and access management systems.</p>



<p>To learn in-depth about all the particulars for ACDCs read the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html">Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC) IETF draft specification</a> by Dr. Samuel M. Smith.</p>



<p>With this brief interlude on the name and purpose of ACDCs out of the way next we dive into the specific credentials we will issue for the journey to Abydos.</p>



 Credentials for Abydos 



<p>Multiple different credentials are issued during different parts of the overall ATHENA trust workflow in the journey to Abydos. The following graphic shows a small blue icon representing each issued (OUT) or received (IN) credential.</p>


 
 


<p>The four credentials that will be issued over the course of the journey include:</p>



 
 TreasureHuntingJourney: this is issued by the Wise Man to each of the explorers, Richard and Elayne, to tell them about a potential journey they could go on. It represents a commitment by ATHENA to a potential explorer as an offer of a journey they could embark upon. 



 JourneyMarkRequest: this is issued by an explorer to the Wise Man as a commitment to join the party for a particular TreasureHuntingJourney. Both Richard and Elayne issue this to Ramiel. 



 JourneyMark: this is issued by the Wise Man to an explorer as an acknowledgment that ATHENA accepted that explorer onto the requested TreasureHuntingJourney. This is issued by Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne. 



 JourneyCharter: once the party threshold for a journey is reached (threshold logic not yet implemented) the Wise Man issues a JourneyCharter credential to each party member who will be going on the journey. This includes Richard and Elayne. 
 



<p>On to our first credential!</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – KLI 



<p>The TreasureHuntingJourney must be issued to both Richard and Elayne as depicted in the graphic below. </p>


 
 


<p>As you see Ramiel has both of these credentials in the OUT column to indicate he has issued these credentials and both Richard and Elayne have them in the IN column indicating they have received these credentials.</p>



<p>The following command shows issuance of this credential to Richard.</p>



 <code>kli vc issue --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${RICHARD_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</code> 



<p>This shows issuance of a credential:</p>



 
 <code>--name</code>: from the Wise Man’s keystore 



 <code>--alias</code>: using the Ramiel AID  



 <code>--schema</code>: using the schema SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney schema. 



 <code>--recipient</code>: The recipient is Richard 



 <code>--data</code>: and the data sent in is specific to the credential issued to Richard. 
 



<p>The only arguments we haven’t used yet for this command are as follows:</p>



 
 <code>--edges</code>: This is for adding the edge links to other credentials, the “chain” part of authentic chained data containers. We will see this in use for the next credential we issue, the JourneyMarkRequest. 



 <code>--rules</code>: This is where the Ricardian Contracts come in to ACDCs. The TreasureHuntingJourney credential did not use the <code>--rules</code> option since the rules were baked in to the schema definition. However, the JourneyMarkRequest schema is different and uses rules passed in. 
 



 Richard’s TreasureHuntingJourneyCredential Data 



 <code>{
  "destination": "Osireion",
  "treasureSplit": "50/50",
  "partyThreshold": 2,
  "journeyEndorser": "Ramiel"
}</code> 



<p>This is the data located in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json">abydos-tutorial/athena/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json</a></code> file. It is used for both Richard’s and Elayne’s credential.</p>



<p>Listing the credentials  while polling (causes messages to be delivered)</p>



<p>Once the credential is issued using <code>kli vc issue</code> it can take a few moments to arrive so the <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> command is useful to wait for the credential to arrive.</p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} --poll</code> 



<p>The output of this command looks as follows:</p>



 <code>Checking mailboxes for any received credentials......

Current received credentials for richard (EJS0-vv_OPAQCdJLmkd5dT0EW-mOfhn_Cje4yzRjTv8q):

    Type: Treasure Hunting Journey
    Status: Issued ✔

    Issued on 2023-03-27T20:23:48.536543+00:00</code> 



<p>As long as you see the <code>Status: Issued ✔</code> then you can know you have issued the credential correctly.</p>



 Issue TreasureHuntingJourney Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Issuing credentials with the Agent is very similar to the command line except all of the data arguments are added as JSON body attributes as shown below.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/osireion-treasure-hunting-journey.json)

curl -s -X POST "${WISEMAN_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${JOURNEY_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${RICHARD_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}" \
  | jq '.["d"]' | tr -d '"'</code> 



<p>Once again I pipe the response to jq and tr to select the SAID of the credential which returns in the “d” field. This is useful to store the SAID in a BASH variable for use later in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Get SAID of TreasureHuntingJourney credential issued 



<p>Another way to get the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney credential is by using a GET request to the <code>/credentials/</code>${ALIAS} endpoint.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Use this GET request if you need to read in the SAID of a particular AID. The pipe combination to selects the “d” attribute from the first credential in the list (“.[0]”) returned.</p>



 Advanced Credential Issuance – with Edges and Rules 



 ACDCs with Edges 



<p>The preceding credential issuance of TreasureHuntingJourney credentials was interesting yet it did not include one of the critical features of ACDCs: edges. Since a graph of ACDCs is connected by edges then knowing how to use an edge to connect, or “chain,” credentials together enables you to represent your domain’s credential data as a graph data structure, specifically a directed acyclic graph, which is just an append-only data structure. The JourneyMarkRequest credential includes an edge that points to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential as shown in the graph below.</p>


 
 


<p>The edge from the JourneyMarkRequest is labeled as “journey”. This is represented in the schema for the JourneyMarkRequest as well as in the schema map JSON file that KASLCred reads in. Edges can be traversed to resolve, inspect, and validate the credential the edge points to.</p>



 ACDC Rules – Ricardian Contracts 



<p>We also show an alternate way to specify rules with the <code>--rules</code> option to the KLI and the “rules” property of the JSON object sent to the Agent.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – KLI 



<p>Once the JourneyMarkRequest Credentials are issued your network will be in the following state:</p>


 
 


<p>Both Richard and Elayne will have issued JourneyMarkRequest credentials to Ramiel and these credentials will have an edge pointing back to the TreasureHuntingJourney credential Ramiel issued to them. </p>



<p>A few steps are involved in issuing the JourneyMarkRequest credential due to the fact that it points to another credential, the TreasureHuntingJourney credential. These steps include:</p>



 
 Prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Saidify the TreasureHuntingJourney edge 



 Include the TreasureHuntingJourney edge inside the JourneyMarkRequest during issuance. 
 



 Prepare TresureHuntingJourney Edge 



<p>A few steps are required to prepare the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for inclusion in the JourneyMarkRequest credential. All of these steps are used to write a JSON file with the edge data that will be included to either the <code>--data</code> argument to <code>kli vc issue</code> with the KLI or embedded within the “source” attribute of the JSON object POSTed to <code>"/credentials/{alias}</code>” with the Agent.</p>



 JQ filters 



<p>JQ filters are useful to write values to a JQ object which eventually will become JSON. See the “Object Construction” section of the “<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#TypesandValues">Types and Values</a>” section of the JQ documentation for a full explanation. In the below code, as well as in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L697">issue_treasurehuntingjourney_credentials_agent</a></code> function in <code>workflow.sh</code> the following JQ object is used to construct an edge:</p>



 <code>{  
  d: \"\", 
  journey: {
    n: ., 
    s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"
  }
}</code> 



<p>The BASH variable “TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID” is added in before the <code>echo</code> statement writes that JQ object to the file “JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER”. This SAID is what it seems, the SAID of the TreasureHuntingJourney ACDC Schema. This is written into the JQ filter object.</p>



<p>JQ is then used to add the “EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID” into the “n” field of the JQ filter using the period “.” expression with the input piped into <code>jq</code> to output the resulting edge JSON.</p>



 <code>JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge-filter.jq

RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE=${ATHENA_DIR}/credential_edges/richard-journey-edge.json

echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"

EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema "${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}")

echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" \
  | jq -f "${JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

# Add SAID to the JourneyMarkRequest rules
kli saidify --file "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 SAIDify TreasureHuntingJourneyEdge 



<p>Finally after writing the edge JSON the file is SAIDified with <code>kli saidify</code>. This populates the “d” attribute of the JSON with a self addressing identifier, or SAID. A self addressing identifier, according to the <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-said/draft-ssmith-said.html#section-1-2">spec</a>, is:</p>



<blockquote><p>is a special class of content-addressable identifier that is also self-referential […] this approach of deriving self-referential identifiers from the contents they identify, is called&nbsp;<code>self-addressing</code>. It allows any validator to verify or re-derive the&nbsp;<code>self-referential, self-addressing identifier</code>&nbsp;given the contents it identifies.</p>Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID) IETF Draft Specification – Dr. Samuel M. Smith</blockquote>



<p>This essentially means the value of the “d” field is computed from the value of everything else in the JSON object and as such is a value derived from everything else in the JSON object, thus self-addressing. Read the spec to learn about the specialized derivation function required to verify a SAID.</p>



<p>The following is an example of a complete TreasureHuntingJourney edge:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "EGRPqBFL0xM0CPeTyc487pfO-MtR5UlYub0S-Rpyx6nm",
  "journey": {
    "n": "EE0MvGRafksqpzyCYXm6tfaiKYR9LpUsV8YGD8KSMRIS",
    "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l"
  }
}</code> 



<p>Once the SAIDified file is created then the “journey” edge is ready to be incorporated into the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest credential with edge 



<p>By now many of the options used below for <code>kli vc issue</code> will be familiar to you. Using the at symbol “<code>@</code>” in the arguments instructs the command to retrieve the contents of the file indicated by the file path. The command options in addition to <code>--name</code> and <code>--alias</code> describe above include:</p>



 
 <code>--registry-name</code> as the registry from which to issue the credential. 



 <code>--schema</code> indicating which ACDC schema to use. Value is the SAID from the “$id” field of the schema you are using to issue the credential with. 



 <code>--recipient</code> indicates who is receiving the issued ACDC. The value is the AID prefix for the recipient of the ACDC. An OOBI must resolved for the recipient’s prefix so that the issuer controller knows where to send the ACDC. 



 <code>--data</code> is the credential-specific data that is described by the “attributes” section of schema referenced by the <code>--schema</code> argument. 



 <code>--edges</code> is the JSON object that contains the edge definitions to link the credentials together. 



 <code>--rules</code> is the JSON object containing the Ricardian Contract definitions for this particular ACDC. 
 



 Data 



<p>An example of the data for this credential is as follows:</p>



 <code>{
  "requester": {
    "firstName": "Richard",
    "lastName": "Ayris",
    "nickname": "Dunkie"
  },
  "desiredPartySize": 2,
  "desiredSplit": 50.00
}</code> 



 Command 



 <code> kli vc issue --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${EXPLORER_REGISTRY} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --recipient "${WISEMAN_PREFIX}" \
  --data @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json \
  --edges @"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}" \
  --rules @"${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json</code> 



 List Credentials to see newly issued Request 



<p>Once again we wait for the credential to be issued with <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> using the <code>--schema</code> SAID of the JourneyMarkRequest schema. This polls for all credentials the wise man has received under this schema. </p>



 <code>kli vc list --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --schema "${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  --poll</code> 



<p>This will provide output similar to the following:</p>

 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Performing the issuance of the JourneyMarkRequest with the Mark I Agent is very similar to using. the KLI. The primary difference is that the JSON files passed in to <code>--data</code>, <code>--edges</code>, and <code>--rules</code> are placed inside the JSON body of the HTTP POST request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/</code> route.</p>

<p>The preparation steps here are pretty much identical to preparing the TreasureHuntingJourney edge for the KLI version of this section.</p>

echo "{d: \"\", journey: {n: ., s: \"${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}\"}}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}"

EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${TREASURE_HUNTING_JOURNEY_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')

echo \""${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_SAID}"\" | jq -f "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE_FILTER}" &gt;"${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"

kli saidify --file "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}"
</code> 



<p>Once you have the SAIDified edge file ready then you use it to issue the JourneyMarkRequest credential.</p>



 Issue JourneyMarkRequest Credential 



<p>To simplify issuing this credential from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script the contents of the JSON files for the data, rules, and edges are stored in BASH variables using the <code>VARNAME=$(cat FILENAME)</code> pattern. This makes it easy to include the contents in the <code>curl</code> command below.</p>



 <code>REQUEST_RULES=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_rules/journey-mark-request-rules.json)
RICHARD_MARK_DATA=$(cat "${ATHENA_DIR}"/credential_data/journey-mark-request-data-richard.json)
RICHARD_EDGE_DATA=$(cat "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_EDGE}")

curl -s -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"credentialData\":${RICHARD_MARK_DATA},
       \"recipient\":\"${WISEMAN_PREFIX}\",
       \"registry\":\"${EXPLORER_REGISTRY}\",
       \"schema\":\"${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
       \"source\":${RICHARD_EDGE_DATA},
       \"rules\":${REQUEST_RULES}}" \
  | jq '.d' | tr -d '"'

# since there is no polling then sleep to wait for credential delivery
sleep 5</code> 



<p>There doesn’t exist an equivalent to <code>kli vc list ... --poll</code> in the KERIpy Mark I agent so you can perform a <code>sleep 5</code> or something similar for an equivalent wait to ensure that a request to <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> will return the issued credential. You could also manually poll this endpoint, process the JSON array of credentials returned, and then continue to poll if the return body doesn’t contain the expected credential.</p>



<p>Next we move on to reviewing the listed credentials with a GET request.</p>



 List Credentials to see newly issued request 



<p>Make a GET request to the <code>/credentials/{alias}/type=issued&amp;schema={schema_said}</code> endpoint on a Mark I agent to get all credentials issued by that agent’s controller of the specified schema type. Below. I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html">command substitution</a> to encapsulate this sort of request as well as a pipe to jq and tr in order to retrieve the credential SAID for later use in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_REQUEST_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=issued&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_MARK_REQUEST_SCHEMA_SAID}" | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')</code> 



<p>Executing the GET request to a controller, in this case the Wise Man, without the command substitution returns a response that looks similar to the following, with some attributes minimized:</p>


 
 


<p>There will be more than one credential returned if you issue this GET request after running the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Issuance Wrap Up 



 Issuing the JourneyMark Credential 



<p>Issuing the JourneyMark credential is essentially the same process as the JourneyMarkRequest issuance only with different data, edges, and rules. As a challenge for you try to issue this credential without reading the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L834">issue_journeymark_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L883">issue_journeymark_credentials_agent</a></code> functions in <code>workflow.sh</code>.</p>



<p>Once the JourneyMark credentials have been issued your issuance state will look like the following:</p>


 
 


<p>As you can see the JourneyMark credentials have been issued from Ramiel to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



 Issuing the JourneyCharter Credential 



<p>The presence of two edges in the edge file is the only substantive difference in issuing this credential as compared to the issuance of both the JourneyMarkRequest and the JourneyMark credential issuance processes. The finished edge file looks like this:</p>



 <code>{
  "d": "",
  "mark": {
    "n": "EI4Z_hKC7hzWfslkhGD8tGv0eMQCBpmVXx-sJ3Xugz8_",
    "s": "EBEefH4LNQswHSrXanb-3GbjCZK7I_UCL6BdD-zwJ4my"
  },
  "journey": {
    "n": "EPxgzkyYW6VdIx0cazHxioyiNMGDl01jlZwPD71hbBae",
    "s": "EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l"
  }
}</code> 



<p>As an added challenge to top it all off for this section take your knowledge of schema writing, schema linking, edge creation, and credential issuance and make your best attempt at assembling your own JourneyCharter edges file for use in issuing the JourneyCharter credential. If you get stuck you can look at the code in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#LL937C10-L937C42">issue_journeycharter_credentials</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L998">issue_journeycharter_credentials_agent</a></code> functions from the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 Final Credential Issuance State 



<p>Once all of the credentials have been issued you will have the state of your credential issuance as shown in the below picture.</p>


 
 


<p>This shows that Ramiel has issued the JourneyCharter to both Richard and Elayne.</p>



<p>With all of the credentials issued we can finally move on to one of the most exciting parts, Credential Presentation.</p>



 Credential Presentation 



<p>In order for a decentralized identity credentialing system to have any value it must be able to plug into a business process somewhere. Credential presentation is the beginning of plugging in a credentialing system to your custom business process logic. Your primary option here is to write a custom controller. The “<a href="https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/sally">Sally</a>” project is one such custom controller. It treats KERIpy as a library on top of which to layer in your custom business logic. I did precisely this in <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">my fork</a> of Sally (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper), which I explain below.</p>



<p>Custom business logic must plug directly in to the credential processing workflow within a controller and respond to credential validation actions that occur when a credential is presented based on whether the credential is issued or revoked. The point at which the custom business logic comes into contact with the decentralized identity system are in custom handler functions written in your custom controller.</p>



<p>A webhook is called from the custom handler functions to illustrate how you would signal controller events to an app, possibly a wallet app, waiting to be notified of event completions from the KERI Agent.</p>



 Presentation Handling Setup 



<p>In order to respond to the credential presentation we must do the following setup steps:</p>



 
 Ensure version 0.6.0 of the <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally">kentbull/sally</a> fork (a.k.a. Abydos Gatekeeper) is installed with <code>python -m pip install -e ./</code> from the fork repo root. 



 Write a credential type mapping file similar to the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings.json">schema-mappings.json</a></code> file that pairs the ACDC schema SAIDs you wrote with credential type names that will be keyed off of in the custom controller. This is important so that the schema SAIDs you generated in your schema linking step match up with the ones the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) expects. 



 Start the Abydos Gatekeeper (sally) with the appropriate command line arguments including the mapping file you wrote (or copied from the tutorial repo). 



 Start the webhook on the same port you specified when you started the Abydos Gatekeeper 



 Present the credential. 



 Await the webhook’s response to the credential. 
 



 Examples in workflow.sh script 



<p>All of these steps, except dependency installation, are written into the <code>workflow.sh</code> script.</p>



 
 The schema mappings file writing occurs on <a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L199">line 199 inside read_schema_saids</a>. Once again jq is used, this time with the <code>--null-input</code> argument, to write a JSON file based on a jq filter file, the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/athena/schemas/schema-mappings-filter.jq">schema-mappings-filter.jq</a></code> file. 



 The gatekeeper is started up in the <code><a href="https://github.com/TetraVeda/abydos-tutorial/blob/master/workflow.sh#L512">start_gatekeeper</a></code> function. <br>You will see this includes the <code>--schema-mappings</code> argument that expects the schema mappings file you wrote earlier.<br>This also includes the <code>--web-hook</code> argument. Set this to be the web hook you started earlier. This will be <code>http://127.0.0.1:9923</code>.<br>Finally, the <code>--auth</code> argument must be set to the AID prefix of the Wise Man Ramiel so that the schema validation functions can allow Richard’s and Elayne’s JourneyCharter credentials to pass validation. 
 



<p>Next we walk through the code customizations made to the Sally server that enable responding to ATHENA-specific ACDC schema types.</p>



 Abydos Gatekeeper : Custom Controller Code for credential handlers 



<p>This is the most complicated, least explained portion of this tutorial. If you want to stay out of the inner details of the custom controller and out of KERIpy then just follow the commands listed in the <code>workflow.sh</code> script. On the other hand, if you are willing to venture into this depth I will assume you have some familiarity with Python as well as the bravery to confront the innards of the flow-based programming, hierarchical structured concurrency asynchronous runtime library Dr. Smith wrote, <code><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">ioflo/hio</a></code>, that is at the core of both KERIpy and the Sally custom controller. </p>



<p>After reading through the controller code, or KERIpy code, you may find yourself wanting to write a custom controller either with a different async framework or another language, which are reasonable desires. I encourage you to dig a little deeper into the HIO code and the KERIpy code before rewriting it. I expect to have a future blog post on the HIO library as well as its usage in KERIpy, though do what. you think is most reasonable. I offer this suggestion just to encourage you to become familiar with the core KERI internals mostly so we can increase the core contributor count to KERIpy. Many hands make light work.</p>



 Communicator class 



<p>The <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L113">Communicator</a></code> class in <code>sally/src/sally/core/handling.py</code> is our main focus. The primary difference between the GLEIF-IT upstream repository and my fork of Sally is that I made a dict of schema handlers keyed by the names of credentials so it would be easy to swap in new schema SAIDs to be recognized as I wrote the schema files during initial development of the schemas. I also thought it readable and human-friendly to use schema type names like “TreasureHuntingJourney” as dict keys rather than schema prefixes like “EIxAox3KEhiQ_yCwXWeriQ3ruPWbgK94NDDkHAZCuP9l”.</p>



 <code># line 107-110 in handling.py
JOURNEY_TYPE = 'TreasureHuntingJourney'
REQUEST_TYPE = 'JourneyMarkRequest'
MARK_TYPE = 'JourneyMark'
CHARTER_TYPE = 'JourneyCharter'</code> 



<p>Technically you could hardcode the schema prefixes into your code since once you standardize on a specific set of ACDC schemas and they are in production then you won’t be changing them especially since you must support backwards compatibility likely indefinitely for whatever schemas you release to production. Yet, even with this technical possibility, I prefer to use schema type names so I wrote a a resolver function to resolve a schema.</p>



 Communicator init function 



<p>You can see in the init function I made a dict for schema handlers and another dict for payload handlers that maps the type names above to specific functions.</p>


 
 


<p>I then use two resolver functions, type to SAID and SAID to type, to pair up schema SAIDs from incoming presentations to the configured SAIDs from the schema SAID mapping file we wrote earlier:</p>



 <code>def resolve_said_to_type(self, schema_said):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.said == schema_said:
            return mapping.credential_type
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {schema_said}")

def resolve_type_to_said(self, credential_type):
    for mapping in self.mappings:
        if mapping.credential_type == credential_type:
            return mapping.said
    raise kering.ValidationError(f"no mapping found for schema {credential_type}")</code> 



<p>If no mapping is found for a given type then a ValidationError is raised.</p>



 Schema Validator Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After resolving the schema type for an incoming credential then a handler is selected from the configured SAID mapping file as shown <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L185">on line 185</a> in order to select and then invoke a credential validator:</p>


 
 


 Payload Handler Function Selection and Invocation 



<p>After selecting the validator, and assuming the credential passes validation, a response payload handler is selected <a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#L246">on line 246</a> and then invoked.</p>


 
 


<p>Again, if no schema validator or handler is found an exception is raised. Otherwise the correct handler is selected to validate the schema and then the correct payload handler prepares the response to the presentation event.</p>



<p>Both of the following functions are the most complicated versions of their functions in Abydos Gatekeeper. You can read through the other similar functions if you want more illustrations.</p>



 JourneyCharter schema validator 



<p>As you can see in the <code><a href="https://github.com/kentbull/sally/blob/dev/src/sally/core/handling.py#LL414C12-L414C12">validateJourneyCharter</a></code> function first the ACDC schema SAID is validated, the credential issuer is verified, and then the credential is handed to other validation functions to validate the full credential chain. Refer to the code for a complete understanding of what it means to validate the full credential chain.</p>


 
 


 JourneyCharter payload handler 



<p>In response to a credential presentation the custom controller can return a customized object which. in this case is the data dict beginning at line 511. What makes this payload function more interesting is the use of the registry (reger) object to retrieve data from each of the credentials chained to the JourneyCharter credential.</p>


 
 


<p>With all of this setup complete we are ready to set up the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Setup 



<p>The webhook only starts up a HTTP server on the default port of 9923. You start it up with the following:</p>



 <code>$ sally hook demo

# Should provide output like the following:
launching on port 9923
Sally Web Hook Sample listening on 9923</code> 



<p>Once the webhook is listening then you are ready to make a presentation and receive a response from the controller.</p>



 Present JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Making a presentation request requires knowing the SAID of the credential you want to present as well as the alias of the recipient you want to send the presentation to. This alias must match up the OOBI alias name you used earlier when resolving an OOBI to connect the presenting controller to the target controller the presentation is being sent to.</p>



 <code># First we get the SAID of the JourneyCharter credential for Richard
RICHARD_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})

# Then we present the credential to the Gatekeeper
kli vc present --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said "${RICHARD_CRED_SAID}" \
  --recipient ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS} \
  --include</code> 



<p>The <code>--include</code> option instructs the KLI to send all of the ACDC data in the presentation and is critical in order for the request to work.</p>



<p>Once the presentation is sent you will need to wait a few moments for the target controller to receive the credential, validate it, and then send the response payload to the webhook.</p>



 Webhook Response 



<p>All the webhook does is return a dump of the HTTP headers and the HTTP request body. For example, the Gatekeeper’s response to Richard’s presentation of the JourneyCharter credential looks like the following, and Elayne’s is very similar:</p>

 Present JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>Presenting with the agent is very similar to with the KLI. You must know the recipient alias, corresponding to the “oobialias” property used to register an OOBI earlier, you must know the ACDC schema SAID, as well as the SAID of the credential you want to present.</p>



 <code>EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(curl -s \
  -X GET "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}?type=received&amp;schema=${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}" \
  | jq '.[0] | .sad.d' | tr -d '"')

curl -s \
  -X POST "${EXPLORER_AGENT_URL}/credentials/${EXPLORER_ALIAS}/presentations" \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
        \"recipient\": \"${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}\",
        \"said\": \"${EXPLORER_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}\",
        \"schema\": \"${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID}\",
        \"include\": true
      }"</code> 



<p>Once again the <code>"include": true</code> property is essential to instruct the agent to send all of the ACDC data for the JourneyMark credential and all linked credentials to the recipient controller, the Abydos Gatekeeper.</p>



 Credential Revocation 



<p>Revocation is an essential part of the lifecycle of an ACDC-style credential. A credential may be revoked at any time. This is represented as a “rev” action in the TEL for that ACDC and can be included in either an “ixn” (Interaction) or “rot” (Rotation) event in the controller’s KEL.</p>



 Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – KLI 



<p>Revoking a credential is very simple. Starting with the SAID of the credential to be revoked the below example stores it in the BASH variable <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID</code> which Iis then fed into the <code>kli vc revoke</code> command. </p>



 <code>RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID=$(kli vc list \
  --name ${EXPLORER_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${EXPLORER_ALIAS} \
  --said \
  --schema ${JOURNEY_CHARTER_SCHEMA_SAID})

kli vc revoke --name ${WISEMAN_KEYSTORE} \
  --alias ${WISEMAN_ALIAS} \
  --registry-name ${WISEMAN_REGISTRY} \
  --said "${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --send ${GATEKEEPER_ALIAS}</code> 



<p>Then when this credential is presented again later the Gatekeeper will see that the credential has been revoked. </p>



<p>The <code>--send</code> argument is essential to instruct the issuing controller to send the revocation notice to the target controller, in this case the Gatekeeper. </p>



 Webhook revocation notification 



<p>With the revocation information the Gatekeeper adjusts its internal state for that credential and then triggers the webhook with a revocation payload. The output from the webhook looks like the following:</p>



 <code>Gatekeeper | received request
Gatekeeper | Invalid credential. Revoked on: 2023-03-29T15:17:19.394845+00:00

 Presenting a Revoked Credential 



<p>When you try to present the credential again to the Gatekeeper the revocation status is detected.</p>



 <code>kli vc present --name explorer --alias richard \
  --said ${RICHARD_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID} \
  --recipient zaqiel \
  --include</code> 



<p>Yet the Gatekeeper detects the revoked status:</p>



 <code>revoked credential EIdNBtudTLx3g-WWIYmuvzkUmVnXgT3EdaUC-3JbeAv1 being presented
# ...continues on to send revoked credential to the webhook</code> 



<p>The one thing missing from the Abydos Gatekeeper for this revocation flow is to send a different payload to the webhook when a revoked credential is presented. This topic will be explored in a future blog post.</p>



<p>With that complete we move on to the bonus section on revocation with the Mark I agent.</p>



 Bonus – Revoke JourneyCharter Credential – Agent (Mark I – deprecated) 



<p>A simple revocation is possible with the Mark I Agent yet it is missing functionality similar to the <code>--send</code> argument to <code>kli vc revoke</code> and thus should not be used. It is included here as an illustration of how revocation with an agent may work.</p>



 <code>curl -s \
  -X DELETE "${WISEMAN_AGENT}/credentials/${WISEMAN_ALIAS}?registry=${WISEMAN_REGISTRY}&amp;said=${EXPLORER_JOURNEY_CHARTER_CRED_SAID}" \
  --header 'accept: */*' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'</code> 



<p>The response is an HTTP 202 Accepted and a blank response body.</p>



 Congratulate yourself! 



<p>Your little network is now readys to send our dear treasure hunters on their journey to the Osireion at Abydos! They, and ATHENA, will be very pleased with you and your work. Maybe you will even get a cut of the treasure.</p>

<p>Exploring the architectural patterns we can use with policy-based access control (PBAC) illustrates the difference between policy-based and attribute-based access control (ABAC). </p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">   </a> <p>The primary ways of implementing access control in modern applications are (1) access control lists (ACLs), (2) role-based access control (RBAC), and (3) attribute-based access control (ABAC). I assume you're familiar with these terms in this post. If you're not there's a great explanation in chapter 12 of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1098117697/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>.1</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>To explore access management patterns, let's classify applications requiring fine-grained access management into one of two types:</p>  <p>Structured—these applications can use the structure of the attribute information to simplify access management. For example, an HR application might express a policy as “all L9 managers with more than 10 reports can access compensation management functionality for their reports”. The structure allows attributes like <code>level</code> and <code>number_of_reports</code> to be used to manage access to the compensation tool with a single policy. A smalls set of policies can control access to the compensation tool. These applications are the sweet spot for ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc—these applications allow users to manage access to resources they control based on identifiers for both principals and resources without any underlying structure. For example, Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie. The photo album, Betty, and Charlie have no attributes in common that can be used to write a single attribute-based policy defining access. These applications have a harder time making effective use of ABAC.</p>  <p>Ad hoc access management is more difficult than structured because of the combinatorial explosion of possible access relationships. When any principal can share any resource they control with any other principal and with any subset of possible actions, the number of combinations quickly becomes very large.</p><p>There are several approaches we can take to ad hoc access management:</p>  <p>Policy-based—In this approach the application writes a new policy for every access case. In the example given above, when Alice shares her vacation photo album with Betty and Charlie, the application would create a policy that explicitly permits Betty and Charlie to access Alice’s vacation photo album. Every change in access would result in a new policy or the modification of an existing one. This is essentially using policies as ACLs.</p>  <p>Group-based—In a group-based approach, we create a group for people who can access the vacation photo album and a policy that allows access to the vacation photo album if the user has a group attribute of <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code>. The group name has to be unique to Alice's vacation photo album and includes the allowed action. When Alice shares the album with Betty and Charlie, we add them both to the <code>canAccessVacationPhotos</code> group by putting it in the <code>groups</code>attribute in their profile. Group-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can access <code>vacationPhotosAlbum</code> if <code>P.groups contains canAccessVacationPhotos</code>." This is essentually RBAC.</p>  <p>Resource-based—In this approach, we add a <code>sharedWith</code> or <code>canEdit</code> attribute to Alice’s vacation photos album that records the principals who can access the resource. Now our policy uses the resource attribute to allow access to anyone in that list. Resource-based policies look like "principal <code>P</code> can edit resource <code>R</code> if <code>P </code>is in <code>R.canEdit</code>". Every resource of the same type has the same attributes. This approach is close to ABAC because it makes use of attributes on the resources to manage access, reducing the combinatorial explosion.</p>  <p>Hybrid—We can combine group and resource-based access management by creating groups of users and storing group names in resource attribute instead of principals. For example, if Alice adds Betty and Charlie to her group <code>friends</code>, then she could add <code>friends</code> to the <code>sharedWith</code> attribute on her album. The advantage of the hybrid approach is we reduce the length of the attribute lists.</p>  <p>The advantage of the policy-based approach is that it’s the <a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">simplest thing that could possibly work</a>. Given a policy store with sufficient management features (i.e., finding, filtering, creating, modifying, and deleting policies) this is straight-forward. The chief downside is the explosion in the number of policies and the scaling that it requires of the policy store. Also since the user’s permissions are scattered among many different policies, knowing who can do what is difficult and relies on the policy store's filtering capabilities.</p><p>The group-based approach results in a large number of groups for very specific purposes. This is a common problem with RBAC systems. But given an attribute store (like an IdM profile) that scales well, it splits the work between the attribute and policy stores by reducing the number of policies to one per share type (or combination). That is, we need a policy for each resource that allows viewing, one to allow editing, and so on. </p><p>The resource-base approach reduces the explosion of groups by attaching attributes to the resource, imposing structure. In the photo album sharing example, each album (and photo) would need an attribute for each sharing type (view, modify, delete). If Alice says Betty can view and modify an album, Betty’s identifier would be added to the view and modify attributes for that album. We need a policy for each unique resource type and action.</p><p>The downside of the resource-based approach is that the access management system has to be able to use resource attributes in the authorization context. Integrating the access management system with an IdP provides attributes about principals so that we can automatically make those attributes available in the authorization context. You could integrate using the attributes in an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a> token or by syncing the authorization service with the IdP using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2017/01/what-is-scim/">SCIM</a>.</p><p>But the ways that attributes can be attached to a resource are varied. For example, they might be stored in the application's database. They might be part of an inventory control system. And so on. So the access management system must allow developers to inject those attributes into the authorization context when the policy enforcement point is queried or have a sufficiently flexible policy information point to easily integrate it with different databases and APIs. Commercial ABAC systems will have solved this problem because it is core to how they function.</p><p>Every application, of course, will make architectural decisions about access management based its specific needs. But if you understand the patterns that are available to you, then you can think through the ramifications of your design ahead of time. Sometimes this is lost in the myth that policy-based access management (PBAC) is all the same. All of the approaches I list above are PBAC, but they're not all ABAC.</p>    Notes   <p>The material that follows is not in the book. But it should be. An errata, perhaps.</p>     <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>

  <p>The challenge, to come up with language that describes the value that is enabled through the technical standards that comprise what is known as IDTech (also known as Self-Sovereign Identity or the Decentralized Identity stack).&nbsp; This is independent of the different variations within the technology stack, and more importantly is meant for the vast majority of the business? population that have never heard of different standards bodies, protocols or tech stacks, and who quite frankly don’t care and will never exert the effort to learn about them.&nbsp; In many cases these are the exact people who make the final investment go/no-go decision.</p><p>After hundreds of conversations and countless hours of research and reading over the past five years, four ‘qualities of value’ have emerged.&nbsp; These are provenance, persistence, flexibility, and portability.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these values are important in your business or operations, then this technology sector will be important for you.</p><p>Provenance, the ability to trace where something, whether data or physical object, has come from, and to have confidence the data has not been tampered with.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than just that, it is being able to trace back to the source with the highest level of confidence.&nbsp; This means to be able to automatically (no human intervention) determine what entity issued or attested to the data or physical object and to validate that this party is authorized to make these claims.&nbsp; </p><p>Persistence, the ability to act on data and information whether the original source of the data continues to exist or not.&nbsp; A reality of life is constant change.&nbsp; For anyone interacting with technology, the rate of change seems only to go up.&nbsp; With change, older systems become unavailable, but information links may need to persist far beyond the life of the source system.&nbsp; Having a mechanism that provides high levels of assurance on the information integrity under the control of the interested entity define / rephrase? can mean a decoupling of systems, reducing complexity and increasing resilience.</p><p>Flexibility, the ability to use the data about an object in ways that extend beyond the original intended use of the data.&nbsp; The most common example of a document that is used widely outside its intended use is the driver’s license, which is also used as a piece of identity documentation for purchasing age restricted products, writing a check (in the US), checking into a hotel and many other uses that have nothing to do with driving a vehicle.&nbsp; This is a broad but simplistic use case. When an individual or organization has the ability to select data from various parties and combine these into a single new claim, presenting this composite claim to any entity while retaining the highest levels of provenance outlined above, this creates new business models and revenue opportunities are found.</p><p>Portability, the ability to bring the data “with me”, and to do so in a manner that does not leave a link or connection to the issuer of the data.&nbsp; This is the ability to move this information between systems and vendors.&nbsp; As an individual or business, data portability is of value as a means to prevent capture or lock-in to a specific vendor.&nbsp; Additionally, being able to use the data in a manner that does not leave a ‘bread crumb trail’ every time it is used (or shared) is critical for personal privacy as well as business confidentiality, and has become a requirement under the law with the GDPR and CCPA regulations. </p><p>In this first post, I have intentionally kept the concepts at a high level.&nbsp; In the following posts, I will delve further into each of these Values, expanding on them and bringing in examples of where they would apply.&nbsp; I will endeavor to keep technical language and jargon out of the posts where at all possible.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

I used the new query pattern to build a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights">dashboard</a> to report, for each server in the home timeline:</p>
 
 The list of blocking servers.
  The count of blocked servers for each blocking server.
  The list of blocking servers for each blocked server, and the count of those blocking servers.
  
<p>
This was a good start, but I had a hunch that <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> would reveal non-obvious connections among these servers. And indeed they do! Here’s a view of the new graph-enriched dashboard.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The left pane shows the blocked servers shunned by a blocking server selected from those in the home timeline. The right pane has the inverse view: the blocking servers that shun a selected blocked server. These were the two categories I defined for the first iteration of these graphs.</p>
 category "blocking_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
}

category "blocked_server" {
  color = "darkred"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
Here’s the code for one of the graphs.</p>
 graph {
   node {
    base = node.blocking_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_server
  }
   node {
    base = node.blocked_and_blocking_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocked_server
  }
   edge {
    args = [ self.input.blocking_server.value ]
    base = edge.match_blocking_server
  }
}
 
<p>
Here is the definition of node.blocking_server, which refers to category.blocking_server.</p>
 node "blocking_server" {
  category = category.blocking_server
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    with servers as (
      select distinct
        blocking_server,
        blocked_server
      from
        blocking_servers(${local.limit})
    )
    select
      blocking_server as id,
      blocking_server as title
    from
      servers
    order by
      blocking_server
  EOQ
}
 
<p>
The FROM clause calls blocking_servers(), a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/08/21/postgres-functional-style/">set-returning function</a> defined like so.</p>
 create or replace function public.blocking_servers(max int) returns table (
  blocking_server text,
  blocked_server text
) as $$
with servers as (
  select distinct
    server as domain,
    'https://' || server as server_url
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit max
),
blocking_and_blocked as (
  select
    s.domain as blocking_domain,
    d.domain as blocked_domain
  from
    servers s
  join
    mastodon_domain_block d
  on
    s.server_url = d.server
)
select
  blocking_domain,
  blocked_domain
from
  blocking_and_blocked
order by
  blocking_domain, blocked_domain
$$ language sql
 
<p>I thought these ingredients would suffice. But when I began poking around in the graphs made with these definitions, infosec.exchange behaved strangely. Someties it would appear as a blocking server, other times as a blocked server. I was missing a category!</p>
 category "blocked_and_blocking_server" {
  color = "orange"
  icon = "server"
}
 
<p>
As you can see in the graph, infosec.exchange not only blocks 73 servers, it is also blocked by two servers: religion.masto.host and weatherishappening.net. Why?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://weatherishappening.net/about">weatherishappening.net</a> calls infosec.exchange a “HOSTING DEATH SPIRAL FASCIST ORGANIZATION” and blocks it with “Limited” severity.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://religion.masto.host/about">religion.masto.host</a> blocks infosec.exchange at the “Suspended” level, but does not explain why (“Reason not available”).</p>
<p>
Although those servers could, in turn, be blocked by others, no such blocks appear in the block lists of my immediate server neighborhood.</p>
 &gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'weatherishappening.net'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+

&gt; select count(*) from blocking_servers(100) where blocked_server = 'religion.masto.host'
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
| 0     |
+-------+
 
<p>
There is another switch hitter in my neighborhood, though. <a href="https://c.im">c.im</a> is blocked by <a>me.dm</a> and <a href="https://octodon.social">octodon.social</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-and-blocking2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Why?</p>
<p>
me.dm (Medium) has “Suspended” c.im for “Hate speech”.</p>
<p>
octodon.social has “Suspended” c.im for “Reason not available”.</p>
<p>
When the opinions and policies of your server differ from those of mine, we see different realities through our respective lenses. Could such fragmentation drive the fediverse-curious back into arms of Big Social? I’m sure that will happen — indeed is happening — to some degree.</p>
<p>
But I hope that some of us, at least, will learn to thrive in diverse networks of online communities, aware of the kaleidoscopic interplay of filters but not overwhelmed by it. That skill  will serve us well IRL too. To acquire it, we’ll need to visualize the operation of our filters. One great way to do that: SQL queries that drive relationship graphs.</p>

For more context around IDtech and its importance, catch up on the previous posts listed in order of publication below.</p>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=3553171a3a88">IDtech is the New Fintech</a> (on&nbsp;Forbes)  <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be&nbsp;Adopted</a>  <a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/3-idtech-misconceptions-51270b72ea23">3 IDtech Misconceptions</a>  <p>In the last five years, I have seen too many failures of IDtech companies with promising ideas. Either they struggled to launch their product, or failed to drive adoption of their product once in market. However, a handful of others show early signs of promising success.</p><p>So I thought I’d document the differences I’ve seen between the fizzles and the sizzles. Spoiler alert: the single biggest predictor of success is simply product execution. It’s the simple stuff like knowing the problem you’re solving, building a good product to solve it, and capturing value with a sustainable business model. Building an IDtech product is hard — the tactics below are ones that I’ve seen used to improve the odds of success for a myriad of IDtech products.</p><blockquote>If you’re interested in diving into more tactical insights from successes and failures from IDtech builders themselves, check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote> Common Product Form&nbsp;Factors <p>Most successful IDtech companies you’ll find have similarities in terms of the products they’re developing. These similarities tend to bridge technical approaches (e.g. built using web2 vs web3), industries, and use&nbsp;cases.</p>  End-user app (product for Holder)<br>Usually, IDtech products are built for people — and those people need a way to manage their identity and consent to data being shared. But some IDtech products target organizations or IoT devices, too (collectively, the “end-user”). This is often called a “Wallet App” or an “ID Wallet”. Decisions about these products, such as whether a mobile app or web app will be developed, depend heavily on the use&nbsp;case.  Identity wallet apps can vary greatly in user experience depending on its intended end user and purpose. Above are three examples of identity wallets from three IDtech companies: ZADA, Dentity, and Yoma (from left to right). Although shown on mobile devices, wallets can bridge mobile, web, browser, and&nbsp;more.  Ecosystem tools (product(s) for Issuers/Verifiers)<br>Creating an ecosystem around the end-user is vital to the success of any IDtech company. After all, an ID wallet is only useful if there is somewhere to use it. Some IDtech companies offer a free end-user product and charge the rest of the ecosystem for the tools to interact with those users, making these ecosystem tools the primary revenue model. We’ve seen various kinds of ecosystem tools successfully generate revenue, such as dashboards, workflow builders, verification landing pages (e.g. for things like OIDC or offline verification), curation &amp; governance services, APIs for integrating solutions into existing systems, and&nbsp;more.  Industry- or use case-specific integrations<br>Many successful IDtech companies begin by targeting a specific industry or use case. The more targeted the vertical, the easier it is to integrate with existing systems and get initial users. For example, an IDtech product for Realtors in the USA can build native integrations with state licensing databases, continuing education (CE) programs, and MLS systems alongside the Realtor’s credentials, offering a much more tailored experience than a generic wallet app ever&nbsp;could.  Provider is the term we at Trinsic use to describe the provider of an IDtech solution/product, which they then offer to an ecosystem of organizations and&nbsp;people. Success Patterns in&nbsp;IDtech <p>While I don’t claim to have a surefire recipe for IDtech product success, I’ve identified several patterns exhibited by successful companies that I hope will prove useful to&nbsp;others.</p> Concise, straightforward messaging <p>Once, I sat down with a venture capitalist to talk about Trinsic (then called Streetcred ID). Midway through the pitch he said, “This sounds like something that could leverage blockchain. Have you looked into that?” to which I responded “Yes, our solution uses a blockchain called Sovrin for anchoring identifiers of issuers.” He looked stunned. “Did you just pitch me a blockchain company without using the word blockchain in the first few minutes?” he asked. Of course, the answer was yes, and Kickstart ended up <a href="https://trinsic.id/streetcred-id-rebrands-to-trinsic-raises-pre-seed-funding/">investing</a>.</p><p>Even more so than investors, customers care about how you can solve their problem, not about the technology you’re using. And when conveying this value, it’s important to do it clearly (without buzzwords or jargon) and concisely. This messaging will look differently for each IDtech product, but here’s a framework I’ve found&nbsp;helpful:</p><p>“_____ enables ______ to use ______ to _________”</p><p>Let’s apply this to a super-successful IDtech company called <a href="https://classpass.com/">Classpass</a>. What do they do for consumers? “Classpassenables people to use a single subscription to access exercise classes all over their city”. What do they do for businesses? “Classpass enables gyms to use a simple integration into their existing booking system to earn additional revenue from the classes they’re already doing.” IDtech companies built using decentralized identity don’t need to be more complicated; take <a href="https://zada.io/">ZADA</a> for example, who has tens of thousands of active users in Southeast Asia. “ZADA enables people to use their health credentials to travel seamlessly in a post-covid world.”</p><p>Teams that nail the messaging of their IDtech solution tend to see better results and get faster adoption. If you have another framework to explain an IDtech product concisely, let me&nbsp;know!</p> Decentralized Identity Leads to Great IDtech&nbsp;Products <p>Despite IDtech products existing for some time, new-age IDtech products inspired by the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) are springing up faster than ever to fill gaps that are challenging to fill using the technologies of previous&nbsp;decades.</p><p>While I don’t believe SSI is necessary for IDtech, I do think IDtech products built using SSI/web5 technology have a competitive edge. As I explain in a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497#5275">previous post</a>, IDtechs built using interoperable technologies give users more choice and usability of their identity earlier (because of the growth of other IDtechs), creating a virtuous cycle with a higher likelihood of customer satisfaction. Not to mention you get a lot out of the box using an infrastructure platform like&nbsp;Trinsic.</p><p>That said, empirically we are seeing proprietary IDtech companies growing much faster than ones based on standardized, interoperable solutions. I think that’s because many of the people building with interoperable solutions are spending far too much time in working group meetings debating governance frameworks or building their own decentralized fairy-tale solution from the ground-up. If SSI stands a chance, the community needs to focus on customers and&nbsp;product.</p> Focus on Your Core Competency <p>This advice isn’t new, but it’s easy to forget. A brief reading of any startup or innovation best practice will tell you to <a href="https://fictivekin.github.io/pmarchive-jekyll//guide_to_startups_part4">focus obsessively on product/market fit</a>, or only do that which makes your “<a href="https://podup.substack.com/p/jeff-bezoss-beer-tasting-analogy">beer taste better</a>”. It’s common sense that 99% of businesses should use AWS instead of buying their own servers, for example. IDtech companies are no different.</p><p>Because most IDtech companies face a <a href="https://a16z.com/book/the-cold-start-problem/">cold start problem</a> as they’re rolling out their solution, it’s critical that as many resources as possible focus on solving that problem. As teams learn about their market, they inevitably need to iterate on their product. If these iterations require refactoring of infrastructure in addition to application changes, the speed of iteration can slow to a snail’s&nbsp;pace.</p><p>Trinsic offers infrastructure for building IDtech products using digital wallets and verifiable credentials. A variety of companies offer infrastructure for identity proofing using government IDs &amp; a selfie. Other companies offer infrastructure for user directories, access management, and login. Savvy teams make wise decisions about the infrastructure they leverage to build their IDtech products upon so they can move fast in solving the most important problems to their business instead of reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p> Business Model Shouldn’t Be on the Back&nbsp;Burner <p>For most product teams, it goes without saying that great product execution is a key to success. In some industries, the business model is relatively straightforward (e.g., in SaaS productivity software, most companies charge ~$10/user/month). But because IDtech is still emerging as a category, oftentimes the business model is just as make-or-break as the&nbsp;product.</p><p>We’ve identified several viable business models for IDtech companies — stay tuned for more on that. For now, remember that business model innovation is as important as technology innovation in the world of&nbsp;IDtech.</p> Give Your Product a&nbsp;Name <p>Many IDtech products are given a distinct name to make it more concrete in the eyes of end-users. For example, TravelPass is the name of a product developed by IATA to verify vaccine status of passengers — that’s 10x better than saying “get your digital travel wallet app so you can download your vaccine data” and 100x better than saying “download a self-sovereign agent so you can custody your own verifiable credential containing a cryptographically-signed vaccine attestation.”</p><p>Products like MemberPass, MySudo, MedCreds, FarmerID, and many more use their name to solidify their market positioning to end-users and get adoption&nbsp;faster.</p> Conclusion <p>Building an IDtech product is hard. Acquiring users and driving adoption is harder. Despite this, my optimism for the future of IDtech has never been stronger. IDtech infrastructure companies like <a href="http://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> are making it easier than ever to build an IDtech company. IDtech companies are getting better at marketing their products. And more IDtech products are getting adopted, leaving behind a blueprint of what it takes to be successful in such a complicated space as identity.</p><blockquote>For more tactical insights from IDtech builders, remember to check out the Future of Identity&nbsp;<a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">podcast</a>!</blockquote><p>We’re all still learning about what makes great IDtech products.

<p>I recently got access to the <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">BlueSky</a> beta, and decided to poke around to see what it's all about. I will save the details of what it is and how I feel about it for a different post. However, one of the first things you do when you sign up is choose a username that exists under the <code>bsky.app</code> domain. I have zero interest in another name rush where everyone tries to claim the shortest username possible, so I went with <code>aaronpk.bsky.app</code> rather than trying to get <code>a</code> or <code>apk</code>.</p>

<p>But, as I was poking around the app and replying to a few people, it just didn't feel like "me" yet. I don't care about renting a name in someone else's space. Yesterday, Jay Graber posted on the BlueSky blog all about supporting <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains as identities in BlueSky</a>. Naturally I was curious to try this out myself, but there were no technical details available in the blog post.</p>

 
Update: The BlueSky app now supports <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">changing your username to your domain name within the app itself</a>! You no longer need to use the below process! You can use my notes below if you're curious about playing with the API directly in order to build other kinds of integrations.
 

<p>When I opened my BlueSky timeline, I saw a few people mentioning that they had figured out how to do it even before the app supported it natively. I did some digging around, and <a href="https://jik.wtf/">jik</a> pointed me to the right places in the AT Proto docs, and I was able to change my handle to <code>aaronpk.com</code>!</p>

<p>Below are the instructions for how to do this yourself. Please note that these instructions will be made obsolete in a week or two since the BlueSky developers are planning on shipping first class support for custom domains in the app and you won't need to do this workaround for long.</p>

 Overview 

<p>The rough process for this is:</p>

 
 Create a DNS TXT record on your domain with the value of your underlying BlueSky ID 
 Get a token for your account (e.g. "log in" to your account from an HTTP client) 
 Update your profile with your new domain 
 

<p>Note: To make these POST requests, you'll need an HTTP client that can POST in JSON format. You can use cURL, httpie, Postman, or write code in whatever language you want. I'll use <a href="https://httpie.io/">httpie</a> for the examples.</p>

 Get a token for your account 

<p>First, you need to "log in" to your account. This process will return an access token you can use to update your profile. Logging in will also tell you your DID, the unique identifier for your underlying account. (The "handle" on your account is more like a display name, and that's how your account can end up being portable across domains as well as BlueSky servers later.)</p>

<p>Call the <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-server#comatprotoservercreatesession">com.atproto.server.createSession</a> method with your email and password you used to sign up. (Type this all on one line, I've just split it into multiple lines for readability. Also, again, if you're using cURL or another HTTP client, make sure you send this payload as JSON, not form-encoded.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession
            identifier=user@example.com password=hunter2
</code> 

<p>The response will be a JSON document with your access token as well as DID:</p>

 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 609
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Tue, 07 Mar 2023 15:29:38 GMT
ETag: W/"261-15oNf47+gL0kDnvlsvzpUK0ocx8"
X-Powered-By: Express

{
    "accessJwt": "eyJh...",
    "did": "did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg",
    "handle": "aaronpk.bsky.app",
    "email": "aaron@parecki.com",
    "refreshJwt": "eyJh..."
}
</code> 

 Create a DNS Record 

<p>Go to your domain registrar and create a new TXT record on your domain.</p>

 
 Subdomain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Value: <code>did=did:plc:XXXXXXXXX</code> 
 TTL: Default 
 

<p>In my case, the domain I wanted to use is <code>aaronpk.com</code>, so I would create a new subdomain <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com</code>, with the value <code>did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg</code>.</p>

 <code>_atproto.aaronpk.com TXT did=did:plc:s2koow7r6t7tozgd4slc3dsg
</code> 

 Update your Profile 

<p>Wait a little while to make sure the DNS entry takes effect. Then you can update your profile with your new domain by running the <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-identity#comatprotoidentityupdatehandle">com.atproto.identity.updateHandle</a> method.</p>

<p>Use the value of the <code>accessJwt</code> you got from the first request. (Again, type this out all on one line.)</p>

 <code>http post https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.updateHandle 
      Authorization:"Bearer eyJ..." 
      handle=aaronpk.com 
</code> 

<p>You won't see a response, but that means it worked! Next time you open the app, you'll probably see a bunch of errors. So log out of the app, and log back in! Right now, you'll need to use your email address to log in instead of your handle, but they are going to fix that in a future update.</p>

<p>Now you should see your new domain as your handle in the BlueSky app!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once again, this will all be obsolete once they ship this feature in the app itself! Here's a sneak peek from Paul of what the interface will look like!</p>

<p></p>

 More Fun 

<p>Once you've got this far, you can start to use the API for some other fun things!</p>

<p>Verifiable Credentials for Enhanced Supply Chain Traceability, Security, &amp; Resilience</p><p>Transmute uses verifiable credentials (VCs) + decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to create cost effective supply chain data security at scale. Using VCs + DIDs together harnesses the benefits of centralization while eliminating the downsides.</p> The Drawbacks of Blockchain <p>Blockchains are an incredible innovation, but they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution.</p><p>In their current state, blockchains are a heavy and over-engineered tool for the job at hand when it comes to bridging data silos in global&nbsp;trade.</p> Blockchains have a high cost for creation and maintenance.   Blockchains are expensive in public and private form, often gobbling up the margins of commodities they are being used to&nbsp;secure.   Blockchains are difficult to&nbsp;scale.   Blockchains don’t scale well enough for reliable enterprise use, including large supply chain companies or large regulatory and customs agencies. Blockchains may require layer 2 solutions to meet these&nbsp;needs.   Blockchains lack interoperability.   Blockchains aren’t interoperable with existing infrastructure or each other. To achieve interoperability, blockchains require additional adapters or layer 2 investments. Additionally, the cryptography many of them rely on is still considered very emergent and may not meet certain regulatory requirements. For instance, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-186.pdf">updated NIST requirements</a> only recently allowed for an element used in Bitcoin and Ethereum to be used in blockchain applications.   The Benefits of VCs +&nbsp;DIDs <p>Applied correctly, VCs + DIDs are affordable, interoperable, and already standardized. The interoperability perks of VCs + DIDs give you the ability to work across existing systems, including distributed ledgers (DLTs) and blockchains. Using VCs + DIDs is a futureproof method to fortify supply chain data, using the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p>  Using VCs + the appropriate DIDs provide the security benefits of decentralization and the efficiency benefits of centralization. Decentralization benefits include immutable claims and tamper evidence, while centralization benefits include scalability.  Implemented by experts like Transmute, VCs + DIDs awaken superpowers — such as data portability, data minimization, and selective disclosure — without locking you into a single vendor or blockchain.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@karylfowler">Karyl Fowler</a>, Transmute co-Founder and CEO, is an expert in emerging tech and economic development in fields with high regulatory burdens such as FDA, HIPAA and ITAR.

<p>
In <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">Mastodon relationship graphs</a> I showed how to use Steampipe to <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">map Mastodon network neighborhoods</a>. When I use the word map here, I’m channeling Denis Wood’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/26399801">The Power of Maps</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Every map shows this … but not that, and every map shows what it shows this way … but not the other way. Not only is this inescapable but it is precisely because of this interested selectivity — this choice of word or sign or aspect of the world to make a point — that the map is enabled to work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The aspect chosen by those neighborhood maps is the boost — the Mastodon version of a retweet. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png">One of the maps</a> focuses on a selected instance that appears in the home timeline. It shows people who belong to that instance and who boost toots from people on the same or different instances. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png">The other map</a> zooms out to show boost relationships among all the instances that appear in the home timeline. This view wouldn’t be legible if it included people, so it omits them in order to focus on server-to-server relationships.</p>
<p>
These maps represent (or as Denis Wood emphasizes, “re-present”) a set of toots. They omit original toots to which nobody replies, and they also omit replies, in order to focus on boost relationships. What about replies? That would be a different map, one that might also be interesting to draw.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, though, I’ve come up with another map to display the tags that appear in the results of a Mastodon tag search, along with the accounts that use those tags. It proved its worth today when I was looking for perspectives on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. As you’ve likely noticed, the US Supreme Court is reconsidering Section 230. My understanding of the topic wasn’t current, I wanted to refresh it, and I especially wanted to test whether Mastodon could provide a useful alternative to a conventional web search. </p>
<p>
One affordance that Mastodon provides: search for toots that use the #Section230 tag. Here are two ways to map the results of that search.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/section230.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
On the left is a conventional Mastodon view: a list of toots that match the query. In this case the article I ultimately wanted to read appears way down in that list. The <a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@themarkup@mastodon.themarkup.org/109925750471340463">toot</a> that announced it was from <a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a>, “a nonprofit newsroom that investigates how powerful institutions are using technology to change our society.” The article, <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/02/25/section-230-is-a-load-bearing-wall-is-it-coming-down">Section 230 Is a Load-Bearing Wall — Is It Coming Down?</a>, transcribes part of a conversation with two legal scholars whom I know to be reliable guides to Net-related issues.</p>
<p>
On the right is my Steampipe-based Mastodon tag explorer. Working with the same data, it surfaced The Markup’s article in a way that brought it immediately to my attention. The first thing that caught my eye was the conjunction of two tags: #section230 and #scotus. Since the Supreme Court’s interest in Section 230 is what’s driving the current news cycle, I wanted to hear from legal scholars qualified to discuss the Court’s interest in Section 230. So the tag conjunction was a significant landmark.</p>
<p>
The map displayed two nodes that connect to both #section230 and #scotus. How did I choose between them? My prior familiarity with The Markup led me to click on that node and visit the Markup’s <a href="https://mastodon.themarkup.org/public/local">Mastodon instance</a> where I read the article. </p>
<p>
Had I been following The Markup then, as I am now, I would likely have seen the article on the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/02/14/news-in-the-fediverse/">news list</a> to which I’ve assigned The Markup’s account. But that wouldn’t have changed the experience of searching for the #section230 tag. The relationship graph works by reformulating the results of that search. It omits the text of toots that contain the tag, and the images in those toots, in order to highlight two aspects of the result list: people (or accounts) and tags. It contextualizes those tags by charting their relative frequency in the result list. And it attaches, to each tag node, a link to a new graph focused on that tag. </p>
<p>
This “interested selectivity” enables the map to do its work: find accounts that use given tags. Like a tag node, an account nodes provides a link — in this case, to the account’s Mastodon home page. It also reports the accounts’ description using a property that appears when hovering the node. So if I were unfamiliar with The Markup I could reveal its description without leaving the graph. Here’s the query that adds that property to the node.</p>
 select
  note
from 
  mastodon_search_account
where 
  query = 'https://mastodon.themarkup.org/@themarkup'

+---------------------+
| note                |
+---------------------+
|  Watching Big Tech. |
+---------------------+
 
<p>
That query is embedded in another query that joins across two Steampipe plugins: one that <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">wraps the Mastodon API</a> and another that <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/rss">queries RSS feeds</a>. That’s because, as noted in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/06/mastodon-steampipe-and-rss/">Mastodon, Steampipe, and RSS</a>, the RSS feeds that Mastodon provides for tags enrich the results available from the core API.</p>
<p>
Enabling SQL to query diverse APIs in a common way is one of Steampipe’s core superpowers. Enabling such queries to form the nodes and edges of relationship graphs is another. Used together, these two superpowers enable maps that select what is helpful, omit what isn’t, and thus “re-present” information for a given purpose.</p>

<p>【ブリュッセル23日】OpenWallet Foundation の発足が日本時間23日深夜に発表されました。</p>



<p>OpenWallet Foundationはデジタル版の証明書や鍵、チケット、カードと言ったものを収めるデジタル財布である「ウォレット」の共通部品を作るためのLinux Foundation配下のオープンソース団体です。個別の機能を開発するプロジェクトの上に団体としての理事会、政府諮問会議、技術諮問会議が組織されます。</p>



<p>初期の理事メンバーはアクセンチュア、フューチャーウェイ、Gen（旧ノートン＋Avast）、VISAで<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/02/5200/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5200" title="日本円で約3100万円拠出しています">1</a>、一般メンバー<a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2023/02/5200/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5200" title="会社の規模に応じて最大1000万円程度の会費を払っています">2</a>にはAmexなどが並んでいます。</p>



<p>OpenWallet はWallet自体ではありません。BlinkなどがWebブラウザ自体ではなくWebブラウザのエンジンであるように、ウォレットのエンジンを提供します。これによって、各社が自社のウォレットを作ることができるようになるのです。</p>



<a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.sakimura.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OWF-Launch-2023.02.23.pptx-1.jpg?ssl=1"></a>OpenWallet はWalletのエンジン<br>(source) OpenWallet Foundation



<p>また、OpenWallet Foundation は規格の開発などは行いません。行うのは、ウォレットを作るために必要になる機能群を収めたライブラリ＝ウォレットエンジンです。これを使って各社はウォレットを作ることができます。同じエンジンを使っていれば、一つのウォレットから他のウォレットに移るのもより簡単になると期待されます。</p>



<p>発表に付随するイベントで、OpenID Foundation理事長のNat Sakimura は、以下のように述べました。</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ユーザー中心主義とプライバシーはデジタルIDに関する技術標準化団体であるOpenID Foundationの中核的な原則で す。15年前のブラウザがそうであったようにウォレットは今この原則を達成するための最前線にいるのです。しかしウォレットが介在しているだけではそれを達成することはできません。ウォレットのコードに対する信頼が必要です。そのためにはオープンソースの実装が提供する透明性が不可欠でありOpenWallet Foundationとの協働を期待しています。</p>

The first post, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=3553171a3a88">IDtech is the New Fintech</a> is available to read on Forbes, and the second post, <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will be Adopted</a>, can be found here on my&nbsp;Medium.</p><p>If you’ve been following the SSI space over the last few months, it’s likely you’ve seen the term “IDtech” used to describe the product or “application layer” of the cutting-edge identity standards like verifiable credentials. I have <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">spoken at length</a> about this term, whether that is on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a>, via <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, or through my <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">podcast</a>, because I believe it can do for identity products what ‘FinTech’, ‘EdTech’, or ‘Medtech’ do for those categories of products.</p><p>The more I’ve seen IDtech used, the more I see three misconceptions cropping up into conversations.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a rebrand of SSI or decentralized identity.</p><p>❌ IDtech is overly&nbsp;broad.</p><p>❌ IDtech is a new category.</p><p>But before I address these misconceptions, I think it is worth clarifying what IDtech&nbsp;is.</p> How Can You Tell an IDtech Product When You See&nbsp;One? <p>Let’s start with a definition from a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">previous&nbsp;post</a>:</p><blockquote>IDtech is the name for the category of products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they&nbsp;need.</blockquote><p>The most important thing to understand about IDtech is that it’s a word to describe a kind of product (as opposed to a philosophy, concept, or technology). Therefore, the first way to tell whether you’re talking about IDtech is to determine whether you’re talking about a tangible product that solves a problem for customers, or potential customers. Booked revenue is an indication that something has moved beyond “use case” and beyond “business case” into a full-fledged product.</p><blockquote>If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and&nbsp;data.</blockquote><p>It may be just as helpful to call out the things that don’t help you identify&nbsp;IDtech.</p>  The form factor doesn’t matter. Many IDtech products are mobile apps, while others are web-based, and others live in a browser extension or smart&nbsp;watch.  The tech stack (e.g. use of web3 or blockchain) doesn’t matter either. Because IDtech describes a kind of product, not a technical approach, developers can draw from technologies in web2, web3, or web5 or (any number of future webs) to build their solutions.  The industry vertical is also irrelevant. While I’ve seen IDtech companies in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government, I’ve seen adoption succeed in other areas as&nbsp;well.  <p>Hopefully the stage is set and we all agree on what IDtech is. Now we can dive in to three common misconceptions.</p> Misconception #1: IDtech Is a Rebrand of Self-sovereign Identity or Decentralized Identity <p>I understand why this misconception exists. Given that my background and company is in the SSI and decentralized identity space, it is easy to see why people associate the term IDtech to those things when I use it. However, I consider anything that meets the two criteria of 1) empowering users with identity and 2) it is productized to fall under the broad IDtech umbrella. Products in this umbrella include things from <a href="http://dentity.com/">Dentity</a> to <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a> to <a href="http://axuall.com/">Axuall</a> to <a href="http://classpass.com/">Classpass</a> to <a href="http://getportabl.com/">Portabl</a>. Decentralization is not a binary; and these products all sit on a bit of a different spot on the spectrum of self-sovereignty — some are fully custodial while others are totally centralized.</p><p>At the risk of sounding like a broken record (I recently wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">whole post</a> about this), self-sovereign identity is a concept or an ideal. Decentralized identity generally refers to a set of technologies. But IDtech refers to a class of product — or said another way, the set of solutions to a particular problem.</p><p>All that being said, my personal belief is that in the long run, the winning IDtech products will be built using decentralized identity and will get users closer to self-sovereignty.</p> Misconception #2: IDtech Is Overly&nbsp;Broad <p>Another misconception is that IDtech is too broad of a term. Usually this stems from a belief that IDtech encompasses everything from <a href="http://okta.com/">Okta</a> to <a href="http://equifax.com/">Equifax</a> to <a href="http://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> to <a href="http://entidad.io/">Entidad</a>. In reality, the only one of these I classify as an IDtech product is Entidad. Okta is an authentication infrastructure. Onfido is a verification widget. Equifax is a data aggregator. In fact, I’m aware of an IDtech product that uses Okta, Onfido, and Equifax together to achieve a particular user experience in their&nbsp;product.</p> Misconception #3: IDtech Is a New&nbsp;Category <p>Again, IDtech describes products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These kinds of products have been around for decades. So despite the word only recently beginning to be used, products that fit this description are not&nbsp;new.</p><p>Dozens of IDtech products like those offered by <a href="http://clearme.com/">Clear</a>, <a href="https://www.merits.com/">Merit</a>, and <a href="https://airsidemobile.com/">Airside</a> were started over the last few decades, streamlining millions of consumers’ lives. Like the FinTech companies started in the early 2000s before open banking or fintech infrastructure, early IDtech companies had to blaze a trail of proprietary technology themselves. Fortunately, today decentralized identity represents a new way to build IDtech products — and infrastructure platforms such as Trinsic make it easier than ever. What used to take a whole team, millions of dollars, and years to build can now be done in a matter of weeks. So it’s easy to see why a surge of new-age IDtech companies are rising to the occasion.</p> IDtech Is About to Have Its&nbsp;Moment <p>Although IDtech is not a rebrand of “SSI” or “decentralized identity”, these technologies do check a lot of the boxes good IDtech products hope to achieve. And IDtech infrastructure companies (like Trinsic) that utilize SSI technologies are making it easier than ever to build IDtech products that serve specific industries or use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An explosion of IDtech products is currently underway showing that IDtech is indeed the new Fintech. This revolution in identity products will transform how identity works today and make the world more accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>These ideas continue to develop. If you have feedback for me, or if you’re building an IDtech product, I’d love to hear from you — my DMs are open on <a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileyparkerhughes/">LinkedIn</a>. You should also check out <a href="http://trinsic.id">Trinsic</a>, the best infrastructure for building IDtech products. If this post was insightful, please share it with others that will learn from it, and follow me so you don’t miss subsequent posts where I’ll dive deeper into the concepts and practices behind successful IDtech products.</p>

  I've had a busy month. Something had to drop and it was regular updates here. Hopefully I’m back to a more regular schedule now. Technological change is messy and hard to predict. Still we can look at the direction in which digital identity is evolving to get an idea what's coming—even if we can't predict the timing.

<p>I've had a busy month. Something had to drop and it was regular updates here. Hopefully I’m back to a more regular schedule now. </p><p>Technological change is messy and hard to predict. Still we can look at the direction in which digital identity is evolving to get an idea what's coming—even if we can't predict the timing. </p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Riley Hughes and I recently had a conversation about the question "why doesn't SSI exist already?" Sometimes the question is asked because people think it's such a natural idea that it's surprising that it's not the norm. Other times, the question is really a statement "if this were really a good idea, it would exist already!" Regardless of which way it's asked, the answer is interesting since it's more about the way technology develops and is adopted than the technology itself.</p><p>Riley calls identity products "extremely objectionable" meaning that there are plenty of reasons for people to object to them including vendor lock-in, privacy concerns, security concerns, and consumer sentiment. I think he's right. You're not asking people and companies to try a new app (that they can easily discard if it doesn't provide value). You're asking them to change the fundamental means that they use to form, manage, and use online relationships.</p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">   </a> <p>The last chapter of my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0BS2H4HT1/technometria-20">Learning Digital Identity</a>, makes a case that there is an existing identity <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/02/life_is_a_metasystem.shtml">metasystem</a> that I label the Social Login (SL) metasystem. The SL metasystem is supported by OpenID Connect and the various "login in with..." identity providers. The SL metasystem is widely used and has provided significant value to the online world.</p><p>There is also an emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) metasystem based on DIDs and verifiable credentials. I evaluate each in terms of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/01/the_laws_of_identity.shtml">Kim Cameron’s Laws of Identity</a>. In this evaluation, the SL metasystem comes out pretty good. I believe this accounts for much of its success. But it fails in some key areas like not supporting directed (meaning not public) identifiers. As a result of these failings, SLM has not been universally adoptable. Banks, for example, aren’t going to use Google Signin for a number of reasons.</p><p>The SSI Metasystem, on the other hand, meets all of Cameron’s Laws. Consequently, I think it will eventually be widely adopted and gradually replace the SL metasystem. The key word being eventually. The pace of technological change leads us to expect that change will happen very quickly. Some things (like the latest hot social media app) seem to happen overnight. But infrastructural change, especially when it requires throwing out old mental models about how things should work is much slower. The fact is, we’ve been building toward the ideas in SSI (not necessarily the specific tech) for several decades. Work at IIW on user-centric identity led to the SL metasystem. But the predominant mental model of that metasystem didn't change much from the one-off centralized accounts people used before. You still get an account administrated bythe relying party, they've just outsourced the authentication to someone else. (Which means another party is intermediating the relationship). Overcoming that mental model, especially with entrenched interests, is a long slog.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s (pre-web) people were only online through the grace of their institution (university or company). So, I was <code>windley@cs.ucdavis.edu</code> and there was no reason to be anything else. When the web hit, I needed to be represented (have an account) in dozens or hundreds of places with whom I no longer had a long term relationship (like employee or student). So, we moved the idea of an account from workstation operating systems to the online service. And became Sybill.</p><p>When Kim first introduced the Laws of Identity, I literally didn’t understand what he as saying. I understood the words but not the ideas. Certainly not the ramifications. I don’t think many did. He’s the first person I know who understood the problems and set out a coherent set of principles to solve them. We <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2008/12/azigos_remindme_service.shtml">used Infocards in our product at Kynetx</a> and they worked pretty well. But because of how they were rolled out, people came to associate them strictly with Microsoft. The SL metasystem won out, offering the benefits of federation, without requiring that people, developers, or companies change their mental model.</p><p>Changing metasystems isn't a matter of technology. It's a social phenomenon. Consequently it's slow and messy. Here's my answer to the question "why doesn't this exist yet?" The arc of development for digital identity systems has been bending toward user-controlled, decentralized digital identity for decades. That doesn't mean that SSI, as currently envisioned, is inevitable. Just that something like it, that better complies with Kim's laws than the current metasystem, is coming. Maybe a year from now. Maybe a decade. No one can say. But it's coming. Plan and work accordingly.</p><p></p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>Blockchain is one of the fastest-growing technologies in the world. Most companies are trying to implement the scope of blockchain for the growth of their business. Therefore, they are looking for skilled blockchain developers who would help them to execute new technologies and to update their existing systems so that they can ensure growth in the market.</p>



<p>As blockchain is revolutionizing the world, there is a huge demand for blockchain developers. Without them, it is not possible to utilize the <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/Top-10-benefits-of-blockchain-technology-for-business">benefits of blockchain technology</a>. The developers are responsible for all the research on the blockchain and the execution of the benefits of blockchain. Developers will be responsible for building the system’s architecture, creating smart contracts, as well as optimizing the protocols. As they need to handle a lot of responsibilities, they need to have certain skills.</p>


 
 


 
 Cryptography 
 



<p>To offer a safe blockchain environment, cryptography is very important. Therefore blockchain developers must have a good understanding of cryptographic practices and concepts including crypto keys, wallets, and digital signatures. Cryptography is a crucial element in ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the Bitcoin network and other cryptocurrencies. Such highly secure crypto is easily accessible with trading bots like bitcode prime. According to <a href="https://www.etf-nachrichten.de/autotrading/bitcode-prime/">bitcode prime test 2023</a>, it is designed to help users trade a wide range of cryptocurrencies on various markets in the cryptocurrency industry. Developers must have the knowledge to make use of public-key cryptography to avoid unauthorized access. They should also understand the dissimilarities between the different cryptographic hash functions such as Keccak-256 and SHA-256.</p>



 
 Blockchain architecture 
 



<p>Blockchain developers must have a good idea about the way blockchain works and its architecture. They should also know concepts like a consensus, smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and others that are very important in the functioning of blockchain technology. They should also know the four basic types of blockchain architecture – private, public, consortium, and hybrid.</p>



 
 Data Structures 
 



<p>The presence of data structures is an unavoidable part of the whole blockchain network. Every block is a data structure type that gathers all the transactions specifically for the public ledger. Blockchain developers must study data structures thoroughly and should understand the way blockchain network makes use of data structure. Developers must also understand the different types of data structures like heaps, graphs, Merkle trees, Patricia trees, and hash trees.</p>



 
 Smart Contracts 
 



<p>Smart contracts allow two parties to transfer services and goods without any intermediaries. Smart contracts are a predominant factor while implementing blockchains. Therefore, developers must be familiar with these smart contracts and how they can be used for business. They should also know the programming languages that are widely used in the execution of smart contracts like Chaincode, Solidity, or Vyper.</p>


 
 


 
 Web development 
 



<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-development/">Web development</a> is very important as blockchain gives high importance to decentralized applications. Therefore developers must have good skills in web development like designing and developing web applications, technologies that back them up, and the steps that can be taken for the optimization and security of these applications.</p>



 
 Programming languages 
 



<p>Various programming languages are used by the blockchain technologies and will be different according to the platforms used to execute the blockchain environment. Developers need not be experts in all the languages, but they should have some basic knowledge of some of the popular languages like Python, C++, or JavaScript. It is also good if the developers have some idea of object-oriented programming.</p>

  Probably not but at there end there are 10 ways to prevent assumptions becoming culture <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Post the 2008 global financial crisis, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said in an opening address at the ECB Central Banking Conference Frankfurt, 18 November 2010, “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2010/html/sp101118.en.html">As a policymaker during the crisis, I found the available models of limited help. In fact, I would go further: In the face of the crisis, we felt abandoned by conventional tools</a>.”</p><br><p></p><br> The Gap <p>Many in executive and leadership positions have faced for a while a feeling that our models, simulations and computations are ill-suited to addressing big, messy, complicated real-world problems. There is a gap between the reality we read and measure today and the model that predicted today a short period ago. &nbsp; Since we have yet to create new models and continue to utilise the same ideals, we know there is a gap between prediction and reality, and that gap is leading to poor decisions, which make us see a bigger gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions based on models today have short and long-term consequences. Poor decisions because of broken models lead to us missing an agreed performance metric and impact our children as they live with choices removed and unintended outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is accepted by some commentators that <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/utility-maximisation/">utility maximisation</a> (the economic concept) is a poor way to navigate uncertainty.&nbsp; The reason is that uncertainty means you cannot be sure you are optimising for the best thing in the short and long term. The map and directions our economic models provide cannot deliver a compass for wicked problems such as climate change and pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>A reason our models fail may be that they start with the wrong outcome preference, framing and assumption, which over time are transformed to no longer be preferences, framings and assumptions but beliefs and culture, and we cannot change them before they break — path dependency.&nbsp; An assumption our utility maximisation economic model took a while back was to value the time of humans unequally (discrimination), and now technology laboured to convert the earth's unvalued natural resources. With this model, humanity ignores the consequences of previous generations' assumptions because they are now cultural, which we experience as differing views on the environment, society and climate.</p> Does system thinking break at earth scale? <p>Many of our complex models start with a decomposition ideal to break apart complexity into small discrete components that we find we can model and explore. However, even our understanding of atoms, once the most fundamental building block, actually contains secrets that we still can't fathom; such is the joy of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; As we break things apart, we break connections we did not know existed, and so we cannot recombine the components and make what we started with.</p><p>Components don't combine to make the hole. I can put all your chemistry in a bucket, but it will not make you.&nbsp;</p><p>If our model depends on the complete understanding of the smallest part and that the understanding is perfect and precise, then when doubt arises or the proof comes that this smallest part is not what we assumed, why do we think that the model will retain its ability to provide precise prediction?&nbsp; When we study our smallest component parts in isolation, what linkages were there to other parts that we did not observe?</p><p>Our systems thinking and models depend on a form of separation, boundary, and interface that help us detail how these small components interact.&nbsp; We have a duality of issue insomuch that if our understanding of the smaller part is not right and we also make an error in the dependencies about how this small part interacts, effects, affects and connects to other small parts, we end up with non-linear errors in our models.&nbsp; Exponential (non-linear) errors, just like exponential growth, get big very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a branch of thinking that retains the idea that we will get a large-scale model right because we should be able to model each small basic component part and the dependency between all parts, but we face a dichotomy that we don't know that if the whole can be represented by the parts, because of variables in time delays and the emergence of new recursive loops in the system, which is why our system thinking breaks at earth's scale. At scale, the earth is not a static model but a dynamic living, moving, changing and adapting system of systems.&nbsp; The earth is adopting (not learning), and today's system creates a dynamic change that means tomorrow's system has different dependencies. &nbsp; Our decisions impact and direct that change.</p><p>In the small backwater of behaviours, economics and social psychology, there is a discipline called anthropology, the study of human behaviours, which searches for differences and how these tiny one-off behaviours and ideas may be the future and may scale. Hidden in plain sight among all the noise and hubris is the new dynamic changes, which means that our understanding of the small parts and the dependency must adapt continually, or we must recognise that small errors at scale will give false conclusions. It is not that the emerging feedback loop existed when it started; it was created because of the dynamic nature of complex systems. &nbsp; We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>We lack right now the tools to create such new dynamic loops. This means that all our models are wrong; we just don't know by how much.</p><p>Just because all models are wrong, that does not mean they are not useful, but it does mean we need all models and cannot align to only one when we are dealing with issues at the earth scale.&nbsp; This implies that 1.5 degrees are both right and wrong, as is 3.5 degrees.&nbsp; Indeed the idea that any temperature is right or wrong is naive. Further, any one metric that we use as a tool for complex decision-making is going to be wrong.&nbsp;</p> Decisions based on metrics. <p>The consequence of the maximisation theory that drives our model has ignored or unvalued some cost. It also maximises for a single outcome, which is never possible.&nbsp; This means that the opposite side of that coin is true, that there will always be an overstatement of revenue and margin that can lead to false intentions.</p><p>We are drawn to decisions not based on costs but on the increment between revenue and costs (margin); we shortcut the complexity of the model to a single figure, ROI. Just like temperature in climate models. ROI decisions based on only costs do not exist and, therefore, as a viewpoint, it is discounted - reinforcing culture/ framing and mindset. ROI will always fail as a decision tool as there will always be undervalued costs and hurdles that mean we stretch the assumptions, but we love the idea of boling complexity down to a simple linear narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Can models navigate uncertainty, probably not, but they are the best tool we have.&nbsp; Assuming they are a true compass is a dangerous game, especially if we have a culture that means we cannot challenge the model itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose here is the reality, system thinking will fail at the earth scale because assumptions become culture, and we don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.&nbsp; If the model cannot be challenged, we will have to wait until it breaks.</p><p>We don’t have any examples that culture changes before it breaks.<br><br></p> Leadership can stop assumptions from becoming culture <p>Assumptions can become part of a culture when they are repeated and reinforced over time, often without questioning or examining their accuracy or relevance.&nbsp; Assumptions become a part of culture when they are widely held and perpetuated through social norms and values.</p><p>To prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched in the company culture, it's important that leadership take steps to challenge and question them, as well as to actively promote more inclusive and open-minded ways of thinking.</p><p>So we we asked ChatGPT for some specific recommendations on how to prevent assumptions becoming culture; we will leave it up to you to judge.</p><p>ChatGPT please give some specific steps that can help prevent assumptions from becoming a culture?</p>  <p>Encourage critical thinking: Promote a culture of critical thinking and encourage people to challenge assumptions and beliefs that are taken for granted. This can help to break down the barriers that prevent people from questioning assumptions and can lead to more open-minded and inclusive thinking.</p>  <p>Encourage and promote diversity: Encourage diversity in all forms, whether it's through hiring practices, community events, or other initiatives. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote understanding across different cultures and perspectives by exposing people to a wider range of perspectives and experiences.</p>  <p>Foster open communication: Create a culture of open communication where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming entrenched by allowing people to openly question and discuss them.</p>  <p>Educate everyone: Provide education and training on topics such as cultural competency, unconscious bias, and diversity and inclusion. This can help people to become more aware of their own assumptions and biases, and can promote more inclusive thinking. Share your findings and insights with others. Explain why certain assumptions are inaccurate and how they can be harmful. Encourage others to question their assumptions as well.</p>  <p>Lead by example: It's important to lead by example. Model the behavior that you want to see in others by questioning your own assumptions and being open to new perspectives. By doing so, you can help to create a culture where assumptions are not accepted without question, and where people are encouraged to think critically and with an open mind.</p>  <p>Emphasize transparency: Encourage open and honest language, and be transparent about the assumptions that underlie decisions and actions. This can help to build trust and promote accountability.</p>  <p>Continuously assess and evaluate: Regularly review assumptions and cultural norms to determine whether they are still relevant and accurate. This can help to prevent assumptions from becoming outdated or misaligned with current needs and realities.</p>  <p>Be aware of your assumptions: Start by examining your own assumptions and biases. Ask yourself where they come from and whether they are based on evidence or stereotypes. Awareness is the first step in changing behavior.</p>  <p>Challenge assumptions: When you encounter assumptions that don't feel right, question them. Look for evidence that supports or contradicts them. If an assumption is not based on evidence, it should be discarded.</p>  Hold people accountable: Finally, hold people accountable for their assumptions. Call out harmful assumptions when you see them, and encourage others to do the same. Make it clear that assumptions are not acceptable in your culture.

<p>Like many, I have been watching the destruction of Twitter by its new owner with
utter fascination. If it was problematic in many ways before, Musk-Twitter is far worse,
and there are no signs it will ever return to the state that many of us, myself included,
mostly enjoyed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are alternatives, led by Mastodon and a rapidly-growing list of
Fediverse apps that all interoperate thanks to a number of open protocols such as
WebFinger, ActivityPub and Activity Vocabulary. Millions of people have created accounts
there in recent months, and over a million new users have become regulars.</p>
<p>But there are growing pains and many open questions, such as:</p>
 
 The underlying protocol standards are currently essentially unmaintained, and
real-implementations don’t exactly match how the standards were intended. How will this
situation be resolved? 
 How do we create and maintain a safe space for traditionally disenfranchised people? 
 The Fediverse currently depends on much unpaid volunteer work. How long can that
go well? What if another million users (or more!) join, and the novelty effect
wears off? 
 Should brands be allowed in? 
 Is #Fediblock the best we can do for moderation? 
 How do we keep the character of the place if (when!) large organizations come in
that bring lots of new users, and, in comparison, large budgets? 
 Who decides? 
 
<p>Conversations need to be had, in a form that encourages problem solving. That’s
the kind of space we are trying to create with FediForum: where people meet who
want to move the Fediverse forward: on technology, on funding, on operations,
on governance, and perhaps on culture.</p>
<p>Because if we don’t, there’s a real chance the once-in-a-generation opportunity to
build better social media passes, and I really, really don’t want that to happen.
I hope you don’t either.</p>
<p>So, if you love Mastodon or any other post-Twitter social media apps, and have an opinion
on the future of social media, <a href="https://fediforum.org/">join us</a> and help figure it out
together with others who think similarly. The first event will be on-line; we hope
to be able to do an in-person event later this year.</p>

   Today we learned that a 34 year old hockey player, a 6x all-star in the NHL’s list of 100 greatest players of all time, stopped playing hockey several weeks ago due to Long Covid. 

 The covid minimizer that now owns Twitter intentionally allows misinformation to spread. Mask up.

 <p>I have been exploring the research and concepts that bias and trauma are deeply linked.&nbsp; The linkage and directionality are much debated. &nbsp; Trauma creates bias, and equally, bias creates trauma. It would appear that either can be a starting point, but they definitely feed each other, creating complex positive (healing) and negative (detrimental) feedback loops which extend beyond the individual and their immediate relationships to wider society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p></p><p>Using systems-mapping to address Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and trauma: A qualitative study of stakeholder experiences&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273361</a></p><br><p>Why does this matter, as all data has a bias?&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamental to a decision-making role based on data is to demand that we recognise bias and try to remove bias; however, I am now thinking that if we remove the bias, we assume there is no trauma, and therefore, everyone will be rational.&nbsp; Yes, there are some big ugly assumptions in that statement, but the purpose here is about the flow of challenging thinking and not academic rigour to prove something we already know.&nbsp;</p><p>In removing the bias, we ignore that bias feeds trauma and that equally, trauma feeds bias; a decision made without this context has no coupling to the reality of the situation.&nbsp; The alternative is that we live with the bias in our data, known and unknown; however, we don't know if the analysis for this person in this situation reflects/ fuels/heals their bias/ trauma or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the framing of removing bias is not valid; equality, a framing that recognises bias, is not valid as it cannot represent the individual.</p><p>Houston, we have a problem. Do we have to reframe bias?</p><p>I am all up for understanding bias, but it has become more evident to me that in my thrust to be curious about bias, I have to accept that I am going to have to operate in a dynamic feedback loop, and it will uncover/ reveal trauma.&nbsp; Revelling trauma or bias crosses the creepy line.&nbsp; The creepy line is a very subjective idea and is different for everyone.&nbsp; When I published “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/">My Digital Footprint</a>” back in 2009, I wrote a lot about the creepy line where data collection can be the same, but how you present the data back to the user will either add value or unnerve them.&nbsp; But to know what a user will accept, you test the user's concepts of a creepy line continually to find out when what you are saying becomes unacceptable and back off — deep personalisation.&nbsp; The creepy line and the concepts of privacy are deeply interlinked.&nbsp; Privacy is linked to perceptions of risk, and risk acceptance or adversity equally links to trauma and bias.</p><p>Bias, trauma, risk and privacy matter at both levels, macro and micro, but that is a big rabbit hole where we get into identity, but I am interested here in decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What I am left questioning is whether understanding bias is the right thing to do. Conceptually should we spend more time understanding if this bias feeds something OR if this bias is fed by something OR both?&nbsp; Would both provide new insights to help us give the user better choices and make better decisions, or are we edging toward influence and control and, in doing so, remove agency?</p><br><p>&nbsp;CEO Take Away</p><p>Trauma and bias are critical to decision-making. In the board room and leadership executive setting, should we unpack bias and ignore trauma? &nbsp; Bias is easy to talk about, trauma remains “unsaid” - I am not even sure if we assume.&nbsp; The point is, can we use bias as a proxy? Knowing that many CEO’s and founders are driven by trauma, is understanding bias going to take us to a place that will be easier or more difficult to talk about how we make decisions?</p><p>Worth reading <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984322000212">CEO childhood trauma, social networks, and strategic risk-taking</a></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><p>Further reading&nbsp;</p>  <p>CEO early-life disaster experience and corporate social performance <br><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.3293</a></p>  <p>CEO Traits and Firm Outcomes: Do Early Childhood Experiences Matter?<br><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374389</a></p>  <p>The Indirect Effect of Trauma via Cognitive Biases and Self-Disturbances on Psychotic-Like Experiences<br><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.611069/full</a></p>  <p>Childhood trauma and cognitive biases associated with psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906349/</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Enhanced Attentional Bias Variability in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and its Relationship to More General Impairments in Cognitive Control <br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15226-7</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unconscious Cultural Bias Reduction and Trauma-Informed Care <a href="https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/">https://www.careinnovations.org/resources/unconscious-cultural-bias-reduction/</a></p>  <p>Attention Bias and Metacogniti on: Relationships with Childhood Trauma and Psychological Vulnerability<br><a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF">https://research.manchester.ac.uk/files/205623245/FULL_TEXT.PDF</a></p>  <p>Interpretation biases in victims and non-victims of interpersonal trauma and their relation to symptom development <br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618506001332</a></p>  <p>Recall Bias in Trauma Recollection <br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355928917_Recall_Bias_in_Trauma_Recollection</a></p>  <br><br><br><br>

On a recent episode of <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/1112270/11934167-baby-jessica-with-blair-braverman">You’re Wrong About</a>, Sarah Marshall delivered a crisp summary of how the 24-hour news cycle came to be. This led me to realize that many among us do not remember when news was confined to time slots: the 7 o’clock news, the 11 o’clock news, the morning paper. I think it might be healthy to bring that back in some form. From the excitement I heard in their voices I gather that Sarah Marshall and her co-presenter Blair Braverman feel the same way. When I hear people complain about Mastodon’s lack of breaking news, I think: “Feature, not bug!” Maybe what the 24-hour cycle has been breaking is us.</p>
<p>
So when <a href="https://press.coop/">press.coop</a> launched today I was a bit conflicted. On the one hand, I would like to use Mastodon to read mainstream news headlines just as I once used RSS to do. (Full disclosure: press.coop is run as a public service by <a href="https://hello.coop">hello.coop</a> whose founder, Dick Hardt, is a longtime friend.) On the other hand, when reading Mastodon timelines I’m enjoying NOT knowing what’s happening in the world right now.</p>
<p>
What if you could exclude news from the home timeline, put it on a list, and go there when — and only when — in a news mindset? That’s a feature of <a href="https://fedilab.app/">the Fedilab client</a>, I learned from <a href="https://twit.social/@ksoltys">Keith Soltys</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/press-coop.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
What would it take to implement the same idea in the Mastodon reader I’m developing? It couldn’t be just an extra WHERE condition, could it?</p>
<p>
Well, actually, it could.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/news-exclude-timeline.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
Problem solved. Now I can read news in Mastodon when and how I want, and never see it otherwise.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-news-list.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
If you want that same control, you shouldn’t have to use a particular Android client, or Steampipe client, or any other. There’s a Cambrian explosion of such creatures right now. The more they can share important DNA, the better for all of us.</p>
<p>
I hope that the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon, which enables the dashboards I’m building using Steampipe’s own <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards-as-code</a> system, can provide some useful common DNA. A rule like news only on lists, not timelines, once expressed in SQL, can be used (and thus not reinvented) by any kind of Steampipe (read: Postgres) client: psql (or any Postgres CLI), Metabase or Tableau or any Postgres-compatible BI tool, Python or JavaScript or any programming language. Steampipe is a versatile <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">component</a>. Its mapping from APIs to SQL can, in theory, provide the data layer for any application. </p>
<p>
My Steampipe + Mastodon adventure notwithstanding, let’s hold on to that larger idea. The fediverse is our chance to reboot the social web and gain control of our information diets. Since our diets all differ, it ought to be trivial for anyone — in any client — to turn on a rule like news only on lists, not timelines. I’ve shown one way it can be trivial. Please show me others!</p>

The model is very valid and helpful at a micro level, but the individuals should test the assumptions, the framing and the perspectives about the macro.&nbsp; Future framing definitely should embrace long-term philosophies of de-growth, sustainability and transparency, but because they are beyond the long-term planning and strategy horizons, they are discounted.&nbsp; Because so much of business is framed by “what problem does this solve”, “free market competition”, and “what is the action”, future thinking is limited to a narrow scope and does not embrace a different ontology or a different optimisation purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>Love this - but let's not pretend we all agree on what or why we are doing something.&nbsp;</p><br><p>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/strategic-intelligence-why-foresight-key-future-readiness/</p> <br>

A chatbot answering complex life questions sitting on a mountain — DALL·E&nbsp;2<p>From ChatGPT:</p><p>Digital identity is a complex issue that has not been fully solved due to several challenges and obstacles, some of which&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy concerns: Digital identity often requires the collection and storage of personal information, which raises privacy concerns and the risk of data breaches. There is a need for a solution that can provide secure and reliable identity verification while also protecting the privacy of individuals.  Interoperability: There are many different systems and protocols for digital identity management, which can make it difficult for these systems to work together seamlessly. This can lead to compatibility issues and difficulties in accessing and sharing information across different platforms and organizations.  Trust and Security: Establishing trust and security in digital identity systems is crucial, as fraudulent activities and identity theft can have serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. Ensuring that digital identity systems are secure and resistant to hacking and fraud requires ongoing investment in research and development.  Regulation: Digital identity is a global issue and different countries have different laws and regulations around data privacy and identity management. This can make it difficult to develop a standardized and universal solution for digital identity.    Technical Complexity: Digital identity involves multiple technologies, such as cryptography, biometrics, and machine learning, which can make it challenging to create a solution that is both secure and user-friendly.  <p>Despite these challenges, there has been progress made in recent years to solve these problems and create more secure and user-friendly digital identity solutions. However, this is an ongoing process that requires collaboration between technology companies, governments, and other stakeholders.</p>

  Installing Ubuntu on a 2010 era iMac hardware

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<p>I use a 2010 era 27” iMac as my primary home desktop computer. I have become increasingly frustrated by my inability to update the macOS to versions that support security and privacy features such as Apple’s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud. So I decided to install Ubuntu (Linux) in a dual-boot configuration on this hardware.</p>

<p></p>



<p>As I was researching whether this was even possible, I ran into sometimes conflicting, many times outdated, and often incomplete information, so wanted to document both my configuration and the resources that were helpful to me in the hope that others don’t have to go through much of the uncertainty that I felt when I decided to go down this road.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR - Installing Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellifish) in a dual boot configuration with macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 on a 27” iMac 11,3 (Mid 2010) hardware with an Intel Core i3 CPU was a painless experience and, as of right now, I have been happily running this configuration as my primary home desktop computer with zero problems for close to 3 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

 Apple hardware 

<p>I like the iMac hardware.</p>

<p>It is clean, does not take up much space, and has been running trouble-free for me since I bought it back in 2010. The following is my hardware configuration:</p>

 ❖ Model Name: iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010)
    ▻ Model Identifier:  iMac11,3
❖ Processor Name: Intel Core i3
    ▻ Processor Speed:  3.2 GHz
    ▻ Number of Processors:  1
    ▻ Total Number of Cores:  2
    ▻ L2 Cache (per Core):  256 KB
    ▻ L3 Cache:  4 MB
❖ Memory:  16 GB 1333 MHz DDR3
❖ Graphics:  ATI Radeon HD 5670 512 MB
❖ Storage:  1 TB SATA Disk
 

<p>It is also connected to the following external peripherals:</p>

 ❖ Dell 27" Monitor (U2719DC)
❖ USB connected Keychron V10 (Alice Layout) QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard
❖ USB connected Logitech G203 Prodigy Gaming Mouse
❖ Hard line network connection  
 

<p>I am calling out the mention of the keyboard, mouse and network connection as being hard-wired because in my research, the typical complaints regarding the installation of Linux on Apple hardware was related to WiFi network connections and Bluetooth keyboards and mice.</p>

<p>My recommendation to de-complexify your installation would be to ensure that you use hard-line connected devices during the installation phase and once everything is done, swap in your regular devices (My WiFi and Bluetooth are working just fine under Ubuntu; I just don’t use it.)</p>

 Why Ubuntu LTS? 

<p>My selection criteria for a Linux distribution was the following:</p>

 
   It should be stable and it should just work; nothing flashy or fancy 
   When a software or hardware vendor says that it “Supports Linux”, the chosen distribution should be at the top of that list 
   There should be an automated security and maintenance update process 
   Excellent documentation and community support 
   Application support for the majority of my day to day activities, ideally with Linux versions of the same applications 
 

<p>Ubuntu LTS met all of those requirements for me.</p>

<p>In particular the LTS version of Ubuntu which “… stands for long-term support — which means five years of free security and maintenance updates, guaranteed until April 2027” was a make or break selection criteria for me.</p>

 Installation steps 

<p>I spent a substantial amount of time looking thru installation guides on the inter-webs and the best one that I found, and which I used for my installation, was Dan Helyer’s <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-macbook-pro/" title="How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac">How to Install and Dual Boot Linux on Your Mac</a>. It is well written, with lots of screen shots, and step-by-step instructions that worked very well for me.</p>

<p>I am not going to replicate that here, but instead provide some notes regarding my experience:</p>

 
   This process will not work on Apple Silicon iMacs 
   I followed the dual-boot installation steps 
   The drive partitioning step was an overnight process for me (I allocated 500GB of my 1TB SATA drive to a combination of OS and swap partitions) 
   I did not use the USB installer, but instead simply <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/burn-a-dvd-on-macos#1-overview" title="How to burn a DVD on macOS">burned the Ubuntu ISO onto a DVD</a> and used that instead 
 

<p>Everything else simply just worked, which I think is a testament to the maturity and polish of the Ubuntu distribution.</p>

 Post-installation configuration 

<p>There were only three steps that were specific to my environment.</p>

 
   
    <p>I use a NAS within my home network to keep content across my various devices synchronized and as my private git server and backup infrastructure. It is then set up to perform regular, automated and encrypted off-site archival of that content. So I simply had to install that client agent on my new system and point it to my internal NAS for all my content to be come back to my new machine. That was an overnight process.</p>
   
   
    <p>By default, Ubuntu uses the bash shell and I prefer the zsh shell. That is a personal preference; I had also spent far too much time getting my terminal “just so” on my mac and did not feel like redoing all that with bash. So I installed zsh and copied the config files that I was using on the iMac over, and everything just came back the way I wanted it to look.</p>
   
   
    <p>My mechanical keyboard supports open source software that allows for a significant amount of customization. So I spent some time looking at the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-keyboard-shortcuts.html.en" title="Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts available under Ubuntu</a> to remap some of my keys, and create some macros to assign to the custom keys on the keyboard to make my day-to-day tasks a bit easier.</p>
   
 

 Future steps 

<p>I am rather happy with how this turned out, and the new life that my iMac hardware is enjoying.</p>

<p>The one thing I am currently researching is how best to add a fingerprint sensor for both authentication to the local machine as well as a pathway to support Passkeys/FIDO2/WebAuthn. Currently reading about and looking into the YubiKey Bio as a possible way to enable this support.</p>

<p>I hope that my experience and pointers prove useful to other folks who are being given not so subtle signals by the vendor that their hardware has reached end-of-life. The reality is that it has not, and you have very good options available to you to continue using the hardware which is working just fine!</p>

 <a href='https://self-issued.info/?p=2316'>Native JWT Representation for Verifiable Credentials</a>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials. This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable. Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD. The native JWT representation explicitly isn’t a mapping […]

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/"></a>For the first time, there is now a native JSON Web Token (JWT) representation for Verifiable Credentials.  This representation uses IANA-registered JWT claims whenever applicable.  Among other improvements and simplifications, this means that we finally have a Verifiable Credentials representation that doesn’t require the use of JSON-LD.</p>
<p>The native JWT representation explicitly isn’t a mapping from the VC Data Model.  This mapping in the VC 1.1 specification resulted in ambiguities about whether to duplicate VC Data Model claims in the VC-JWT representation (the “in addition to” option) or whether to delete them from the VC Data Model representation (the “instead of” option).  These ambiguities harmed interoperability.  Rather, the 2.0 VC-JWT representation is its own simpler native JWT data structure.</p>
<p>See the new native JWT VC representation in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-2">Version 2 section of the “Securing Verifiable Credentials using JSON Web Tokens” specification</a>.  You can also compare it there to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-jwt/#version-1.1">Version 1.1 representation</a>, which is a mapping from the VC Data Model with the “in addition to” and “instead of” choices.</p>
<p>This accomplishment is the product of the vision, passion, and perseverance of many advocates of simplifying Verifiable Credentials.  Foremost among them is <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Orie Steele</a> – my co-editor for the VC-JWT specification.  I’ll also observe that the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-jwt/pull/44">pull request creating this functionality</a> had an unprecedented fifteen approvers – an indication of the broad support for this direction for Verifiable Credentials.  I am proud to have played a role in making it happen.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cast your mind back to the first time you experienced joy and wonder on the Internet. Do you worry you’ll never be able to capture that sense again? If so, it’s worth wading gently into the world of Mastodon microblogging to see if it offers something fresh and delightful. It might remind you—as it does me, at least for now—of the days when you didn’t view online interactions with some level of dread.</p>
<p>Mastodon isn’t a service but a network of consensually affiliated, independently operated servers running the Mastodon software. It’s the best-known example of the so-called Fediverse…</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, a few paragraphs later, he provides the best metaphor I’ve yet seen for what Mastodon is and how it works:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can think of Mastodon as a flotilla of boats of vastly different sizes, whereas Twitter is like being on a cruise ship the size of a continent. Some Mastodon boats might be cruise liners with as many as 50,000 passengers; others are just dinghies with a single occupant! The admin of each instance—the captain of your particular boat—might make arbitrary decisions you disagree with as heartily as with any commercial operator’s tacks and turns. But you’re not stuck on your boat, with abandoning ship as the only alternative. Instead, you can hop from one boat to another without losing your place in the flotilla community. Parts of a flotilla can also splinter off and form their own disconnected groups, but no boat, however large, is in charge of the community.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since my day job is working as a visiting scholar in the <a href="https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/">Ostrom Workshop</a> at Indiana University, and <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a> has been imagined from its start as a potential commons for customers (or as many commons, flotilla style), I find myself wondering if each of Mastodon’s boats is a commons. Or if some of them could be, or already are. Or if Mastodon itself is one.</p>
<p>My first experience with Mastodon came early on, in a boat that I abandoned before it sank. But now that Mastodon is hot again, I’ve jumped with two crowds onto two boats: <a href="https://twit.social/">twit.social</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twit.social/@dsearls">here</a>) and <a>journa.host</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://journa.host/@dsearls">here</a>). TWiT.social’s occupants are the community of hosts, co-hosts, and participants in the <a href="https://twit.tv">TWiT network</a>. Journa.host’s occupants are a collection of journalists. The two communities are different, though not entirely: journalists abound in both of them.</p>
<p>The question for me here is if any of these boats qualify as a commons. Or if Mastodon itself is one.</p>
<p>To qualify as a commons, a canonical list to check off is provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom">Elinor Ostrom</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/governing-the-commons/A8BB63BC4A1433A50A3FB92EDBBB97D5">Governing the Commons</a>&nbsp;(Cambridge, 1990), she outlined eight “design principles” for stable local common pool resource (CPR) management. I’ll make notes following each in italics:</p>
 
 Clearly defining the group boundaries (and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties) and the contents of the common pool resource.&nbsp;Mastodon is designed to support that. 
 The appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions.&nbsp;If we’re talking about code, yes. Maybe more. Gotta think about that. 
 Collective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process. Depends on the instance, I suppose.&nbsp; 
 Effective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators.&nbsp;Not sure about that one.&nbsp; 
 A scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules.&nbsp;Up to the person or people running each boat. 
 Mechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access.&nbsp;I think these range from informal to formal, and draw from rules developed for mailing lists and other fora. But, not sure. 
 Self-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities.&nbsp;At the top level, it’s othe Mastodon dev community. At the boat (instance) level, it’s the captain(s) of each. 
 In the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs (common pool resources) at the base level.&nbsp;A thought: the common pool resource is the authors of posts (aka toots) and the posts themselves. 
 
<p>Ostrom and others have also gone deeper and wider than that, for example by examining socio-ecological systems (SESes), <a href="https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art18/">defined here</a> in 2004. I’ll leave digging into that up to scholars more schooled than I (or to a later post, after I finish schooling myself). Meanwhile, I think it’s important, given the sudden growth of Mastodon and other federated systems with flotilla-ish qualities, to examine how deep research and writing on commons apply.</p>
<p>This work does matter: Ostrom <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/">won a Nobel Prize</a> for it, and it may matter more now than ever.</p>
<p>And help is welcome.</p>
 
<p>About the photo up top: Lacking a royalty-free visual for a flotilla of boats, I settled on the collections of people you see through bubbles in the photo above, which I shot on the grounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles,_Yvelines">Versailles</a>. Kinda works, methinks.</p>

The Fediverse is wired together by protocols like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7033">WebFinger</a> which, as yet, I know very little about. That’s because the Steampipe plugin, which supports the dashboards I’ve been building and describing in this series, doesn’t require me to understand or use those protocols. </p>
<p>
It does, however, require me to understand and use the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/intro/">Mastodon API</a>. Mostly I use that API by way of the <a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-mastodon">Go SDK for Mastodon</a> (thanks, mattn!), sometimes I make REST calls directly. Either way, my read-only dashboards use a fairly small subset of the Mastodon API. The full API is quite broad and deep; it enables API clients to read from and write to Mastodon servers in all sorts of ways. Here are the chapters of the Mastodon API book: <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/apps/">apps</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/">accounts</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/admin/">admin</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/instance/">instance</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/search/">search</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/">statuses</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/timelines/">timelines</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/notifications/">notifications</a>, <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/oembed/">oembed</a>. These chapters define what’s common to all Mastodon clients, including web apps, phone apps, native OS apps, and Steampipe dashboards.</p>
<p>
So far I’ve ignored protocol-enabled interop in order to focus on API-enabled interop. I’m aware that the Fediverse includes much more than just Mastodon. I intend to explore BookWrym, Friendica, Funkwhale, Lemmy, takahe, PeerTube, Pixelfed, PeerTube, and others in due time. But right now the Mastodon ecosystem is plenty to try to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>
For example, there’s a new web client for Mastodon: <a href="https://elk.zone">elk.zone</a>. With the recent addition of support for lists, it has become my favorite way to interact in Mastodon space. So naturally I wanted to be able to click through from Steampipe dashboards to Elk, and use it as an alternative to the batteries-included Mastodon web app.</p>
<p>
It turned out to be easy to enable that integration. Not thanks to ActivityPub, and not even thanks to the API. It works thanks to a third level of interop at play: common patterns for account URLs and toot URLs. </p>
<p>
Here’s the account URL for Ward Cunningham who hangs his shingle at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox</a>. But as we saw in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>, if you visit that URL directly — and if it’s not your home server — you can’t follow Ward there, or add him to a list. You’ll need to copy that URL, paste it into your home server’s search box, run the search, and arrive at an instance-qualified URL where you can follow him or add him to a list: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>. If you’re home is fosstodon.org this would instead be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://fosstodon.org/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a>.</p>
<p>
Similarly here is one of Ward’s toots at mastodon.radio: <a href="https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379">https://mastodon.radio/@k9ox/109802968820955379</a>. If you want to reply or boost or favorite, you can’t do it there. The URL you need is again one that routes through your home server: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a>. Note that the ids for the same toot differ! That difference surprised me and some others, and is a topic for another episode. Here I’ll just note that these two patterns govern how we interact when crossing server boundaries in Mastodon space using the stock web client.</p>
<p>
When I started using Elk, another layer of pattern emerged. Here are those same URLs in Elk:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio</a></p>
<p>
<a href="https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562">https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@k9ox@mastodon.radio/109802969999396562</a></p>
<p>
As it turns out, I just needed to make two of the Steampipe plugin’s transform functions prepend elk.zone to the instance-qualified URLs, then make such prefixing a configuration option. Now when I visit Mastodon links from dashboards, to reply or boost or follow or enlist, I land in the Elk experience that I prefer.</p>
<p>
ActivityPub and WebFinger are formal standards. I would describe the Mastodon API as a de-facto standard. But this prefixing maneuver is just a convention. It’s not guaranteed to work with another web client, and not even guaranteed to work across all URLs presented by the stock Mastodon client. That’s OK by me. Conventions are incredibly useful. The Twitter hashtag is just a convention, after all, inspired in turn by an <a href="https://factoryjoe.com/2007/08/25/groups-for-twitter-or-a-proposal-for-twitter-tag-channels/">IRC convention</a>. </p>
<p>
We’re in one of those Internet moments of rapid innovation, when new conventions can unlock emergent behaviors. It hadn’t even occurred to me that the Steampipe dashboards could support Elk. A few hours after I thought they might, they did. I’ve seen this kind of thing before, perhaps most notably when the blogosophere adopted &lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="{feedUrl}"&gt; to enable browsers to auto-discover RSS feeds. That happened about 20 years ago, and quite suddenly when a handful of leading blogging tools adopted the convention in a matter of days. It was a lot of fun to live through that era. If you missed it, enjoy the sequel that’s unfolding now!</p>

<p>The digital wallet is the killer app for the completely open source hardware and software “digital mobile safe” program led by mudge (aka Peiter) Zatko, at Google’s Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) Group back in 2015. We need it today!</p>



<p>Digital wallets are core to enabling individual agency and control over sensitive data in online and offline interactions. In many ways, the European Union is leading this charge with the <a title="Orchestrating an ecosystem">massive identity ecosystem orchestration they are currently in the midst of.</a></p>

<p>At the same time, to ensure that wallets truly remain under individual control we must pay attention to <a title="Whose wallet is it anyway?">choices being made in its development such that the future does not become a collection of proprietary vertical cylinders of excellence (silos)</a>, and that <a title="Asymmetric wallet wars">individuals have true choice in how and when they select wallets</a> for their personal use.</p>

<p>However, there is a curious but important missing element in all of these digital wallet conversations; everyone talks about protocols to interact with a wallet and what should or should not be stored in a wallet, but there is little to no discussion about ensuring the openness, consistency and fidelity of the core security, privacy, cryptographic and storage aspects that a wallet actually needs!</p>

 Common need across digital wallets 

<p>Let us fast forward in time to understand what is needed:</p>

 
   
    <p>I am an EU Citizen with a EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet who is seeking to live and work in the US. I need to interact with the US Government to provide information about who I am, and at the end of that process receive some manner of immigration or work permit related credential. Since I already have an EUDI Wallet, I would like provide information to the USG from that wallet and in turn continue to use that wallet to store any immigration credential I get from the USG.</p>
   
   
    <p>I am a Canadian who is looking to live and work in the EU and when seeking employment there would like to use the digital wallet from my Province that stores my identity information as well as education credentials. My potential employer supports, per EU regulation, the ability to consume these credentials in a digital form.</p>
   
   
    <p>Following upon both of the above scenarios, I would like to open a bank account using my digital wallet to present the needed information for KYC.</p>
   
 

<p>There are so many more variations of this that span the public and private sector, as well as a variety and combinations of credentials.</p>

<p>The commonality across ALL of them is not the credentials, or the protocols, but the underlying foundation and “trustability” of the digital wallet itself by a counter-party. Everything else is pipes and payloads.</p>

<p>And that, to my mind, is what the Google ATAP Project Vault showed could be done in a completely open manner, such that you can actually have independently verifiable confidence in that wallet when it shows up at your digital front door.</p>

 Google ATAP Project Vault 

<p>I would highly recommend folks watching the video below, which includes both a great introduction by Regina Dugan (formerly the first female director of DARPA) as well as the overview and demo of the capability by mudge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question is, why build this [...]</p>
<p>It turns out, you already have security elements in your phones and your computers. SIM Cards; they protect the things that are important to the carriers. Trusted platform modules, or TPMs;  they protect the things that are important to the OEMs and the content providers. [...]</p>
<p>So, where is the security element that protects the things that are important to you, that you have complete control over? So we made one!</p>
<p>[...] So what do developers have to do to get the phones or laptops or IOT devices ready to use Project Vault? Nothing! The host system thinks this is a regular storage device.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mpbWQbkl8_g?t=2845">Link to Project Vault YouTube video</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As <a title="Parenting the future of technology">I wrote back in 2015:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Vault is a micro-SD form-factor card that, when plugged into a device, makes available to the device a suite of cryptographic tools to enable hashing, signing, bulk encryption, streaming encryption as well as a strong hardware random number generator.</p>

  <p>The algorithms in the vault are not exposed to the host system so you can plug it into an untrusted device while being confident that the host system will not be able to corrupt the vault’s crypto services.</p>

  <p>It also comes with 4GB of isolated, sealed storage which can be used for enabling capabilities such as an immutable logging system where evidence of malicious activity cannot be covered up by tampering with the logs.</p>

  <p>It is operating system agnostic, so will work with a variety of both mobile and desktop operating systems. To the OS it behaves like a proc file system without any kernel drivers, which means that developers don’t have to do anything special in order to utilize it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The one change I would hope for in any current day implementation “… is a Security Key form-factor with USB-C …” because <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20220413STO27211/usb-type-c-to-become-eu-s-common-charger-by-end-of-2024" title="USB-type C to become EU's common charger by end of 2024">USB-type C is mandated to become EU’s standard by the end of 2024</a>, and where the EU is leading with that, the world will follow.</p>

 Opportunity for personal, truly open digital wallets 

<p>There is a clear opportunity here to implement an open source hardware(!) and software foundation (the vault) to enable secure and interoperable wallets that can be used for a variety of purposes, that truly remains under the control of an individual.</p>

<p>However, for anyone going down this path, what will become critical to their success is what they choose not to do rather than what they actually do.</p>

<p>In order to provide a truly open foundation for a digital wallet that is under the personal control of an individual, it will require them to:</p>

 
   keep the focus on enhancing and making production ready the foundational vault capabilities to support hardened, accelerated cryptographic operations and secure storage that are needed for any type of digital wallet 
   build well documented APIs to interact with the core vault services that are open, royalty free and free to implement for anyone 
   think through how best to put into place an independent assessment/verification mechanism with a high degree of transparency and credibility that allows counter-parties to assess the “goodness” of an implementation 
 

<p>I anticipate that the hardest challenges here will not be technical, but instead will be to:</p>

 
   resist the pressure from handset and platform vendors who will seek to influence the work in a manner such that the capabilities being externalized into the vault continue to be gatekeeper’d by them 
   resist the use of platform or vendor specific hardware security elements instead of the open source externalized hardware security elements demonstrated by Project Vault 
   resist getting dragged into the political infighting around directly implementing the variety of credential types or credential issuance and presentation protocols directly in the vault; it should be the responsibility of those specific communities to define and standardize how their protocols can utilize the open platform and vendor neutral vault APIs. 
 

 Building on an open source foundation 

<p>I have no visibility into or awareness of what happened with Project Vault after mudge moved on from Google ATAP. What I do believe is that he, particularly given his prior stint at DARPA, looked around the corner for what was coming, drove the work that was needed to be ready for that future, and made sure it was as widely available as possible by making it entirely open source!</p>

<p>That is a gift that should not be wasted!</p>

 

 <a></a>newRecently: Commons are not tragic 

<p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-is-a-false-and-dangerous-myth" title="The miracle of the commons">Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, debunks the “Tragedy of the Commons”</a> which posits that “Humans, when left to their own devices, compete with one another for resources until the resources run out.”</p>

<p>Her research revealed that “Far from being profoundly destructive, we humans have deep capacities for sharing resources with generosity and foresight.”</p>

<p>The features of successful systems, Ostrom and her colleagues found, include:</p>

 
   
    <p>clear boundaries (the ‘community’ doing the managing must be well-defined);</p>
   
   
    <p>reliable monitoring of the shared resource;</p>
   
   
    <p>a reasonable balance of costs and benefits for participants;</p>
   
   
    <p>a predictable process for the fast and fair resolution of conflicts;</p>
   
   
    <p>an escalating series of punishments for cheaters;</p>
   
   
    <p>and good relationships between the community and other layers of authority, from household heads to international institutions.</p>
   
 

<p>This has implications for and provides hope to those who are building and investing in the “Internet Commons”.</p>

<p>
I began this journey convinced that Steampipe could help the Fediverse evolve, but not sure exactly how. My first thought was to use Steampipe’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">API-wrangling superpower</a> to study patterns of communication (and conflict) across the Fediverse. But as one of many Twitter escapees last November, I soon realized that the network I was joining reflected a culture that had been humming along nicely for six years and didn’t particularly want to be the object of sociological study.</p>
<p>
As I argued in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/11/28/autonomy-packet-size-friction-fanout-and-velocity/">Autonomy, packet size, friction, fanout, and velocity</a>, Mastodon bakes in certain kinds of friction for reasons. You’ve likely heard about a default unfriendliness to search, which is both a technical setting and a cultural choice that privileges the experience of current flow over the mining of past flow. Even more fundamentally, the ID of a toot not only differs from server to server but also obfuscates the toot’s date, another technical/cultural choice that means you can’t randomly access history by date. None of these frictions is insurmountable. They will be overcome for purposes good and bad. I hope and expect that communities will be able to choose their desired amounts and kinds of friction while still interoperating with others. But for my project it seemed that trying to survey the wider Fediverse wasn’t the right place to start.</p>
<p>
So instead I began to explore a different way to read my home timeline. The dashboards that I’ve built and described in this series have become, for me at least, an effective way to scan recent Mastodon flow, then click into the stock client to post, reply, or boost. After overcoming a few obstacles, things are starting to feel like the <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/17/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon/">Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a> that I envision.</p>
<p>
One of those obstacles was the awkward copy/paste/search of foreign toot URLs that was required in order to interact with them. That’s now overcome by <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">Instance-qualified Mastodon URLs</a>. Another obstacle was the difficulty of curating and effectively reading topical lists of people. The strategies described in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/21/working-with-mastodon-lists/">Working with Mastodon lists</a> have improved matters nicely. And <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a> turned out to be a more useful alternate view of the current flow than I had expected.</p>
<p>
I think I’ve proven that a set of Steampipe dashboards, layered on a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">plugin</a> that maps the Mastodon API to tables that the dashboards query, can improve the ability to absorb and react to Mastodon flow. An unproven corollary: Steampipe’s <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/dashboards-as-code">dashboards-as-code</a> system is only one of potentially <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/cloud/integrations/overview">many clients</a> of the Mastodon plugin. Any dashboarding system or web app or native app could tap into the same query capability to deliver still another way to experience the flow. But that’s a future episode.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, with a decent reading experience in place, this seemed like a good time to circle back to the question of surveying the wider Fediverse. To begin enabling that I added a couple of new tables to the plugin: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_peer.md">mastodon_peer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_domain_block.md">mastodon_domain_block</a>.</p>
<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_peer.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by
    server
)
select
  s.server,
  s.occurrences,
  count(p.peer) as peers
from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_peer p
on
  s.server = p.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  peers desc
 
<p>
In Engish: gather the most recent 100 toots in my home timeline, count the occurrences of each origin server, then ask each origin server how many other servers it talks to. Unsurprisingly my home server, mastodon.social, occurs most often. And because it’s the marquee Mastodon server it has the most peers. </p>

<p>
Here’s a query that uses mastodon_domain_block.</p>
 with data as (
  select
    'https://' || server as server
  from
    mastodon_toot
  where
    timeline = 'home'
  limit 100
),
servers as (
  select
    server,
    count(*) as occurrences
  from
    data
  group by

from
  servers s
join
  mastodon_domain_block d
on
  s.server = d.server
group by
  s.server,
  s.occurrences
order by
  "blocked domains" desc
 
<p>
This one says: Again gather the origin servers in my recent home timeline, but this time ask each one how many other servers it blocks. Here we see that octodon.social, which happened to show up in my timeline when I ran the query, blocks a lot more servers than mastodon.social does.</p>
 +--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| server                   | occurrences | blocked domains |
+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| https://octodon.social   | 1           | 510             |

+--------------------------+-------------+-----------------+
 
<p>
One could, and maybe at some point I will, comprehensively acquire and store this data. But meanwhile, how might it enhance the experience of reading recent Mastodon flow? Here’s what I’ve got so far.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/blocked-servers.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
We’ve already seen the first table which answers the question: “How many servers does each of the origin servers in my timeline block?” The second table answers a different question: “Which servers are most often blocked by the origin servers in my timeline?” </p>
<p>
The blocking server list column shows an interesting mix of consensus and variation, and I think that will be something to explore comprehensively across the Fediverse. But for now I like how this view contextualizes what’s in my home timeline. Like the relationship graphs, it’s highly dynamic because my immediate network neighborhood is changing all the time. Whatever the current set of servers happens to be, though, I now have some clues about how connected each of those servers is and how aggressively each one is blocking others. This feels like a good first step toward mapping the wider Fediverse.</p>

<p>2022 marked the end of a big chapter of my life. The culmination of my PhD journey, easily the most challenging project I have ever undertaken. Alongside graduating from my PhD as a Doctor of Philosophy, this year I formalised my relationship as a Consultant Requirements Engineer at Legendary Requirements, helped to produce RWOT the Hague and participated in a research sprint focused on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projects/digital-identity-times-crisis">Digital Identity in Times of Crisis</a> coordinated by the Berkman Klein Center where I wrote a soon to be published short hopepunk story titled Experiences in Memory Space. </p>
<p>This post is a brief reflection on and celebration of this last year and the PhD adventure that brought me to this moment. It will likely be the last post I submit to this site, as I experiment with new self-presentations of myself online. </p>
<p>First, I have to say what an honour, joy and privilege it was to participate as one of the first PhD students at the Blockpass Identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University. I didn’t fully comprehend what I was getting myself into back in <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/bil-launch">2018</a>, but it exceeded my expectations. </p>
<p>That I had the freedom and support to explore the boundaries and the depths of human knowledge is something I will be forever grateful for. To perceive the interconnections and evolution of human scientific thought stretching back into our past, back to the seeds of ideas and the subsequent foundations upon which our modern information society has been built. It has been both an awe-inspiring and humbling experience. I am grateful to all those who influenced, shaped and supported me along the way, especially my PhD supervisor and mentor Professor Bill Buchanan.</p>
<p>It is telling that the last post I made to this site was almost two years ago in March 2021. Since then, almost all of my writing energy was turned towards producing my thesis. In the process I wrote over 200,000 words on <a href="https://new.750words.com/">750words.com</a>, a lifesaving practice where I worked through my goals, fears, doubts and initial drafts. Then there were the countless words produced iterating through drafts, revisions and rewrites as I attempted to corral my thoughts and sythesise my learnings into a coherent, consistent body of text. The end result being an 80,000 word tome titled Identity and Identification in an Information Society: Augmenting Formal Systems of Identification with Technological Artefacts that I imagine few will ever read. Regardless, it is a piece of work I will always be proud of.</p>
<p>My thesis presents my unique perspective on the identification systems, shaped by my academic research across multiple disciplinary boundaries and my practical experience as an implementer and participant in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. I believe there are some nuggets within its pages. My personal highlights include:</p>
 
 The chapter titled Security without Identification which traces the history and evolution scientific thought on cryptography through the lens of cryptographic credentials first conceptualised by David Chaum’s seminal paper <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/pub/secsem/chaum1985bigbrother.pdf">Security without Identification</a>. 
 My determination to include a broader, sociological understanding of identification systems, despite advice that it should be left out of scope. See Chapters Identity, Trust and Privacy in an Information Society and Identification Systems. 
 The workshop I ran at the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14864.pdf">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a> that introduced verifiable credentials and explored issues and perceptions around their use for clinical passporting solutions. 
 The subtle influences of Ludwick Fleck’s work: <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo25676016.html">The Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact</a> that I attempted to weave throughout my thesis. 
 The diverse, high quality references throughout my thesis, that are testament to the depth and breadth of human knowledge produced on identity and identification throughout the last 100 years. 
 The content in my appendix, especially my wacky abstract diagrams and a paper I wrote but never published that talks about identity and interaction in terms of complex adaptive systems. 
 
<p>Of course there are some aspects I am less pleased with, but I imagine that is always the case. I completed it, passed my viva and graduated which is all that really matters at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I have ambitions to synthesise and adapt parts of my thesis into more digestible content which I will make available on my new professional self-presentation - <a href="https://drwip.com">https://drwip.com</a>. We will see how that goes. In the meantime, if you are interested to give it a read I am happy to send it across.</p>
<p>It is also important to point out that the thesis is not the journey, just like the map is not the territory. There were so many other explorations, side quests, learning opportunities and experiences that shaped my perspective throughout my PhD and are not well reflected in the thesis. Growing into a researcher and developing my academic voice, exploring the beauty of Edinburgh and Scotland, learning Rust, participating in the interdisciplinary <a href="https://francesryanphd.com/2019/12/tapestry-sandpit-register/">TAPESTRY research sandpit</a>, over two years collaborating with the <a href="https://www.openmined.org/">OpenMined </a>community, the <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">Odyssey hackathon</a> where I contributed to the initial POC for the <a href="https://commonsstack.org/">Commons Stack</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/rwot8">RWOT Barcelona</a>, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/mapping-workshop">MyData</a>, my <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/codi-virtual">attempt</a> at the Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas as part of the unfortunately virtual Edinburgh Fringe, my evolving thoughts about <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> and countless other experiences. With at least half of my studies against the backdrop of the pandemic, adding its own layer of challenges into the mix and changes to adapt to.</p>
<p>My PhD journey was daunting, exhilarating, stressful, inspiring, exhausting, humbling and joyful at different moments along the way. A rollercoaster of emotions, motivation, exhaustion and determination. I am glad it is over, but I will be forever grateful for the opportunities and experiences that it opened up for me. </p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The future is unknown and unknowable. However, despite this I have repeatedly seen the value of setting expectations of it. Imagining, outlining and articulating possible futures that I would like to see come to pass. In fact I am playing around with a whole new space - <a href="https://futurewip.com">https://futurewip.com</a> - to playfully explore and experiment with just this in the context of the climate emergency. Even if it is more of a placeholder at the moment. I enjoy learning a new voice and style with which to write in. Crafting new identities you might say. Which if I have learnt anything over my PhD, it is that the identities we hold, take or have applied to us shape our experienced present and inturn influence our future. I believe there a few things more powerful that intentionally constructing loosely held identities for yourself as a means to explore yourself and who you might want to be in the future. </p>
<p>Another thing I learnt during my thesis, is that I love the freedom to self-direct my attention and time whilst exploring things that I care deeply about. Which identity and identification in an information society is certainly one, as I have come to view it as critical to the future of humanity and the forms and structures it might take. Whatever I end up doing in the future, I want to make sure I have time to spend as I choose because I am confident in my ability to spend it well and know this helps me thrive. At the moment that looks like pursuing a research and development agenda focused on <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/ideas-memory">memory and meaning</a> as previously discussed on this blog. Indeed the questions I posed on my home page two years ago appear rather prescient and increasingly relevant in the context of LLMs such as ChatGPT. The speculative fiction story I produced as part of the BKC research sprint further explores these ideas through a different creative lens. I have some other interesting ideas and experiments around this concept that I hope to share over the coming months.</p>
<p>Professionally, I see my future intertwined with Legendary Requirements. Through Legendary I have been exposed to a diverse and interesting set of clients, projects and technologies with challenging problems that are fun to work through. It is clear that we add value to our clients, that I add value to Legendary and that Legendary values my contributions. My work is flexible, engaging and self-directed. The people I work with are intelligent, kind and thoughtful. I feel fortunate to have had such a smooth transition from my PhD into a job that respects my time, supports my growth and encourages my independence.</p>
<p> The decentralized identity space is still young and emerging. Legendary Requirements is well positioned to continue to work at the forefront of this space, helping clients discover, document and maintain human requirements for real world systems and use cases. </p>
<p>I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>

<p>That’s a question asked on Quora and deleted before I posted my answer. So I’m posting my answer here.</p>
<p>This is like asking if a car radio sounds better than a TV. Because it’s a matter of where, how, when, and what, more than a matter of sound.</p>
<p>There is some overlap in the sense that both SiriusXM and YouTube are fully useful on mobile apps. But you don’t watch your radio in your car or listen to your radio on your TV, even though it’s possible to do both through apps that are native to both the road (through Android Auto and Apple Carplay) and the living room (through Roku, Amazon, Apple, and other TV app platforms).</p>
<p>As for the sound itself, YouTiube lets you&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/9076559?hl=en#zippy=%2Caudio-quality-on-wi-fi">select</a> audio quality bitrates up to 256kbps AAC &amp; OPUS. SiriusXM’s default bitrate is also 256kpbs, but over the satellite link bitrates are typically lower—sometimes much lower. But, since SiriusXM does not (to my knowledge, so far) publish their bitrates in a place that’s easy to find, its bitrates are subject to debate. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/siriusxm/comments/jhb4kt/what_are_the_different_streaming_bitrates_in_the/">Here is one of those on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>But, again, it’s a matter of where. when, and what, more than how. If you want to see and hear a piece of music, YouTube provides enormous optionality, with its almost boundless collection of videos. If you want radio-like music programming, SiriusXM offers more—plus sports, talk, news, sports (including play-by-play for all the major ones), and more.</p>
<p>Yet the Internet has more than both put together. That’s why the image above is of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radioparadise">Radio Paradise</a>, which is one of the oldest and best Internet music stations. It’s live on the Net and the Web, and it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=radioparadise">Best Of</a> collections on YouTube as well.</p>
<p>Bonus link (and a lot of fun): <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2023/01/12/fm-down/">radio.garden</a>. There’s an app for that too.</p>

  I’m thrilled that the IETF has restarted the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Working Group. It’s chartered to work on JSON- and CBOR-based representations for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure enabling minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation.

<p>I’m thrilled that the IETF has restarted the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/">JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Working Group</a>.  It’s chartered to work on JSON- and CBOR-based representations for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), selective disclosure enabling minimal disclosure, and non-correlatable presentation.  The representations are planned to use the three-party model of Issuer, Holder, and Verifier utilized by Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>See the newly approved JOSE charter at <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-jose/03/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-jose/03/</a>.  The working group will be chaired by <a href="https://twitter.com/kodonog">Karen O’Donoghue</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ve7jtb">John Bradley</a>, and John Mattsson, with the assigned area director being Roman Danyliw.</p>
<p>I believe this is a great outcome because the JOSE working group participants already have expertise creating simple, widely-adopted JSON-based cryptographic formats, such as JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), and JSON Web Key (JWK).  The new formats will be peers to JWS, JWE, and COSE, reusing elements that make sense, while enabling use of new cryptographic algorithms whose inputs and outputs are not representable in the existing JOSE and COSE formats.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the work, please join the <a href="mailto:jose@ietf.org">JOSE mailing list</a> at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose">https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/jose</a> if you’re not already a member.  Also, plan to participate in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/">IETF 116 Yokohama</a>, where we should be able to have the first meeting of the reconstituted working group.  I hope to see you there!</p>
<p>As background, the first step in the JOSE rechartering was the <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2286">JSON Web Proofs (JWP) BoF at IETF 114 in Philadelphia</a> sponsored by Security Area Director Roman Danyliw and chaired by <a href="https://twitter.com/kodonog">Karen O’Donoghue</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ve7jtb">John Bradley</a>, during which Jeremie Miller, <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinayasuda">Kristina Yasuda</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tplooker">Tobias Looker</a>, and I presented.  That was follwed by a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2022-jwp-01/session/jwp">Virtual Interim JWP BoF in October, 2022</a>, review on the ietf-announce mailing list, and multiple IESG discussions.</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the (now recurring!) question:  “What Would JOSE Do?”  Join us and be part of answering it!</p>

  <p>Signs are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/08/gurman-ar-headset-spring/">pointing</a>
that Apple will announce its first headset in the next few months. This would be
a major new product for Apple – and the industry beyond –, but there is very little
excitement in the air.</p>
<p>We can blame Meta for that. After buying Oculus, iterating over the product for
almost 9 years since, and reportedly spending more than
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/why-reality-labs-will-keep-losing-billions-even-as-meta-makes-big-cuts.html">$10 billion a year</a>
on it, their VR products remains a distinct Meh. I bought a Quest 2 myself, and while it
definitely has some interesting features (I climbed Mt Everest, in VR!), it mostly
sits on the shelf, gathering dust.</p>
<p>So the industry consensus is that Apple’s won’t amount to much either. If Meta
couldn’t find compelling use cases, the thinking goes, Apple won’t either, because
there aren’t any! (Other than some limited forms of gaming and some niche enterprise ones.)</p>
<p>I think this line of thinking would be a mistake.</p>
<p>My argument: Apple understands their customers and works down their use cases better than
anybody. If Apple works on a new product category for many years – and signs are that
they have – and then finally decides that the product is ready, chances are, it is.
Their track record on new products is largely unblemished since the return of Jobs
about 25 years ago:</p>
 
 fruity fun design for a computer (iMac) – success 
 digital music player (iPod) – smashing success 
 smartphone (iPhone) – so successful it killed and reinvented an entire industry 
 table (iPad) – success 
 watch (iWatch) – success 
 … and many smaller products, like headsets, voice assistance, Keynote etc. 
 
<p>Looking for a major dud in those 25 years, I can’t really find one. (Sure, some smaller
things like the 25-year anniversary Mac – but that was always a gimmick, not a
serious product line.)</p>
<p>It appears that based on their history, betting against Apple’s headset is not a smart move.
Even if we can’t imagine why an Apple headset would be compelling before we see it: we
non-Apple people didn’t predict iPhone either, but once we saw it, it was “immediately”
obvious.</p>
<p>So let’s turn this around. What about we instead assume the headset will be a major success?
Then what?</p>
<p>I believe this would transform the entire technology industry profoundly. For
historical analogies, I would have to go back all the way to the early 80’s when
graphical user interfaces first became widely used – coincidentally (or not) an
Apple accomplishment: they represented a fundamentally different way of interacting
with computers than the text terminals that came before them. Xerox Parc
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface">gave that demo</a>
to many people. Nobody saw the potential and went with it, just Apple did. And they pulled
a product together that caused the entire industry to transform. Terminals are still in
use, but only by very few people for very specific tasks (like system administrators).</p>
<p>What if AR/VR interfaces swept the world as the GUI swept the PC?</p>
<p>I believe they can, if somebody relentlessly focuses on uses cases and really makes
them work. I built my first 3D prototype in VRML in 1997. It was compelling back then
and it would be today. Those uses can be found, I’m quite certain.</p>
<p>Based on everything we’ve seen, it’s clear that Meta won’t find them. Hanging out
with your friends who don’t look like your friends in some 3D universe is just not
it. But if anybody can do it, it’s Apple.</p>
<p>So I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they came up with, and I think you
should be, too.</p>

<p>Even if you have not such a need and you only have an interest in learning about KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) this post is also for you.</p>



 

 KERI KLI Series: Sign and Verify



 Sign and Verify 



<p>“Sign and Verify with Heartnet” is the first of the KERI Tutorial Series focused on accomplishing tasks the KERI command line. This tutorial uses <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">KERIpy</a>, the Python reference implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri">KERI protocol</a>.</p>



 Our Task 


 
 


<p>The task for today is simple: </p>



 
 Establish trust between Allie and Brett’s communication lines 



 Sign a love letter from Allie to Brett 



 Verify the love letter signature 



 Sign a love reply from Brett to Allie 



 Verify the love reply signature 
 



<p>The diagram below shows what you will end up with, a local KERI network with two keystores, one each for Allie and Brett, and a pool of six witnesses, the demonstration witness pool provided by the Python implementation of KERI. </p>


 
 


 Outline 



 
 Set up your machine for a KERI deployment.
 
 Docker Setup with GLEIF image – Easiest 



 Manual Setup form Source – Harder 
 
 



 Create configuration and keystore directories 



 Start Witness network 



 Initialize keystores 



 Create KERI identifiers by making an inception event 



 Connect the two KERI identifiers using OOBIs (direct service discovery) 



 Increase the trust level with MFA challenge phrases 



 Write and sign the love letter 



 Verify the love letter signature 



 Write and sign the love reply 



 Verify the love reply 
 



 General notes 



 
 The “$” dollar sign character indicates the type of shell being used, specifically a user shell rather than a root shell (signified by a pound sign “#”). You do not need to type the “$” character when it appears at the beginning of a shell command line. 



 I make frequent use of the shell continuation character “\” to provide readability to commands. This could be hard on the eyes of seasoned professionals though it is helpful for those new to KERI and those who appreciate separate arguments on separate lines. <br>You do not need to use this continuation character when you use the commands. You can omit it and type everything on or condense everything to one line. 



 Output of commands is typically included in code highlighting blocks directly after the command with a header of “Output:”. 
 



 Step 1: Machine Setup 



 Docker Setup with GLEIF image – Easiest –  



 Docker Setup on OSX and Unix 



 
 Install Docker 



 Run the following command: <code>docker run --rm -it gleif/keri /bin/bash</code> 
 



<p>Make sure to include the “/bin/bash” command as the default command in the GLEIF image is to run Python as it is based on the python:3.10.4-alpine3.16 image. You want a shell prompt, not a Python prompt.</p>



 Docker Setup on Windows 



<p>Thank you to Jim Martin for the Windows instructions here.</p>



 
 Install Docker<br>Detailed instructions at Docker docs:<br><a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/</a>








 
 Install WSL2<br>Detailed instructions for installing WSL2:<br><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install</a> 
 



 
 The following will install the defaults (Ubuntu):
 
 Open Powershell 



 Enter the command: <br><code>wsl –install</code> 



 Restart your computer 
 
 
 



 
 Download Docker Desktop installer for Windows<br><a href="https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe">https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe</a> 



 Double-click the Docker installer to begin the install, or alternatively you can install via the the Powershell command line:<br><code>Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install</code> 



 Docker will not automatically start after installing. Use the Windows Start menu to find and start Docker Desktop. 
 
 



 Run the following command at the Powershell command line
 
 <code>docker run --rm -it gleif/keri /bin/bash</code> 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup from Source – Harder 



 Linux (recommended, especially as a Ubuntu container) 



 
 Install Git, cURL, Python 3, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 <code><code>$ </code>apt update</code> 



 <code>$ apt install git curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv libsodium-dev</code> 



 <code>$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | bash -s -- -y</code> 



 <code>$ source "$HOME/.cargo/env"</code> 



 <code>$ pip3 install maturin</code> 
 
 



 Make the working directory /keri
 
 <code>$ mkdir /keri</code> 



 <code>$ cd /keri</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ python3 -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8” or “0.6.9” 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup on OS X / Mac 



<p>If you are going to install with OS X then be sure to translate all of the “/keri” directories to whatever the root directory is you are using for this tutorial work.<br>I will use $HOME/allie-brett.<br>You will also need to translate the “python” commands to whatever you end up having on your system whether “python3”, “python3.10”, or anything like that. I use “python” because I set up my system to point to my Pyenv installation in <code>$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python</code> binary.</p>



 
 With <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>: Install Python 3, Python 3 PIP, Python 3 Venv, Libsodium-dev, maturin, and the Rust toolchain
 
 Installing Python 3 on a Mac is a rather involved process since the operating system default installation can interfere with things. <br>Use the following freeCodeCamp guide to install “pyenv” and then install Python 3 on top of that: <br><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/">How to Install Python 3 on Mac – Brew Install Update Tutorial</a> 



 <code>$ brew install libsodium</code> 



 <code>$ pip install maturin</code> 
 
 



 Set up the working directory
 
 <code>$ mkdir $HOME/allie-brett</code> 



 <code>$ cd $HOME/allie-brett</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd $HOME/allie-brett/keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8” or “0.6.9” 
 
 
 



 Manual Setup on Windows 



<p>Thanks to Jim Martin for providing these installation instructions.</p>



<p>Install the 64-bit versions of the following:</p>



 
 Winget (may already be installed on your system, run winget -version at the Powershell command line to check.): <br><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases">https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases</a> 



 Git<br>Use winget at the Powershell command line:<br><code>winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget</code><br>Or download the most recent git installer from <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a> 



 Python3:<br>Use winget at the Powershell command line to find the most recent version of Python:<br><code>winget search Python.Python</code><br>As of this writing, Python 3.12 is the most recent. Use the given Id to install python with winget:<br><code>winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12</code> 



 Python PIP:<br>Use the Powershell command to install:<br><code>python get-pip.py</code> 



 Venv:<br>Use the Powershell command to install:<br><code>pip install virtualenv</code> 



 Libsodium:<br>First, install download and build the Microsoft vcpkg tool at the Powershell command line:<br><code>mkdir vcpkg</code><br><code>cd vcpkg</code><br><code>git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git .</code><br><code>./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat</code><br><br>Next use the vcpkg tool to install libsodium on your computer. At the Powershell command line:<br><code>./vcpkg integrate install</code><br><code>./vcpkg install libsodium</code><br><br>Alternatively, you can follow the directions for ‘pre-built libraries at:<br><a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/installation/">https://doc.libsodium.org/installation/</a><br><br>*** There is a possibility the above may silently fail to place libsodium.dll in the Windows\System32 directory. You may need to manually copy the DLL from the pre-built library download into your Windows\System32 directory.<br>As of this writing, the most recent version of the DLL is located in the pre-built library zip file at:<br>\libsodium-1.0.18-msvc\libsodium\x64\Release\v142\dynamic\libsodium.dll 



 Rust toolchain:<br>Follow the installation instructions for 64-bit Rust at :<br><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a><br><br>Be sure to restart your Powershell terminal after installation has completed. After starting a new Powershell terminal, verify your Rust install by checking the installed version:<br><code>rustc --version</code><br><br>If this does not work, the most likely issue is the PATH variable not being set properly. Consult the Rust installation page for more information.<br>Additional information about installing Rust on Windows and configuring Visual Studio code can be found at:<br><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup</a> 



 Maturin:<br>At the Powershell command line, execute the following command:<br><code>pip install maturin</code> 



 Set up the working directory (don’t know if these work)
 
 <code>$ mkdir keri</code> 



 <code>$ cd keri</code> 
 
 



 Install KERI
 
 <code>$ git clone git clone https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy.git</code> 



 <code>$ cd %userprofile%\allie-brett\keripy</code> 



 <code>$ python -m pip install -e ./</code> 
 
 



 Verify your installation
 
 <code>$ kli version</code> 



 This should output something like “0.6.8”, “0.6.9”, or “1.0.0”.<br>This fails on Windows with the error:AttributeError: module ‘socket’ has no attribute ‘AF_UNIX’<br><br>This is due to AF_UNIX port types not being supported by Windows. Interestingly, the code is actually trying to open a logging file, which should be done a different way. It could be said that the flaw exists in the code.<br><br>In order to fix this, the following code modifications were necessary the ioflo/hio library, specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio/blob/8e655fb6322eb8dad14953bf0a3c4fbd437940bd/src/hio/help/ogling.py#L169">ogling.py</a> file. ioflo/hio is the async runtime KERI is built on top of. 
 
 
 



 Hack to make KERI work on windows (test with kli version) 



 <code>At approx. line 183, you will see the lines of code:

facility = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler.LOG_USER # LOG_DAEMON
self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=address, 
                                                        facility=facility)

Replace this code with the following hack:

===================START CODE HACK==========================
if sys.platform == 'win32':
  # cur_filename is obtained from the os.path so it matches the source code file.
  # a better fix would be using the app name or something else relevant to the logger.
  cur_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]
  log_filename = 'logs' + os.sep + 'Log_' + cur_filename + '.txt'

  # make sure the log directory exists
  if not os.path.exists("logs"):
    os.makedirs('logs')

  # use a logging handler more appropriate to windows
  self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(
    os.environ.get("LOGFILE", log_filename))
else:
  # if not on Windows, use the old way
  facility = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler.LOG_USER # LOG_DAEMON
  self.baseSysLogHandler = logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=address, 
                                                          facility=facility)
===================END CODE HACK==========================

After this fix, you should be able to run the kli version command and be rewarded with results like the following:

\&gt; kli version
0.6.9

In addition, you should also see a new logs directory inside the keri directory which contains an empty file:

Log_ogling.txt</code> 



<p>The rest of the tutorial will be using Linux since it is the easiest to work with. If you aren’t yet familiar with Docker I highly recommend you take the plunge and learn how to use it. You will be well rewarded for your efforts.</p>



 Step 2: Create configuration and keystore directories 



<p>Pretty simple, just making a few directories and configuration files. If you haven’t seen the “{,}” syntax before in making directories it allows you to specify a list of directories to be made at a given level.<br>Keep in mind the KERI_CONFIG_DIR variable as it will be used later.</p>



<p>The two witness configuration files, “allie-witness-oobis.json” and “brett-witness-oobis.json”, are the witness pool configurations for both Allie and Brett. Similarly the “magic-pencil.json” and the “secret-speaker.json” configuration files are the identifier configurations used for Allie and Brett, respectively.</p>



 <code>$ mkdir -p /keri/heartnet/keri/cf
$ mkdir /keri/{allie,brett}
$ export KERI_CONFIG_DIR=/keri/heartnet

$ echo '{"dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00","iurls": ["http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX/controller"]}' \
     &gt; /keri/heartnet/keri/cf/allie-witness-oobis.json

$ echo '{"dt": "2022-01-20T12:57:59.823350+00:00","iurls": ["http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/BM35JN8XeJSEfpxopjn5jr7tAHCE5749f0OobhMLCorE/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5646/oobi/BIj15u5V11bkbtAxMA7gcNJZcax-7TgaBMLsQnMHpYHP/controller","http://127.0.0.1:5647/oobi/BF2rZTW79z4IXocYRQnjjsOuvFUQv-ptCf8Yltd7PfsM/controller"]}' \
     &gt; /keri/heartnet/keri/cf/brett-witness-oobis.json

$ echo '{"transferable": true,"wits": ["BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha","BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM","BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"],"toad": 3,"icount": 1,"ncount": 1,"isith": "1","nsith": "1"}' \
     &gt; /keri/allie/magic-pencil.json

$ echo '{"transferable": true,"wits": ["BM35JN8XeJSEfpxopjn5jr7tAHCE5749f0OobhMLCorE","BIj15u5V11bkbtAxMA7gcNJZcax-7TgaBMLsQnMHpYHP","BF2rZTW79z4IXocYRQnjjsOuvFUQv-ptCf8Yltd7PfsM"],"toad": 3,"icount": 1,"ncount": 1,"isith": "1","nsith": "1"}' \
     &gt; /keri/brett/secret-speaker.json</code> 



<p>At this point you have created the keystores and have the foundation set up for both Allie and Brett</p>


 
 


 Step 3: Start Witness Network 



<p>Very simple, one command, since the demo witness network is being used. Ensure you follow the command with the ampersand “&amp;” sign so it runs in the background and you can use your terminal session for the rest of the commands. Alternatively you can run this in a separate terminal window or with something like the <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/">screen</a> command.</p>



 <code>$ kli witness demo &amp;

Output will look like:
[1] 23
Witness wan : BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha
Witness wil : BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM
Witness wes : BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX
Witness wit : BM35JN8XeJSEfpxopjn5jr7tAHCE5749f0OobhMLCorE
Witness wub : BIj15u5V11bkbtAxMA7gcNJZcax-7TgaBMLsQnMHpYHP
Witness wyz : BF2rZTW79z4IXocYRQnjjsOuvFUQv-ptCf8Yltd7PfsM
</code> 



<p>The witness network is a set of six witnesses separated into two groups, three each for Allie and Brett.</p>


 
 


 Step 4: Initialize Keystores 



<p>You create a unique cryptographic salt for Allie that is used to derive her public key. This salt should be kept secure with the utmost protections. You can use other sources for the salt.</p>



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ export ALLIE_SALT="$(kli salt)"
$ kli init \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie  \
      --nopasscode \
      --salt ${ALLIE_SALT} \
      --config-dir ${KERI_CONFIG_DIR} \
      --config-file allie-witness-oobis

Output:
KERI Keystore created at: /keri/allie/allie_ks
KERI Database created at: /keri/allie/allie_ks
KERI Credential Store created at: /keri/allie/allie_ks

<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ export BRETT_SALT="$(kli salt)"
$ kli init \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett  \
      --nopasscode \

<p>You have now successfully initialized the keystores for Allie and Brett.</p>


 
 


 Step 5: Create KERI identifiers by making an inception event 



<p>The most important part to being able to use KERI is the creation of KERI identifiers, also known as <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/autonomic-identifier">Autonomic Identifiers</a>, or AIDs. One identifier will be created for each Allie and Brett. The witnesses in the witness pools will each observe, or witness, the inception event and give a receipt of that observation back to the AID controller.</p>



 
 Allie’s AID will be aliased as “magic-pencil”
 
 She writes her love letter with a magic pencil! 
 
 



 Brett’s AID will be aliased as “secret-speaker”
 
 Brett has a special device known as a secret speaker that will only play verified messages from his sweetheart. 
 
 
 



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli incept \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      -f /keri/allie/magic-pencil.json

Output:
Waiting for witness receipts...
Prefix  EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP
	Public key 1:  DDENeQF4NUaO4AdJfNdyxnrEYRTCIZoEzJ9kh4t0woLN

Place the prefix in a variable for later
$ export ALLIE_PREFIX=EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ kli incept \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett  \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      -f /keri/brett/secret-speaker.json

Output:
Waiting for witness receipts...
Prefix  EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA
	Public key 1:  DE2RDQFCUvEx8kcKEg15S8txBZ8X1lURdwLpWylLD2Jm

Do the same thing for Brett's prefix:
$ export BRETT_PREFIX=EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA</code> 



<p>Now that both of the identifiers are set up then <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/key-event-log">key event logs</a> (KELs) have been created for Allie and Brett. You also see that receipts from each of the witnesses sent back to the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/controller">controller</a> of each AID are stored in the key event log and can be called a <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/key-event-receipt-log">key event receipt log</a> (KERL).</p>


 
 


 Step 6: Connect the two KERI identifiers using OOBIs (direct service discovery) 



<p>Currently Allie and Brett’s KERI controller nodes (their AID controllers) do not know about each other and must be introduced to begin the trust bond.</p>



<p>To do this you first generate an <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/out-of-band-introduction">Out Of Band Introduction</a> (OOBI) value for a given source identifier and then you pass that value to the destination who you want to learn about the location of, or discover, the source.</p>



 OOBI Generation 



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi generate \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --role witness

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5643/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5644/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness</code> 



<p>You see an OOBI value for each of the witnesses specified in the configuration file. Take any one of these values to place in the magic_pencil_oobi variable:</p>



 <code>$ export magic_pencil_oobi=http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi generate \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --role witness

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5646/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness
http://127.0.0.1:5647/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness</code> 



<p>And again put one of the values in the secret_speaker_oobi variable:</p>



 <code>$ export secret_speaker_oobi=http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness</code> 



 OOBI Resolution (discovery) 



<p>We switch up the storyline order here and have Allie introduce her magic-pencil AID to Brett followed by Brett introducing his secret-speaker AID to Allie. This mutual resolution of OOBIs to completes the discovery process.</p>



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>kli oobi resolve \
    --name brett_ks \
    --base /keri/brett \
    --oobi-alias magic-pencil \
    --oobi "${magic_pencil_oobi}"

Output: 
http://127.0.0.1:5642/oobi/EGdeGrvLiZ7K8KFuSrFhc4AghPwkwi-qEMGKokaTh2JP/witness resolved</code> 



<p>This introduces Allie to Brett. Allie has shared her magic-pencil OOBI with Brett and Brett has resolved that OOBI (a URL) using typical internet infrastructure to find and connect with Allie’s AID. Brett’s secret-speaker AID then analyzes the key event log of Allie’s magic-pencil AID and verifies it so Brett’s secret-speaker AID knows it can trust it is really speaking with Allie’s magic-pencil AID.</p>


 
 


<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>$ kli oobi resolve \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --oobi-alias secret-speaker \
      --oobi "${secret_speaker_oobi}"

Output:
http://127.0.0.1:5645/oobi/EMFWPbZf4uG2XUV-LSJ4zWkLU-2tbuCMZh36gW1NeJiA/witness resolved</code> 



<p>This introduces Brett to Allie. Brett gives his secret_speaker_oobi value to Allie which she uses to then resolve his location using typical internet infrastructure, establishes a connection with him, and then verifies his key event log for the secret-speaker AID to ensure she can trust the secret-speaker. </p>


 
 


 Step 7: Increase the trust level with MFA challenge phrases 



<p>As a multi-factor authentication (MFA) method you can issue challenge phrases to an identifier that it would prepare a response to which you could then verify using the challenge verify workflow. For Allie and Brett they both generate their own challenge phrase which the other party signs after which the original party who generated the challenge phrase verifies the signature of the signed phrase.</p>



 Generate Challenge Phrase 



<p>The <code>kli challenge generate</code> command works like so:</p>



 <code>$ kli challenge generate --out string

Sample Output:
ranch space pipe later they jazz retreat tide expand inform barrel gorilla</code> 



<p>For brevity I use command expansion and string interpolation to generate the challenge phrases. You can use any string you like for the challenge phrase and are not limited to phrases generated by <code>kli challenge generate</code>.</p>



<p>For Allie:</p>



 <code>allie_words="$(kli challenge generate --out string)"</code> 



<p>For Brett:</p>



 <code>brett_words="$(kli challenge generate --out string)"</code> 



 Prepare Challenge Response 



<p>Allie prepares a response to Brett’s challenge phrase and Brett verifies Allie’s challenge response.</p>



 <code>Allie preparing a response to Brett's challenge phrase:
$ kli challenge respond \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --recipient secret-speaker \
      --words "${allie_words}"

Output: no output

Brett verifying Allie's challenge response:
$ kli challenge verify \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --signer magic-pencil \
      --words "${allie_words}"

Output:
Checking mailboxes for any challenge responses..

Signer magic-pencil successfully responded to challenge words: '['term', 'spatial', 'weasel', 'prison', 'sniff', 'worth', 'unfold', 'balance', 'motor', 'monkey', 'cloud', 'economy']'</code> 


 
 


<p>Brett then similarly prepares a response to Allie’s challenge phrase and Allie verifies Brett’s challenge response.</p>



 <code>Brett preparing a response to Allie's challenge phrase:
$ kli challenge respond \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --recipient magic-pencil \
      --words "${brett_words}"

Output: no output

Allie verifying Brett's challenge response:
$ kli challenge verify \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --signer secret-speaker \
      --words "${brett_words}"

Output:
Checking mailboxes for any challenge responses..

Signer secret-speaker successfully responded to challenge words: '['life', 'lift', 'sheriff', 'same', 'gentle', 'traffic', 'foot', 'trash', 'approve', 'dawn', 'audit', 'type']'</code> 


 
 


 Step 8: Write and sign the love letter 



<p>Now we can finally do what we came here to do! It’s time to write the letter and sign it.</p>



<p>Allie’s love letter:</p>



 <code>Allie writes the letter:
$ echo '{"love_letter": "well, hello there, honey. Happy Valentines :*"}' &gt; /keri/heartnet/love-letter.json

And signs it:
$ kli sign \
      --name allie_ks \
      --base /keri/allie \
      --alias magic-pencil \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-letter.json 

Output (is a signature):
1. AAAZP-KPS1FtkeVNvvm8uSFJqlDNmJy8tpD1hB2-OYcmlP39Fog4wETcDEL_4QNXHeUVV_QiuUpqbxgIzAaiV9EK

Place output in a variable:
export ALLIE_SIGNATURE=AAAZP-KPS1FtkeVNvvm8uSFJqlDNmJy8tpD1hB2-OYcmlP39Fog4wETcDEL_4QNXHeUVV_QiuUpqbxgIzAaiV9EK</code> 



 Step 9: Verify the love letter signature 



<p>Brett wants to know this letter really is from Allie so he verifies it with kli verify:</p>



 <code>Brett verifies Allie's signature on the love letter:
$ kli verify \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --prefix $ALLIE_PREFIX \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-letter.json \
      --signature $ALLIE_SIGNATURE

Output:
Signature 1 is valid.</code> 


 
 


 Step 10: Write and sign the love reply 



<p>In turn, for such a show of affection from Allie, Brett signs and returns a love reply.</p>



 <code>Brett's love reply:
$ echo '{"love_letter": "Hey sweetie, I got your letter! &lt;3 &lt;3"}' &gt; /keri/heartnet/love-reply.json

And his signature:
$ kli sign \
      --name brett_ks \
      --base /keri/brett \
      --alias secret-speaker \
      --text @/keri/heartnet/love-reply.json

Output (a signature):
1. AAB3VtKayW1e1zn-RvyWLo3SChc01RitBgeYlX_apLZ8geCd8iMLFUu8exS0txwp9znjtMoayFy9-edim5Vfd7EK

And place it in a variable for later use:
export BRETT_SIGNATURE=AAB3VtKayW1e1zn-RvyWLo3SChc01RitBgeYlX_apLZ8geCd8iMLFUu8exS0txwp9znjtMoayFy9-edim5Vfd7EK</code> 



 Step 11: Verify the love reply 



<p>Allie wants to be sure this reply to her letter really came from Brett so she will verify the signature Brett sent her.</p>



 <code>Allie verifies Brett's love reply by checking his signature of it:
$ kli verify \
    --name allie_ks \
    --base /keri/allie \
    --alias magic-pencil \
    --prefix $BRETT_PREFIX \
    --text @/keri/heartnet/love-reply.json \
    --signature $BRETT_SIGNATURE

Output:
Signature 1 is valid.</code> 


 
 


<p>It verifies! Both Allie and Brett can enjoy their secure, authentic love letter communications.</p>



 Wrap up 



<p>Brett and Allie had a great laugh knowing they have a secret conversation that nobody else knows about where they can trust that they were really communicating with each other. They can now have a happy, peaceful valentines.</p>

<p>
The Mastodon dashboards I’ve been developing and describing in this series are backed by a <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon">Steampipe plugin</a> that translates SQL queries to Mastodon API calls. Like all Steampipe plugins you can use this one to run those queries in all sorts of ways: from psql or another Postgres CLI (perhaps via cron, perhaps in a CI/CD pipeline); from Metabase or Grafana or any Postgres-compatible BI tool; from Python or JavaScript or any programming language. The Steampipe core is a versatile <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/steampipe-as-component">software component</a> that you can plug into just about any environment.</p>
<p>
There’s also, of course, Steampipe’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668032/visualizing-the-hacker-news-api-with-hcl-and-sql.html">dashboards as code</a> approach which powers the alternate Mastodon UX that I’ve been exploring in this series. You can think of this dashboarding tool as a primitive web browser with a freakish talent for querying Postgres and weaving SQL results into widgets such as infocards, input controls, charts, tables, and relationship graphs. You compose widgets using HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) instead of HTML, arrange them using basic layout syntax, and view them by connecting your browser to the local Steampipe dashboard server or to <a href="https://cloud.steampipe.io">cloud.steampipe.io</a>.</p>
<p>
The alternate Mastodon UX built this way was aptly described (thanks again <a href="https://third-bit.com">Greg Wilson</a>!) as <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3684669/a-bloomberg-terminal-for-mastodon.html">A Bloomberg terminal for Mastodon</a>. As a reminder, the stock Mastodon web client looks like this.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/01/default-mastodon-view-100936040-large.jpg%22"></a></p>
<p>
And the pages served by the Mastodon dashboards look like this.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/images.idgesg.net/images/article/2023/01/steampipe-mastodon-view-100936039-orig.jpg?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
I can scan the latter view far more effectively.</p>
<p>
Now, I’ve been trying out a bunch of alternate Mastodon clients lately. I love <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274">Ivory</a> on my phone, and <a href="https://elk.zone">Elk</a> in the browser, and I use them when I want an experience that feels social-media-ish. But I don’t use Ivory or Elk or Toot! or the stock Mastodon web clients (browser, phone) when I want an experience that feels RSS-reader-ish.</p>
<p>
For some information landscapes I want to unfold a big map, spread it out, and scan for points of interest. Social media is that kind of landscape, RSS readers were the first way I surveyed it effectively, and these Mastodon dashboards are becoming my new way.</p>
<p>
When I compare those two screenshots though, it’s not just the density of the latter that I notice, but also the absence of pictures. At first I fretted about that. Could the dashboard pages render full-strength HTML? Perhaps they will, and there are a few different ways that could happen, but meanwhile I’ve come to embrace the text-only constraint. When I’ve got my map unfolded, and I’m scanning my home timeline or my lists for things to click into, images can be a distraction. I wouldn’t have chosen to omit them, but I find that their absence enables me to focus very effectively on who is speaking, and what they are saying or boosting. </p>
<p>
There is also, of course, the graphical view afforded by <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">relationship graphs</a>. These feel very map-like in the way they reveal clusters of people interacting with one another. I’m finding them more useful than anticipated.</p>
<p>
But the text that I read in these dashboards is image-free for now. And I think it’s having a calming effect. There are plenty of times when I want images, don’t get me wrong, and that’s partly why I use a mix of conventional Mastodon clients. But there are times when I want to dial down the clutter, just like there are times when I switch my phone to monochrome. Two things can be true: The pictures we share with one another are a source of joy, and they are sensory overload. I’ll make them optional here when I can, and would like to have the option to use all social media interfaces in text mode.</p>

<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-twitter-takeover.html">strange things</a>
to <a href="https://twitter.com/">some internet platform</a>, and all of a sudden

<p>Core to this is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> standard,
and real-world implementations that mix it with additional independently

<p>None of them are particularly easy to understand. So I did a bit of drawing
just to make it clearer (for myself) what kind of data can be shipped around
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>. To be clear,
this is only a small part of the overall stack, but an important one.</p>
<p>Here are some diagrams. They are essentially inheritance diagrams that
show what kinds of activities there are, and actors, etc. Posted here
in case they are useful for others, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>And here’s how to interpret my homegrown graphical notation. (I made it up

<p>
Since the early days of the blogosphere I have cherished the ability to view the world through the eyes of people more qualified than me to understand and explain what happens in particular domains. Although Twitter lists were a great way to collect people who provide those perspectives, I made little use of them. Prompted by Martin Fowler’s <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-mastodon.html#frustrations-with-lists">frustration with lists</a> I described my first steps toward reviving the technique in <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/22/lists-and-people-on-mastodon/">Lists and people on Mastodon</a>. </p>
<p>First I encapsulated the relevant APIs in a pair of tables provided by the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon: <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list.md">mastodon_list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-mastodon/blob/main/docs/tables/mastodon_list_account.md">mastodon_list_account</a>. Then I used those tables to enhance the <a href="https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-mastodon-insights/">Mastodon dashboard</a> in a couple of ways. The followers and following tabs now show me who is or isn’t on a list.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/following-with-lists.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
And I can use the list tab to read recent posts from people on each list.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-list-tab.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
With these basic building blocks in place I want to be more intentional about curating these lists. To that end I thought I’d share the lists I’ve built so far, and invite suggestions. You can export your lists from the Mastodon web client using Preferences -&gt; Data export -&gt; Lists. The resulting CSV file has two columns: the name of a list and the Mastodon handle for a person.</p>

<p>It’s easy to create that list using the Steampipe plugin for Mastodon.</p>
<p>
steampipe query “select title as list, username, server, instance_qualified_account_url, note from mastodon_list l join mastodon_list_account a on l.id = a.list_id order by list, username” –output csv &gt; mastodon_lists.csv</p>
<p>
(I’m using <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">instance-qualified URLs</a> relative to my home server, if your home is elsewhere than mastodon.social you’ll want to adjust the links accordingly.)</p>
<p>
I’ve uploaded the output of that query to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IREOYAGI87zIma_V7m-zmx7oPt_jkEpZOLje6jn2dzY">Google sheet</a>. The most recent addition to my climate list is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@petergleick@fediscience.org">Peter Gleick</a> who was quoted yesterday in Farhad Manhjoo’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/opinion/california-drought-flooding-climate-change.html">What Will ‘Weather Whiplash’ Mean for California?</a> I’d been looking for an expert perspective on California water policy, so I checked to see if Peter is on Mastodon, found that he is, and added him to my climate list. Here’s an example of the kind of perspective I’m looking for.</p>
<blockquote><p>
California reservoirs have captured enough water from the recent storms to supply all urban water use in the state for a year. Not counting the massive snowpack. Those claims that “all the water is being wasted flowing to the ocean” is nonsense. — <a href="https://mastodon.social/@petergleick@fediscience.org/109720107561013638">Mastodon link</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Of course it’s a complex issue, and I don’t think I’m wrong to be very interested in strategies for capturing more rainfall and using it to recharge aquifers. But this was a useful reality check. </p>
<p>
Who are the experts you follow in various domains? Can I cherrypick from your lists? And can we imagine a way of remixing and sharing these lists? I’m looking at you, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@lucasgonze@indieweb.social">Lucas Gonze</a>, with fond memories of how <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130729204004/http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3655.html">Webjay</a> did that for MP3 playlists. Can we do that for Mastodon lists too?</p>

<p>Megan McArdle says this week, in the Washington Post, that “Twitter might be replaced, but not by Mastodon or other imitators.” I’m not linking to the article, you can easily find it, but that title is all we need for my purpose here, along with this bit of context: she has 93K followers on Twitter. </p>
<p>Nobody wants to walk away from that kind of audience. Well, almost nobody. Sam Harris’ recent Twitter exit is a rare example of someone concluding that a large follower count is a net negative. If I were in his shoes I’m not sure I’d be able to do the same. When my own audience was at its peak — at BYTE during the dawn of the Internet, then at InfoWorld in the early years of the blogosphere — I could press the Publish button on my blog and watch in realtime as the responses rolled in on waves of dopamine. It’s addictive, there’s never enough, you’re always looking for the next hit.</p>
<p>When Twitter started, that momentum carried forward for a while. I never racked up a huge follower count — it maxed out just shy of 6K — but most of those people followed me early on, thanks to the the ad-supported publications that had brought me to their attention. My Twitter following reached a plateau years ago. Did I wish for 100K followers? Sure, I’d be lying to pretend otherwise. But gradually I came to see that there was a sweet spot, somewhere between (let’s say) 200 and 15,000 followers, where it was possible to enjoy the kinds of pleasant and stimulating interaction that I’d first experienced in web forums and the blogosophere.</p>
<p>Until it wasn’t. Like a frog in slowly boiling water, I failed to notice how the Twitter experience degraded over time. Fewer and fewer of my 6K followers corresponded regularly, and my social graph there became stagnant. For me the Mastodon reboot has been a delightful replay of the early blogosphere: new acquaintances, collegial discussion, positive energy.</p>
<p>If you occupy a privileged position in the attention economy, as Megan McArdle does now, and as I once did in a more limited way, then no, you won’t see Mastodon as a viable replacement for Twitter. If I were still a quasi-famous columnist I probably wouldn’t either. But I’m no longer employed in the attention economy. I just want to hang out online with people whose words and pictures and ideas intrigue and inspire and delight me, and who might feel similarly about my words and pictures and ideas. There are thousands of such people in the world, not millions. We want to congregate in different online spaces for different reasons. Now we can and I couldn’t be happier. When people say it can’t work, consider why, and who benefits from it not working. </p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2023/01/16/mastodon-relationship-graphs/">graph</a> of the Fediverse as it appears  from my perspective right now. </p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/server-to-server-boosts.png?ssl=1"></a></p>

<p>The new release of Steampipe is all about relationship graphs. Our <a href="https://steampipe.io/blog/release-0-18-0">blog post</a> shows how these graphs provide contextual awareness for devops and security pros who can now see all the resources related to an EC2 instance, or determine at a glance whether the permissions related to an IAM role are properly scoped. As always, developers can explore and remix the code that builds these graphs, and adapt the idioms for their own purposes in any data domain.</p>
<p>These relationship graphs are driven by SQL queries that define nodes and edges. Such queries can use any column of any table provided by <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to form nodes, and then edges between nodes. If you want to see connections among the people and objects represented by diverse APIs, you can now use SQL idioms to graph them. The only limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>Naturally I imagined graphing Mastodon relationships. So far I’ve built two graphs that visualize my home timeline. Here’s the first one.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-from-selected-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Here we’re looking at the most recent 50 boosts (the Mastodon version of retweet) in my homeline. This is the query to find them.</p>
 select
  *
from
  mastodon_toot
where
  timeline = 'home'
  and reblog_server is not null
  limit  50
 
<p>If we focus on Brian Marick we can see that:</p>
 
 Brian belongs to mastdn.social 
 Brian boosted a post by Tim Bray 
 Tim belongs to hachyderm.io 
 
<p>So this graph shows people on a selected server boosting people on other servers. In this case mastdn.social is the selected server, but we can refocus the graph on any other server that’s sending boosts.</p>
<p>The second graph zooms out to show the web of boost relationships among servers. If anyone on infosec.exchange boosts anyone on mastodon.world, there’s an edge connecting the two nodes. Although it’s not happening anywhere in this graph, the arrow can point both ways and would if anyone on mastodon.world were also boosting anyone on infosec.exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/mastodon-boosts-server-to-server.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>Let’s build up the first graph step by step.</p>
 Step 1: Identify the selected server 
<p>Here’s the definition of the node that represents the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.selected_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      server as id,
      server as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'server', server
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>Per the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/node">documentation</a>, a node’s query must at least select a column aliased as id. Here it’s the server column in a row returned by the above query. I’ve packaged that query into a SQL function, mastodon_boosts, to hide details (timeline = 'home' reblog_server is not null limit 50) and make it easier to focus on what’s special about each node. In this case the special quality is the server column that gives the node its identity matches the selected server.</p>
<p>If the <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/graph">graph</a> block includes only this node, and mastdn.social is the selected server, here is the rendering. Not much to see here yet!</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-1.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>The node defines a bag of properties that can be any of the columns returned by the underlying query; these appear when you hover the node. The node also refers to a category that governs the node’s icon, color, and link. Here’s the category for the selected server.</p>
 category "selected_server" {
  color = "darkgreen"
  icon = "server"
  href  = "https://{{.properties.'server'}}"
}
 
 Step 2: Identify boosted servers 
<p>Now we’ll add boosted servers. This node uses the same set of records: the 50 most recent boosts in my feed. Again it finds just those whose server column matches the selected server. But the id is now the reblog_server which is the target, instead of the origin, of boosts from the selected server.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_server
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_server as id,
      reblog_server as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
    EOQ
}
 
<p>Here’s the graph with both selected_server and boosted_server nodes. We’ve used another category to differentiate the boosted nodes.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-2.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>There’s only one selected server but it can send boosts to more than one boosted server. The default rendering folds them into one node but you can click to unfold and see all of them.</p>
 Step 3: Identify people who boost others 
<p>Where are the people? Let’s add them next, starting with the people who are sending boosts.</p>
 node {
  category = category.person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as id,
      display_name as title,
	    jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_account_url', instance_qualified_account_url
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
     server = $1
    EOQ
  }
 
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-3.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>
The username column gives the node its identity. Note also the property instance_qualified_account_url. That’s the synthetic column we added to the Mastodon plugin <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2022/12/31/instance-qualified-mastodon-urls/">last time</a> to ensure that links to people and toots will work properly in the Mastodon client. Because it’s included in a property here, and because category.person refers to that property, links representing people in the graph will resolve properly.</p>
 Step 4: Identify people who are boosted 
<p>This node takes its identify from the reblog_username column, and uses the synthetic column instance_qualified_reblog_url to provide the link.</p>
 node {
  category = category.boosted_person
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as id,
      reblog_username as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'instance_qualified_reblog_url', instance_qualified_reblog_url
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-4.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 5: Connect boosters on the selected server to that server 
<p>So far we’ve seen only nodes, whose queries minimally return the id property. An <a href="https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources/edge">edge</a> connects nodes by way of a query that minimally returns columns aliased to from_id and to_id.</p>
 edge {
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
  EOQ
}
 
<p>You’ll also want to provide a title to label the edge. Here this edge occurs twice to represent “John Mashey belongs to mstdn.social” and “Brian Marick belongs to mstdn.social.”</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-5.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 6: Connect people on boosted servers to their servers 
<p>This edge works the same way, but captures the relationship between boosted people and their servers.</p>
 edge {
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      reblog_username as from_id,
      reblog_server as to_id,
      'belongs to' as title
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}

 
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-6.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Step 7: Connect boosters to the people they boost 
<p>Finally we add an edge to connect boosters to the people they boost.</p>
 edge {
  category = category.boost
  args = [ self.input.server.value ]
  sql = &lt;&lt;EOQ
    select
      username as from_id,
      reblog_username as to_id,
      'boosts' as title,
      jsonb_build_object(
        'reblog_username', reblog_username,
        'reblog_server', reblog_server,
        'content', reblog -&gt;&gt; 'content'
      ) as properties
    from
      mastodon_boosts()
    where
      server = $1
  EOQ
}
 
<p>And now we’ve completed the first graph shown above.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-step-7.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
 Graphing GitHub relationships 
<p>You can use this grammar of nodes and edges to describe relationships in any domain. Here’s a graph that looks across all the Steampipe-related repos and shows recently-updated PRs from external contributors.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-external-prs.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>And here’s one that uses <a href="https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins">any Steampipe plugin</a> to show recently-updated pull requests for a selected repo.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/jonudell.info/images/relgraph-github-mod-pr-updates.png?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>These two views share a common SQL query and serve complementary purposes. The table is handy for sorting by date or author, the graph highlights one-to-many relationships.</p>
 Lifting the burden of context assembly 
<p>In <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2670157/what-timedance-got-right.html">What TimeDance got right</a> I mourned the passing of a tool for scheduling meetings that had excelled at bringing together the messages and documents related to a meeting. I called this “context assembly” — a term I’d picked up from Jack Ozzie, cofounder of Groove, another collaboration tool whose passing I mourn. Context assembly is hard work. Too often the burden falls on people who only need to use that context and would rather not spend time and effort creating it.</p>
<p>We’ve seen how SQL can <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3648648/how-sql-can-unify-access-to-apis.html">unify access to APIs</a>. Now it can also help us see relationships among the data we extract from those APIs.</p>

  SSI wallets will embody people in the digital world and give them a place to stand as a peer to others online. But online services will still have accounts.

The person (and their wallet) will be the account." While I appreciate the sentiment, I think reality is much more nuanced than that because identity management is about relationships, not identities (whatever those are).</p><p>Supporting a relationship requires that we recognize, remember, and react to another party (person, business, or thing). In self-sovereign identity (SSI), the tools that support that are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2022/12/wallets_and_agents.shtml">wallets and agents</a>. For people, these will be personal. For a business or other organization they'll be enterprise wallets and agents. The primary difference between these is that enterprise wallets and agents will be integrated with the other systems that the business uses to support the relationships they have at scale.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p>       <p>Remembering and reacting to another entity requires that you keep information about them for the length of the relationship. Some relationships, like the one I form with the convenience store clerk when I buy a candy bar, are ephemeral, lasting only for the length of the transaction. I don't remember much while its happening and forget it as soon as it's done. Others are long-lasting and I remember a great deal in order for the relationship to have utility.</p><p>So, let's say that we're living in the future where SSI is ubiquitous and I have a DID-based relationship with Netflix. I have a wallet full of credentials. In order for my relationship to have utility, they will have to remember a lot about me, like what I've watched, what devices I used, and so on. They will likely still need to store a form of payment since it's a subscription. I call that an account. And for the service Netflix provides, it's likely not optional.</p><p>Let's consider a different use case: ecommerce. I go to a site, select what I want to buy, supply information about shipping and payment, and submit the order. I can still create a DID-based relationship, but the information needed from me beyond what I want to buy can all come from my credentials. And it's easy enough to provide that I don't mind supplying it every time. The ecommerce site doesn't need to store any of it. They may still offer to let me create an account, but it's optional. No more required than the loyalty program my local supermarket offers. The relationship I create to make the purchase can be ephemeral if that's what I want.</p><p>What will definitely go away is the use of accounts for social login. In social login, large identity providers have accounts that are then used by relying parties to authenticate people. Note that authentication is about recognizing. SSI wallets do away with that need by providing the means for different parties to easily create relationships directly and then use verifiable credentials to know things about the other with certainty. Both parties can mutually authenticate the other. But even here, social login is usually a secondary purpose for the account. I have an account with Google. Even if I never use it for logging in anywhere but Google, I'll still have an account for the primary reasons I use Google.</p><p>Another thing that goes away is logging in to your account. You'll still be authenticated, but that will fade into the background as the processes we use for recognizing people (FIDO and SSI) become less intrusive and fade into the background. We have a feel for this now with apps on our smartphones. We rarely authenticate because the app does that and then relies on the smartphone to protect the app from use by unauthorized people. FIDO and SSI let us provide similar experiences on the web as well. Because we won't be logging into them, the idea of accounts will fade from people's consciousness even if they still exist.</p><p>I don't think accounts are going away anytime soon simply because they are a necessary part of the relationship I have with many businesses. I want them to remember me and react to me in the context of the interactions we've had in the past. SSI offers new ways of supporting relationships, especially ephemeral ones, that means companies need to store less. But for long-term relationships, your wallet can't be the account. The other party needs their own means of remembering you and they will do that using tools that look just like an account.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Creditor%27s_Ledger,_Holmes_McDougall_%284271445364%29.jpg">Creditor's Ledger, Holmes McDougall</a> from Edinburgh City of Print (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en">CC BY 2.0</a>)</p>   <p>Thanks for reading Phil Windley's Technometria!

<p>[Update: 11:20 AM Wednesday 18 January] Well, I woke this morning to hear all the signals from Gibraltar Peak back on the air. I don’t know if the site is on generator power, or if electric power has been restored. This pop-out from a map symbol on Southern California Edison’s <a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">Power Outage Awareness Map</a>&nbsp;suggests the latter:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status"></a></p>
<p>However, I am listening right now to<a href="http://am1290kzsb.com/"> KZSB/1290</a> AM’s FM signal on 96.9 from Gibraltar Peak, where the show hosts are detailing many road closures, noting that sections of Gibraltar road are “down the hill,” meaning not there anymore, and unlikely to be fixed soon. I think I also heard them say their FM transmitter is on generator power. Far as I know, they are the only station covering local road closures, buildings damaged, farms and orchards damaged, and related topics, in great detail. It’s old-fashioned local radio at its best. Hats off.</p>
<p>Looking at the power requirements up there, only two stations are high-power ones: KDB/93.7’s transmitter pumps 4.9kW into a stack of five antenna bays that yield an ERP (effective radiated power) of 12.5kW, and KDRW(KCRW)/88.7 uses about 5.9kW to produce 12kW ERP through a stack of four antenna bays. Those are on the poles at the right and left ends of this photo, which I shot after the Jesusita Fire in 2009:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/52624023819/in/album-72177720305197807/"></a></p>
<p>All the other stations’ transmitters require less wattage than a microwave oven. Three only put out ten watts. So, given typical modern transmitter efficiencies, I’m guessing the site probably has a 20kW generator, give or take, requiring about 2.5 gallons of propane per hour. So a 500-gallon propane tank (a typical size) will last about 200 hours. Of course, none of that will matter until the next outage, provided electrical service is actually restored now, or soon.</p>
<p>[Update: 3:34 PM Monday 16 January] Two news stories:</p>
 
 Edhat: <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/gibraltar-road-damage">Gibraltar Road Damage</a>., by Edhat staff, Januraly 11, 2023 12:30 PM. It’s a collection of revealing Gibraltar Road photos that I wish I had seen earlier. Apologies for that. This is the text of the whole story: “A resident of Gibraltar Road shared the below photos from the recent storm damage. A section of the road appears to be washed out with a Tesla trapped under some debris.&nbsp;The Tesla slide is located approximately a quarter mile past the Rattlesnake Canyon trailhead and the washed road is about a mile past the radio tower before reaching the west fork trailhead.” If “mile past” means going uphill toward East Camino Cielo on the ridge, that means travel was (and is) impeded (at the very least) in both directions from the transmitter sites. The photos are dramatic. Please check them out. 
 Noozhawk:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/several-radio-stations-still-off-the-air-after-storm-knocks-out-power-to-gibraltar-transmitter-site/">Several Radio Stations Still Off the Air After Storm Knocks Out Power to Gibraltar Transmitter Site</a> by <a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">Giana Magnoli</a>, by M<a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/author/giana-magnoli/">anaging Editor Giana Magnoli</a>, January 16, 2023 | 1:47 pm 
 
<p>From the Noozhawk story:</p>
 
 “… they’ve helicoptered up a new battery and 600 gallons of diesel fuel to the site’s backup generator, but they haven’t been able to get it to work.” I believe this is for lack of the expected banjo valve. (See below.) 
 “Southern California Edison, which supplies power to the transmission towers site, first reported an outage for the Gibraltar Road area at 2:34 a.m. Jan. 9, the day of the big storm.” That was Monday. At least some stations would have switched over to generator power then. 
 “Repair crews haven’t been sent to the site yet, according to the<a href="https://www.sce.com/outage-center/check-outage-status">&nbsp;SCE Outage Map</a>, but Franklin said he heard there could be new poles installed this week.” That’s John Franklin, who runs the whole Gibraltar Peak site. 
 “KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday.KCLU (102.3 FM) went off the air on Wednesday and was still off as of Monday. KJEE (92.9 FM) went down for several days but came back on the air on Thursday.” Note: it’s not on now—at least not on the radios I’m using. 
 “Santa Barbara County spokeswoman Kelsey Gerckens Buttitta said there are cell and radio station towers off Gibraltar Road that requires fuel to operate, and Gibraltar Road and East Camino Cielo Road are closed because of slides, debris and slipouts.” Fixing those roads will be very difficult and time-consuming. 
 
<p>The story also lists signals I reported off as of last night. One correction to that:&nbsp;K250BS/97.9, which relays KTMS/990, is on the air. This I presume is because it’s at the KTMS/KTYD site. All the signals from that site (which is up the road from Gibraltar Peak) are still up. I assume that’s either because they are fed electric power separately from Gibraltar Peak, or because they are running on generator power.</p>
<p>[Update: 11:40 AM Monday 16 January] In a private group discussion with broadcast engineers, I am gathering that a stretch of Gibraltar Road close to the Gibraltar Peak site has collapsed. The location is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7pNt3oethjD25xDW6">34°28’05.2″N 119°40’21″W,</a> not far from the road into the transmitter site. This is not the section marked closed by Santa Barbara County on its map <a href="https://www.countyofsb.org/2116/Road-Closures">here</a>. It is also not an easy fix, because it appears from one photograph I’ve seen (shared on a private group) that the land under the road slid away. It is also not the section where power lines to the site were knocked out. So we’re looking at three separate challenges here:</p>
 
 Restoring electrical service to Gibraltar Peak, and other places served by the same now-broken lines 
 Repairing Gibraltar Road in at least two places (the one marked on the county map and the one above) 
 Getting generators fueled and fixed. 
 
<p>On that last issue, I’m told that the site with most of the transmitters can be powered by a generator that awaits what is called a <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=banjo+valve">banjo valve</a>. The KDB facility requires propane, and stayed up longer than the others on the peak while its own supply held up.</p>
 
<p>Gibraltar Peak isn’t the highest landform overlooking Santa Barbara. At 2180 feet, it’s about halfway up the south flank of the Santa Ynez Mountains. But it does provide an excellent vantage for FM stations that want the least obstructed view of the market’s population. That’s why more local signals come from here than from any other site in the region.</p>
<p>Except for now: a time that began with the storm last Tuesday. That’s when power lines feeding the peak were broken by falling rocks that also closed Gibraltar road. Here is a list of signals that have been knocked off the air (and are still off, as of the latest edit, on Sunday, January 15 at 11:15PM):</p>
 
 88.7 KDRW, which has a studio in Santa Barbara, but mostly relays <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/">KCRW</a> from Santa Monica 
 89.5 KSBX, which relays <a href="https://www.kcbx.org/">KCBX</a> from San Luis Obispo* 
 89.9 K210AD, which relays <a href="https://www.kpcc.org/">KPCC</a> from Pasadena by way of KJAI from Ojai 
 90.3 KMRO-FM2, a booster for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMRO">KMRO</a> in Camarillo 
 91.5 K218CP, which relays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSN_International">KAWZ</a> from Twin Falls, Idaho 
 93.7 KDB, which relays KUSC from Los Angeles (down after running on generator power for 5 days) 
 96.9&nbsp;K245DD, which relays <a href="http://am1290kzsb.com/">KZSB</a>/1290 AM in Santa Barbara 
 97.9 K250BS, which relays <a href="http://www.ktms.com/">KTMS</a>/990 AM in Santa Barbara (and is on a KTMS tower, farther up the slope) 
 98.7 K254AH, which relays <a href="https://www.kpfk.org/">KPFK</a> from Los Angeles 
 102.3 KK272DT, the FM side of <a href="https://www.kclu.org/">KCLU</a>/1340 in Santa Barbara and KCLU/88.3 in Thousand Oaks 
 
<p>KTMS/990AM, KTYD/99.9FM, and K231CR/94.1, which relays <a href="https://oldschool1490.com/">KOSJ</a>/1490AM, are still on the air as of Sunday night at 11:15pm. Those are are a short distance farther up Gibraltar Road. (In the other box in the photo above.)</p>
<p>Here is a guide to substitute signals for some of the stations:</p>
 
 KCRW/KDRW can be heard on KCRU/89.1 from Oxnard (actually, Laguna Peak, in Pt. Magu State Park) 
 KDB can be heard on KDSC/91.1 from Thousand Oaks (actually off Sulphur Mountain Road, south of Ojai) 
 KCLU can be heard on 1340 AM from Santa Barbara and 88.3 FM from Thousand Oaks 
 KPCC can be heard on KJAI/89.5 from Ojai (also transmitting from Sulphur Mountai Road) 
 KSBX/KCBX can be heard on 90.9 from Solvang (actually Broadcast Peak) 
 KPFK can be heard on its home signal (biggest in the U.S.) from Mount Wilson in Los Angeles at 90.7 
 KZSB can be heard on 1290 AM from Santa Barbara 
 KMRO can still be heard on its Camarillo main transmitter on 90.3 
 
<p>The two AM signals (marked green in the top list above) are strong in town and most of the FMs are weak but listenable here and there. And all of them can be heard through their live streams online.</p>
<p>Published stories so far, other than this one:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.independent.com/2023/01/11/gibraltar-peak-towers-out-of-commission/">Gibraltar Peak Towers Out of Commission</a>, in the <a href="https://www.independent.com/">Santa Barbara Independent</a>. That story says two power poles were knocked out, as reported by John Franklin, who operates the whole transmitter site. (The story also kindly gives me credit for the photo there.) 
 <a href="https://www.kclu.org/kclus-102-3-fm-signal-in-santa-barbara-is-intermittently-off-the-air">KCLU’s 102.3 FM signal in Santa Barbara is intermittently off the air</a>, on the KCLU website. The image it shows is not of KCLU’s antenna on Gibraltar Peak. Mouse&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51196612298/in/album-72157719242709298/">over this photo</a> to see which of the many antennas on Gibraltar Peak radiate which signals (to the best of my knowledge, anyway). 
 
<p>The Independent says the site is a “relay” one. That’s correct in the sense that most of the stations there are satellites of bigger stations elsewhere. But KCLU is local to Santa Barbara (its anchor AM station is here), and the ratings reflect it. I wrote about those ratings a few years ago, in <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>. In that post, I noted that public radio is bigger in Santa Barbara than anywhere else in the country.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb591">ratings</a> (Spring of 2022), in % shares of total listening, are these:</p>
 
 KDB/93.9, classical music, relaying KUSC/91.1 from Los Angeles: 7.9% 
 KCLU/102.3 and 1340 in Santa Barbara (studios in Thousand Oaks), public broadcasting: 7.3% 
 KDRW/88.7 in Santa Barbara (main studio in Santa Monica, as KCRW/89.9): 4.6% 
 KPCC/89.9, relaying KJAI/89.5 and KPCC/89.3 in Pasadena: 1.3% 
 KSBX/89.5, relaying KCBX/90.1 from San Luis Obispo: 0.7% 
 
<p>Total: 21.8%.</p>
<p>That means more than a fifth of all radio listening in Santa Barbara is to noncommercial and public radio.</p>
<p>And, of all those stations, only KDB/KUSC and KCLU-AM are on the air right now.</p>
<p>By the way, when I check to see how public broadcasting is doing in other markets, nothing is close. Santa Barbara still kicks ass. I think that’s an interesting story, and I haven’t seen anyone report on it, other than here.</p>
 
<p>*Turns out KSBX is off the air permanently, after losing a coverage battle with KPBS/89.5 in San Diego. On December 29, they published a story in print and sound titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kcbx.org/health-science-and-technology/2022-12-29/why-is-89-5-ksbx-off-the-air-the-answer-is-in-the-atmosphere">Why is 89.5 KSBX off the air? The answer is in the atmosphere.</a>&nbsp;They blame <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_propagation#Tropospheric_ducting">tropospheric ducting</a>, which much of the time makes KPBS come in like a local signal. Also, even though KPBS’s transmitter on Soledad Mountain (really more of a hill) above the coast at La Jolla is more than 200 miles away, it does pump out 26,000 watts, while KCBX puts out only 50 watts—and less in some directions. Though the story doesn’t mention it, KJAI, the KPCC relay on 89.5 for Ojai, is audible in Santa Barbara if nothing else is there. So that also didn’t help. By the way, I’m almost certain that the antenna identified as KSBX’s in the story’s photo (which is also one of mine) is actually for KMRO-2. KSBX’s is the one on the left in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/51197177169/in/album-72157719242709298/">this photo here</a>.</p>

<p>Most of California has just two seasons: rain and fire. Rain is another name for Winter, and it peaks in January. In most years, January in&nbsp;California isn’t any more wet than, say, New York, Miami or Chicago.&nbsp;But every few years California gets monsoons. Big ones. This is one of those years.</p>
<p>The eighteen gallon storage tub in our yard is sixteen inches deep and serves as a rain gauge:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday morning it was less than half full. While it gathered rain, our devices blasted out alerts with instructions like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>So we stayed home and watched the Web tell us how the drought was ending:</p>
<p><a href="https://rain.cosbpw.net/sensor/?site_id=105&amp;site=70729dd9-97d4-430a-9271-7b6c195b49be&amp;device_id=9&amp;device=e1b323bd-c4c6-4ea4-b9d1-c775a97ce915"></a></p>
<p>Wasn’t long ago that Lake Cachuna was at 7%.</p>
<p>So that’s good news. The bad news is about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/roads-turn-to-rivers-as-storms-drench-california-claiming-lives-and-leaving-many-in-the-dark/ar-AA16aly9">floods</a>, <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/california-ocean-piers-collapse-waves-rise-to-35-feet/">ruined piers and wharfs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/city-of-fallen-trees-storm-damage-visible-across-sacramento/ar-AA16amrh">downed trees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/over-135k-people-are-without-power-from-california-storm-see-where-its-hit-the-most/ar-AA16bnwa">power outages</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/levee-breaches-cause-additional-flooding-in-monterey-county-new-evacuations-ordered/">levee breaches</a>. The usual.</p>
<p>It should help to remember that the geology on both coasts is temporary and improvisational. The East Coast south of New England and Long Island (where coastal landforms were mostly dumped there or scraped bare by glaciers in the geologic yesterday) is a stretch of barrier islands that are essentially dunes shifted by storms. Same goes for the Gulf Coast. The West Coast looks more solid, with hills and mountains directly facing the sea. But Pacific storms in Winter routinely feature waves high as houses, pounding against the shores and sea cliffs.</p>
<p>Looking up the coast from Tijuana, within a few hundred years Coronado and Point Loma in San Diego, La Jolla, all the clifftop towns up the coast to Dana Point and Laguna, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Malibu and Point Dume, Carpinteria, the Santa Barbara Mesa and Hope Ranch, all of Isla Vista and UCSB, Pismo and Avila Beaches, all of Big Sur and the Pacific Coast Highway there, Carmel and the Monterey Peninsula, Aptos, Capitola and Santa Cruz, Davenport, Half Moon Bay, Pacifica, the headlands of San Francisco, Muir and Stimson Beaches and Bolinas in Marin, Fort Bragg in Mendicino County, and Crescent City in Humbolt—all in California—will be eaten away partially or entirely by weather and waves. Earthquakes will also weigh in.</p>
<p>The photo up top is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita,_California">La Conchita</a>, a stupidly located town on the South Coast, west of Ventura, four days after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Conchita_landslides#2005_La_Conchita_landslide">landslide in 2005</a> took out 13 homes and killed 10 people. All the land above town is a pile of former and future landslides, sure to slide again when the ground is saturated with water. Such as now or soon.</p>
<p>So that’s a long view. For one that spans the next week, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windy.com/">windy.com</a>&nbsp;and slide the elevation up to FL (flight level) 340 (34000 feet):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?200h,41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>That yellow river of wind is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream">jet stream</a> hauling serious ass straight across the Pacific and into California. Jet streams are why the headwinds and tailwinds you see on seat-back displays showing flight progress on planes often say 100mph or more. Look at Windy before you fly coast to coast or overseas, and you can guess what the flight path will be. You can also see why it may take as little as five hours to get from Dulles to Heathrow, or more than seven hours to come back by a route that touches the Arctic Circle. Your plane is riding, fighting or circumventing high altitude winds that have huge influences on the weather below.</p>
<p>To see how, drop Windy down to the surface:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windy.com/?41.043,-171.585,4"></a></p>
<p>Those eddies alongside the jet stream are low pressure centers full of the moisture and wind we call storms. They spin along the sides of the jet stream the way dust devils twist up along the sides of highways full of passing trucks. Those two storm centers are spinning toward California and will bring more wind and rain.</p>
<p>Beside the sure damage those will bring, there will be two benefits. One is that California will be as green as Ireland for a few months. The other is that wildflowers will bloom all over the place.</p>
<p>The Death Valley folks are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/wildflower-seasons.htm">hedging their bet</a>, but I’d put money on a nice bloom this Spring. Watch for it.</p>
<p>Bonus link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/northern-california/underground-norcal/">There’s An Underground City Beneath Sacramento In Northern California That Most People Don’t Know About</a>. Excerpt: “…Old Sacramento was built up during the time of the gold rush, but the frequent flooding of this area obliterated its first level time and time again, until finally, the city abandoned that level altogether. It’s both fascinating and creepy to tour the abandoned level…”</p>

<p>Summary: The following is an excerpt from my upcoming book, Learning Digital Identity, which will be available January 2023.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf092e8f-f95e-49e9-a2f3-59a96cdf06f4_1954x967.jpeg">    </a> <p>The family therapist Salvador Minuchin <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674292367/technometria-20">declared</a>, "The human experience of identity has two elements: a sense of belonging and a sense of being separate." This is as good a description of digital identity as it is of our psychological identity. A digital identity contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing but also contains information about the subject's relationships to other entities.</p><p>To see an example of this, consider the data record that represents your car, stored somewhere in your state or country's computers. This record, commonly called a title, contains a vehicle identification number (VIN) that uniquely identifies the car to which it belongs. In addition, it contains other attributes of the car such as year, make, model, and color. The title also contains relationships: most notably, the title relates the vehicle to a person who owns it. In many places, the title is also a historical document, because it identifies every owner of the car from the time it was made, as well as whether it's been in a flood or otherwise salvaged.</p><p>While fields as diverse as philosophy, commerce, and technology define identity, most are not helpful in building, managing, and using digital identity systems. Instead, we need to define identity functionally, in a way that provides hooks for us to use in making decisions and thinking about problems that arise in digital identity.</p><p>Joe Andrieu, principal at Legendary Requirements, <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">writes</a> that "identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things. Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context." This definition is my favorite because it has proven useful over the years in thinking through thorny identity issues.</p><p>The identity record for a car includes attributes that the system uses to recognize it: in this case, the VIN. The title also includes attributes that are useful to people and organizations who care about (that is, need to respond to) the car, including the owner, the state, and potential buyers. The government runs a system for managing titles that is used to create, manage, transfer, and govern vehicles (or, in Andrieu's formulation, remember them). The system is designed to achieve its primary goal (to record valuable property that the state has an interest in taxing and regulating) and secondary goals (protecting potential buyers and creating a way to prove ownership).</p><p>Digital identity management consists of processes for creating, managing, using, and eventually destroying digital records, like the one that contains your car title. These records might identify a person, a car, a computer, a piece of land, or almost anything else. Sometimes they are created simply for inventory purposes, but the more interesting ones are created with other purposes in mind: allowing or denying access to a building, the creation of a file, the transfer of funds, and so on. These relationships and the authorized actions associated with them make digital identities useful, valuable, and sometimes difficult to manage.</p>   <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/loneprimate/300432532">Plate - WHOS_CAR</a> from Lone Primate (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</a>)</p><p>Tags: <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/identity">identity</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/ldid">ldid</a></p>

   Mastodon is not the fediverse and in my check_webfinger! post, I’m afraid I made that assumption.  In particular, I concluded 

 
   So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.

  <p>Mastodon is not the fediverse and in my <a href="https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2022/12/23/check_webfinger/">check_webfinger!</a> post, I’m afraid I made that assumption.  In particular, I concluded</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, from the perspective of mastodon, the domain component of your identifier you are known as is determined by which domain serves your actor document rather than the domain serving the original “well known” webfinger document.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is not necessarily true if you consider the fediverse outside of Mastodon.</p>

<p>Instead, it seems that I should have said that the domain component of your identifier is determined by the domain component of the subject field returned in the webfinger response from the domain that serves your actor document when mastodon makes its 2nd webfinger request which is done in the <a href="https://github.com/herestomwiththeweather/mastodon/blob/main/app/services/activitypub/fetch_remote_actor_service.rb#L48">check_webfinger!</a> method.</p>

  <code>  def check_webfinger!
    webfinger                            = webfinger!("acct:#{@username}@#{@domain}")
    confirmed_username, confirmed_domain = split_acct(webfinger.subject)
</code> 
 

<p>In the code above, the @domain passed to webfinger! is the domain of the server providing the activitypub actor document but the confirmed_domain can be different (e.g. your personal domain) if your original “well known” webfinger document was not pointing to a Mastodon server for providing the actor document.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you have a static personal website, it is not necessary to also host the actor document there as long as the fediverse node providing the actor document is smart enough to provide your personal domain in the subject when mastodon makes a webfinger call to it.  A caveat is that such a fediverse node accomodating personal domains would not be able to distinguish between bob@a.com and bob@b.com when mastodon webfingers server.com for bob@server.com.</p>

  A quick tip for speeding up Perl builds in GitHub workflows by caching dependencies.

<p>I’ve spent quite a few hours evenings and weekends recently building out a
comprehensive suite of <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/actions">GitHub Actions for Sqitch</a>. They cover a dozen versions
of Perl, nearly 70 database versions amongst nine database engines, plus a
coverage test and a release workflow. A pull request can expect over 100 actions
to run. Each build requires over 100 direct dependencies, plus all their
dependencies. Installing them for every build would make any given run
untenable.</p>
<p>Happily, GitHub Actions include a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows" title="GitHub Actions: “Caching dependencies to speed up workflows”">caching feature</a>, and thanks to a
<a href="https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-setup-perl/pull/892">recent improvement to shogo82148/actions-setup-perl</a>,
it’s quite easy to use in a version-independent way. Here’s an example:</p>
  <code>name: Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  OS:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu, macos, windows ]
        perl: [ 'latest', '5.34', '5.32', '5.30', '5.28' ]
    name: Perl ${{ matrix.perl }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Perl
        id: perl
        uses: shogo82148/actions-setup-perl@v1
        with: { perl-version: "${{ matrix.perl }}" }
      - name: Cache CPAN Modules
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: local
          key: perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: cpm install --verbose --show-build-log-on-failure --no-test --cpanfile cpanfile
      - name: Run Tests
        env: { PERL5LIB: "${{ github.workspace }}/local/lib/perl5" }
        run: prove -lrj4
</code>  <p>This workflow tests every permutation of OS and Perl version specified in
<code>jobs.OS.strategy.matrix</code>, resulting in 15 jobs. The <code>runs-on</code> value determines
the OS, while the <code>steps</code> section defines steps for each permutation. Let’s take
each step in turn:</p>
 
 “Checkout Source” checks the project out of GitHub. Pretty much required for
any project. 
 “Setup Perl” sets up the version of Perl using the value from the matrix.
Note the <code>id</code> key set to <code>perl</code>, used in the next step. 
 “Cache CPAN Modules” uses the <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">cache action</a> to cache the directory named
<code>local</code> with the key <code>perl-${{ steps.perl.outputs.perl-hash }}</code>. The key
lets us keep different versions of the <code>local</code> directory based on a unique
key. Here we’ve used the <code>perl-hash</code> output from the <code>perl</code> step defined
above. The <code>actions-setup-perl</code> action outputs this value, which contains a
hash of the output of <code>perl -V</code>, so we’re tying the cache to a very specific
version and build of Perl. This is important since compiled modules are not
compatible across major versions of Perl. 
 “Install Dependencies” uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-cpm/view/script/cpm" title="cpm - a fast CPAN module installer"><code>cpm</code></a> to quickly install Perl dependencies. By
default, it puts them into the <code>local</code> subdirectory of the current directory
— just where we configured the cache. On the first run for a given OS and
Perl version, it will install all the dependencies. But on subsequent runs
it will find the dependencies already present, thank to the cache, and
quickly exit, reporting “All requirements are satisfied.” In <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/runs/4275487924?check_suite_focus=true">this Sqitch
job</a>, it takes less than a second. 
 “Run Tests” runs the tests that require the dependencies. It requires the
<code>PERL5LIB</code> environment variable to point to the location of our cached
dependencies. 
 
<p>That’s the whole deal. The first run will be the slowest, depending on the
number of dependencies, but subsequent runs will be much faster, up to the
seven-day caching period. For a complex project like Sqitch, which uses the same
OS and Perl version for most of its actions, this results in a tremendous build
time savings. CI configurations we’ve used in the past often took an hour or
more to run. Today, most builds take only a few minutes to test, with longer
times determined not by dependency installation but by container and database
latency.</p>

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Before embarking upon this project, we spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter: sustainably, affordably and with as few third party services as possible, while I learn the use of various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and what we learn here could be of use in any conceivable domain.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awesome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>I saved some useful guides along that path in my <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a></p>

<p>Static Websites are great for security and require minimal infrastructure, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I’m not currently using these forms, because I didn’t have the energy to maintain, verses the use they were getting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server. Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form 

   <code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form class="staticman" method="POST" action="https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[redirect]" type="hidden" value="https://infominer.xyz/subscribed"&gt;
    &lt;input name="options[slug]" type="hidden" value="infohub"&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[name]" type="text" placeholder="Name (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[email]" type="email" placeholder="Email"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="fields[message]" type="text" placeholder="Areas of Interest (optional)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input name="links" type="hidden" placeholder="links"&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code>   
 The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo 

   <code>subscribe:
  allowedFields: ["name", "email", "message"]
  allowedOrigins: ["infominer.xyz","identosphere.net"]
  branch: "master"
  commitMessage: "New subscriber: {fields.name}"
  filename: "subscribe-{@timestamp}"

  path: "{options.slug}" 
  requiredFields: ["email"]
</code>   

<p>It seems to be <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/366#issuecomment-726016008">struggling with GitHub’s recent move</a> to change the name of your default branch from master to main (for new repositories). So, unfortunately, I had to re-create a master branch to get it running.</p>

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should mention that websites typically generate a machine readable copy of your blog in what’s called an RSS feed.</p>

<p>This allows anyone to follow your content in a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually.</p>

<p>Pluto Feed reader works just like a podcast app, but builds a simple webpage from the feeds added to it (or can be integrated with a Jekyll template).</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your news feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

   <code>name: Build BlogCatcher

  schedule:
    # This action runs 4x a day.
    - cron:  '0/60 */4 * * *'

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>After we got these pages up and running, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every week, we get browse the [BlogCatcher]identosphere.net), and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://newsletter.identosphere.net/">newsletter.identosphere.net</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a href="https://justatheory.com/2020/06/test-extensions-with-github-actions/" title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

 <code>name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events matching v1.0, v20.15.10, etc.
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release on GitHub and PGXN
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    env:
      # Required to create GitHub release and upload the bundle.
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Bundle the Release
      id: bundle
      run: pgxn-bundle
    - name: Release on PGXN
      env:
        # Required to release on PGXN.
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
      run: pgxn-release
    - name: Create GitHub Release
      id: release
      uses: actions/create-release@v1
      with:
        tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
        release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
        body: |
          Changes in this Release
          - First Change
          - Second Change          
    - name: Upload Release Asset
      uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
      with:
        # Reference the upload URL and bundle name from previous steps.
        upload_url: ${{ steps.release.outputs.upload_url }}
        asset_path: ./${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should be appended to the
<code>$GITHUB_OUTPUT</code> file like this, with <code>$filename</code> representing the name of
the release file, usually <code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>echo bundle=$filename &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.

<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1

</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15

22

</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>I became captivated with computers in the early-mid ’90s, as the world wide web began to reach the consumer market. I was a total computer nerd, but never took it seriously.</p>

<p>I had no conception of how the world would be transformed, and ultimately decided that technology was simply one of many potential material pursuits. I took off to gather experience and pursue meaning, which kept me apart from the tech I loved, for most of the time.</p>

<p></p>

 After years bereft of meaningful direction, I needed a re-boot. 

<p>Finding safe haven where I could freely pursue a new direction and self-education. While I had been paying scant attention to the broader cultural movements or the advance of personal computing, the world had become transformed.</p>

<p>Feeling the pain of lost opportunities, I quickly realized I could have done almost anything if I had gotten serious about tech as a kid, I could have built a much nicer life for myself by that point.</p>

<p>Yet, I could see that the world has only begun its digital transformation, and opportunity abounds.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved to read and consume information, so I began writing freelance, in order to make some money while educating myself. If I could get paid to read, I thought… Now, that would be the ticket!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hadn’t spent much time with the written word in a while, could barely keep my eyes focused on the screen, and I didn’t know anything about the modern tech landscape.</p>
</blockquote>

 Learn some markdown, and get blogging! 

<p>My style was rough, to start, but my dedication to internet search and relating accurate and precise information landed me some content gigs related to Bitcoin and data science.</p>

<p>Fed up with all the empty content dominating search results, I started keeping track of useful information. I used only a fraction of my background research for the articles I was writing, I thought I might collaborate with other information aggregators.</p>

<p>I wanted to make lists for various histories surrounding my topics of interest, since it’s a lot easier to understand anything if you can see where it came from and how it developed. Somewhere along the line, I realized I love information discovery and keeping track of fast moving information streams a lot more than I like writing.</p>

 Curated Lists: the Gold of the Internet 

<p>Coming upon a list of relevant materials someone else already sorted for me, that’s even better than finding a single source. Why write an article when I could make endless lists which could become a foundation for a variety of articles?</p>

<p>Then I thought “what if I could map out the various systems of information surrounding my subjects of interest.” This is the biggest challenge in tech that hardly anyone is working on. Sure plenty trying to write algorithms to save themselves the work of curation, but no-one is really tackling the problem head on.</p>

<p>Automation is just eating up jobs left and right, while curation is a purely human activity. You can augment curation, but you can’t automate it. You need a human to determine the value of a given resource in relation to the rest.</p>

<p>I see internet research and digital curation as making up a potentially massive portion of the future labor markets. This huge sector of the economy just waiting to transform the world.</p>

 I’d like to nurture that potential and help to create that reality! 

<blockquote>
  <p>A bigger wikipedia isn’t the answer, but a wikipedia full of curated lists might be a step in the right direction.</p>

  Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose. After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of update

<p>In the Summer of 2018, I had a seemingly foolish idea. I decided that I should try and organize all the types of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the channels of a discord server.</p>

<p>Recognizing the collaborative potential for Discord Chat, during the ICO boom in 2017, I was inspired to begin collecting information about blockchain in the channels of a Discord Server dedicated for that purpose.</p>

<p>After a year or so working relentlessly on whatever was in front of me at a given moment, its time to pause, reflect, and make a way for anyone following my work to be notified of updates.</p>

<p></p>

 A reasonably comprehensive grasp 

<p>A grasp of so many subjects is required for a reasonably comprehensive understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrency and relevant tech trends; eventually I broke my inquiry apart into multiple categories which spread across a dozen discord organizations with associated twitter accounts.</p>

<p>I learned to follow the professionals and organizations working in each field, using the retweet button to bookmark interesting posts, whose content I could review later with a fresh set of eyes for its substance and relevance.</p>

<p>I never assumed that I could actually accomplish the task, but I felt it was important to act and believe as though it was possible.</p>

<p>While I grew up a total computer nerd, I drifted from that early passion for many years, and only got serious about tech, more recently.</p>

<p>I have had quite a steep learning curve trying to catch up, but I paired that with an infinite curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>

 A Collaborative Workflow? 

<p>The idea that I could organize the varieties of information surrounding Bitcoin, in a comprehensive fashion, still seems foolish. Then again, it doesn’t seen quite so foolish as it did, when I began.</p>

<p>It’s always been my intent for these resources to be collaborative, and they have been open for such from the beginning.</p>

<p>While I’ve received assistance, in one form or another from a handful of contributors, the work has primarily been my own. I will admit that I’ve not always felt very social, or acted as an effective organizer.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’m pretty sure Discord isn’t the ideal venue for this work.</p>

 FOSS Ideals vs Pragmatism 

<p>The irony of a dependence on discord and twitter while laying a foundation for a Free and Open Source (FOSS) principled collaborative curation platform is not lost on me.</p>

<p>Discord was a matter of convenience, Twitter has played an essential component of my education, and is a primary public sphere for discourse on most of the subjects I’ve been studying.</p>

<p>Despite it’s shortcomings, there is plenty of value to be gained from studying various fields through the lense of Twitter.</p>

 Moving Forward 

<p>It’s time to move forward. I’d like to say I’m moving to 100% sovereign solutions, However, I’m not quite there yet. I have no definite answers, except that I’ll be restructuring this information into markdown and then structured data.</p>

<p>I’m just getting to know google sheets, and decided I should get to know the GSuite a little better while searching for a reasonable replacement.</p>

<p>Spreadsheets are extensible, and make an ideal stepping stone between unordered lists and a variety of applications.</p>

<p>I’ve also begun to include Notion as an integral component of my workflow. It allows me to easily transform html into markdown, which is perfect from all the enriched content I’ve been pulling from the social media.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think a wiki of curated lists is a solid direction to aim towards.</p>

<p></p>

 Taking a Break from Socials 

<p>This post is meant to provide an update, since I’m taking a break from social media.</p>

<p>I have just been going full blast, trying to make up for lost time. Now its time for me to reassess my workflow, and figure out what is the best path forward.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m backing off from my day to day curation, so I can organize what I’ve got, learn some new tools, and take it all to the next level.</p>

  I've found myself enthralled by intoxicating ecosystems of knowledge surrounding Bitcoin. Self-educated, I began studying related histories: Cryptography, Programming, Digital Cash; while developing my technical skills with freelance work, and building small websites on related subjects.

<p>I’ve found myself enthralled by the intoxicating streams of information surrounding Bitcoin, in 2017. I began studying related histories: Cryptography, Programming, Digital Cash; while developing my technical skills with freelance work, and building small websites on related subjects.</p>

<p>Studying history is my antidote to the exceeding complexity of life. While Bitcoin and its network are rather complex to wrap your head around, learning about the history of cryptography makes it a lot easier.</p>

<p>If you proceed to study the history of other relevant subjects: from the global economy, wall street, and the creation of money; to the timeline and basic details surrounding the creation of various programming languages, little by little, Bitcoin becomes much easier to digest.</p>

 A few markdown files 

<p>This project began as a few markdown files in my first github repository, that gradually evolved into my homepage. I needed space for my endless curiosity to grow, and splitting the content off to multiple websites also helped me to develop my skills.</p>

<p>At each step I have used my interests to fuel my education and learned many difficult things for the ability share knowledge I’ve gathered, and increase my value in this rapidly evolving digital sphere.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now all of my content, and forked repositories, have become divided between a variety of GitHub Organizations and my user account. This makes it easy to publish websites built from multiple custom domains, without the need to rent server space for each of them.</p>

 I will keep building! 

<p>I’ve always hoped that I might find others interested in helping to create these resources, but appreciate that others may prefer to quietly gather resources for their own projects, and it could always get easier to contribute.</p>

<p>Either way, I like moving around information, organizing it in different ways, expanding my reach in the digital sphere, and experimenting with different ways of sharing it.</p>

<p>These projects have tended to multiply and then contract, in an iterative fashion, and over time the ideal structure of these cornerstones have beginning to emerge.</p>

 The transformation 

<p>This page is meant to be a top level index of projects I’m working on, transformed from a rough list of links beginning to explore the above subjects.</p>

<p>Of course, my homepage is always the last to know about anything, and I’m not always working directly on these projects.</p>

<p>That said, whenever there are significant updates, I am making efforts to keep this content as current and relevant to my work as possible.</p>

  The inspiration for my work in digital identity might easily trace back to The Original Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by Markus Sabadello. /peacekeeper/blockchain-identity I leaned heavily on that resource when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is among my earliest posts, and came at a time when I first began to think about how can this project evolve into the future, beyond lists of links gathered and organized by hand?</p>

 Knowledge Defies Categorization 

<p>Part of the challenge I encountered is that information wont be neatly divided into categories. Fields of knowledge are all overlapping, and a given post will fit within multiple categories.</p>

<p>What I came to understand is that I should use some type of structured data, so that I required only a single entry of an item in the data file, for it to be featured within multiple categories, once the finished product was rendered.</p>

 Infominer meets Structured Data 

<p>When I began, I didn’t really know much about types of data.</p>

<p>I decided upon TOML because it’s user-friendly, and easy to read. Once data is structured in this way, it can be transformed to JSON, or whichever format works best for a given project.</p>

<p>This page has two toml files from <a href="https://github.com/infominer33/SourceCrypto">infominer33/SourceCrypto</a> embedded into it, marking a beginning in my effort to enhance my curation and publishing through automation.</p>

<p>I’ve always been good with a computer, but this was entering me into an entirely new domain. At the time of publication is when I began learning how to publish websites and use developers tools.</p>

 Future Direction 

 
   some simple way to check <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">didecentral.github.io</a> against these lists, and output a list of links that have yet to be included. 
   an app that will take a list of links as the input and output a toml file with title\description automatically populated based on metadata.. 
 

<p>(Crossing out these items, as now I can manage these tasks with python)</p>

<p>I suppose it would make the most sense to prioritize those objectives, rather than constructing everything by hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scraping a list of links from wherever I want is simple.. so really the two things are checking a list of links against a toml file(s), outputting any links not found in the db already. Another script to construct a toml file grabbing metadata.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time I didn’t come to the logical conclusion of how easy it could have been to generate content based on the files embedded here. I was just getting in way over my head, and was hopeful someone coder would catch my enthusiasm and make the code for me.</p>

<p>Ultimately it has worked out fine and in 2023, finally coming around to this idea: full-circle.</p>

 Algorithmic tagging 

<blockquote>
  <p>what’s really missing is tagging all of these resources by authors, co-authors, references/citations</p>

  <p>once this is done, topical tags can be derived algorithmically<br>
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.8960&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Enabling Author-Centric Ranking of Web Content</a> - @MaciekLaskus on twitter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once I get the infrastructure in place that will be next on my list. Even simply downloading all of the links and generating a keyword list for each could get us a long way.</p>

 Blockchain Identity - Data 

<p>The inspiration for my work in digital identity might easily trace back to The Original Blockchain Identity list on GitHub, originally compiled by <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/">Markus Sabadello</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity">/peacekeeper/blockchain-identity</a> 
 

<p>I leaned heavily on that resource when first learning about decentralized identity and blockchain.</p>

<p>After making some progress on decentralized-id.com, I went back over that whole repository, fixing any broken links and pulling in relevant data, at the end of 2018.</p>
