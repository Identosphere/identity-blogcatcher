<p>みなさん、フランスの２０世紀の作曲家、ダマーズの「フルート、オーボエ、クラリネットとピアノのための四重奏」をご存知でしょうか？いかにもフランスという洒脱な曲です。リンクを貼ったのは二楽章ですが、ダマーズはこれに限らず第二楽章に楽しいものがおおいです。</p>



<p>ダマーズはコルトーの弟子で、フォーレのノクチュルヌとバルカローレの全曲録音を最初にした人でもあります。</p>



<p>新古典主義の作曲だったので20世紀にはあまり評価されていませんでしたが、最近評価が上がってきて録音も手に入るようになってきています。いかにもフランス的。プーランクが好きだったらダマーズも好きだと思います。</p>

<p>I remember well exactly when I decided not to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">bitcoin</a>. It was on July 26, 2009, after I finished driving back home to Arlington, Mass, after dropping off my kid at summer camp in Vermont. I had heard a story about it on the radio that convinced me that now was the time to put $100 into something new that would surely become Something Big.</p>
<p>But trying to figure out how to do it took too much trouble, and my office in the attic was too hot, so I didn’t. Also, at the time, the price was $0. Easy to rationalize not buying a non-something that’s worth nothing.</p>
<p>So let’s say I made the move when it hit $1, which I think was in 2011. That would have been $100 for 100 bitcoin, which at this minute&nbsp;are worth $56101.85 apiece. A hundred of those are now $5,610,185. And what if I had paid the 1¢ or less a bitcoin would have been in July, 2009? You move the decimal point while I shake my head.</p>
<p>So now we have NFTs. What do you think I should do? Or anybody? Serious question.</p>

<p>On March 9, The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* hosted presentations from Xavier Vale, Product Manager for Validated ID and Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Director of Astrea on eIDAS and Self Sovereign Identity.  The presentations covered the technical, legal and business dimensions of bridging between eIDAS and SSI concepts and increasing the value and usability of digital identity in the European model.</p><p>A key component of the Digital Europe architecture is the existence of a trusted and secure digital identity infrastructure.  This journey was started in 2014 with the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.  As has been discussed in previous Vienna Digital Identity Meetups, a high assurance digital identity is the key piece connecting the physical and digital worlds, and this piece was not included in the initial creation of our digital world.</p><p>Why then is eIDAS v1 not seen as a success?  There are many reasons; from parts of the regulation that focused or constrained its use into the public sphere only, to the lack of total coverage across all of the EU.  Likely the key missing piece was that the cultural climate was not yet ripe and the state of digital identity was really not ready.  Too many technical problems were yet to be solved. Without these elements the realized state of eIDAS should not be unexpected.  All this said, eIDAS v1 laid very important groundwork and created an environment to gather important learnings to allow eIDAS v2 to realize the hoped for levels of success and adoption.</p><p>Validated ID has been developing a eIDAS - ESSIF bridge bringing the eIDAS trust seals to Verifiable Credentials.  As a  Qualified Trust Service Provider under the eIDAS, Validated ID has been offering trust services to customers across Europe since 2012.  Xavier presented this current work and provides a detailed explanation on how the eIDAS-SSI bridge applies the qualified electronic seals to Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Dr. Alamillo further clarified the importance of the eIDAS-SSI Bridge in his presentation on SSI in the eIDAS Regulation.  When a Qualified Electronic Seal is applied to a Verifiable Credential the combined document becomes a legal document with cross border legal value within the EU.  Currently in an identity context, eIDAS is the European wide identity meta system, providing the framework for the 27 nation states of the EU to operate as a very large federated identity network.  However, the point was raised the in the current ongoing revision of the eIDAS regulation, it is possible that handling of electronic identification may be changed from a ‘connecting of services’ to a new trust service.</p><p></p><p>To listen to a recording of the event please check out the link: <a href="https://vimeo.com/522501200">https://vimeo.com/522501200</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:04:00 - Xavier Vale, Validated ID </p>  <p>0:34:00 - Questions </p>  <p>0:42:00 - Dr. Ignacio Alamillo, Astrea </p>  <p>1:18:00 - Questions </p>  <p>1:28:00 - Wrap-up &amp; Upcoming Events  </p>  <p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events. </p><p>If interested in getting notifications of upcoming events please join the event group at: https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/ </p><p>*The Vienna Digital Identity Meetup is hosted by The Dingle Group and is focused on educating business, societal, legal and technologists on the new opportunities that arise with  a high assurance digital identity created by the reduction risk and strengthened provenance. We meet on the 4th Monday of every month, in person (when permitted) in Vienna and online on Zoom. Connecting and educating across borders and oceans.</p>

<p>For 20 bucks or less, nowadays, you can buy an extra-wide convex mirror that clips onto your car’s existing rear-view mirror. We just tried one for the first time, and I’m pretty sure it’s a keeper. These gadgets claim to eliminate blind spots, and this one absolutely does. Driving down 101, I counted three seconds as a car passed through my driver’s-side blind spot. That’s a long time when you’re going 70 miles per hour; during that whole time I could see that passing car in the extended mirror.</p>
<p>Precious few gadgets spark joy for me. This one had me at hello. Not having to turn your head, avoiding the risk of not turning your head — these are huge benefits, quite possibly life-savers. For 20 bucks!</p>
<p>It got even better. As darkness fell, we wondered how it would handle approaching headlights. It’s not adjustable like the stock mirror, but that turns out not to be a problem. The mirror dims those headlights so they’re easy to look at. The same lights in the side mirrors are blinding by comparison.</p>
<p>I’ve been driving more than 40 years. This expanded view could have been made available at any point along the way. There’s nothing electronic or digital. It’s just a better idea that combines existing ingredients in a new way. That pretty much sums up my own approach to product development.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the metaphor. Seeing around corners is a superpower I’ve always wanted. I used to love taking photos with the fisheye lens on my dad’s 35mm Exacta, now I love making panoramic views with my phone. I hate being blindsided, on the road and in life, by things I can’t see coming. I hate narrow-mindedness, and always reach for a wider view.</p>
<p>I’ll never overcome all my blind spots but it’s nice to chip away at them. After today, there will be several fewer to contend with.</p>

  For a few years now, T-Mobile has been branding itself the “un-carrier,” saying&nbsp;it’s “synonymous with 100% customer commitment.” Credit where due: we switched from AT&amp;T a few years ago because T-Mobile, alone among U.S. carriers at the time, gave customers a nice cheap unlimited data plan for traveling outside the country.

<p>For a few years now, T-Mobile has been branding itself the “un-carrier,” <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/our-story/un-carrier-history">saying</a>&nbsp;it’s “synonymous with 100% customer commitment.” Credit where due: we switched from AT&amp;T a few years ago because T-Mobile, alone among U.S. carriers at the time, gave customers a nice cheap unlimited data plan for traveling outside the country.</p>
<p>But now comes <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803">this story</a> in the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p>T-Mobile to Step Up Ad Targeting of Cellphone Customers<br>
Wireless carrier tells subscribers it could share their masked browsing, app data and online activity with advertisers unless they opt out</p>
<p>Talk about jumping on a bandwagon sinking in quicksand. Lawmakers in Europe (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>), California (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act">CCPA</a>) and elsewhere have been doing their best to make this kind of thing illegal, or at least difficult. Worse, it should now be clear that it not only sucks at its purpose, but customers hate it. A lot.</p>
<p>I just counted, and all 94 responses in the “conversation” under that piece are disapproving of this move by T-Mobile. I just copied them over and compressed out some extraneous stuff. Here ya go:</p>
<p>“Terrible decision by T-Mobile. Nobody ever says “I want more targeted advertising,” unless they are in the ad business. &nbsp;Time to shop for a new carrier – it’s not like their service was stellar.”</p>
<p>“A disappointing development for a carrier which made its name by shaking up the big carriers with their overpriced plans.”</p>
<p>“Just an unbelievable break in trust!”</p>
<p>“Here’s an idea for you, Verizon. Automatically opt people into accepting a break on their phone bill in exchange for the money you make selling their data.”</p>
<p>“You want to make money on selling customer’s private information? Fine – but in turn, don’t charge your customers for generating that profitable information.”</p>
<p>“Data revenue sharing is coming. If you use my data, you will have to share the revenue with me.”</p>
<p>“Another reason to never switch to T-Mobile.”</p>
<p>“Kudos to WSJ for providing links on how to opt-out!”</p>
<p>“Just another disappointment from T-Mobile.&nbsp; I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>
<p>“We were supposed to be controlled by the government.”</p>
<p>“How crazy is it that we are having data shared for service we&nbsp; PAY for? You might expect it on services that we don’t, as a kind of ‘exchange.'”</p>
<p>“WSJ just earned their subscription fee. Wouldn’t have known about this, or taken action without this story. Toggled it off on my phone, and then sent everyone I know on T Mobile the details on how to protect themselves.”</p>
<p>“Just finished an Online Chat with their customer service dept….’Rest assured, your data is safe with T-Mobile’…no, no it isn’t.&nbsp; They may drop me as a customer since I sent links to the CCPA, the recent VA privacy law and a link to this article.&nbsp; And just&nbsp; to make sure the agent could read it – I sent the highlights too.&nbsp; the response – ‘Your data is safe….’&nbsp; Clueless, absolutely clueless.”</p>
<p>“As soon as I heard this, I went in and turned off tracking.&nbsp; Also, when I get advertising that is clearly targeted (sometimes pretty easy to tell) I make a mental note to never buy or use the product or service advertised if I can avoid it.&nbsp; Do others think the same?”</p>
<p>“Come on Congress, pass a law requiring any business or non-profit that wants to share your data with others to require it’s customers to ‘opt-in’. We should(n’t) have to ‘opt-out’ to prevent them from doing so, it should be the other way around. Only exception is them sharing data with the government and that there should be laws that limit what can be shared with the government and under what circumstances.”</p>
<p>“There must be massive amounts of money to be made in tracking what people do for targeted ads.&nbsp; I had someone working for a national company tell me I would be shocked at what is known about me and what I do online.&nbsp; My 85 year old dad refuses a smartphone and pays cash for everything he does short of things like utilities.&nbsp; He still sends in a check each month to them, refuses any online transactions.&nbsp; He is their least favorite kind of person but, he at least has some degree of privacy left.”</p>
<p>“Would you find interest-based ads on your phone helpful or intrusive?<br>
Neither–they’re destructive. They limit the breadth of ideas concerning things I might be interested in seeing or buying. I generally proactively look when I want or need something, and so advertising has little impact on me. However, an occasional random ad shows up that broadens my interest–that goes away with the noise of targeted ads overlain and drowning it out. If T-Mobile were truly interested, it would make its program an opt-in program and tout it so those who might be interested could make the choice.”</p>
<p>“Humans evolved from stone age to modern civilization. These tech companies will strip all our clothes.”</p>
<p>“They just can’t help themselves. They know it’s wrong, they know people will hate and distrust them for it, but the lure of doing evil is too strong for such weak-minded business executives to resist the siren call of screwing over their customers for a buck. Which circle of hell will they be joining Zuckerberg in?”</p>
<p>“Big brother lurks behind every corner.”</p>
<p>“What privacy policy update was this?&nbsp; Don’t they always preface their privacy updates with the statement: YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US(?) When did T-Mobile tell its customers our privacy is no longer important to them?&nbsp; And that in fact we are now going to sell all we know about you to the highest bidder. Seems they need at least to get informed consent to reverse this policy and to demonstrate that they gave notice that was actually received and reviewed and&nbsp;&nbsp;understood&nbsp;by customers….otherwise, isn’t this wiretapping by a third party…a&nbsp;crime?&nbsp; Also isn’t using electronic means to monitor someone in an environment where they have the reasonable expectation of privacy a&nbsp;tort.&nbsp;Why don’t they just have a dual rate structure?&nbsp;&nbsp; The more expensive traditional privacy plan and a cheaper exploitation plan? Then at least they can demonstrate they have given you consideration for the surrender of your right to privacy.”</p>
<p>“A very useful article! I was able to log in and remove my default to receive such advertisements “relevant” to me.&nbsp; That said all the regulatory bodies in the US are often headed by industry personnel who are their to protect companies, not consumers. US is the best place for any company to operate freely with regulatory burden. T-mobile follows the European standards in EU, but in the US there are no such restraints.”</p>
<p>“It’s far beyond time for the Congress to pass a sweeping privacy bill that outlaws collection and sale of personal information on citizens without their consent.”</p>
<p>“Appreciate the heads-up&nbsp; and the guidance on how to opt out. Took 30 seconds!”</p>
<p>“Friends, you may not be aware that almost all of the apps on your iPhone track your location, which the apps sell to other companies, and someday the government. If you want to stop the apps from tracking your locations, this is what to do. In Settings, choose Privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then choose Location Services.&nbsp; There you will see a list of your apps that track your location.&nbsp; All of the time. I have switched nearly all of my apps to ‘Never’ track.&nbsp; A few apps, mostly relating to travel, I have set to “While using.”&nbsp; For instance, I have set Google Maps to ‘While using.’ That is how to take control of your information.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for this important info! I use T-Mobile and like them, but hadn’t heard of this latest privacy outrage. I’ve opted out.”</p>
<p>“T-Mobile is following Facebook’s playbook.&nbsp;Apple profits by selling devices and Operating Sysyems. Facebook &amp; T-Mobile profit by selling, …………………&nbsp;YOU!”</p>
<p>“With this move, at first by one then all carriers, I will really start to limit my small screen time.”</p>
<p>“As a 18 year customer of T-Mobile, I would have preferred an email from T-Mobile&nbsp; about this, rather than having read this by chance today.”</p>
<p>“It should be Opt-In, not Opt-out. Forcing an opt out is a bit slimy in my books. Also, you know they’ll just end up dropping that option eventually and you’ll be stuck as opted in. Even if you opted in, your phone plan should be free or heavily subsidized since they are making dough off your usage.”</p>
<p>“No one automatically agrees to tracking of one’s life, via the GPS on their cell phone. Time to switch carriers.”</p>
<p>“It’s outrageous that customers who pay exorbitant fees for the devices are also exploited with advertising campaigns. I use ad blockers and a VPN and set cookies to clear when the browser is closed. When Apple releases the software to block the ad identification number of my device from being shared with the scum, I’ll be the first to use that, too.”</p>
<p>“It was a pain to opt out of this on T-Mobile. NOT COOL.”</p>
<p>“I just made the decision to “opt out” of choosing TMobile as my new phone service provider. &nbsp;So very much appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Well, T-Mobile, you just lost a potential subscriber.&nbsp; And why not reverse this and make it opt-in instead of opt-out? &nbsp;I know, because too many people are lazy and will never opt-out, selling their souls to advertisers. And for those of you who decide to opt-out, congratulations. &nbsp;You’re part of the vast minority who actually pay attention to these issues.”</p>
<p>“I have been seriously considering making the switch from Verizon to T-Mobile. The cavalier attitude that T-Mobile has for customers data privacy has caused me to put this on hold. You have to be tone deaf as a company to think that this is a good idea in the market place today.”</p>
<p>“Been with T-Mo for over 20 years because they’re so much better for international travel than the others. I don’t plan on changing to another carrier but I’ll opt out of this, thanks.”</p>
<p>“So now we know why T-Mobile is so much cheaper.”</p>
<p>“I have never heard anyone say that they want more ads. How about I pay too much for your services already and I don’t want ANY ads. We need a European style GDP(R) with real teeth in the USA and we need it now!”</p>
<p>“So these dummies are going to waste their money on ads when their service Suckky Ducky!&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, but it’s a wasteland of T-Mobile, “No Service” Bars on your phone with these guys.&nbsp; It’s the worst service, period.&nbsp;Spend your money on your service, the customers will follow.&nbsp; Why is that so hard for these dummies to understand?”</p>
<p>“If they do this I will go elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“When will these companies learn that their ads are an annoyance.&nbsp; I do not want or appreciate their ads.&nbsp; I hate the words ‘We use our data to customize the ads you receive.'”</p>
<p>“Imagine if those companies had put that much effort and money into actually improving their service. Nah, that’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Thank you info on how to opt out. I just did so. It’s up to me to decide what advertising is relevant for me, not some giant corporation that thinks they own me.”</p>
<p>“who is the customer out there like, Yeah I&nbsp;want&nbsp;them to advertise to me! I love it!’? Hard to believe anyone would ask for this.”</p>
<p>“I believe using a VPN would pretty much halt all of this nonsense, especially if the carrier doesn’t want to cooperate.”</p>
<p>“I’m a TMobile customer, and to be honest, I really don’t care about advertising–as long as they don’t give marketers my phone number.&nbsp; Now that would be a deal breaker.”</p>
<p>“What about iPhone users on T-Mobile?&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple’s move to remove third party cookies is creating this incentive for carriers to fill the void. It’s time for a national privacy bill.”</p>
<p>“We need digital privacy laws !!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Sad that Europe and other countries are far ahead of us here.”</p>
<p>“Pure arrogance on the part of the carrier. What are they thinking at a time when people are increasingly concerned about privacy? I’m glad that I’m not currently a T-Mobile customer and this seals the deal for me for the future.”</p>
<p>“AT&amp;T won’t actually let you opt out fully. Requests to block third party analytics trigger pop up messages that state ‘Our system doesn’t seem to be cooperating. Sorry for any inconvenience. Please try again later’.”</p>
<p>“One of the more salient articles I’ve read anywhere recently. Google I understand, we get free email and other stuff, and it’s a business.&nbsp;But I already pay a couple hundred a month to my phone provider. And now they think it’s a good idea to barrage me and my family? What about underage kids getting ads – that must be legal only because the right politicians got paid off.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I bet customers have been begging for more “targeted advertising”. &nbsp;It would be nice if a change in privacy policy also allowed you to void your 12 month agreement with these guys.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for showing us how to opt out. If these companies want to sell my data, then they should pay me part of the proceeds. Otherwise, I opt out.”</p>
<p>Think T-Mobile is listening?</p>
<p>If not, they’re just a typical carrier with 0% customer commitment.</p>

<p>One year ago exactly (at this minute), my wife and I were somewhere over Nebraska, headed from Newark to Santa Barbara by way of Denver, on the last flight we’ve ever taken. Prior to that we had put about four million miles on United alone, flying almost constantly somewhere, mostly on business. The map above traces what my pocket GPS recorded on various trips (and far from all of them) by land, sea and air since 2007. This life began for me in 1990 and for my wife long before that. Post-Covid, none of this will ever be the same. For anybody.</p>
<p>We also haven’t seen most of our kids or grandkids in more than a year. Same goes for countless friends, business associates and fellow (no longer) travelers on other routes of life.</p>
<p>The old normal is over. We don’t know what the new normal will be, exactly; but it’s clear that business travel as we knew it is gone for years to come, if not forever.</p>
<p>I also sense a generational hand-off. Young people always take over from their elders at some point, but this handoff is from the physical to the digital. Young people are digital natives. Older folk are at best familiar with the digital world: adept in many cases, but not born into it. Being born into the digital world is very different. And still very new.</p>
<p>Though my wife and I have been stuck in Southern California for a year now, we have been living mostly in the digital world, working hard on that handoff, trying to deposit all we can of our long experience and hard-won wisdom on the conveyor belt of work we share across generations.</p>
<p>There will be a new normal, eventually. It will be a normal like the one we had in the 20th Century, which started with WWI and ended with Covid. This was a normal where the cultural center was held by newspapers and broadcasting, and every adult knew how to drive.</p>
<p>Now we’re&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/02/23/welcome-to-the-21st-century/">in the 21st Century</a>, and it’s something of a whiteboard. We still have the old media and speak the same languages, but Covid pushed a reset button, and a lot of the old norms are open to question, if not out the window completely.</p>
<p>Why should the digital young accept the analog-born&nbsp;status quos of&nbsp;business, politics, religion, education, transportation or anything? The easy answer is because the flywheels of those things are still spinning. The hard answers start with questions about how we can do all that stuff better. For sure all&nbsp;the answers will be, to a huge degree, digital.</p>
<p>Perspective: the world has been digital for a only few years now, and will likely remain so for many decades or centuries. Far more has been not been done than has, and lots of stuff will have to be improvised until we (increasingly the young folk) figure out the best approaches. It won’t be easy. None of the technical areas my wife and I are involved with personally (and I’ve been writing about) —<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20privacy">privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20identity">identity</a>, <a href="https://www.big-fintech.com/Media/BIGcast/ArticleID/416/Masters-Of-Identity-Part-2">fintech</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/10/31/about-face/">facial recognition</a>, <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">advertising</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc%20searls%20journalism">journalism</a>—have easy answers to their problems, much less final ones.</p>
<p>But we like working on them, and sensing some progress, which doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago I wanted to find something I’d written about privacy. So I started with a simple search on Google:</p>
<p><a href="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy"></a></p>
<p>The result was this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk027GpO224bVqHtszlifSgH2QElhxg%3A1615428050746&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=0nlJYLDjKvq40PEP7KCrwAY&amp;iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYEmH4oABvwZXU7SSlElAGSIoNzDGF_su&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy&amp;oq=doc+searls+privacy&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECc6BAguECc6BQgAEJECOgQIABBDOgQILhBDOggILhCxAxCDAToFCAAQsQM6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOggIABCxAxCDAToKCAAQhwIQsQMQFDoICAAQsQMQkQI6AggAOgUILhCxAzoHCC4QsQMQQzoKCC4QhwIQsQMQFDoHCAAQsQMQCjoICC4QxwEQrwE6BQghEKABOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeUKgIWORAYIFEaANwAHgAgAGCAYgBwRCSAQQxMi45mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwlP24kqfvAhV6HDQIHWzQCmgQ4dUDCAo&amp;uact=5"></a></p>
<p>Which is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very way long way of saying this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy" title="https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+privacy">https://google.com/search?&amp;q=doc+searls+…</a></p>
<p>That’s 609 characters vs. 47, or about 13 times longer. (Hence the word “very” repeated 13 times, above.)</p>
<p>Why are search URLs so long these days? The didn’t used to be.</p>
<p>I assume that the 562 extra characters in that long url tell Google more about me and what I’m doing than they used to want to know. In old long-URL search results, there was human-readable stuff there about the computer and the browser being used. This mess surely contains the same, plus lots of personal data about me and what I’m doing online in addition to searching for this one thing. But I don’t know. And that’s surely part of the idea here.</p>
<p>This much, however, is easy for a human to read:</p>
 
 Giant URLs like this are cyphers, on purpose. 
 You’re not supposed to know what they actually say. Only Google should know. 
 There is a lot about your searches that are&nbsp;Google’s business and not yours. 
 Google has lost interest (if it ever had any) in making search result URLs easy to copy and use somewhere else, such as in a post like this. 
 
<p>Bing is better in this regard. Here’s the same search result there:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy&amp;form=QBLH&amp;sp=-1&amp;pq=doc+searls+privacy&amp;sc=0-18&amp;qs=n&amp;sk=&amp;cvid=E72524E96FE449DA86253E8D8574CC5C"></a></p>
<p>That’s 101 characters, or less than 1/6th of Google’s.</p>
<p>The de-crufted URL is also shorter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy" title="https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+privacy">https://bing.com/search?q=doc+searls+pri…</a></p>
<p>Just 44 characters.</p>
<p>So here is a suggestion for both companies: make search results available with one click in their basic forms. That will make sharing those URLs a lot easier to do, and create good will as well. And, Google, if a cruft-less URL is harder&nbsp;for you to track, so what? Maybe you shouldn’t be doing some of this tracking in the first place.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s better to make things easy for people than harder. This is one of those times. Or billions of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You probably know <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/this-is-water">this David Foster Wallace joke</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, “What the hell is water?”</p></blockquote><p>When you're in the depths of your context, whatever that happens to be, it can be hard to even see the rules you’re unconsciously abiding by. I think it’s worth stopping, every so often, and particularly after a year like the one we’ve collectively had, to ask: what matters?</p><p>I think there are two traps in life. (There are certainly more, but let’s go with two for the purposes of this piece. Two traps is already a lot of traps.) The first is that you find yourself on a metaphorical treadmill, working really hard but not for any really good reason that gets you to anywhere in particular. The second is that you have a fixed goal in mind and are so fixated on getting there that you miss out on all the beauty and possibilities inherent to the journey. In other words: blinkered-ness and inflexibility.</p><p>Naming the decisions we make and understanding why we make them allows us to make better ones. For example, taking care of my parents is a choice - I could up and move to Singapore, say - but it’s only one on a technicality. I may have autonomy, but not in a way that I’d feel good about. Leaving the Bay Area and not being there for my family feels like the wrong thing to do. As much as I’d love to travel more and live somewhere else (which, in a vacuum, I really would), if I consciously weigh the two things against each other, staying here wins.</p><p>If I’m naming things and making conscious choices, understanding how much of myself I give to other people - and how much of my life is truly proactively under my control, vs. a reaction to external demands or desires - is an important exercise. I want to have a job, and I want to both spend time with and take care of people I love. But I also want to be my own, autonomous person, and give myself enough breathing space to live and grow.</p><p>Those conscious choices just scratch the surface. We all unconsciously give a lot of ourselves in response to external pressures. Consumer culture - the advertising, media, and word-of-mouth values we’re all exposed to hundreds of times a day - also has designs on us. It wants us to fit into a pigeonhole, follow a fashion, modify our bodies, get rich, become something we’re not. The message is that fitting ourselves into these templates will improve us somehow. For advertising, it’s a reflection of someone’s desire to convince you to buy their product; for media, it’s their desire to capture your attention; for everyone else, it’s their desire to feel better about themselves. People who are brave enough to truly be themselves are a threat to people who are not.</p><p>In the tech industry, a lot of people feel like they’ve constantly got to be in hustle mode: a particular kind of working all the time that is imposed through a mix of entrepreneurship porn and peer pressure. I’ve long since washed my hands of this side of tech culture, but it’s something I definitely was part of for a little while, and I continue to see it in others. I made choices that were detrimental to me in the name of the work I was doing (without realizing that, by harming me, these choices were also detrimental to that work). I meet and talk to a lot of people who still want to hustle hard because they’re under the impression they will somehow going to get rich quick. For a lot of people, there really isn’t a tangible goal: they hustle to the point of exhaustion and contort their personas into accepted forms simply because they think they’re expected to.</p><p>That same impulse is why immigrants are pressured to assimilate, or why people self-asserting their own gender identity is a threat to so many people. Assimilation takes the fear out of accepting someone from a culture a person doesn’t understand. Traditional gender identity and roles are well-understood; not just culturally accepted but culturally indoctrinated, prescribed, and sold to. It’s in a lot of peoples’ interests for us to conform to them, so there’s pressure to do that. But assimilation requires letting go of a key piece of who we are; adopting a traditional gender rather than expressing our true selves requires denying who we are. In some cases, the unfair expectations placed on us differ wildly: Black women are held to a different, more stringent standard to white women, who are held to a different standard again to white men.</p><p>Let’s ask again: what matters?</p><p>Everyone deserves to be accepted for the completeness of who they are. Acceptance matters; trust matters; respect matters; equity matters. A professional relationship is in peril if the parties involved don’t accept each other as people, or if they don’t accept the relationship itself. A romantic relationship is in peril if the same things are true. If we’re constantly judging each other, or holding each other to unfair or inconsistent standards, our respect for and acceptance of each other is drastically undermined.</p><p>It’s a universal but largely unspoken need: I want to be my full, weird, unbridled self, and I want to be accepted and loved for it. I want the people around me to be accepted and loved for who they are. I want the injustices of the past - the intentional and unconscious choices communities have made for centuries - to be named and redressed, so that everyone can be themselves.</p><p>The inclusive, nonconformist future is here, but isn’t evenly distributed yet. I don’t want to live in a place with a homogenous culture; I don’t want my community to be assimilated and sanitized to some out-of-date standard. I want everyone to be themselves. Life is so much richer when you can build community with people from a galaxy of contexts, ethnicities, and cultures; a spectrum of sexualities and genders; a rainbow of people who can all create and share and love and collaborate and grow with each other without losing their sense of self or the pressure to give up pieces of their identities. A culture that, above all, gives people the metaphorical and literal space to live.</p><p>To me, that’s what matters. Being accepted and loved for who I am, warts and all; accepting and loving the people I’m connected to for who they are, warts and all. Allowing people to really be themselves and rejecting conformity. And it leads to conscious choices: where to live, where to work, who to be connected to, and what to do next. Rejecting the cultural pressure to conform to traditional values and embracing the new and radical means finding the places, organizations, and people who do the same.</p><p>That’s what I think a good life looks like. I think it’s important to consciously know, and to name it. It’s what I want.</p>

<p>The column republished below, originally at <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/04/22/primetime.html</a>, was the vector that connected me to my dear friend Gardner Campbell. I’m resurrecting it here partly just to bring it back online, but mainly to celebrate the ways in which Gardner — a film scholar among many other things — is, right now, bringing his film expertise to the practice of online teaching. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3106">this post</a> he reflects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the learning spaces I’ve been in provide very poorly, if at all, for the supposed magic of being co-located. A state-mandated prison-spec windowless classroom has less character than a well-lighted Zoom conference. A lectern with a touch-pad control for a projector-and-screen combo is much less flexible and, I’d argue, conveys much less human connection and warmth than I can when I share a screen on Zoom during a synchronous class, or see my students there, not in front of a white sheet of reflective material, but in the medium with me, lighting up the chat, sharing links, sharing the simple camaraderie of a hearty “good morning” as class begins.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in <a href="http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=3096">this one</a> he shares the <a href="https://youtu.be/82Gu4BKagpI">course trailer</a> (!) for Fiction into film: a study of adaptations of “Little Women”.</p>
<p>My 2005 column was a riff on a New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/06/movies/is-a-cinema-studies-degree-the-new-mba.html">Is Cinema Studies the new MBA</a>? It was perhaps a stretch, in 2005, to argue for cinema studies as an integral part of the new freshman comp. The argument makes a lot more sense now.</p>
 
 The New Freshman Comp 
<p>For many years I have alternately worn two professional hats: writer and programmer. Lately I find myself wearing a third hat: filmmaker. When I began making the films that I now call screencasts, my readers and I both sensed that this medium was different enough to justify the new name that we collaboratively gave it. Here’s how I define the difference. Film is a genre of storytelling that addresses the whole spectrum of human experience. Screencasting is a subgenre of film that can tell stories about the limited — but rapidly growing — slice of our lives that is mediated by software.</p>
<p>Telling stories about software in this audiovisual way is something I believe technical people will increasingly want to do. To explain why, let’s first discuss a more ancient storytelling mode: writing.</p>
<p>The typical reader of this column is probably, like me, a writer of both prose and code. Odds are you identify yourself as a coder more than as a writer. But you may also recently have begun blogging, in which case you’ve seen your writing muscles grow stronger with exercise.</p>
<p>Effective writing and effective coding are more closely related than you might think. Once upon a time I spent a year as a graduate student and teaching assistant at an Ivy League university. My program of study was science writing, but that was a tiny subspecialty within a larger MFA (master of fine arts) program dedicated to creative writing. That’s what they asked me to teach, and the notion terrified me. I had no idea what I’d say to a roomful of aspiring poets and novelists. As it turned out, though, many of these kids were in fact aspiring doctors, scientists, and engineers who needed humanities credits. So I decided to teach basic expository writing. The university’s view was that these kids had done enough of that in high school. Mine was that they hadn’t, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>I began by challenging their reverence for published work. Passages from books and newspapers became object lessons in editing, a task few of my students had ever been asked to perform in a serious way. They were surprised by the notion that you could improve material that had been professionally written and edited, then sold in bookstores or on newsstands. Who were they to mess with the work of the pros?</p>
<p>I, in turn, was surprised to find this reverent attitude even among the budding software engineers. They took it for granted that programs were imperfect texts, always subject to improvement. But they didn’t see prose in the same way. They didn’t equate refactoring a program with editing a piece of writing, as I did then and still do.</p>
<p>When I taught this class more than twenty years ago the term “refactoring” wasn’t commonly applied to software. Yet that’s precisely how I think about the iterative refinement of prose and of code. In both realms, we adjust vocabulary to achieve consistency of tone, and we transform structure to achieve economy of expression.</p>
<p>I encouraged my students to regard writing and editing as activities governed by engineering principles not unlike the ones that govern coding and refactoring. Yes, writing is a creative act. So is coding. But in both cases the creative impulse is expressed in orderly, calculated, even mechanical ways. This seemed to be a useful analogy. For technically-inclined students earning required humanities credits, it made the subject seem more relevant and at the same time more approachable.</p>
<p>In the pre-Internet era, none of us foresaw the explosive growth of the Internet as a textual medium. If you’d asked me then why a programmer ought to be able to write effectively, I’d have pointed mainly to specs and manuals. I didn’t see that software development was already becoming a global collaboration, that email and newsgroups were its lifeblood, and that the ability to articulate and persuade in the medium of text could be as crucial as the ability to design and build in the medium of code.</p>
<p>Nowadays, of course, software developers have embraced new tools of articulation and persuasion: blogs, wikis. I’m often amazed not only by the amount of writing that goes on in these forms, but also by its quality. Writing muscles do strengthen with exercise, and the game of collaborative software development gives them a great workout.</p>
<p>Not everyone drinks equally from this fountain of prose, though. Developers tend to write a great deal for other developers, but much less for those who use their software. Laziness is a factor; hubris even more so. We like to imagine that our software speaks for itself. And in some ways that’s true. Documentation is often only a crutch. If you have to explain how to use your software, you’ve failed.</p>
<p>It may, however, be obvious how to use a piece of software, and yet not at all obvious why to use it. I’ll give you two examples: Wikipedia and del.icio.us. Anyone who approaches either of these applications will immediately grasp their basic modes of use. That’s the easy part. The hard part is understanding what they’re about, and why they matter.</p>
<p>A social application works within an environment that it simultaneously helps to create. If you understand that environment, the application makes sense. Otherwise it can seem weird and pointless.</p>
<p>Paul Kedrosky, an investor, academic, and columnist, alluded to this problem on his blog last month:</p>
<blockquote><p>Funny conversation I had with someone yesterday: We agreed that the thing that generally made us both persevere and keep trying any new service online, even if we didn’t get it the first umpteen times, was having Jon Udell post that said service was useful. After all, if Jon liked it then it had to be that we just hadn’t tried hard enough. [<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001115.html">Infectious Greed</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>I immodestly quote Paul’s remarks in order to revise and extend them. I agree that the rate-limiting factor for software adoption is increasingly not purchase, or installation, or training, but simply “getting it.” And while I may have a good track record for “getting it,” plenty of other people do too — the creators of new applications, obviously, as well as the early adopters. What’s unusual about me is the degree to which I am trained, inclined, and paid to communicate in ways that help others to “get it.”</p>
<p>We haven’t always seen the role of the writer and the role of the developer as deeply connected but, as the context for understanding software shifts from computers and networks to people and groups, I think we’ll find that they are. When an important application’s purpose is unclear on the first umpteen approaches, and when “getting it” requires hard work, you can’t fix the problem with a user-interface overhaul or a better manual. There needs to be an ongoing conversation about what the code does and, just as importantly, why. Professional communicators (like me) can help move things along, but everyone needs to participate, and everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively.</p>
<p>If you’re a developer struggling to evangelize an idea, I’d start by reiterating that your coding instincts can also help you become a better writer. Until recently, that’s where I’d have ended this essay too. But recent events have shown me that writing alone, powerful though it can be, won’t necessarily suffice.</p>
<p>I’ve written often — and, I like to think, cogently — about wikis and tagging. But my screencasts about Wikipedia and del.icio.us have had a profoundly greater impact than anything I’ve written on these topics. People “get it” when they watch these movies in ways that they otherwise don’t.</p>
<p>It’s undoubtedly true that an audiovisual narrative enters many 21st-century minds more easily, and makes a more lasting impression on those minds, than does a written narrative. But it’s also true that the interactive experience of software is fundamentally cinematic in nature. Because an application plays out as a sequence of frames on a timeline, a narrated screencast may be the best possible way to represent it and analyze it.</p>
<p>If you buy either or both of these explanations, what then? Would I really suggest that techies will become fluid storytellers not only in the medium of the written essay, but also in the medium of the narrated screencast? Actually, yes, I would, and I’m starting to find people who want to take on the challenge.</p>
<p>A few months ago I heard from Michael Tiller, who describes himself as a “mechanical engineer trapped in a computer scientist’s body.” Michael has had a long and passionate interest in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modelica.com/">Modelica</a>, an open, object-oriented language for modeling mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic, thermal, and control systems. He wanted to work with me to develop a screencast on this topic. But it’s far from my domains of expertise and, in the end, all he really needed was my encouragement. This week, Michael launched a website called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/">Dynopsis.com</a>&nbsp;that’s chartered to explore the intersection of engineering and information technologies. Featured prominently on the site is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=modelica_screencast">this 20-minute screencast</a>&nbsp;in which he illustrates the use of Modelica in the context of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynasim.se/">Dymola</a>&nbsp;IDE.</p>
<p>This screencast was made with Windows Media Encoder 9, and without the help of any editing. After a couple of takes, Michael came up with a great overview of the Modelica language, the Dymola tool, and the modeling and simulation techniques that they embody. Since he is also author of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0792373677">book</a>&nbsp;on this subject, I asked Michael to reflect on these different narrative modes, and here’s how he responded on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were interested in teaching someone just the textual aspects of the Modelica language,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/104-0719698-6919906">this is exactly the approach I would take</a>.<br>
…<br>
But when trying to teach or explain a medium that is visual, other tools can be much more effective. Screencasts are one technology that could really make an impact on the way some subjects are taught and I can see how these ideas could be extended much further. [<a href="http://www.dynopsys.com/?q=node/19">Dynopsis: Learning by example: screencasts</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>We’re just scratching the surface of this medium. Its educational power is immediately obvious, and over time its persuasive power will come into focus too. The New York Times recently asked: “Is cinema studies the new MBA?” I’ll go further and suggest that these methods ought to be part of the new freshman comp. Writing and editing will remain the foundation skills they always were, but we’ll increasingly combine them with speech and video. The tools and techniques are new to many of us. But the underlying principles — consistency of tone, clarity of structure, economy of expression, iterative refinement — will be familiar to programmers and writers alike.</p>

  <p>This week I virtually attended the NICAR data journalism conference and made a ton of progress on the Django backend for VaccinateCA (see <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/28/vaccinateca/">last week</a>).</p>
 NICAR 2021 
<p><a href="https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2021/">NICAR</a> stands for the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting - an acronym that reflects the age of the organization, which started teaching journalists data-driven reporting back in 1989, long before the term "data journalism" became commonplace.</p>
<p>This was my third NICAR and it's now firly established itself at the top of the list of my favourite conferences. Every year it attracts over 1,000 of the highest quality data nerds - from data journalism veterans who've been breaking stories for decades to journalists who are just getting started with data and want to start learning Python or polish up their skills with Excel.</p>
<p>I presented <a href="https://nicar21.pathable.co/meetings/virtual/xEmubEJvwB5mv3Dfn">an hour long workshop</a> on Datasette, which I'm planning to turn into the first official Datasette tutorial. I also got to pre-record a five minute lightning talk about Git scraping.</p>
<p>I published <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Mar/5/git-scraping/">the video and notes for that</a> yesterday. It really seemed to strike a nerve at the conference: I showed how you can set up a scheduled scraper using GitHub Actions with just a few lines of YAML configuration, and do so entirely through the GitHub web interface without even opening a text editor.</p>
<p>Pretty much every data journalist wants to run scrapers, and understands the friction involved in maintaining your own dedicated server and crontabs and storage and backups for running them. Being able to do this for free on GitHub's infrastructure drops that friction down to almost nothing.</p>
<p>The lightning talk lead to a last-minute GitHub Actions and Git scraping <a href="https://nicar21.pathable.co/meetings/virtual/FTTWfJicMwFLP849H">office hours session</a> being added to the schedule, and I was delighted to have <a href="https://github.com/rdmurphy">Ryan Murphy</a> from the LA Times join that session to demonstrate the incredible things the LA Times have been doing with scrapers and GitHub Actions. You can see some of their scrapers in the <a href="https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-scrapers">datadesk/california-coronavirus-scrapers</a> repo.</p>
 VaccinateCA 
<p>The race continues to build out a Django backend for the <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> project, to collect data on vaccine availability from people making calls on that organization's behalf.</p>
<p>The new backend is getting perilously close to launch. I'm leaning heavily on the Django admin for this, refreshing my knowledge of how to customize it with things like <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/actions/">admin actions</a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_filter">custom filters</a>.</p>
<p>It's been quite a while since I've done anything sophisticated with the Django admin and it has evolved a LOT. In the past I've advised people to drop the admin for custom view functions the moment they want to do anything out-of-the-ordinary - I don't think that advice holds any more. It's got really good over the years!</p>
<p>A very smart thing the team at VaccinateCA did a month ago is to start logging the full incoming POST bodies for every API request handled by their existing Netlify functions (which then write to Airtable).</p>
<p>This has given me an invaluable tool for testing out the new replacement API: I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/83e66d618f07aa3b19d2f1db58be78b8">a script</a> which replays those API logs against my new implementation - allowing me to test that every one of several thousand previously recorded API requests will run without errors against my new code.</p>
<p>Since this is so valuable, I've written code that will log API requests to the new stack directly to the database. Normally I'd shy away from a database table for logging data like this, but the expected traffic is the low thousands of API requests a day - and a few thousand extra database rows per day is a tiny price to pay for having such a high level of visibility into how the API is being used.</p>
<p>(I'm also logging the API requests to PostgreSQL using Django's JSONField, which means I can analyze them in depth later on using PostgreSQL's JSON functionality!)</p>
 YouTube subtitles 
<p>I decided to add proper subtitles to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CjA-03yK8I&amp;t=1s">lightning talk video</a>, and was delighted to learn that the YouTube subtitle editor pre-populates with an automatically generated transcript, which you can then edit in place to fix up spelling, grammar and remove the various "um" and "so" filler words.</p>
<p>This makes creating high quality captions extremely productive. I've also added them to the 17 minute <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/7/video/">Introduction to Datasette and sqlite-utils</a> video that's embedded on the <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> homepage - editing the transcript for that only took about half an hour.</p>

<p>We’ve been here 6 years, and the magical Sonoma County landscape just keeps growing on me. I’ve written about the spectacular coastline, a national treasure just twenty miles to our west that’s pristine thanks to the efforts of a handful of environmental activists, notably <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2019/07/21/walking-the-kortum-trail/">Bill Kortum</a>. Even closer, just ten miles to our east, lies the also spectacular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains">Mayacamas range</a> where today I again hiked Bald Mountain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarloaf_Ridge_State_Park">Sugarloaf Ridge State Park</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever visit this region and fancy a hike with great views, this is the one. (Ping me and I’ll go with you at the drop of a hat.) It’s not too challenging. The nearby Goodspeed Trail, leading up to Gunsight Notch on Hood Mountain, is more demanding, and in the end, less rewarding. Don’t get me wrong, the view from Gunsight — looking west over the Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa plain — is delightful. But the view from the top of Bald Mountain is something else again. On a clear day (which is most of them) you can spin a slow 360 and take in the Napa Valley towns of St. Helena and Calistoga to the west, Cobb and St. Helena mountains to the north, the Sonoma Valley and Santa Rosa plain to the east, then turn south to see Petaluma, Mt. Tamalpais, the top of the Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco, the San Pablo Bay, the tops of the tallest buildings in Oakland, and Mt. Diablo 51 miles away. Finally, to complete the loop, turn east again to look at the Sierra Nevada range 130 miles away.</p>
    
<p>The rugged topography you can see in that video occurs fractally everywhere around here. It’s taken a while to sink in, but I think I can finally explain what’s so fascinating about this landscape. It’s the sightlines. From almost anywhere, you’re looking at a 3D puzzle. I’m a relative newcomer, but I hike with friends who’ve lived their whole lives here, and from any given place, they are as likely as I am to struggle to identify some remote landmark. Everything looks different from everywhere. You’re always seeing multiple overlapping planes receding into the distance, like dioramas. And they change dramatically as you move around even slightly. Even just ten paces in any direction, or a slight change in elevation, can alter the sightlines completely and reveal or hide a distant landmark.</p>
<p>We’ve lived in flat places, we’ve lived in hilly places, but never until now in such a profoundly three-dimensional landscape. It is a blessing I will never take for granted.</p>

<p>An idea has been maturing in my thoughts for a while now. Or rather I have been thinking about a series of ideas, programming projects I would love to actualise, which I recently realised share a common thread. Memory and how we access it. Probably not surprising for software developers, pretty much any application we can imagine requires some form of data store. Although rarely, in my experience, do we talk about this data in terms of memory.</p>
<p>My more recent work researching identity, privacy and trust in digital interactions has evolved and broadened my perspective on the importance of memory. Our identity, whatever we conceive that to be, must be understood to exist in close relation to memory. Or the mathematician in me wants to say as a function of memory I ~ F(m) <a>1</a>. And as Herbert Simon details in the Science of the Artificial, memory is a key property of any intelligent system <a>2</a>.  The ability to take information from the past and apply it when navigating the present moment is a powerful skill in the Homo Sapien toolbox, both as individuals and a species.</p>
<p>These patterns of thought on memory percolating in my mind have further been influenced through my engagement with blockchain/distributed ledger both as a concept and through the practical application of it in application development. I especially find the ideas coming out of the Ethereum community transformative to the possibilities for digital application design. Persistent Compute Objects (PICOs) <a>3</a> are a more recent idea and open source project I have been following that appears to support novel interaction patterns.</p>
<p>It has been an interesting journey to this point, what follows in a sketch of the evolution of my thoughts on memory told through the lens of three ideas and the questions these ideas sparked in me. Then I intend to reflect on where my thoughts are at now, because it is only now reflecting on these ideas that I see the common thread - human memory. </p>
<p>The ideas that influenced my thinking and help illustrate my thoughts are; Viewing Time, The Community Mind and Nifty Books. Each originates at a different point in my life but all were ideas for programming side projects I could use to cut my teeth on a new technology, language or library. Each idea has a special place in my own memory, and it is from these memories that the thoughts I am sharing emerged.</p>
 Viewing Time 
<p>My first idea, back before I knew how to program. The inspirational carrot I used to motivate myself to learn. Not that I ever wrote more than a few lines of code on this. It originates from a time in Maastricht visiting a friend, we were sitting looking at a beautiful view and I thought: </p>
 What if we could create a timelapse of a view from a specific location? A View of Time. 
<p>I think I tried to get my friend to go back their every day to take a photo to do just this. Not the ideal solution, my thinking has evolved since then. Here are some of the questions I thought about:</p>
 
 
<p>What if we could crowd source the collection of the photos for a view, enabling anyone with a camera to contribute?</p>
 
 How would view’s of time be discovered, found, contributed to and viewed? 
 
<p>How would you prevent “bad” view from being added. Inappropriate, non valued, etc?</p>
 
 Who decides what a “bad” view is? 
 Authorisation problem 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Where would views be stored?</p>
 
 Who stores them? 
 Who has control over them? 
 Who manages that control? 
 
 
 Who would host and pay for this application and why? 
 
<p>How might Viewing Time change our relationship with our environment and help us reflect on the change happening all around us?</p>
 
 Chasing Ice, a documentary I watched on another visit to the Netherlands, emphasised how powerful this could be. <a href="https://earthvisioninstitute.org/share-this/columbia-glacier-alaska/">Here is an example</a>. 
 Watching a Chinese cityscape evolve over these last 20 years would have provided another staggering view of time and change. 
 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/21/timelapse-satellite-images-china-fastest-growing-cities">Here are some examples of this using satellite imagery</a> 
 How might Viewing Time help communities record and interact with shared memories? 
 I was recently involved with planting a Community Orchard and became aware how valuable creating a view as a shared artifact could be. It might help communities celebrate and appreciate the positive changes they bring about. 
 
 
 How might date, time or season be used to present different time-lapses of the same view? 
 
<p>How would we prevent overtourism?</p>
 
 I never wanted to turn view’s into used and abused tourist spaces, an acknowledged tension. 
 Explicitly want to avoid insta tourism type effects. How?  
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Trs-isdu4eE">This is a funny add from the Kiwi’s recently keeping me mindful of this</a> 
 What are the incentives? 
 How do we ensure this is an artifact all can enjoy while minimising the unintended consequences associated with the change in context-relative informational norms? 
 How might this be used to create incentives for positive, respectful tourism? 
 Realised in part this is about how views are discovered. 
 This got me closer to the importance of location. 
 
 
 
<p>What if you could only discover view’s if you were in it’s location?</p>
 
 How might this help to prevent bad content? 
 How would you even prove you were in a certain location? 
 Who/what would you prove it to? 
 
 
 
<p>What is the context and associated informational norms with a View?</p>
 
 Who defines and evolves these norms? 
 What are the rules? 
 
 
 How might location be used as a strong authenticator?<a>4</a> 
 
<p>These are all pointers, sketching the outlines of thought that I have been evolving over the 5 or so years since first appeared in my mind. </p>
<p>It is an idea that I never made any meaningful, tangible progress on. Except for a few positive conversations with friends it has remained wishful thinking. It is in my humble opinion, a beauty of an idea, something that I would love to see happen. I am optimistic, the technology and mental model for application design is shifting in ways that open up an entirely new design space for these kinds of ideas. Something other than the for profit venture capitalist endeavours that have lead to the colonisation and privatisation of much of our virtual spaces. A for-profit venture could never be the best realisation of this idea.</p>
 The Community Mind 
<p>
      <a>
    
  
  </a>
    </p>
<p>This is my baby. My first <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/sideproject">side project</a>. It is how I learnt React and felt the power of GraphQl. The first website and server I ever deployed - a challenging experience but one I <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-from-deploying-my-first-full-stack-web-application-34f94ec0a286/">learnt from</a>.  It is was also my first encounter with authentication and account management, what a nightmare that was.</p>
<p>After completing a year in industry this was the next programming project I worked on. I committed a lot of my time to this work. Including spending a month straight on it while dipping my toes into the digital nomad lifestyle in Chiang Mai, where I was exposed to and became fascinated with blockchain, Bitcoin and all that crazy stuff. An influential period of my life really. </p>
<p>Anyway, the idea revolves around creating a place for us to organise our questions. A space for questions to be shared and thought about, but not a place to collect answers. In my mind it was explicitly not for answers. Rather it would provide triggers to thought’s within individuals as they pondered these questions from the their own unique perspective shaped by their lived experience. I am a strong believe that we all have the ability to imagine creative ideas and possibilities, the hard part of course is actioning those ideas. As in many ways this text demonstrates.</p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this idea came from the book <a href="https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/">A More Beautiful Question</a>. I wanted to try to develop something that would make it easier to ask and discover beautiful questions. A place where these questions could be crowd sourced, recorded and connected.  I wanted to provide an interface for individuals to explore a web of interconnected questions being thought by others. I wanted people to be able to contribute their own questions and thought pathways to this network. Each individual interacting with and contributing to the community mind.</p>
<p>The questions that surfaced when thinking through the design requirements of such a project were something along these lines:</p>
 
 
<p>How will I manage questioners?</p>
 
 I was still thinking in a user account paradigm in these days.  
 Who gets to ask questions? 
 Who gets to see the questions asked? 
 
 
 
<p>How will questioners search and discover the questions they are interested in?</p>
 
 What if questions could be linked to other questions? 
 Who can link questions to other questions? Which links do people see and how do they decide? 
 What if these links grew in strength the more they were traversed and endorsed like neural pathways in our own minds? 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent duplicate questions?</p>
 
 Am I trying to create a single global repository of questions?  
 
<p>Or would it be better to allow each individual to manage their web of questions independently?</p>
 
 How might you enable the best of both? 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How will we prevent bad data? Questions that don’t align with the ethos of the mind?</p>
 
 Whose mind? Who decides? 
 How might questions be optimally curated? 
 What is optimal and who is curating? 
 
 
 Where would this information be stored?  
 
<p>What is the business model for such an application?</p>
 
 What are the incentives? 
 
 
 
<p>When initially developing this project I had in mind a database for storing questions and their links, which people would interact with. Searching and filtering to discover the questions they were interested in. Contributing their own questions and connections to this storage. All managed by some centralised application, providing a single view and interface for people to interact with. Today, I have a model of individual’s being able to maintain their own mind, curating the questions and connections that find useful to them. Then providing a mechanism to network and aggregate the minds of others into a larger web of questions for all to explore. Imagine a mind like a GitHub repository, the entity that creates it would be able to manage the rules governing how questions and links are contributed. I even considered private minds as a potential business model. Although my desire was and remains today to develop an open source tool for recording, curating and discovering beautiful questions. I see them as a loose scaffold around thought, hinting at the problem space without prescribing the solution. A common entry point to creativity, that any individual from any background at any moment in time would be able to interact with. Using their own unique perspective to draw new insights and inspire different solutions.</p>
<p>I have a lot of fond memories developing this idea, including a weekend in Porto visiting a friend where I discovered the joy and value of committing thoughts to paper. Creating a physical artifact to interact with. Something that in my view can never fully be replicated in a digital medium, but what if you could have both?</p>

    </p>
<p>Towards the end of my <a href="https://github.com/wip-abramson/TheCommunityMind">active development</a> of this idea I attempted to integrate a token, Simple Token, as part of a challenge they held. My idea at the time was to use this as some form of incentive mechanism for the application, although the actual execution was a bit clumsy looking back. You can view my submission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMABXKGoiAk&amp;t=1s">here</a>. Then there is this old <a href="https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/5">Github issue</a> from a month long hackathon called Blockternship. </p>
<p>While development is dormant, I am still very committed to making this a thing. One day!</p>
 Nifty Books 
<p>This is another lovely idea, in my book at least. Originating from my desire to learn how to write smart contracts using solidity, the Ethereum programming language. The idea stemmed from thinking through how we might digitally represent books the books we own, creating a distributed library and opening access to a wealth of books. Moving them off our shelves and into peoples hands, helping the wisdom held within them diffuse into more peoples minds and become recorded in their memories. Book’s can provide an intoxicating fountain of knowledge or a refreshing escape from reality. I appreciate both aspects equally and would love more to experience their joy. </p>
<p>For a bit of history of this idea you can see <a href="https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding/issues/23">my proposal</a> for the ETH Berlin hackathon around this. I proposed creating an application that allowed anyone to mint an <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC721 Non-Fungible Token</a> to represent their physical book. Unfortunately, I ended up forming a different team and haven’t made much progress on realising this idea. I remain a sketchy solidity developer at best. That said, progress has been made. The concept is more mature in my mind, and the ethereum development landscape has come a long way since 2018. As my recent experience at the virtual <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/">ETH Denver</a> highlighted, while I didn’t manage to submit anything or even write much code I did get a sense for how far things have come. The <a href="https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth">scaffold-eth</a> repo seems like a great place to start, if I ever do manage to carve out time to create this.</p>
<p>I am convinced, and regularly reminded, how this idea could unlock so much hidden value. Book’s deserve to be read more than once, indeed there is something beautiful about a book having been read by many different people. Throughout the course of my studies in Edinburgh I have developed a fairly extensive personal collection of some truly fascinating books. I would love to have a means to share them with others in the area also interested in this material. And yes I am sure there exist ways for me to do this if I really tried, but I believe giving a book a memory has more implications that simply making it easily shareable.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions that this idea has raised over the years as I wondered about how it might be developed:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we digitally represent a physical book?</p>
 
 How would you link the physical book with it’s digital representation? 
 Would a QR Code work here? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we represent ownership?</p>
 
 What affordances should owners of books have? 
 What affordances should borrower’s have? 
 
 
 
<p>How would books within the virtual library be discovered, requested and returned?</p>
 
 How might you pay for postage of book between participants? 
 
<p>What if the model was to create primarily a local virtual library, but with exchanges between localities when requested?</p>
 
 Libraries have existed like this for ages. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>How might the digital representation of a book be used to embed it with a memory?</p>
 
 What information would the book want to store in it’s memory? 
 How might we represent the list of borrowers without compromising their privacy? 
 
<p>What if the book had an interface to the Community Mind allowing readers to ask and share questions that the material provoked in them?</p>
 
 How might being in possession of a book, either as a lender or borrower provide a mechanism for access control into other applications? E.g. the Community Mind. 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way individuals interact with eBook’s today? 
 How might this approach help us appreciate this medium more deeply? 
 
 
 
<p>How might we deter bad actors abusing the virtual library?</p>
 
 What is the incentive model? 
 Who decides? 
 What is to stop malicious actors creating virtual book’s unattached to physical copies?  
 What prevents people from stealing book’s they have borrowed? 
 
 
 Who stores the information around virtual books?  
 
<p>How are the search and discovery capabilities for these books mediated? </p>
 
 Who is mediating this? 
 
 
 What can we learn from the way book’s are shared and exchanged by travellers? 
 
<p>What if the things we bought came with a configurable and extendable digital memory?</p>
 
 How might this both simplify and expand the field of interaction enabled and perceived by those in proximity to the device? 
 
 
 
<p>As usual, a whole load of questions. Always there are questions. I present them here to provoke your own thought and inquiry around these ideas.</p>
 The Common Thread 
<p>Now, these ideas are not directly or intentionally linked. They are connected through me, and through my desire to produce ideas for software applications I would be motivated to create. Most developers you meet will have a few of these kicking around if you ask them. Over time all ideas evolve, dots connect and new insight emerges. The three ideas I presented trace the evolution of me, as much as anything else, from a computer science undergraduate to hopefully a final year PhD student. </p>
<p>It is only recently, from the new perspectives my research has provided me that I can reflect on all these ideas and clearly see a common thread in my thinking. In keeping with the article will summarise in a series of questions:</p>
 
 
<p>How might we use technology to experiment with the ways in which we can attach memory to the artifacts we place meaning in?</p>
 
 How might we design this memory to be open and extendable supporting permission-less innovation at the edges? 
 
 
 
<p>How might artifacts use this memory to intelligently interact with it’s environment and the people interacting with it?</p>
 
 How might such artifacts be designed to respect the privacy of those it interacts with while ensuring they are held accountable within a defined context? 
 
 
 
<p>What if we started to centralise information on artifacts, using our physical interaction with these artifacts to provide an alternative to the search engine for the discovery of information?</p>
 
 How might centralising information on the artifact, be that a location, object or thought transform the way  design digital systems and our ability to actively maintain collective memory at all scales of society? 
 
 
 How might context-relative informational norms for managing this memory be defined, communicated, upheld and evolved? 
 How might such artifacts change the way we identify and authenticate digitally? 
 
<p>How might this change the nature of the virtual spaces we interact in?</p>
 
 How might this provide natural limits to the participants within these spaces? 
 How might this create virtual neighbours and encourage trustworthy behaviour and positive relationships? 
 
 
 
<p>What are the descriptive and normative properties for structuring memory?</p>
 
 What are the properties of collective memory that we experience in the majority of virtual environments we exist in today and how do they differ from the ways we have managed memory in the physical reality across time and context? 
 
 
 
<p>It is an exploration of the structure of memory, how we might augment this structure with intention using digital technology and the implications of this on meaning making within both individuals and groups. To date this exploration has predominantly involved a few powerful entities constructing, owning and manipulating the digital structures of memory to meet their own agenda’s <a>5</a>. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that while working on this idea I created artifacts, both physical and digital, they hold meaning to me but are no longer only accessible too me. By committing thoughts to paper, code or words, they become remembered at least partially in a different kind of memory. Indeed this text itself is one of these artifacts.</p>
<p>I could go on, but it’s long already and I wrote this for fun more than anything. A break from the rigidity of academic writing that can be suffocating at times. A more detailed, formal analysis of these ideas is for another time. </p>
<p>Thanks for making it this far. These thoughts are pretty fresh, I would love to know what they triggered in you. </p>
 
 
 
 
<p>This is something my thoughts wander across on occasion. I am always drawn the ideas in quantum field theory where particles exist in a field of potential, it is only upon measurement that the field collapses. Feels like there is something interesting in having a similar mental model for identity.</p>

<p>One idea that stuck with me from this is location based authentication. This is one of the reasons I was so interested by the <a href="https://foam.space/location">FOAM project</a>, although it seems a long way from reaching it’s potential at the moment. Alternative, censorship resistant location services feels like something that would unlock a lot of value.</p>

Case by case there are always minor adjustments. Finally, there will be some form of Recommendation inviting the board to note key facts and approve the request.&nbsp; I believe it is time for the Chair or CEO, with the support of their senior data lead (#CDO) to ask that each board paper has a new section heading called &nbsp; “Data Attestation.”&nbsp; Some will favour this as an addition to the main flow, some as a new part of legal, others as an appendix; how and where matters little compared to its intent.</p><p>The intention of this new heading and section is that the board receives a *signed* declaration from the proposer(s) and independent data expert, that the proposer has:</p>  <p>proven attestation of the data used in the board paper,&nbsp;</p>  <p>proven rights to use the data</p>  <p>what difference/ delta third-party data makes the recommendation/ outcome</p>  <p>ensured, to best efforts, that there is no bias or selection in the data or analysis</p>  <p>clearly specifies any decision making that is or becomes automated&nbsp;</p>  <p>if relevant created the hypothesis before the analysis&nbsp;</p>  <p>run scenarios using different data and tools</p>  <p>not miss-led the board using data</p>  <p>highlighted the conflicts of interest between their BSC/KPI and the approval sort</p>  <br><p>In regards to the independent auditor, this should not be the companies financial auditor or data lake provider, this should be an independent forensic data expert. Audit suggests sampling; this is not about sampling. It is not about creating more hurdles or handing power to an external body, this is about third party verification and validation. A company you build a list of experts and cycle through them on a regular basis. The auditor does not need to see the board paper, the outcome from the analysis or the recommendations - they are there to check the attestation and efficacy from end to end.&nbsp; Critical will be proof of their expertise and a large insurance certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Whilst this is not the final wording you will use, it is the intent that is important, this does not remove data risks from the risk section.</p><p>Data Attestation</p><p>We certify by our signatures that we, the proposer and auditor, can prove to OurCompany PLC Board that we have provable <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">attestation and rights</a> to all the data used in the presentation of this paper. &nbsp; We have presented in this paper sensitivity of the selected data, model and tools and have provided evidence that different data and analysis tool selection equally favours the recommendation.&nbsp; We have tested and can verify that our data, analysis, insights and knowledge is traceable and justifiable.&nbsp; We declare that there are no Conflicts of Interest and no automation of decision making will result from this approval.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Why do this?</p><p>Whilst Directors are collectively accountable and responsible for the decisions they take, right now there is a gap in skills in data and many board members don’t know how to test the data that forms the basis on which they are being asked to approve. This is all new and a level of detail that requires deep expertise.&nbsp; This provides an additional line until such time that we can gain sufficient skills at the Board and test data properly.&nbsp; Yes, there is a high duty of care that is already intrinsic in anyone who presents a board paper, however, the data expertise and skills in the majority of senior levels are also well below what we need.&nbsp; If nothing else it will get those presenting to think carefully about data, bias and the ethics of their proposal.&nbsp;</p><br><br><br><br>

 Notes from the talk 
<p>Here's <a href="https://m.pge.com/#outages">the PG&amp;E outage map</a> that I scraped. The trick here is to open the browser developer tools network tab, then order resources by size and see if you can find the JSON resource that contains the most interesting data.</p>
<p>I scraped that outage data into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pge-outages">simonw/pge-outages</a> - here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pge-outages/commits">commit history</a> (over 40,000 commits now!)</p>
<p>The scraper code itself <a href="https://github.com/simonw/disaster-scrapers/blob/3eed6eca820e14e2f89db3910d1aece72717d387/pge.py">is here</a>. I wrote about the project in detail in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/">Tracking PG&amp;E outages by scraping to a git repo</a> - my database of outages database is at <a href="https://pge-outages.simonwillison.net/pge-outages/outages">pge-outages.simonwillison.net</a> and the animation I made of outages over time is attached to <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1188612004572880896">this tweet</a>.</p>

<p>In the video I used that as the template to create a new scraper for CDC vaccination data - their website is <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations</a> and the API I found using the browser developer tools is <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_data">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/COVIDData/getAjaxData?id=vaccination_data</a>.</p>

<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/uploads/web_dev_pillar_page.jpg</a> Why developer-first IAM&nbsp;? And why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters? <p>In my previous blog, <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a>, I discussed why the enterprises will demand for developer-first IAM. As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations.</p><p>The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/okta-auth0-announcement/">announcement</a> came yesterday on Okta’s intention to acquire Auth0 for $6.5B, which is probably 40 times the Auth0’s current revenue, is a true validation of the push towards developer-first IAM. However, this is not Okta’s first effort towards developer-first IAM. In 2017, Okta acquired Stormpath, a company that built tools to help developers to integrate login with their apps. Stormpath soon got absorbed into the Okta platform, but yet, Okta’s selling strategy didn’t change. It was always top-down.</p><p>In contrast to Okta, Auth0 follows a bottom-up sales strategy. One of the analysts I spoke to couple of years back told that the Auth0 name comes in an inquiry call only when a developer joins in. The acquisition of Auth0 will give Okta, the access to a broader market. So, it is important for Okta to let Auth0 run as an independent business, as also mentioned in the acquisition announcement.</p><p>Auth0 is not just about the product; but also the developer tooling, content and the developer community around it. Okta will surely benefit from this ecosystem around Auth0. Also, for years, Azure is the primary competitor of Okta, and Auth0 acquisition will make Okta stronger against Azure in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Late 2020, in one of the the earnings calls, the Okta announced that it sees the total market for its workplace identity management software as $30 billion, but it sees another, additional market for customer identity software at $25 billion. In the customer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven customer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements. The developer-first IAM is more critical in building a CIAM solution than in workforce IAM. In the latest Forrester <a href="https://wso2.com/resources/analyst-reports/the-forrester-wave-customer-identity-and-access-management-q4-2020/">report</a> on CIAM, Auth0 is way ahead of Okta, in terms of the current product offering. Okta will probably use Auth0 to increase their presence in the CIAM domain. Like Microsoft has Azure AD to focus on workforce IAM and Azure B2C to focus on CIAM, Auth0 could be Okta’s offering for&nbsp;CIAM.</p>Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020<p>When Auth0 was founded in 2013, it picked a less-saturated (even right to say fresh), future-driven market segment in IAM — developer-first. Developer-first is all about the experience. Auth0 did extremely well there. They were worried about building the right level of developer experience, rather than the feature set. Even today, Auth0 stands against others not because of their feature set, but the experience they build for developers.</p><p>The developer-first experience is not only about the product. How you build product features in a developer-first manner, probably contribute 50% of the total effort. The rest is about developer tooling, SDKs, and the content. Then again, the content is not just about the product. The larger portion of the content needs to be on how to integrate the product with a larger ecosystem — and also to teach developers the basic constructs, concepts and best practices in IAM. That helps to win the developer trust!</p>How the Auth0 website looked like in July,&nbsp;2014<p>Auth0’s vision towards developer-first IAM evolved over the past. The way the Auth0 website itself evolved in terms of the messaging and the presentation, reflects how much they want to be on the enterprisy side more today than in the past. As they claim Auth0 has 9000+ enterprise customers, which probably generate $150M annual revenue, the average sales value (ASV) would be around $16500. That probably means, the majority of Auth0 customers are in free/developer/developer pro tiers. So, it’s understandable why they want to bring in enterprise look and messaging, probably moving forward to focus more on top-down driven sales strategy. The big Contact Sales button over the Signup button on the Auth0 website today, sums up this direction to some extent.The Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 could probably strengthen this&nbsp;move.</p>How the Auth0 website looks like today (March,&nbsp;2021)<p>Like Microsoft’s acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B in 2018, Okta’s acquisition of Auth0 for $6.5B is a win for developers! Congratulations to both Auth0 and Okta and very much looking forward to see the journey of Auth0 together with&nbsp;Okta.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/why-developer-first-iam-and-why-oktas-auth0-acquisition-matters-9fff3dde81">Why developer-first IAM and why Okta’s Auth0 acquisition matters?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The before state and the after state, with the transformation being “trust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The before status is untrusted or less trusted, and because of specific actions, the end state will either be more trusting, eventually leading to being trusted (a final state) or less trusted, eventually leading back to untrusted.&nbsp; “Trust” itself never exists - it happens to be the word we use as the transition or transformation of state.&nbsp; However, as we socially don’t want to talk about the existing state of trust, I have in you or what status of trust I have after the activities/ actions we use the word “trust” to hide, confuse and remain unclear, perhaps we don’t know ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do you trust me? This is not a very good question; what do you trust me for would be far better, but that is often too raw, so we prefer the former.</p> Does this framing of trust help? <p>We might adopt it within the team to allow us to define the starting and endpoints and the journey, avoiding the word naked word “trust.”&nbsp; We also need to recognise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis">hysteresis</a>, which creates different paths between becoming more trustworthy and either losing trust (time and inaction) or the destruction of trust by action.&nbsp; I would expect everyone has a different hysteresis, and it will vary by age, experience, value, relationships, chemistry and time.&nbsp; We are all on the journey, but we also need to determine who is on the journey with us and if we want to walk at the pace of the slowest or leave a few behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps there is a good reason we find it hard to define trust?</p> <br>

How do you know your view is limited?&nbsp; The message is that if you cannot imagine or see the whole elephant but are limited or framed, it means you only get the outcome you expected.&nbsp; Our limits in experience, diversity, understanding bias, behaviour, path dependency, data structure means we are all blind but think we can see.</p><br><p>The 3rd elephant in the room</p><p>How do you eat an elephant? One small chunk at a time</p><p>It is too big to swallow whole, so cut up the big problem into smaller chunks.&nbsp; What is the problem I have to solve today?&nbsp; What is the work to be done?</p><p>It is easy to focus on and has items everyone can identify with, but someone must know it is an elephant to know the priorities and what tasks matter.</p><br><p>The 4th elephant in the room</p><p>When the client asks if you can do it cheaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Where priorities, budgets and the economics of short-termism override long term purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>Enough said.&nbsp;</p> <br>  <br> <br><br><br><p>Observation</p><p>What can I do that makes a difference?&nbsp; Knowing that the elephant in the room is more significant than anyone can understand (ESG, Climate, policy, behaviours, economics, geopolitics, humanity).&nbsp; I have to accept that I cannot have a complete HD picture of how everything connects but must accept that I am blind, but I can sense a small part and owe a duty to connect and share. Together we will work out the first chuck we need to eat, knowing that we cannot eat it all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What can I do that makes a difference?&nbsp;</p><br><p>ESG and Climate</p><p>We cannot individually do anything about it as it is too big, and my actions are too small. Some leaders do have a clear picture, but how can we break-up the big into smaller steps.&nbsp; Whilst I hope we can debate about the steps’ priorities, there is one action that each of us can take.</p><p>The problem that is too big</p><p>The majority of our agreed economic understanding rests in several supply/ demand models; how we have implemented the controls of the models varies across the globe, including market forces, regulation, government (state control) and stewardship codes.&nbsp;</p><p>Using a three-axis plot, where the axes are Values/ Principles, Accountability/ Obligations and Health of Eco-systems, we create an inner blue box in Figure 1 representing today’s overall economic market and controls.&nbsp; The values and principles tend to focus on self, accountability tends towards an elected authority (self-appointed, director or elected in a democracy) and the health of the ecosystem is focussed on only the one that you interact with (prime) but usually to ensure your health and not everyone’s. There are many exceptions to this model.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand from the <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business RoundTable 2019</a> report that companies in western capital markets are encouraged to think broader and include values that benefit society and all dependent ecosystems.&nbsp; The orange box in figure 1.</p><p>ESG thinking pushes all the boundaries further such that our values/ principles create a sustainable earth, society becomes accountable for its actions, and all ecosystems become healthy (this solves the boundary problem with circular economy thinking where you cannot ignore your actions have an effect on everyone else). This is the larger green box in figure 1</p><p>One elephant in the room is the requirement to move our economic model in three dimensions simultaneously.&nbsp; Walking forward is naturally comfortable (one dimension). Running uphill is harder (two dimensions). Going forward, upwards and outwards by defying gravity for man is challenging; however, this is the big picture elephant of ESG.&nbsp; Change everything at the same time.</p><br><br><p></p><p>Figure 1: The Big ESG problem</p><p>Should we move one direction at a time to make this more digestible?</p><p>There is a debate I believe we need to have in which direction we should focus as a priority?&nbsp; Figure 2 offers a suggestion. How do we move from where we are to where we want to be, in phases and not trying to do everything at once.&nbsp; However, whilst digestible, it might be too slow. We need to agree on a map, but who should own this?</p><p></p><p>Figure 2, where do we go first?</p><br><p>Where are we on the journey right now?</p><p>We are making progress for Directors to move from ShareHolder Primacy mandates to report on ESG Compliance Codes and more informed fiduciary duties. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-quality-and-effectiveness-of-audit-independent-review">Audit (finance) is a mess and is not reliable</a>, and it is not a solution for ESG. We are making progress with capital and investment markets with the addition of stewardship codes, forcing directors to comply as the investment basis they need starts to demand change. Thank you, <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter">Blackrock </a>and <a href="https://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/insight/equities/a-clear-perspective-on-esg-investing/">Hermes</a>.&nbsp; We are at the early stages of ESG and using public data to make informed investment decisions. However, I believe public data ESG assessment a significant problem as it introduces <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">quantum risk. </a>ESG public data has three fundamental issues as the boundaries we are dependent on have become less clear.</p><p>1. The quality of the data and implied knowledge we receive from our direct and dependent* eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>2. The quality of the knowledge we receive from our indirect and interdependent** eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>3. Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (assumption first boundary is direct and already in control in our risk model) - the reuse of the same “data” in several justifications.&nbsp;</p><p>* Dependent: balancing being able to get what I want by my own effort as contingent on or determined by the actions of someone else to make it work&nbsp;</p><p>** Interdependence combine my efforts with the efforts of others to achieve successful outcomes together but does not have to be mutual or controlled</p><br><p>Therefore I believe we need to look at a much deeper level of data sharing to achieve sustainability, and the first step is an ESG API for data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>How can we make this happen together?</p><p>Investment industry - move your power to follow and support those who implement a Data API for ESG data the quickest. Let’s get data with attestation to make better decisions.</p><p>Companies and Charities - collect the data and make it available publicly and not via a highly scripted and edited document.&nbsp; Drive out multiple uses of the same data and greenwashing</p><p>Academic/ Standards/ Global bodies - create a top-level ontology for this data set’s data sharing.&nbsp; Ensure that it is creative commons, owned by everyone to benefit everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Government - do your part and lead in collecting and publishing the government’s data - show the way.</p><p>Regulators - lobby to gain the power to strike off and fine Directors who are part of the creation of false data or are not fast enough to react</p><p>Media/ Journalism/&nbsp; - check the data/ analysis/ insights and don’t promote your click model negative headlines over purpose, knowing that the regulators will have the power on the particular issue of data to remove you.&nbsp; Be the body that brings about change and not the one the looks to score wins at society’s expense.</p><p>Researchers/ Consulting - Find ways to help and support the transformation, not by shaming or by creating best practice but by highlighting where we need to focus so we don’t leave anyone behind. Let’s not celebrate successes until we all find a sustainable place. We cannot run faster than our weakest partner.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals - we make change possible because somewhere in here, we have a role, and next is what we can all do.&nbsp; Personally commit to enabling that the data, with rights and attestation, can be collected in everything done.&nbsp; This will ensure I can make my choices based on data that has provenance and lineage.&nbsp;</p><br> Together, with data, we can achieve the sustainable goals we want. <br><br><br>

<p>When IndieVC arrived six years ago, it represented an exciting alternative to traditional venture investments. While revenue-based investing wasn't new, Indie made it mainstream, and started an important conversation: VC isn't appropriate for every business, so what's available for revenue-first, independent businesses that want to shoot for profitability instead of unicorn growth?</p><p>I was gutted today to <a href="https://medium.com/@bryce/the-end-of-indie-6e1b92d90b09">read about its demise</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We’ve not been shy in sharing the challenges of departing from the well-known narratives of startups and VCs. 4 years ago, it cost us 80% of our LP base. Unfortunately, as we’ve sought to lean more aggressively into scaling our investments and ideas behind an “Indie Economy” we’ve not found that same level of enthusiasm from the institutional LP market.</p></blockquote><p>Fundamentally, this shines an important light on a discrepancy in venture capital. Every VC fund depends on Limited Partners: typically institutional funds and the family offices of high net worth individuals that dedicate a portion of their investments to riskier, potentially high-yield businesses. While VC funds themselves claim to want to invest in the future, the investment managers in charge of LP money tend as a rule to be more risk averse. At the very least, in the same way that money from wealthy philanthropists is more opinionated than public funds, it is deployed according to the values of fund owners. Alternative models are met with reticence.</p><p>Radical changes in venture capital depend on radical changes in limited partner attitudes. So what does funding these kinds of sustainability-oriented businesses look like in light of this?</p><p>I suspect it looks like this: no funding. Instead, I wonder if we need to be building ecosystems like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">IndieHackers</a>, which operates as a community of solo entrepreneurs focused on making their side projects profitable. Instead of funding, members promote each other and offer skill shares and examples from their own experiences. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> has evolved into a similar kind of space: one where individuals and funded companies alike share new things they've released, get feedback, and build community.</p><p>The idea of no funding is problematic, because only a certain kind of person can get something off the ground with only their own resources. Those people are usually wealthier, and wealthier people tend to come from a very narrow demographic. On the other hand, venture capital disproportionately (and problematically) already goes to people from that narrow demographic. So, screw it. Maybe the counterculture has better answers.</p><p>I link a lot to the <a href="https://zebrasunite.org">Zebra movement</a>; its upcoming co-op and crowdfunding partnerships make a lot of sense to me. I'm warming up more and more to the idea of <a href="https://e2c.how/">exit to community</a> as an exit strategy, which allows companies to shift ownership to their ecosystems and maximize their distribution of equity. But these approaches are most effective when a business has been established (although co-operatives and community collaboration can certainly help). I think there needs to be more support for the first step: getting a business zygote off the ground.</p><p>VC funding has the effect of allowing founders to focus on product for an artificially long time. In contrast, aiming from profitability from the get-go forces you to build a business from day one. (A third option, building a product and running it for the love of it outside of a business context, is a radically different thing, and not really interchangeable with the first two.) The result is two radically different kinds of ventures with different roadmaps, mindsets, and approaches. One is shorter on profitability; the second is shorter on product innovation.</p><p>Venture investors, at their best, are like co-founders; being a part of a portfolio creates a kind of network effect that maximizes value. You get introductions and advice you might not receive otherwise. This could potentially be substituted with small communities of practice. But another way VC founders win is by sharing equity: it's common for early-stage founders to swap a little ownership with each other to spread the risk. If one startup succeeds, all the founders in the network see some upside. I can imagine a world where indie founders do something similar, in a revenue-bound way: an equity spread that is paid down as a percentage of profits. If one company becomes wildly popular, every founder who's struggling to do the same gets a boost.</p><p>The bottom line is this: we need an established, alternative route for starting businesses on the internet. For some companies, VC is the right thing - but it's not the right thing for every company. For the others, rather than hoping for positive iterations of VC, the best bet may simply be to create community with each other, co-operate where possible, and make money on their own terms. To aim to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3h86YunhXc">the million they never made</a>. It's not about riches; it's about sustainability.</p><p>I'm sad to see Indie VC go. But I do have hope for the future.</p>

<p>In Winter, the cap of dark on half the Earth is cocked to the north. So, as the planet spins, places farther north get more night in the winter. In McGrath, Alaska, at close to sixty-three degrees north, most of the day is dark. This would be discouraging to most people, but to Paul B. Walker it’s a blessing. Because Paul is a DXer.</p>
<p>In the radio world, DX stands for for distance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXing">DXing</a> is listening to distant radio stations. Thanks to that darkness, Paul listens to AM stations of all sizes, from Turkey to Tennessee, Thailand to Norway. And last night, New Zealand. Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newstalk_ZB">NewsTalk ZB</a>‘s main AM signal at 1035 on the AM (what used to be the) dial. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.distancecalculator.net/">distancecalculator.net</a>, the signal traveled 11886.34 km, or 7385.83 miles, across the face of the earth. In fact it flew much farther, since the signal needed to bounce up and down off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#E_layer">E layer</a> of the ionosphere and the surface of the ocean multiple times between Wellington and McGrath. While that distance is no big deal on shortwave (which bounces off a higher layer) and no deal at all on the Internet (where we are all <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/the-giant-zero-ce71920a2580">zero distance apart</a>), for a DXer that’s like hauling in a fish the size of a boat.</p>
<p>In this sense alone, Paul and I are kindred souls. As a boy and a young man, I was a devout DXer too. I logged thousands of AM and FM stations, from my homes in New Jersey and North Carolina. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/albums/72157701501898062">Here is a collection</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card#History">QSL cards</a> I got from stations to which I reported reception, in 1963, when I was a sophomore in high school.) More importantly, learning about all these distant stations sparked my interest in geography, electronics, geology, weather, astronomy, history and other adjacent fields. By the time I was a teen, I could draw all the states of the country, freehand, and name their capitals too. And that was on top of knowing on sight the likely purpose of every broadcast tower and antenna I saw. For example, I can tell you (and do in the mouse-over call-outs you’ll see if you click on the photo) what FM and TV station transmits from every antenna in this picture (of Mt. Wilson, above Los Angeles):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/50170283411/in/album-72157715298138792/"></a></p>
<p>As a photographer, I’ve shot thousands of pictures of towers and antennas. (See <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure/">here</a>.) In fact, that’s how I met Paul, who created and runs a private Facebook group called (no kidding) “I Take Pictures of Transmitter Sites.” This is not a small group. It has 14,100 members, and is one of the most active and engaging groups I have ever joined.</p>
<p>One reason it’s so active is that many of the members (and perhaps most of them) are, or were, engineers at radio and TV stations, and their knowledge of many topics, individually and collectively, is massive.</p>
<p>There is so much you need to know about the world if you’re a broadcast engineer.</p>
<p>On AM you have to know about ground conductivity, directional arrays (required so stations don’t interfere with each other), skywave signals such as the ones Paul catches and the effects of tower length on the sizes and shapes of the signals they radiate.</p>
<p>On FM you need to know the relative and combined advantages of antenna height and power, how different numbers of stacked antennas concentrate signal strength toward and below the horizon, the shadowing effects of buildings and terrain, and how the capacitive properties of the earth’s troposphere can sometimes bend signals so they go much farther than they would normally.</p>
<p>On TV you used to care about roughly the same issues as FM (which, in North America is sandwiched between the two original TV bands). Now you need to know a raft of stuff about how digital transmission works as well.</p>
<p>And that’s just a small sampling of what needs to be known in all three forms of broadcasting. And the largest body of knowledge in all three domains is what actually happens to signals in the physical world—which differs enormously from place to place, and region to region.</p>
<p>All of this gives the engineer a profound sense of what comprises the physical world, and how it helps, limits, and otherwise interacts with the electronic one. Everyone in the business is like the fool on the Beatles’ hill, seeing the sun going down and the world spinning round. And, while it’s not a dying profession, it’s a shrinking one occupied by especially stalwart souls. And my hat’s off to them.</p>
<p>By the way, you can actually hear Paul Walker for yourself, in&nbsp;two places. One is as a guest on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/55">this Reality 2.0 podcast</a>, which I did in January. The other is live on <a href="https://www.kskopublicradio.com/">KSKO/89.5</a> in McGrath, where he’s the program director. You don’t need to be a DXer to enjoy either one.</p>

Despite not having access to source code or debugging symbols t0st figured out the problem and managed to inject a custom DLL that hooked some internal functions and dropped load times down from 6m down to to 1m50s!</p>

  <p>Summary: I'm excited to announce a new, stable, production-ready pico engine. The latest release of the Pico Engine (1.X) provides a more modular design that better supports future enhancements and allows picos to be less dependent on a specific engine for operation.</p>


 


<p>
    The <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">pico engine</a> creates and manages picos.1  Picos (persistent compute objects) are internet-first, persistent, actors that are a good choice for building reactive systems—especially in the Internet of Things.
</p>

<p>
    Pico engine is the name we gave to the node.js <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/09/the_10-year_platform_shutting_down_kre.shtml">rewrite</a> of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/kre">Kynetx Rules Engine</a> back in 2017. <a href="https://github.com/farskipper">Matthew Wright</a> and <a href="https://github.com/b1conrad">Bruce Conrad</a> have been the principal developers of the pico engine. 
</p>

<p>
    The 2017 rewrite (Pico Engine 0.X) was a great success. When we <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/03/rebuilding_krl.shtml">started that project</a>, I listed speed, internet-first, small deployment, and attribute-based event authorization as the goals. The 0.X rewrite achieved all of these. The new engine was small enough to be able to be deployed on Raspberry Pi's and other small computers and yet was significantly faster. One <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/using_picos_for_byus_priority_registration.shtml">test we did</a> on a 2015 13" Macbook Pro handled 44,504 events in over 8000 separate picos in 35 minutes and 19 seconds. The throughput was 21 events per second or 47.6 milliseconds per request.
</p>

<p>
    This past year Matthew and Bruce reimplemented the pico engine with some significant improvements and architectural changes. We've released that as Pico Engine 1.X. This blog post discusses the improvements in Pico Engine 1.X, after a brief introduction of picos so you'll know why you should care. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Picos 

<p>
    Picos support an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actor model</a> of distributed computation. Picos have the following three properties. In response to a received message, 
</p>
 
     picos send messages to other picos—Picos <a>respond to events and queries</a> by running rules. Depending on the rules installed, a pico may raise events for itself or other picos. 
     picos create other picos—Picos can create and delete other picos, resulting in a parent-child hierarchy of picos.  
     picos change their internal state (which can affect their behavior when the next message received)—Each pico has a set of persistent variables that can only be affected by rules that run in response to events. 
 

<p>
      I <a>describe picos</a> and their <a>API and programming model</a> in more detail elsewhere. Event-driven systems, like those built from picos, can be used to create systems that meet the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/11/reactive_programming_with_picos.shtml">Reactive Manifesto</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite the parent-child hierarchy, picos can be arranged in a heterachical network for peer-to-peer communication and computation. As mentioned, picos support direct asynchronous messaging by sending events to other picos. Picos have an internal event bus for distributing those messages to rules installed in the pico. Rules in the pico are selected to run based on declarative <a href="http://docs.kynetx.com/display/docs/Event+Expressions">event expressions</a>. The pico matches events on the bus with event scenarios declared in the event expressions. Event expressions can specify simple single event matches, or complicated event relationships with temporal ordering. Rules whose event expressions match are scheduled for execution. Executing rules may raise additional events. More detail about the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189951/Event+Loop+Introduction">event loop and pico execution model</a> are available elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
    Each pico presents a unique <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189953/Event-Query+API">Event-Query API</a> that is dependent on the specific rulesets installed in the pico. Picos share nothing with other picos except through messages exchanged between them. Picos don't know and can't directly access or affect the internal state of another pico. </p>

<p>
    As a result of their design, picos exhibit the following important properties:
</p>

 
     Lock-free concurrency—picos respond to messages without locks.  
     Isolation—state changes in one pico cannot affect the state in other picos.  
     Location transparency—picos can live on multiple hosts and so computation can be scaled easily and across network boundaries.  
     Loose coupling—picos are only dependent on one another to the extent of their design.

 Pico Engine 1.0 

<p>
    Version 1.0 is a rewrite of pico-engine that introduces major improvements:
</p>
 
     A more pico-centric architecture that makes picos less dependent on a particular engine. 
     
     A more module design that supports future improvements and makes the engine code easier to maintain and understand.  
     Ruleset versioning and sharing to facilitate decentralized code sharing.
     
     Better, attribute-based channel policies for more secure system architecture.
     
     A new UI written in React that uses the event-query APIs of the picos themselves to render.
     
 

<p>
    One of our goals for future pico ecosystems is build not just distributed, but decentralized peer-to-peer systems. One of the features we'd very much like picos to have is the ability to move between engines seamlessly and with little friction. Pico engine 1.X better supports this roadmap.
</p>

<p>
    Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the primary components. The new engine is built on top of two primary modules: <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-framework"><code>pico-framework</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/select-when"><code>select-when</code></a>.
</p>


	<a></a>

<p>
    The <code>pico-framework</code> handles the building blocks of a Pico based system:
</p>
 
     Pico lifecycle—picos exist from the time they're created until they're deleted. 
     Pico parent/child relationships—Every pico, except for the root pico, has a parent. All picos may have children. 
     Events—picos respond to events based on the rules that are installed in the pico. The <code>pico-framework</code> makes use of the <code>select_when</code> library to create rules that <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189912/Event+Expressions">pattern match on event streams</a>. 
     Queries—picos can also respond to queries based on the rulesets that are installed in the pico. 
     Channels—Events and queries arrive on channels that are created and deleted. Access control policies for events and queries on a particular channel are also managed by the <code>pico-framework</code> 
     Rulesets—the framework manages installing, caching, flushing, and sandboxing rulesets. 
     Persistence—all picos have persistence and can manage persistent data. The <code>pico-framework</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/Level/levelup">Levelup</a> to define an interface for a LevelDB compatible data store and uses it to handle persistence of picos. 
 

<p>
    The <code>pico-framework</code> is language agnostic. <code>Pico-engine-core</code> combines <code>pico-framework</code> with facilities for rendering <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189890/KRL+Manual">KRL</a>, the rule language used to program rulesets. KRL rulesets are compiled to Javascript for <code>pico-framework</code>. <code>Pico-engine-core</code> contains a registry (transparent to the user) that caches compiled rulesets that have been installed in picos. In addition, <code>pico-engine-core</code> includes a number of <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189596/Libraries">standard libraries</a> for KRL. Rulesets are compiled to Javascript for execution. The Javascript produced by the rewrite is much more readable than that rendered by the 0.X engine. Because of the new modular design, rulesets written entirely in Javascript can be added to a pico system.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>pico engine</code> combines the <code>pico-engine-core</code> with a LevelDB-compliant persistent store, an HTTP server, a log writer, and a ruleset loader for full functionality. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Wrangler 
<p>
    <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1686929547/Wrangler">Wrangler</a> is the pico operating system. Wrangler presents an event-query API for picos that supports programatically managing the pico lifecycle, channels and policies, and rulesets.  Every pico created by the pico engine has Wrangler installed automatically to aid in programatically interacting with picos. 
</p>

<p>
    One of the goals of the new pico engine was to support picos moving between engines. Picos relied too heavily on direct interaction with the engine APIs in 0.X and thus were more tightly coupled to the engine than is necessary. The 1.0 engine minimizes the coupling to the largest extent possible. Wrangler, written in KRL, builds upon the core functionality provided by the engine to provide developers with an API for building pico systems programmatically. A great example of that is the Pico Engine Developer UI, discussed next. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Pico Engine Developer UI 

<p>
    Another significant change to the pico engine with the 1.0 release was a rewritten <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/32585778/Developer+UI">Developer UI</a>. In 0.X, the UI was hard coded into the engine. The 1.X UI is a single page web application (SPA) written in React. The SPA uses an API that the engine provides to get the channel identifier (ECI) for the root pico in the engine. The UI SPA uses that ECI to connect to the API implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/blob/master/packages/pico-engine/krl/io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl"><code>io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl</code></a> ruleset (which is installed automatically in every pico).
</p>

<p>
    Figure 2 shows the initial Developer UI screen. The display is the network of picos in the engine. Black lines represent parent-child relationships and form a tree with the root pico at the root. The pink lines are subscriptions between picos—two-way channels formed by exchanging ECIs. Subscriptions are used to form peer-to-peer (heterachical) relationships between picos and do no necessarily have to be on the same engine. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Pico Engine UI (click to enlarge)


<p>
    When a box representing a pico in the Developer UI is clicked, the display shows an interface for performing actions on the pico as shown in Figure 3. The interface shows a number of tabs. 
</p>
 
     The About tab shows information about the pico, including its parent and children. The interface allows information about the pico to be changed and new children to be created.
     
     The Rulesets tab shows any rulesets installed in the pico, allows them to be flushed from the ruleset cache, and for new rulesets to be installed.
     
     The Channels tab is used to manage channels and channel policies.
     
     The Logging tab shows execution logs for the pico.
     
     The Testing tab provides an interface for exercising the event-query APIs that the rulesets installed in the pico provide.
     
     The Subscriptions tab provides an interface for managing the pico's subscriptions and creating new ones.
     
 


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Pico Developer Interface (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Because the Developer UI is just using the APIs provided by the pico, everything it does (and more) can be done programatically by code running in the picos themselves. Most useful pico systems will be created and managed programmatically using Wrangler. The Developer UI provides a convenient console for exploring and testing during development. The <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine/blob/master/packages/pico-engine/krl/io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl"><code>io.picolabs.pico-engine-ui.krl</code></a> ruleset can be replaced or augmented by another ruleset the developer installs on the pico to provide a different interface to the pico. Interesting pico-based system will have applications that interact with their APIs to present the user interface. For example, <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io/#/login">Manifold</a> is a SPA written in React that creates a system of picos for use in IoT applications.

<p>
    In addition to the work on the engine itself, one of the primary workstreams at present is to complete Bruce Conrad's excellent work to use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDs and DIDComm</a> as the basis for inter-pico communication, called ACA-Pico (Aries Cloud Agent - Pico). We're <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dWUFyL7u6OQkhnPObJOOlV-U2LDoHpF-ZQLj3hXbjA/edit">holding monthly meetings</a> and there's a <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico">repository of current work</a> complete with <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico/issues">issues</a>. This work is important because it will replace the current <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/186843209/Managing+Subscriptions">subscriptions</a> method of connecting heterarchies of picos with DIDComm. This has the obvious advantages of being more secure and aligned with an important emerging standard. More importantly, because DIDComm is protocological, this will support protocol-based interactions between picos, including <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">credential exchange</a>.

   This week I got involved with the VaccinateCA effort. We are trying to end the pandemic a little earlier, by building the most accurate database possible of vaccination locations and availability in California. 

 VaccinateCA 
 I’ve been following this project for a while through Twitter, mainly via Patrick McKenzie - here’s his tweet about the project from January 20th.

  <p>This week I got involved with the <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">VaccinateCA</a> effort. We are trying to end the pandemic a little earlier, by building the most accurate database possible of vaccination locations and availability in California.</p>

 VaccinateCA 
<p>I’ve been following this project for a while through Twitter, mainly via <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a> - here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1351942635682816002">his tweet</a> about the project from January 20th.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://t.co/JrD5mb4TAN">https://t.co/JrD5mb4TAN</a> calls medical professionals daily to ask who they could vaccinate and how to get in line. We publish this, covering the entire state of California, to help more people get their vaccines faster. Please tell your friends and networks.</p>- Patrick McKenzie (@patio11) <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1351942635682816002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>The core idea is one of those things that sounds obviously correct the moment you hear it. The Covid vaccination roll-out is decentralized and pretty chaotic. VaccinateCA figured out that the best way to figure out where the vaccine is available is to call the places that are distributing it - pharmacies, hospitals, clinics - as often as possible and ask if they have any in stock, who is eligible for the shot and how people can sign up for an appointment.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.vaccinateca.com/what-weve-learned-so-far/">What We've Learned (So Far)</a> by Patrick talks about lessons learned in the first 42 days of the project.</p>
<p>There are three public-facing components to VaccinateCA:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/">www.vaccinateca.com</a> is a website to help you find available vaccines near you. 
 <code>help.vaccinateca</code> is the web app used by volunteers who make calls - it provides a script and buttons to submit information gleaned from the call. If you’re interested in volunteering there’s <a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/about-us">information on the website</a>. 
 <code>api.vaccinateca</code> is the public API, which is <a href="https://docs.vaccinateca.com/reference">documented here</a> and is also used by the end-user facing website. It provides a full dump of collected location data, plus information on county policies and large-scale providers (pharmacy chains, health care providers). 
 
<p>The system currently mostly runs on <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, and takes advantage of pretty much every feature of that platform.</p>
 Why I got involved 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/obra">Jesse Vincent</a> convinced me to get involved. It turns out to be a perfect fit for both my interests and my skills and experience.</p>
<p>I’ve built crowdsourcing platforms before - for <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2009/Dec/20/crowdsourcing/">MP’s expense reports at the Guardian</a>, and then for conference and event listings with our startup, Lanyrd.</p>
<p>VaccinateCA is a very data-heavy organization: the key goal is to build a comprehensive database of vaccine locations and availability. My background in data journalism and the last three years I’ve spent working on <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> have given me a wealth of relevant experience here.</p>
<p>And finally… VaccinateCA are quickly running up against the limits of what you can sensibly do with Airtable - especially given Airtable’s hard limit at 100,000 records. They need to port critical tables to a custom PostgreSQL database, while maintaining as much as possible the agility that Airtable has enabled for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a great fit for this kind of challenge, and I know quite a bit about both Django and using Django to quickly build robust, scalable and maintainable applications!</p>
<p>So I spent this week starting a Django replacement for the Airtable backend used by the volunteer calling application. I hope to get to feature parity (at least as an API backend that the application can write to) in the next few days, to demonstrate that a switch-over is both possible and a good idea.</p>
 What about Datasette? 
<p>On Monday I spun up a Datasette instance at <a href="https://vaccinateca.datasette.io/">vaccinateca.datasette.io</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/vaccinate-ca-datasette/">underlying repository</a>) against data from the public VaccinateCA API. The map visualization of <a href="https://vaccinateca.datasette.io/vaccinateca/locations?_facet=Affiliation&amp;_facet=Latest+report+yes%3F&amp;_facet_array=Availability+Info">all of the locations</a> instantly proved useful in helping spot locations that had incorrectly been located with latitudes and longitudes outside of California.</p>
<p>I hope to use Datasette for a variety of tasks like this, but it shouldn’t be the core of the solution. VaccinateCA is the perfect example of a problem that needs to be solved with <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">Boring Technology</a> - it needs to Just Work, and time that could be spent learning exciting new technologies needs to be spent building what’s needed as quickly, robustly and risk-free as possible.</p>
<p>That said, I’m already starting to experiment with the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.JSONField">JSONField</a> introduced in Django 3.1 - I’m hoping that a few JSON columns can help compensate for the lack of flexibility compared to Airtable, which makes it ridiculously easy for anyone to add additional columns.</p>
<p>(To be fair JSONField has been a feature of the Django PostgreSQL Django extension since <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/1.9/">version 1.9 in 2015</a> so it’s just about made it into the boring technology bucket by now.)</p>
 Also this week 
<p>Working on VaccinateCA has given me a chance to use some of my tools in new and interesting ways, so I got to ship a bunch of small fixes, detailed in <a>Releases this week</a> below.</p>
<p>On Friday I gave a talk at <a href="https://speakeasyjs.com/">Speakeasy JS</a>, "the JavaScript meetup for 🥼 mad science, 🧙‍♂️ hacking, and 🧪 experiments" about why "SQL in your client-side JavaScript is a great idea". The video for that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyOYqJGrWak">is on YouTube</a> and I plan to provide a full write-up soon.</p>
<p>I also recorded a five minute lightning talk about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">Git Scraping</a> for next week's <a href="https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2021/">NICAR 2021</a> data journalism conference.</p>
<p>I also made a few small cosmetic upgrades to the way tags are displayed on my blog - they now show with a rounded border and purple background, and include a count of items published with that tag. My <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/">tags page</a> is one example of where I've now applied this style.</p>

  <p>Summary:      Picos make building decentralized applications easy. This blog post shows a heterarchical sensor network can built using picos.</p>

<p>
    Picos are designed to form heterarchical, or peer-to-peer, networks by connecting directly with each other. Because <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/announcing_pico_engine_10.shtml#picos">picos use an actor model of distributed computation</a>, parent-child relationships are very important. When a pico creates another pico, we say that it is the parent and the pico that got created is the child. The parent-child connection allows the creating pico to perform life-cycle management tasks on the newly minted pico such as installing rulesets or even deleting it. And the new pico can create children of its own, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
    Building a system of picos for a specific application requires programming them to perform the proper lifecycle management tasks to create the picos that model the application. <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1686929547/Wrangler">Wrangler is a ruleset installed in every pico automatically</a> that is the pico operating system. Wrangler provides rules and functions for performing these life-cycle management tasks.
</p>

<p>
    Building a pico application can rarely rely on the hierarchical parent-child relationships that are created as picos are managed. Instead, picos create connections between picos by creating what are called <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/186843209/Managing+Subscriptions">subscriptions</a>, providing bi-directional channels used for raising events to and making queries of the other pico.
</p>

<p>
    This diagram shows a network of temperature sensors built using picos. In the diagram, black lines are parent-child relationships, while pink lines are peer-to-peer relationships between picos.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Temperature Sensor Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    There are two picos (one salmon and the other green) labeled a "Sensor Community". These are used for management of the temperature sensor picos (which are purple). These community picos are performing life-cycle management of the various sensor picos that are their children. They can be used to create new sensor picos and delete those no longer needed. Their programming determines what rulesets are installed in the sensor picos. Because of the rulesets installed, they control things like whether the sensor pico is active and how often if updates its temperature. These communities might represent different floors of a building or different departments on a large campus. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite the fact that there are two different communities of temperature sensors, the pink lines tell us that there is a network of connections that spans the hierarchical communities to create a single connected graph of sensors. In this case, the sensor picos are programmed to use a gossip protocol to share temperature information and threshold violations with each other. They use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> to keep track of the number of threshold violations currently occuring in the network. 
</p>

<p>
    The community picos are not involved in the network interactions of the sensor picos. The sensor network operates independently of the community picos and does not rely on them for communication. Astute readers will note that both communities are both children of a "root" pico. That's an artifact of the way I built this, not a requirement. Every pico engine has a root pico that has no parent. These two communities could have been built on different engines and still created a sensor network that spanned multiple communities operating on multiple engines. 
</p>

<p>
    Building decentralized networks of picos is relatively easy because picos provide support for many of the difficult tasks. The actor model of picos makes them naturally concurrent without the need for locks. Picos have persistent, independent state so they do not depend on external data stores. Picos have a persistent identity—they exist with a single identity from the time of their creation until they are deleted. Picos are persistently available, always on and ready to receive messages. You can see more about the programming that goes into creating these systems in these lessons: <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/21168151/Pico-Based+Systems+Lesson">Pico-Based Systems</a> and <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/21659676/Pico+to+Pico+Subscriptions+Lesson">Pico to Pico Subscriptions</a>.

The reality of leadership and management is that it is a complex adaptive system, and context enables your nature to emerge and nurturing to mature.&nbsp; This is important because we also know there is a link between strategy, styles (leadership) and business structures.&nbsp; In this article, we will unpack how your “nature or nurture” thinking-structure, affects outcomes.&nbsp; Your thinking-structure is also a complex adaptive system as your peers and customers thinking, your companies “culture of structure” thinking affect you. BUT have you considered how your data structure and your data philosophy will have a direct and significant impact on outcomes?&nbsp; <br><p>I’ve known that my neurodiversity package (severe dyslexia, mild high functioning autism, ADHD) informs how I interrupt the world as my “biological cortex” and gut-brain axis structures process sensory data and memory uniquely. I cannot modify my mind or brain’s basic structure any more than I could change my fingerprint, core DNA or the colour of my eyes; however, I can play with my microbiome. It’s an essential part of what makes me, me. My chemical and biological structures enable me to make sense of the world in my way.&nbsp; Communication (language, words, music, song, dance, art, sound, movement, gesture) enables us to share the sense we create from patterns and align with others who approximate the same (tribe).&nbsp; How we actually make sense (learn) is intensely debated, with one camp believing that language is our sense maker, assuming that we might observe patterns but cannot understand it without language? Other than that, we make sense and then create a language to communicate the insight we have gained.&nbsp; Irrespective, language allows us to both structure and navigate our space and share the journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Is how we structure or frame something nature or nurture? <p>Why does this question matter? We all read, speak and write differently, we all understand differently, but we use questions to clarify understanding, check meaning and create common interruption.&nbsp; How we individually structure meaning is determined from the perspective we have been given (nature), from what we have been taught (nurture) and what we align to (bias).&nbsp; Our structure is an ontology*. Imagine putting one person from each of our worlds religions or faith groups into a room, but assume no-one can speak the same language.&nbsp; How and what would they agree or disagree about as there is no common structure (ontology)</p><p>* An ontology is “the set of things whose existence is acknowledged by a particular theory or system of thought.”&nbsp; (The Oxford Companion to Philosophy)&nbsp;</p><p>By way of example, the word “Evil” creates meaning for you as soon as you read it. Without a doubt, the nature of evil is a complex and nuanced area too often glossed over in a rush to present or evaluate the defences and theodicies. Let’s unpack the word using the super book “<a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/making-evil/dr-julia-shaw/9781786891327">Making Evil</a>” by <a href="https://www.drjuliashaw.com/">Dr Julia Shaw</a>. &nbsp; Evil is an unavoidable part of life that we all encounter as we all suffer in one sense or another, but what makes something evil is a matter of framing/ structure/ ontology. “Natural evil” is the pain and suffering that arises from the natural world’s functioning or malfunctioning. “Moral evil” is the pain and suffering that results from conscious human action or inaction. It is evil where a person or people are to blame for the suffering that occurs; a crucial point is the blameworthiness of the person at fault. Moral evil, at its heart, results from the free choice of a moral agent. If we just look at the consequences, it is not always possible to tell whether moral evil has taken place or not; we have many mitigations. Therefore a level of moral evil can be found in the degree of intention and consequence.&nbsp; However, if we compare death rates for natural evil (suffering) and moral evil at an extreme people killing people, the latter is a rounding error in the form of suffering in the world. The point is that by framing something, I can create a structure for understanding.

Our data’s very structure (designed or otherwise) creates bias, prevents certain outcomes from being created, and creates others. The reality is that our structures (ontologies) have already committed to the success or failure of your data strategy and business model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that our structures (ontologies) have already committed to the success or failure of your data strategy and business model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a leader, have you asked what is the structure (ontology) of our data? Has your team informed you about the limitations of your data structure/ ontology on decision making? The <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo">CDO</a> should be tasked with providing a map, matrix or translation table showing data sets linkage to ontologies and the implications. As we now depend on ecosystem data, do you know the ontologies of others in your ecosystem and how that affects your decision making capability?&nbsp; Gaps in <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html?q=portability">data sharing</a> ontologies affect decisions and create <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/quantum-risk-a-wicked-problem-that-emerges-at-the-boundaries-of-our-data-dependency-2dc36dfb21fb">Quantum Risk</a>.&nbsp; What assumptions do we make about data without knowing is essential for investment risk, as we are using public ESG data to make capital allocation decisions without knowing where the data came from, what ontology the data has, if the right analysis tools have been used.&nbsp;</p><br><p>----</p> Implication 1.&nbsp; Management and Leadership <p>The figure-of-8 diagram below shows two interconnected loops. The connection is the mindset of the leader. Outstanding leadership with an open mindset can choose which loop is best at this time.&nbsp; Poor leadership will stick to the lower closed mindset loop.&nbsp; The lower loop never starts with a different way of asking questions or solving problems.&nbsp; Those in this self-confirming loop stick to the same biases, same decisions and same paradigms.&nbsp; This creates the ideas of one culture and a fixed culture. &nbsp; We have our way of doing it.&nbsp; The approach is consistency; the methods are highly efficient and based on the $1bn profit last year, we know it works, and we should continue to do the same.&nbsp; The reward mechanism, KPI and balanced scorecards are structured to keep the same highly efficient and effective thinking.&nbsp; Is assumes that yesterday, today and tomorrow will create the same outcomes if we do it the same.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with this, and during times of stability, many have made vast fortunes with this approach.</p><p>Great leaders follow this loop when it is right but can also swop to the upper loop.&nbsp; Such leaders sense a change. Such a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift">paradigm shift</a>”, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, “is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a scientific discipline”.&nbsp; This shift means there is a new structure to understand (ontology). This paradigm shift has a new structure, which means that there is a need to determine the new culture to create value with a new structure.&nbsp; Together a team will form an approach.&nbsp; At this point, the team will question the shift and the assumptions that have led to change, setting a new mindset for the new order.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically - understanding structure and ontology is crucial, and it is why I believe Data Philosophy, Data Ontology and better decisions based on data are current board issues. Still, they require new skills, are highly detailed, and often require a mind shift.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding structure and ontology is crucial for a data-driven digital board.</p><br><p></p><br> Implication 2.&nbsp; AI and Automation <p>The Data Paradox.&nbsp; How are you supposed to know how to create questions about something that you did not know we had to ask a question of?</p><p>Every child reads a book differently. A child learns to use questions to check and refine understanding. Every software engineer reads code differently. A software engineer is forced to check their understanding of the code and function by asking questions and by being asked questions. Whilst every AI will create sense from the data differently (ontology and code), right now, an AI cannot check its understanding of data by asking questions! Who could/would/ should the AI ask the clarification question of, and how do we check the person who answered is without bias? (Note I am not speaking about <a href="https://medium.com/dataseries/training-machine-learning-models-to-ask-the-right-questions-b6235dd5872b">AQA</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sherlock Holmes in The Great Game says, “people do not like telling you things; they love to contradict you. Therefore if you want smart answers, do not ask a question. Instead, give a wrong answer or ask a question in such a way that it already contains the wrong information. It is highly likely that people will correct you”.&nbsp; Do you do this to your data, or can you do this to your AI?</p><p>Today (Feb 2021), we cannot write an “algorithm” that detects if AI is going to create harm (evil). Partly because we cannot agree on “harm”, we cannot determine the unintended consequences, and we cannot bound harm for a person vs society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is a drive towards automation for efficiency based on the analysis of data. As a Director, are you capable of asking the right questions to determine bias and prejudice created in the automated processes, the data structures, different ontologies, data attestation or bias in the processes?&nbsp; Given Directors are accountable and responsible - indeed, this is a skill all board needs. Where is the audit and quota for these skills, can you prove it is available to the board?&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<p>Historic milestones don’t always line up with large round numbers on our calendars. For example, I suggest that the 1950s ended with the assassination of JFK in late 1963, and the rise of British Rock, led by the Beatles, in 1964. I also suggest that&nbsp;the 1960s didn’t end until Nixon resigned, and disco took off, in 1974.</p>
<p>It has likewise been suggested that the 20th century actually began with the assassination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria">Archduke Ferdinand</a> and the start of WWI, in 1914. While that and my other claims might be arguable, you might at least agree that there’s no need for historic shifts to align with two or more zeros on a calendar—and that in most cases they don’t.</p>
<p>So I’m here to suggest that the 21st century began in 2020 with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">Covid-19 pandemic</a> and the fall of Donald Trump. (And I mean that literally. Social media platforms were Trump’s man’s stage, and the whole of them dropped him, as if through a trap door, on the occasion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">the storming of the U.S. Capitol</a> by his supporters on January 6, 2021. Whether you liked that or not is beside the facticity of it.)</p>
<p>Things are not the same now. For example, over the coming years, we may never hug, shake hands, or comfortably sit next to strangers again.</p>
<p>But I’m bringing this up for another reason:&nbsp;I think the future we wrote about in <a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, in <a href="http://worldofends.com">World of Ends</a>, in<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527"> The Intention Economy</a>, and in other optimistic expressions during the first two decades of the 21st Century may finally be ready to arrive.</p>
<p>At least that’s the feeling I get when I listen to <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=Digital%20Tipping%20Point%3A%20Doc%20Searls">an interview</a> I&nbsp;did with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/digitaltippingpoint/">Christian Einfeldt</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/einfeldt">@einfeldt</a>) at a San Diego tech conference in April, 2004—and that I just discovered recently in the Internet Archive. The interview was for a film to be called “Digital Tipping Point.” Here are its eleven parts, all just a few minutes long:</p>

<p>The title is a riff on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>‘s book&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tipping_Point">The Tipping Point</a>, which came out in 2000, same year as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cluetrain_Manifesto">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. The tipping point I sensed four years later was, I now believe, a foreshadow of now, and only suggested by the successes of the open source movement and independent personal publishing in the form of blogs, both of which I was high on at the time.</p>
<p>What followed in the decade after the interview were the rise of social networks, of smart mobile phones and of what we now call Big Tech. While I don’t expect those to end in 2021, I do expect that we will finally see&nbsp; the rise of personal agency and of constructive social movements, which I felt swelling in 2004.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong about that. But I am sure that we are now experiencing the millennial shift we expected when civilization’s odometer rolled past 2000.</p>

<p>February 22,&nbsp;2021</p><p>The Honorable Xavier&nbsp;Becerra</p><p>California State&nbsp;Capitol</p><p>SENT VIA&nbsp;EMAIL</p><p>Dear Attorney General&nbsp;Becerra,</p><p>On behalf of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, an organization of blockchain and virtual currency businesses in California, I write to bring to your attention a pending federal regulation that would preempt and refute many of the important privacy protections your office has led the nation on. On December 18, 2020 the US Treasury led by Steve Mnuchin, released a concerning proposed rule that would put into place first of its kind reporting requirements for virtual currencies and digital assets. The agency initially proposed a 15 day comment period over the holidays due to unsubstantiated ‘national security concerns’. After widespread pushback from private citizens, virtual currency companies and members of Congress, the Treasury Department provided another 15 days for reporting requirements and an additional 45 for recordkeeping and counterparting reporting. Fortunately the Biden administration, faced with an avalanche of such poorly thought out rules, gave a 60 day pause and extension on the rulemaking and now the industry is facing a March 1st deadline to comment on a rule that would significantly stifle innovation, limit access to these new products and massively extend the reach of government surveillance of financial transactions far beyond the Bank Secrecy Act&nbsp;(BSA).</p><p>If it were to become policy, this rule would preempt California’s consumer privacy laws, significantly weakening the data privacy protections around financial information voters deemed important when approving the Californian Privacy Rights Act in November of 2020. While many parties have opined on the slapdash process and lack of clarity in the proposed rule, we do not believe that the blatant and far reaching consumer privacy implications have been brought to attention&nbsp;. Your office has led the charge implementing and enforcing the nation’s first and strongest consumer privacy framework, particularly for sensitive financial information. Because of this, we wanted to raise the following concerns with the proposed FinCEN rulemaking and ask for your action. The proposed rule complements existing BSA requirements applicable to banks and MSBs (money service business) by proposing to add reporting requirements for virtual currency transactions exceeding $10,000 in value. Pursuant to the proposed rule, banks and MSBs will have 15 days from the date on which a reportable transaction occurs to file a report with FinCEN. Further, this proposed rule would require banks and MSBs to keep&nbsp;records</p><p>of a customer’s virtual currency transactions and counterparties, including verifying the identity of their customers, if a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet and the transaction is greater than&nbsp;$3,000.</p><p>Our concerns with the consumer privacy implications of this proposed rule are&nbsp;twofold:</p><p>First, the proposed rule’s requirement that MSB’s collect identifying information associated with wallet addresses will create reporting that extends well beyond the intent of the rule or the transaction. According to the EFF “For some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, transaction data — including users’ Bitcoin addresses — is permanently recorded on a public blockchain. That means that if you know the name of the user associated with a particular Bitcoin address, you can glean information about all of their Bitcoin transactions that use that address.” California consumers do not have the expectation that a future reporting requirement will link to their entire financial transaction history from that&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Second, this rule creates requirements for disclosure of counterparty information beyond what the BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to collect. It wouldn’t only require these businesses to collect information about their own customers, but also the information of anyone who transacts with those customers using their own cryptocurrency wallets. Specifically:</p>  The name and physical address of each counterparty to the transaction of the financial institution’s customer;  Other counterparty information the Secretary may prescribe as mandatory on the reporting form for transactions subject to reporting pursuant to § 1010.316(b);  Any other information that uniquely identifies the transaction, the accounts, and, to the extent reasonably available, the parties involved;  <p>Unlike KYC (know your customer) requirements which arise from a direct customer relationship, KYCC (know your customer’s counterparty) requirements unreasonably obligate non-customers to provide personally identifying information to a VASP/MSB (virtual asset service provide/money services business) they do not know or do business with, and whose security and privacy practices they have not evaluated, simply because they happen to transact with one of its customers.</p><p>In its haste, the Treasury did not adequately consider the impact of these rules on consumer privacy for those that choose to use virtual currency and would create large scale government surveillance of small personal transactions. We call upon your leadership and expertise in this space to once again lead the charge for consumer protections and submit a comment letter opposing these portions of the proposed rule. Thank you for your consideration and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Ally Medina</p><p>Director, Blockchain Advocacy Coalition</p>

<p>Loved reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">Ask Your Developer: How to Harness the Power of Software Developers and Win in the 21st Century</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff&nbsp;Lawson</a>.</p><p>Jeff says in the book that every company is on a journey to becoming a software company and everyone is starting to see the world through the lens of software. He defines the term, software person. A software person is not necessarily a developer, it’s anybody who, when faced with a problem, asks the question, how can software solve this&nbsp;problem?</p> Build vs. Buy (or vs.&nbsp;Die) <p>In the book, Jeff takes the popular debate, build vs. buy, to another dimension; build vs die. As every company is becoming a software company, the competitive advantage they build is in the software they build. When software becomes the interface where the services you offer, meet the customers; unless you build it in the way you want; you&nbsp;die!</p><p>Building what you want gives you the freedom to experiment (or innovate). More you experiment or the ability to experiment more, gives you the edge to understand your customers more. Hence, you grow your business.</p><p>Build, does not necessarily mean building everything from scratch. You don’t build anything that already exists, given that it provides what you need. You only build things that are core to your business, which help building your competitive advantage over all the others. The rest, or the building blocks that help you build what you wish are part of the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p> The Digital Supply&nbsp;Chain <p>Uber, for example, uses 4000+ microservices internally. However, not all of them are developed by Uber itself. Uber uses Google Maps API to pull out location data, the Twilio API to facilitate communication between passengers and drivers and many other APIs. All these APIs are coming from the digital supply chain Uber picks to build its product. Then again, these building blocks in Uber’s digital supply chain are also available to Lyft, and other Uber competitors around the world. What brings Uber the competitive advantage is in what they&nbsp;build!</p><p>The software you build, can be your product, at the same time it can be a building block for another product. Google Maps is Google’s product, however the Google Maps API is a building block for Uber. Alexa is a product of Amazon, however Alexa API is a a building block for&nbsp;Nissan.</p><p>Picking the right digital supply chain is equally important as what you pick to build. Think, what if Uber had to build something equivalent to Google Maps from the scratch? From 2016 to 2018, Uber paid 58M USD to Google for using Google Maps. But, then again it’s a peanut, when you compare that with their revenue in 2019, which was 14.15 billion&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Having the right digital supply chain helps you to optimize your development team to build only what you need and no more. Instagram, for example, was only a 13 people team, when Facebook acquired it for $1B in 2012; and WhatsApp team was only 50, when Facebook acquired it for $19B in&nbsp;2014.</p> Build Your Own Identity&nbsp;Stack? <p>Every service you develop, every API you design, every device you use, every person you interact with, will have a managed identity, and in today’s hyperconnected world, the Identity integrations with these business applications and systems, is going to be critical.</p><p>Going back to the build vs. die debate; do you still have to build the Identity stack to gain the competitive advantage in your business? If you are in the Identity business, of course yes, for all the others no. Identity stack you need to build your product is a building block in the digital supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>You never worried about building a TCP/IP stack yourself, so, don’t worry about building an Identity stack yourself. However, over the time we have spoken to over a thousand companies (hundreds of them are WSO2 customers), and in most of the cases they bring in unique identity requirements. The uniqueness comes in those requirements are specific to the industry they are in and also specific to the complexity of the business problem they want to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Identity is core to any business, and how you manage identity will also help you in building competitive advantage. At WSO2, we have worked with 90% of the Identity Server customers to solve complex identity problems. Identity Server is open source, and if the business problem is straightforward, they don’t even talk to us, they simply use the product as it is. However, when we work with complex Identity requirements, we have extended the product to solve specific business problems.</p><p>Building these extensions, specific to unique business requirements helped companies to differentiate themselves from others. Then again, they didn’t want to build everything from scratch — rather they started with what’s common (and available to everyone) and started innovating on that. That drastically reduced the time-to-market, and also gave the freedom to innovate.</p><p>I don’t intend to contradict with what I mentioned before, that the Identity stack is part of the digital supply chain you pick, however, the Identity stack you pick for the digital supply chain should have the flexibility to extend with minimal effort to build business requirements specific to your business.</p> The TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>In the 70’s, having support for TCP/IP in a product was considered to be a competitive advantage. Today, it’s given, and nobody worries about TCP/IP support; it’s everywhere.</p><p>Ian Glazer from Salesforce, mentioned in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QZPd584l6o&amp;ab_channel=KuppingerCole">keynote</a> at the European Identity Conference 2016 that, it’s the TCP/IP moment in Identity now. He in fact talked about the open standards (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth, SCIM, XACML and so on) in the Identity domain, and how they are going to be part of every product, so no Identity vendor is going to gain competitive advantage just by supporting the open standards. RFPs looking for Identity products will not even worry about asking support for these open standards.</p> The Next TCP/IP Moment in&nbsp;Identity <p>Developers do not worry about building a TCP/IP stack, or even worrying about TCP/IP while building software. We believe, the Identity integrations with business applications and systems need to be developer-first (or developer-focused) with the right level of abstractions and tools. And, doing that right, would be the next TCP/IP moment in Identity, that will free the developers from worrying about complexities in Identity integrations.</p> The Developer-first IAM <p>The single Identity administrator role has started diminishing, and the role of the developer is becoming more prominent in Identity integrations. These developers need a better abstraction over core identity concepts; and the developer-first IAM is the way to realize the next TCP/IP moment in Identity.</p><p>In the consumer Identity space, when we talk to enterprises, they bring in their unique requirements. In many cases they look for a product that can be used to build an agile, event-driven consumer Identity (CIAM) platform that can flex to meet frequently changing business requirements.</p><p>A developer-first IAM product builds an abstraction over the core Identity concepts in the form of APIs and SDKs, provides tools for troubleshooting, has the ability to integrate with the organization’s build pipeline, carries the right level of developer experience and has the ability to extend product’s core capabilities to fit into organization’s complex IAM requirements.</p><p>As every company is becoming a software company, and starting to build their competitive advantage on the software they build, the developer-first IAM will free the developers from inherent complexities in doing Identity integrations. That’s the next TCP/IP moment in Identity!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-next-tcp-ip-moment-in-identity-464fdb559f3b">The Next TCP/IP Moment in Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Fuzzy Name Matching in Postgres 
 Paul Ramsey describes how to implement fuzzy name matching in PostgreSQL using the fuzzystrmatch extension and its levenshtein() and soundex() functions, plus functional indexes to query against indexed soundex first and then apply slower Levenshtein. The same tricks should also work against SQLite using the datasette-jellyfish plugin.

<p>On <a href="https://quora.com">Quora</a>, somebody asks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-radio-industry-stay-relevant-in-the-age-of-streaming-music-and-podcasts">How can the radio industry stay relevant in the age of streaming music and podcasts?</a>&nbsp;Here’s my answer:</p>
<p>It already is, if you consider streaming music and podcasting evolutionary forms of radio.</p>
<p>But if you limit the meaning of radio to over-the-air broadcasting, the relevance will be a subordinate one to what’s happening over streaming, cellular and Internet connections, podcasting, satellite radio, digital audio broadcast (DAB) and various forms of Internet-shared video (starting with, but not limited to, YouTube).</p>
<p>The main way over-the-air radio can remain relevant in the long run is by finding ways for live streams to hand off to radio signals, and vice versa. Very little effort is going into this, however, so I expect over-the-air to drift increasingly to the sidelines, as a legacy technology. Toward this inevitable end, it should help to know that AM is mostly gone in Europe (where it is called MW, for MediumWave). This follows in the tracks of LW (longwave) and to some degree SW (shortwave) as well. Stations on those bands persist, and they do have their uses (especially where other forms of radio and Internet connections are absent); but in terms of popularity they are also-rans.</p>
<p>BUT, in the meantime, so long as cars have AM and FM radios in them, the bands remain relevant and popular. But again, it’s a matter of time before nearly all forms of music, talk and other forms of entertainment and sharing move from one-way broadcast to every-way sharing, based on digital technologies. (Latest example: <a href="https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=clubhouse&amp;FORM=HDRSC6">Clubhouse</a>.)</p>

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-55">Datasette 0.55</a> and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v3-6">sqlite-utils 3.6</a> this week with a common theme across both releases: supporting cross-database joins.</p>
 Cross-database queries in Datasette 
<p>SQLite databases are single files on disk. I really love this characteristic - it makes them easy to create, copy and move around. All you need is a disk volume you can create as many SQLite databases as you like.</p>
<p>A lesser known feature of SQLite is that you can run queries, including joins, across tables from more than one database. The secret sauce is the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html">ATTACH DATABASE</a> command. Run the following SQL:</p>
 <code>ATTACH 'other.db' AS other;
</code> 
<p>And now you can reference tables in that database as <code>other.tablename</code>. You can then join against them, combine them with <code>UNION</code> and generally treat them as if they were another table in your first connected database.</p>
<p>I've wanted to add support for cross-database queries to Datasette <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/283">since May 2018</a>. It took me quite a while to settle on a design - SQLite defaults to only allowing ten databases to be attached together, and I needed to figure out how multiple connected databases would fit with the design of the rest of Datasette.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided on the simplest option that would unlock the feature. Run Datasette with the new <code>--crossdb</code> option and the first ten databases passed to Datasette will be ATTACHed to an in-memory database available at the <code>/_memory</code> URL.</p>
<p>The <code>latest.datasette.io</code> demo now exposes two databases using this feature. Here's an illustrative example query that performs a UNION across the <code>sqlite_master</code> metadata table in two databases:</p>
  select
  'fixtures' as database, *
from
  [fixtures].sqlite_master
union
select
  'extra_database' as database, *
from
  [extra_database].sqlite_master  
<p><a href="https://latest.datasette.io/_memory?sql=select%0D%0A++%27fixtures%27+as+database%2C+*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++%5Bfixtures%5D.sqlite_master%0D%0Aunion%0D%0Aselect%0D%0A++%27extra_database%27+as+database%2C+*%0D%0Afrom%0D%0A++%5Bextra_database%5D.sqlite_master">Try that out here</a>.</p>
 Cross-database queries in sqlite-utils 
<p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> offers both a Python library and a command-line utility in one package. I've added <code>ATTACH</code> support to both.</p>
<p>The Python library support <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-attach">looks like this</a>:</p>
 db = Database("first.db")
db.attach("second", "second.db")
# Now you can run queries like this:
cursor = db.execute("""
select * from table_in_first
    union all
select * from second.table_in_second
""")
print(cursor.fetchall()) 
<p>The command-line tool now has <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-attach">a new --attach option</a> which lets you attach a database using an alias. The equivalent query to the above would look like this:</p>
  $ sqlite-utils first.db --attach second second.db '
  select * from table_in_first
    union all
  select * from second.table_in_second'  
<p>This defaults to returning results as a JSON array, but you can add <code>--csv</code> or <code>--tsv</code> or <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#running-queries-and-outputting-a-table">other options</a> to get the results back in different output formats.</p>
 A cosmetic upgrade to tags on my blog 
<p>I noticed that <a href="https://lethain.com/">Will Larson's blog</a> shows little numbers next to the tags indicating how many times they have been used. I really liked that, so I've implemented it here as well.</p>
<p>Each entry (and quotation and link) now gets a block in the sidebar that looks like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a long-time fan of faceted search interfaces I really like this upgrade - it helps indicate at a glance the kind of content I have stashed away in my blog's archive.</p>

The idea is simple: anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project.

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>Back in December I decided to try something new for my <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> open source project: <a href="https://calendly.com/swillison/datasette-office-hours">Datasette Office Hours</a>. The idea is simple: anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project. I’m interested in talking to people who are using Datasette, or who are considering using it, or who just want to have a chat.</p>
<p>I’ve now had 35 conversations and it’s been absolutely fantastic. I’ve talked to people in Iceland, Burundi, Finland, Singapore, Bulgaria and dozens of other places around the world. I’ve seen my software applied to applications ranging from historic cemetery records to library collections to open city data. It’s been thrilling.</p>
<p>I’d like to encourage more open source project maintainers to consider doing something similar.</p>

<p>("Office hours" is a term used at some universities for periods of time when you can drop in to talk with a lecturer. In Germany they use the term "Sprechstunde" for "speaking hours" which I think is better!)</p>

 Reasons to do this 
<p>A challenge of open source is that it's easy to be starved of feedback. People might file bug reports if something breaks, but other than that it can feel like publishing software into a void.</p>
<p>Hearing directly from people who are using your stuff is incredibly motivational. It’s also an amazing source of ideas and feedback on where the project should go next.</p>
<p>In the startup world “talk to your users and potential customers” is advice that becomes a constant drumbeat… because it’s really effective, but it’s also hard to bring up the courage to do!</p>
<p>Talking to users in open source is similarly valuable. And it turns out, especially in these pandemic times, people really do want to talk to you. Office hours is an extremely low-friction way of putting up a sign that says “let’s have a conversation”.</p>
 How I do this: 25 minute slots, via Calendly 
<p>I’m using <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> to make 20 minute slots available every Friday between 9am and 5pm Pacific Time (with 12:30-1:30 set aside for lunch), with a ten minute buffer between slots.</p>
<p>In practice, I treat these as 25 minute slots. This gives me five 5 minutes break in between conversations, and also means it’s possible to stretch to 30 minutes if we get to a key topic just before the time slot ends.</p>
<p>I configured Calendly to allow a maximum of five bookings on any Friday. This feels right to me - conversations with five different people can be pretty mentally tiring, and cutting off after five still gives me a good chance to get other work done during the day.</p>
<p>I use Calendly’s Zoom integration, which automatically sends out a calendar invite to both myself and my conversation partner and schedules a Zoom room that’s linked to from the invite. All I have to do is click the link at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>About one in fifteen conversations ends up cancelled. That’s completely fine - I get half an hour of my day back and we can usually reschedule for another week.</p>
 How about making some money? 
<p>I’ve been having some <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1361752269700489216">fascinating conversations</a> on Twitter recently about the challenges of taking an open source project and turning it into a full-time job, earning a salary good enough to avoid the siren call of working for a FAANG company.</p>
<p>People pointed me to a few good examples of open source maintainers who charge for video conference consulting sessions - <a href="https://benjie.dev/">Graphile’s Benjie</a> and <a href="https://calendly.com/csswizardry/consultation">CSS Wizardry's Harry Roberts</a> both let you book paid sessions with them directly.</p>
<p>I really like this as an opportunity for earning money against an open source project, and I think it could complement office hours nicely: 25 minutes on a Friday free on a first-come, first-served basis could then up-sell to a 1.5 hours paid consulting session, which could then lead to larger consulting contracts.</p>
 Try this yourself 
<p>If you're tempted to try office hours for your own project, getting started is easy. I'm using the Calendly free plan, but their paid plans (which include the ability to attach Stripe or PayPal payments to bookings) are reasonably priced. I've been promoting my sessions via Twitter, the <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> website and the <a href="https://datasette.substack.com/">Datasette Newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of those ideas I wish I'd had sooner. It's quickly become a highlight of my week.</p>
<p>Update 5th March 2021: The original headline of this piece was "Open source projects should run office hours". This was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26351053">being misinterpreted</a> as yet another demand for free labor from open source maintainers, so I changed it to "Open source projects: consider running office hours" - less pithy, but it better reflects my actual message here.</p>

SSI — Legal compliance and the involvement of governments<p>This article describes how governments of sovereign states might be involved in building identity ecosystems based on self-sovereign principles and how regulatory conformity of such ecosystems can be achieved.</p><p>When it comes to identity management the involvement of the government can be a tricky topic. It needs to be involved to enable access to public services, adapt legislature and guarantee equal access for its citizens. However, it should not be able to control or monitor all aspects and activities of its citizens. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) might for some imply, that a citizen is suddenly able to issue his own ID-card, which isn’t the case. Governments are still the primary source of foundational identities.</p> The government as issuer of foundational identities <p>While individuals gain more autonomy with SSI the issuance of national IDs is still the responsibility of the public administration. The Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) differentiates between foundational and contextual identities.</p><blockquote>“A foundational identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).” <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/PCTF-CCP/">PCTF</a>&nbsp;[1]</blockquote><p>Hence, the government continues to be the issuer of foundational identities and still holds the authority to revoke these credentials when necessary. However, SSI also enables the usage of other identity providers, which are context dependent — leading to a contextual identity as further explained within the&nbsp;PCTF.</p><blockquote>“A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media). Depending on the identity context, a contextual identity may be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a drivers licence) or may not be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a social media profile).“ [1]</blockquote><p>This means a customer of a bank can use his verified bank ID to identify himself at a credit bureau. Since the bank ID is based on a foundational identity, the contextual identity provided by the bank can be sufficient in this particular use-case given the regulatory environment allows such a usage. However, a contextual identity can, but doesn’t have to be based on a foundational identity.</p><p>The European Commission supports the continued usage of contextual identities online and only demands the usage of foundational identities when required by law as stated in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528">eIDAS public consultation</a> [2] regarding the option to extend the regulation for the public&nbsp;sector:</p><blockquote>“A European identity solution enabling trusted identification of citizens and companies in their digital interactions to access public or private online services (e.g. e- commerce), should be entirely voluntary for users to adhere to and fully protect data and privacy. Anonymity of the internet should be ensured at all times by allowing solutions for anonymous authentication anonymously where user identification is not required for the provision of the service.“ [2]</blockquote> Regulatory compliancy <p>When dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) all involved stakeholders need to adhere to a certain set of laws, which dictate the usage of the such data. These laws highly depend on the citizenship of the data subject (the individual the PII is about) among other important factors. Although the following paragraphs are specifically devoted to the laws of the European Union, the conclusion might also be applied to similar laws such as the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> or the <a href="https://law.asia/regional-data-privacy-laws/">Indian Personal Data Protection Bill&nbsp;(DPA)</a>.</p><p>Within the European Union, there are two laws, which have a significant influence on identity frameworks. The General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, determines how personal data from EU citizens can be collected and used. The other important law is the Electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) provision specified in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">N°910/2014</a> [3]. It constitutes the main electronic identification trust framework in the EU and is an elemental building block of the digital single&nbsp;market.</p> GDPR — General Data Protection Regulation Overview of important roles regarding PII data management according to international standards.<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessm%20ent+Reports">EBSI GDPR assessment</a> [4] notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“According to this Regulation, there are two types of actors whose key role in data processing and whose relationship to the data within the data processing environment leads the European legislator to attribute them a set of obligations and responsibilities. Thus, these liable actors are subject to data protection rules.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>These are data controllers, which are defined in article <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">4(7) GDPR</a> [5]&nbsp;as</p><blockquote>“the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law”&nbsp;[5]</blockquote><p>which</p><blockquote>“have to take all necessary measures so that data subjects are sufficiently informed and have the ability to exercise their data protection rights.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The other actor is the data processor who acts as delegate of the data controller and is a separate legal entity according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2010/wp169_en.pdf">opinion 1/2010 of the Data protection working party.</a> [6] With multiple nodes running a decentralized network every node acts as a data processor or data controller depending on if the node operator is processing the data as a delegate or not. The EBSI GDPR report further&nbsp;notes:</p><blockquote>“in case of joint controllership, data controllers can contractually assign partial responsibility based on distinct stages of data processing.“ While an agreement between these data processors can regulate the responsibilities, “data subjects will have ot (sic!) be able to exercise their rights against every joint controller“ and “nodes that add and process the on-chain ledger data in order to maintain the consensus will be individually qualified as joint data controllers and this, regardless of a contractual relationship stating the contrary.“ [4]</blockquote><p>For public blockchains with permissionless write access such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, this means, that every miner, which is participating in the proof of work consensus is regarded as data processor given there is an unintentional personal data leakage or correlation with an URL (Uniform resource locator) of a service endpoint within DID Documents as pointed out as critical to keep PII private by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DID specification of the W3C in section 10.1</a>.[7] This threat in addition of the numerous other correlation risks mentioned in section 10.2 and 10.3 of said specification make the current implementation of SSI based on permissionless blockchains, which inhibit the capability for natural persons to write a anywise DID on the ledger, a daunting privacy challenge.</p><p>Another important aspect is the question if credentials (or any other form of PII) is stored as hash on the verifiable data registry. A hash is a data digest and is considered a one-way function, which in theory leads to an anonymization of the original information. The debate around the question if a hash constitutes PII is likely to continue, since national data protection agencies are struggling to clearly define if the hashing can be considered an anonymization or pseudonymization.</p><blockquote>“According to the Spanish DPA (Data protection agency), hashing can at times be considered as anonymization or pseudonymization depending on a variety of factors varying from the entities involved to the type of the data at hand.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>Even if the hash constitutes a one-way obfuscation technique, which anonymizes PII, it I) requires a transaction on a public ledger and II) it puts data controllers in a higher risk position with the obligation to avoid correlation of individuals. Risk minimizing obligations for data controllers are easier to implement when there is no hash of a verified credential or verified presentation stored on a public&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>When it comes to the wallet itself the EBSI GDPR report notes&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>“there is growing consensus about the possibility of data subjects to being simultaneously considered as data controllers for the data that refer to themselves“. The report provides the recommendation that “the privacy preserving technical and organisational measures of the wallet and the personal data transmissions should ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place in order to not limit the empowerment of the data subject through the DLT chosen model.“&nbsp;[4]</blockquote><p>The report concludes, that data within the wallet application is considered personal data and therefor is subject to the data protection regulation.</p><p>While there is a general assumption that e.g. <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/GDPR-Paper_V1.pdf">Hyperledger Indy implementations are GDPR compliant</a> [8], ultimately courts have to decide if that claim holds up based on a case by case evaluation on the particular implementation. Nevertheless, avoiding the exposure of PII on the verifiable data registry, by I) not allowing natural persons to write public DIDs and II) not storing PII in hashed form on the verifiable data registry facilitate the GDPR compliance obligations.</p> eIDAS: <p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/system/files/ged/eidas_regulation.pdf">eIDAS regulation</a> [3] is concerned with two distinct topics. One part is concerned with trust services for private businesses such as electronic signatures, seal, time stamps etc. The other part is regulating the mutual recognition among member states of national implementations of electronic identification (eID) for the public sector. Is a technology neutral approach, which has a strong influence on the international regulatory space. The main goal of mutual recognition of eID is to enable EU citizens access to cross-border public services with their own national eID means. The implementation of eID schemes vary from member state to member state and not all member states have notified an eID scheme as illustrated by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Overview+of+pre-notified+and+notified+eID+schemes+under+eIDAS">overview of pre-notified and notified eID schemes</a> [9] under&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><p>There are three levels of assurance specified for eIDs under eIDAS referring to the degree of confidence in the claimed identity of a person, which include detailed criteria allowing member states to map their eID means against a benchmark (low, substantial and high). Current SSI implementations have the objective to be recognized with a level of assurance specified as substantial.</p><p>It’s currently possible to be eIDAS compliant with SSI by leveraging one out of five scenarios described in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Legal+Assessment+Reports">SSI eIDAS legal report by Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo</a> [10]. Especially interesting is the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge">SSI eIDAS bridge</a>, which adds legal value to verified credentials with the use of electronic certificates and electronic seals. However, it’s also possible to derive national eIDs notified in eIDAS, which are eIDAS linked by deriving a national eID by issuing a verifiable credential with a qualified certificate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Spe%20V%20cification+%2815%29+-+eIDAS+bridge+for+VC-eSealing">technical specification</a>.[12]</p><p>Nevertheless, there are also hindrances in the process of creating a qualified certificate with the derived national identity, because of the way the regulation is defining a qualified signature. Another issue is that national eID schemes require the keys to be in a secure element. However, current SSI wallets only offer software keys and do not leverage the security benefits of a hardware element. Furthermore, the eIDAS regulation doesn’t regulate the case of a private entity issuing an eID attribute to a natural person for the usage of it in other private interactions.</p><p>Furthermore, the authentication process to achieve the recognition of notified eIDAS schemes by other member states requires a national node, which provides the authentication service. While aimed to be technology neutral, the obligation to provide this authentication service as delegated authentication component has several drawbacks and also hinders the potential adoption of SSI. The EU has already identified the need to re-evaluate the policies set by&nbsp;eIDAS.</p><blockquote>“Fundamental changes in the overall societal context suggest a revision of the eIDAS Regulation. These include a dramatic increase in the use of novel technologies, such as distributed-ledger based solutions, the Internet of Thing, Artificial Intelligence and biometrics, changes in the market structure where few players with significant market power increasingly act as digital identity ‘gatekeepers’, changes in user behavior with increasing demand for instant, convenient and secure identification and the evolution of EU Data Protection legislation” [2]</blockquote><p>The consultation continues with its&nbsp;target:</p><blockquote>“The objective of this initiative is, first of all, to provide a future proof regulatory framework to support an EU-wide, simple, trusted and secure system to manage identities in the digital space, covering identification, authentication and the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations. Secondly, the initiative aims at creating a universal pan-European single digital ID. These objectives could be achieved through an overhaul of the eIDAS system, an extension of eIDAS to the private sector, the introduction of a European Digital Identity (EUid) building on the eIDAS system or combination of both.”&nbsp;[2]</blockquote><p>In an private interview for an academic study Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo suggested embodying new technologies such as SSI into the revised regulation e.g. by not mandating the provision of an authentication facility and creating new trust services such as electronic identification. In another private interview Luca Boldrin suggested keeping national identity systems as they are but use a derivation of national identity for cross-border context for public and private businesses in parallel to current node implementation to enable a European identity.</p><p>Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo argues that having derived national eIDs and eID trust services has the benefit of increased privacy by using a peer to peer authentication instead of a delegated authentication model (the national eIDAS node). This also leads to less liability issues by shifting the authentication part to private providers as well as less costs associated with running authentication infrastructure for governments, because these are provided by Distributed Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) instead of national eIDAS nodes. These DPKI systems also have the benefits of being more resilient to attacks compared to a single node, which represents a single point of failure. However, regulating eID as trust service also means opening up identification for the private market, which might not be in the interest of national governments.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

<p>When I walk around our neighborhood I see very few copies of our local newspaper on sidewalks, porches, and front lawns. We subscribe because it’s a lifelong habit, and because we like to support local journalism, and in my case because it’s a welcome reprieve from a long day of screentime.</p>
<p>This archaic habit has also, weirdly, become a kind of superpower. From time to time I meet people who are surprised when I know facts about them. These facts are public information, so why should it be surprising that I know them? Because they appear in the print edition of the newspaper. Consider the man in this photo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were out for a Sunday morning walk, carrying the newspaper, when we saw him in a cafe. We had just read an article about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petalumawhiskerino/photos">Whiskerino</a>, the annual contest of fancy beards and mustaches in Petaluma. And here was the guy whose photo was featured in the article!</p>
<p>That was a nice coincidence, but the kicker is that he had no idea his picture was in the paper. Not being of newspaper-reading age, and not having friends of newspaper-reading age, he had to depend on elders to alert him. I guess we got to him before his parents did.</p>
<p>When a similar thing happened this weekend, it occurred to me that this could be a good marketing strategy for newspapers. Do you want to wield an information superpower? Do you want to amaze people by knowing facts that they can’t imagine you could possibly know? Subscribe to the print edition of your local newspaper!</p>

   My big project this week was this Video introduction to Datasette and sqlite-utils. I recorded the video a few weeks ago in advance of FOSDEM, but this week I put together the annotated version. I'm really happy with it, and I've added it to the datasette.io homepage as a starting point for helping people understand the project.

  <p>My big project this week was this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/7/video/">Video introduction to Datasette and sqlite-utils</a>. I recorded the video a few weeks ago in advance of FOSDEM, but this week I put together the annotated version. I'm really happy with it, and I've added it to the <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> homepage as a starting point for helping people understand the project.</p>
 Annotating the video 
<p>I'm not a huge watcher of video tutorials - I'm impatient and find myself watching them at double speed and still complaining that a text version would be more efficient. So when I publish my own videos I like to accompany them with a useful text version.</p>
<p>The format I've settled on - for this video and for others like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/">Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data</a> - is to use screenshots from the video accompanied by notes, links and code samples. Ideally you can read the text version without watching the video at all, but if you do watch the video the text version can provide extended annotations.</p>
<p>I created this one on macOS using the combination of QuickTime Player and Preview. If you hit Command+C while watching a video in QuickTime Player a PNG snapshot gets copied to your clipboard. Switch to Preview with Command+Tab and hit Command+N to create a new untitled document there containing the image.</p>
<p>I ran through the video creating snapshots of each interesting moment in this way, leaving 40+ open Preview documents called "Untitled", "Untitled 2" and so on.</p>
<p>When I reached the end of the video I switched back to Preview and used Command+S to save each open document in turn, creating a folder full of images with names like "Untitled 2.png". These were in the correct order.</p>
<p>I used the Finder "Rename 40 items..." right-click menu option to remove the Untitled prefix.</p>
<p>Then I optimized the PNGs using the tricks <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/macos_shrinking-pngs-with-pngquant-and-oxipng.md">described in this TIL</a>.</p>
<p>Next step: create the HTML. I have a template that I use for each "slide" which looks like this:</p>
  &lt;div class="slide"&gt;
    &lt;img alt="" height="{height}" src="{filename}" width="{width}"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Words&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  
<p>I constructed <a href="https://observablehq.com/@simonw/build-an-html-page-for-a-sequence-of-slides-or-screenshots">an Observable notebook</a> which accepts a list of filenames (copied and pasted directly from the Finder) and turns them into a sequence of those HTML templates.</p>
<p>Having built out the HTML framework for the page, the last step was to go through and add the annotations. I did that by editing the HTML directly.</p>
 datasette-tiles: OSM v.s. TMS 
<p>Matthew Somerville <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-tiles/issues/15">pointed out</a> that my <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-tiles">datasette-tiles</a> project (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/4/datasette-tiles/">described here previously</a>) had the Y axis flipped from the standard used by Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>It turns out there are two rival standards for this. TMS - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service">Tile Map Service</a> - is a tile specification developed by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. It's used by the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.3/spec.md">MBTiles specification</a> which is why <code>datasette-tiles</code> was using it.</p>
<p>Google Maps and OpenStreetMap do things slightly differently - counting Y from the top of the map instead of the bottom. This has become the de facto standard for web mapping. Tom MacWright has published <a href="https://gist.github.com/tmcw/4954720">a useful explainer</a> of the diffference between the two.</p>
<p>I made myself a couple of diagrams to ensure I completely understood how the two tile systems work:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-tiles/releases/tag/0.6">datasette-tiles 0.6</a> ships a breaking change that switches the default serving mechanism to the OpenStreetMap system - so <code>/-/tiles/db/z/x/y.png</code> now serves tiles using that coordinate system.</p>
<p>If you want the TMS mechanism, you can use the new <code>/-/tiles-tms/db/z/x/y.png</code> endpoint instead.</p>

  <p>Summary: Passwords are ruining the web with awful, lengthy, and inconsistent user experiences. They're insecure and lead to data breaches. The good news is there are good ways for web sites to be passwordless. If you hate passwords, build the world you want to live in.</p>




<p>
    Compare, for a moment, your online, web experience at your bank with the mobile experience from the same bank. Chances are, if you're like me, that you pick up your phone and use a biometric authentication method (e.g. FaceId) to open it. Then you select the app and the biometrics play again to make sure it's you, and you're in. 
</p>

<p>
    On the web, in contrast, you likely end up at a landing page where you have to search for the login button which is hidden in a menu or at the top of the page. Once you do, it probably asks you for your identifier (username). You open up your password manager (a few clicks) and fill the username and only then does it show you the password field1. You click a few more times to fill in the password. Then, if you use multi-factor authentication (and you should), you get to open up your phone, find the 2FA app, get the code, and type it in. To add insult to injury, the ceremony will be just different enough at every site you visit that you really don't develop much muscle memory for it. 
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence, when I need somethings from my bank, I pull out my phone and use the mobile app. And it's not just banking. This experience is replicated on any web site that requires authentication. Passwords and the authentication experience are ruining the web. 
</p>

<p>
    I wouldn't be surprised to find businesses abandon functional web sites in the future. There will still be some marketing there (what we used to derisively call "brochure-ware") and a pointer to the mobile app. Businesses love mobile apps not only because they can deliver a better user experience (UX) but because they allow business to better engage people. Notifications, for example, get people to look at the app, giving the business opportunities to increase revenue. And some things, like airline boarding passes, just work much better on mobile. 
</p>

<p>
    Another factor is that we consider phones to be "personal devices". They aren't designed to be multi-user. Laptops and other devices, on the other hand, can be multi-user, even if in practice they usually are not. Consequently, browsers on laptops get treated as less insecure and session invalidation periods are much shorter, requiring people to login more frequently than in mobile apps.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, web sites can be passwordless, relieving some of the pain. Technologies like FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SSI allow for passwordless user experiences on the web as well as mobile. The kicker is that this isn't a trade off with security. Passwordless options can be more secure, and even more interoperable, with a better UX than passwords. Everybody wins. 
</p>



 

<a></a>
 Notes 

 
     This is known as "identifier-first authentication". By asking for the identifier, the authentication service can determine how to authenticate you. So, if you're using a token authentication instead of passwords, it can present that next. Some places do this well, merely hiding the password field using Javascript and CSS, so that password managers can still fill the password even though it's not visible. Others don't.

<p>In August 2020, we’ve rolled out a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-platform-updates-are-here">new release of the ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> which included updated versions of all of the products, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a> 7.0. I didn’t write a post about the new release, mostly due to our focus to deliver the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-identity-cloud-gets-even-better">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> and family vacation.</p>



<p>But ForgeRock Directory Services 7.0 is a major release in many ways. It is the first to be released with <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html#whats-new-700">a sample docker file and full support to run in Kubernetes</a> environments in the Cloud. To achieve that, we’ve made a number of significant changes especially in how security is managed, and how replication is configured and enabled. The rest of the server remains quite the same, delivering consistent performance and reliability. You should read the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/release-notes/whats-new.html">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>



<p>Since, DS 7 was successfully deployed in production, in VMs or in Docker/Kubernetes, and our customers have praised the simplicity and efficiency of the new version. However, some customers have experienced some difficulties with upgrading their current deployment to the 7.0 release, mostly due to the changes I’ve mentioned above. So we have been improving our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ds/7/upgrade-guide/">Upgrade Guide</a>, with greater details, and my colleague <a href="https://marginnotes2.wordpress.com/">Mark Craig</a>, has posted a series of 3 articles on Upgrading to Directory Services 7: </p>

  <p>Summary:      Picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.</p>



<p>
    <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">Jon Udell introduced me</a> to a fascinating talk by the always interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/r0ml?lang=en">r0ml</a>. In it, r0ml argues that <a href="https://youtu.be/hAuV0AYzMuQ?t=1032">Postgres as a programming environment feels like a Smalltalk image</a> (at least that's the part that's germane to this post). Jon has been working this way in Postgres for a while. He says:
</p>

<blockquote>For over a year, I’ve been using Postgres as a development framework. In addition to the core Postgres server that stores all the Hypothesis user, group, and annotation data, there’s now also a separate Postgres server that provides an interpretive layer on top of the raw data. It synthesizes and caches product- and business-relevant views, using a combination of PL/pgSQL and PL/Python. Data and business logic share a common environment. Although I didn’t make the connection until I watched r0ml’s talk, this setup hearkens back to the 1980s when Smalltalk (and Lisp, and APL) were programming environments with built-in persistence.
     From <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2021/01/24/the-image-of-postgres/">The Image of Postgres</a><br>Referenced 2021-02-05T16:44:56-0700 
</blockquote>

<p>
    Here's the point in r0ml's talk where he describes this idea:
</p>


<p>
    As I listened to the talk, I was a little bit nostalgic for my time using Lisp and Smalltalk back in the day, but I was also excited because I realized that the model Jon and r0ml were talking about is very much alive in how one goes about building a pico system.
</p>

<a></a>
 Picos and Persistence 
<p>
    Picos are persistent compute objects. Persistence is a core feature of how picos work. Picos exhibit persistence in three ways. Picos have1:
</p>

 
     Persistent identity—Picos exist, with a single identity, continuously from the moment of their creation until they are destroyed. 
     
     Persistent state—Picos have state that programs running in the pico can see and alter. 
     
     Persistent availability—Picos are always on and ready to process queries and events.
     
 

<p>
    Together, these properties give pico programming a different feel than what many developers are used to. I often tell my students that programmers write static documents (programs, configuration files, SQL queries, etc.) that create dynamic structures—the processes that those static artifacts create when they're run. Part of being a good programmer is being able to envision those dynamic structures as you program. They come alive in your head as you imagine the program running. 
</p>

<p>
    With picos, you don't have to imagine the structure. You can see it. Figure 1 shows the current state of the picos in a test I created for a collection of temperature sensors. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Network of Picos for Temperatures Sensors (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, the black lines show the parent-child hierarchy and the dotted pink lines show the peer-to-peer connections between picos (called "subscriptions" in current pico parlance). Parent-child hierarchies are primarily used to manage the picos themselves whereas the heterarchical connections between picos is used for programmatic communication and represent the relationships between picos. As new picos are created or existing picos are deleted, the diagram changes to show the dynamic computing structure that exists at any given time. 
</p>

<p>
    Clicking on one of the boxes representing a pico opens up a developer interface that enables interaction with the pico according to the rulesets that have been installed. Figure 2 shows the Testing tab for the develop interface of the <code>io.picolabs.wovyn.router</code> ruleset in the pico named <code>sensor_line</code> after the <code>lastTemperature</code> query has been made. Because this is a live view into the running system, the interface can be used to query the state and raise events in the pico. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Interacting with a Pico (click to enlarge)


<p>
    A pico's state is updated by rules running in the pico in response to events that the pico sees. Pico state is <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189855/Persistent+Variables">made available to rules as persistent variables</a> in KRL, the ruleset programming language. When a rule sets a persistent variable, the state is persisted after the rule has finished execution and is available to other rules that execute later2. The Testing tab allows developers to raise events and then see how that impacts the persistent state of the pico. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Programming Picos 

<p>
    As I said, when I saw r0ml's talk, I was immediately struck by how much programming picos felt like using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Image-based_persistence">Smalltalk or Lisp image</a>. In some ways, it's like working with Docker images in a Fargate-like environment since it's serverless (from the programmer's perspective).  But there's far less to configure and set up.  Or maybe, more accurately, the setup is linguistically integrated with the application itself and feels less onerous and disconnected. 
</p>

<p>
    Building a system of picos to solve some particular problem isn't exactly like using Smalltalk. In particular, in a nod to modern development methodologies, the rulesets are installed from URLs and thus can be developed in the IDE the developer chooses and versioned in <code>git</code> or some other versioning system. Rulesets can be installed and managed programmatically so that the system can be programmed to manage its own configuration. To that point, all of the interactions in developer interface are communicated to the pico via an API installed in the picos. Consequently, everything the developer interface does can be done programmatically as well.
</p>

<p>
    Figure 3 shows the <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/32754595/Programming+Workflow">programming workflow</a> that we use to build production pico systems. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Programming Workflow (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The developer may go through multiple iterations of the Develop, Build, Deploy, Test phases before releasing the code for production use. What is not captured in this diagram is the interactive feel that the pico engine provides for the testing phase. While automated tests can test the unit and system functionality of the rules running in the pico, the developer interface provides a visual tool for envisioning the interaction of the picos that are animated by dynamic interactions. Being able to query the state of the picos and see their reaction to specific events in various configurations is very helpful in debugging problems. 
</p>

<p>
    A pico engine can use multiple images (one at a time). And an image can be zipped up and shared with another developer or checked into <code>git</code>. By default the pico engine stores the state of the engine, including the installed rulesets, in the <code>~/.pico-engine/</code> directory. This is the image. Developers can change this to a different directory by setting the <code>PICO_ENGINE_HOME</code> environment variable. By changing the <code>PICO_ENGINE_HOME</code> environment variable, you can keep different development environments or projects separate from each other, and easily go back to the place you left off in a particular pico application.
</p>

<p>
    For example, you could have a different pico engine image for a game project and an IoT project and start up the pico engine in either environment like so:
</p>
 # work on my game project
PICO_ENGINE_HOME=~/.dnd_game_image pico-engine

# work on IoT project
PICO_ENGINE_HOME=~/.iot_image pico-engine
 


<a></a>
 Images and Modern Development 

<p>
    At first, the idea of using an image or the running system and interacting with it to develop an application may see odd or out of step with modern development practices. After all, developers have had the idea of layered architectures and separation of concerns hammered into them. And image-based development in picos seems to fly in the face of those conventions. But it's really not all that different. 
</p>

<p>
    First, large pico applications are not generally built up by hand and then pushed into production. Rather, the developers in a pico-based programming project create a system that comes into being programmatically. So, the production image is separate from the developer's work image, as one would like. Another way to think about this, if you're familiar with systems like Smalltalk and Lisp is that programmers don't develop systems using a REPL (read-eval-print loop). Rather they write code, install it, and raise events to cause the system to talk action. 
</p>

<p>
    Second, the integration of persistence into the application isn't all that unusual when one considers the recent move to microservices, with local persistence stores. I built a production connected-car service called Fuse using picos some years ago.  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/fuse_as_a_microservice_architecture.shtml">Fuse had a microservice architecture</a> even though it was built with picos and programmed with rules. 
</p>

<p>
    Third, programming in image-based systems requires persistence maintenance and migration work, just like any other architecture does. For example, a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/07/a_microservice_for_healing_subscriptions.shtml">service for healing API subscriptions in Fuse</a> was also useful when new features, requiring new APIs, were introduced since the healing worked as well for new, as it did existing, API subscriptions. These kinds of rules allowed the production state to migrate incrementally as bugs were fixed and features added. 
</p>

<p>
    Image-based programming in picos can be done with all the same care and concern for persistence management and loose coupling as in any other architecture. The difference is that developers and system operators (these days often one and the same) in a pico-based development activity are saved the effort of architecting, configuring, and operating the persistence layer as a separate system. Linguistically incorporating persistence in the rules provides for more flexible use of persistence with less management overhead. 
</p>

<p>
    Stored procedures will not likely soon lose their stigma. Smalltalk images, as they were used in the 1980's, are unlikely to find a home in modern software development practices. Nevertheless, picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.
</p>

<a></a>
 Future Work 

<p>
    There are some improvements that should be made to the pico-engine to make image-based development better.
</p>
 
     Moving picos between engines is necessary to support scaling of pico-based system. It is still too hard to migrate picos from one engine to another. And when you do, the parent-child hierarchy is not maintained across engines. This is a particular problem with systems of picos that have varied ownership. 
     
     Managing images using environment variables is clunky. The engine could have better support for naming, creating, switching, and deleting images to support multiple project.
     
     Bruce Conrad has created a <a href="https://github.com/b1conrad/pico-debug">command-line debugging tool</a> that allows declarations (which don't affect state) to be evaluated in the context of a particular pico. This needs functionality could be better integrated into the developer interface.

  I think there are more reasons to believe in the Bucs than the Chiefs today: better offensive line, better defense, Brady’s unequaled Super Bowl experience, etc. But the Chiefs are favored by 3.5 points, last I looked, and they have other advantages, including the best quarterback in the game—or maybe ever—in Patrick Mahomes.

<p>I think there are more reasons to believe in the Bucs than the Chiefs today: better offensive line, better defense, Brady’s unequaled Super Bowl experience, etc. But the Chiefs are favored by 3.5 points, last I looked, and they have other advantages, including the best quarterback in the game—or maybe ever—in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a>.</p>
<p>And that’s the story. The incumbent GOAT (greatest of all time) is on his way out and the new one is on his way in. This game will certify that. I also think the Chiefs will beat the spread. By a lot. Because Mahomes and the Chiefs’ offense is just that good, and that ready.</p>
<p>Disclosures… In 2016, I&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/06/19/why-the-cleveland-cavaliers-will-win-tonight/">correctly predicted, for the same reason (it makes the best story)</a> that Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers would beat the Golden State Warriors for the NBA championship. Also, a cousin of mine (once removed—he’s the son of my cousin) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Heck">Andy Heck</a>, the Chiefs’ offensive line coach. So, as a long-time fan of both the Patriots and Tom Brady, I’ll be be cool with either team winning.</p>
<p>But I do think a Chiefs win makes a better story. Especially if Mahomes does his magic behind an offensive line of injuries and substitutes outperforming expectations.</p>
<p>[Later…] The Chiefs lost, 31-9, and their o-line was terrible. Poor Pat had to use his scrambling skills to the max, running all over the backfield looking for a well-covered receiver. And he came inches from hitting one in the end zone at least twice, while on the run 50 or more yards away. This was the Chief’s worst loss ever in the Mahomes era. Anyway, it looked and felt like it. But hey: congrats to the Bucs. They truly kicked ass.</p>

  <p>I put together a 17 minute video introduction to <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> and <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> for <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/open_research_datasette/">FOSDEM 2021</a>, showing how you can use Datasette to explore data, and demonstrating using the <code>sqlite-utils</code> command-line tool to convert a CSV file into a SQLite database, and then publish it using <code>datasette publish</code>. Here's the video, plus annotated screen captures with further links and commentary.</p>

 
    
 

 
    
     
        <p>Datasette is an "open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data". The best way to explain what that means it to show you a demo.</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/cleopaws">Cleo</a> is my dog. I'm going to answer the question "What is Cleo's favourite coffee shop?"</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>I use the <a href="https://www.swarmapp.com/">Foursquare Swarm</a> app. Every time I check in somewhere with Cleo I use the wolf emoji as part of my checkin message.</p>
        <p>I use my <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/swarm-to-sqlite">swarm-to-sqlite</a> tool to build a database of all of my checkins using data retrieved from the Foursquare API.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>This is a SQL view that joins against the venues table to retrieve the latitude and longitude, then uses the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> plugin to show my checkins on a map.</p>
<p>The view is defined by the following SQL:</p>
 CREATE VIEW checkin_details AS 
select
    checkins.id, created, venues.id as venue_id, venues.name as venue_name,
    venues.latitude, venues.longitude, group_concat(categories.name) as venue_categories,
    shout, createdBy, events.name as event_name
from checkins
    join venues on checkins.venue = venues.id
    left join events on checkins.event = events.id
    join categories_venues on venues.id = categories_venues.venues_id
    join categories on categories.id = categories_venues.categories_id
group by checkins.id
order by createdAt desc;
 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>If I filter for everything where the "shout" contains the wolf emoji I get a map of just the places that Cleo likes.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>If I facet by venue_categories I can see that she likes parks and dog runs, but she's also been to coffee shops 25 times. </p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>I can filter down to just coffee shop checkins, then facet by venue_name to see that she's been to Blue Bottle 16 times but she has occasionally been to Starbucks.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Everything you can see in the Datasette interface can be got back out as raw data as well. This is a JSON feed of Cleo's coffee shop checkins.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>And here are those checkins as CSV.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
<p>So this is clearly super-useful software for categorizing your dog's different coffee shop visits.</p>
<p>Let's try something a bit more serious.</p>
        <p>The New York Times publish their Covid-19 data to <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">a GitHub repository</a> as CSV files on a daily basis.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>I run a Datasette instance at <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/">covid-19.datasettes.com</a> which publishes the latest COVID data from the New York Times, the LA Times and some other sources on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Here are the New York Times daily county numbers as <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties">a table in Datasette</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>I can drill down to just the numbers <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?_size=1000&amp;county__exact=San+Francisco&amp;state__exact=California&amp;_sort_desc=date">for San Francisco County in California</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Then I can use the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> plugin to <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?_size=1000&amp;county__exact=San+Francisco&amp;state__exact=California&amp;_sort_desc=date#g.mark=line&amp;g.x_column=date&amp;g.x_type=temporal&amp;g.y_column=cases&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">plot those numbers on a line chart</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Here's that same chart <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> plugin to <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/ny_times_us_counties?_size=1000&amp;county__exact=Los+Angeles&amp;state__exact=California&amp;_sort_desc=date#g.mark=line&amp;g.x_column=date&amp;g.x_type=temporal&amp;g.y_column=cases&amp;g.y_type=quantitative">for Los Angeles county</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Since this is all built on top of a relational database, I can use joins. Here's <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations">a page</a> that joins this the New York times data aginst this table of <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/us_census_county_populations_2019">US Census county populations</a> by FIPS code, allowing us to see number of cases per million population.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Another plugin is <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a>, which gives you the ability to copy and paste data out of Datasette in different formats - here's <a href="https://covid-19.datasettes.com/covid/latest_ny_times_counties_with_populations.copyable?_table_format=latex">a LaTeX export</a> of that COVID data for example.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Datasette is built on top of <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, which claims to be the world's <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine</a>.</p>
<p>I particularly like how SQLite databases are single <code>.db</code> files on disk, which makes them easy to copy, upload and share with other people.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The original inspiration for Datasette was work I did at the Guardian back in 2009. We <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/blogpost1">launched the Datablog</a> to share the data underlying our stories - and we ended up using Google Sheets to share the data. I always felt like there should be a more open way of publishing data than putting it in a Google Sheet.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The other inspiration was serverless hosting providers, like <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and <a>Cloud Run</a>.</p>
<p>I started looking at these three years ago, and realized that while they didn't generally provide a relational database (at least not for free) if your data was read-only you could bundle the data up in a SQLite file and deploy it as part of the application code.</p>
<p>I call this the Baked Data architectural pattern.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The city of San Francisco publishes a CSV file of <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq">every tree in the city</a> - 195,000 trees!</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The CSV file includes latitude, longitude, species, street address and lots more.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p><a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a> is a separate tool I've been building for manipulating SQLite databases.</p>
<p>I'm going to use it to insert that tree CSV file into a SQLite database file.</p>
 sqlite-utils insert trees.db trees Street_Tree_List.csv --csv
 
<p>Full documentation for the <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> command is <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-csv-or-tsv-data">available here</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Both Datasette and sqlite-utils can be installed on macOS using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>
 brew install datasette sqlite-utils 
<p>They are written in Python so they can also be installed using <code>pip</code>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>To run Datasette against the new <code>trees.db</code> file locally, run this:</p>
 datasette trees.db 
<p>Then visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code> in your browser.</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>-o</code> option to Datasette to open the browser for you:</p>
 datasette trees.db -o 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>And here's that CSV file running in Datasette in tabular format.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>To see them on a map, we need the datasette-cluster-map plugin. We can install that like this:</p>
 datasette install datasette-cluster-map 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>And here they are on a map. You can see straight away that sixteen of the trees have an incorrect latitude and longitude and appear in the middle of the ocean.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>A lot of the columns have duplicate values - <code>qLegalStatus</code> for example. sqlite-utils has a tool for helping with that - it can extract those values out into a separate table.</p>
<p>I wrote about this at length in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/">Refactoring databases with sqlite-utils extract</a>.</p>
<p>We can extract that <code>qLegalStatus</code> column like so:</p>
 sqlite-utils extract trees.db trees qLegalStatus 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>When I refresh the page you can see that those columns now contain links through to the new table.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Here's the new table.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>And here's a map of every "significant tree" in San Francisco.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>We'll extract two more columns:</p>
 sqlite-utils extract trees.db trees qCaretaker
sqlite-utils extract trees.db trees qSpecies 
<p>Another useful thing we can do is configure full-text search. We can do that against the <code>qAddress</code> column using the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#configuring-full-text-search">enable-fts command</a>:</p>
 sqlite-utils enable-fts trees.db trees qAddress 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Now Datasette provides a search field, which we can use to search for "grove" to see a map of all of the trees on Grove street.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>And I can facet by species to see the most common species of trees on Grove street. I can even get those back out as CSV or JSON.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Because this is all running on a SQLite database, you can execute custom SQL queries against the database. This is safe because the database is opened in read-only mode and there's a time limit on how long a query is allowed to execute for.</p>
<p>This means you can write applications in JavaScript that execute SQL against Datasette and pull back the results in JSON. I wrote more about this in a tutorial called <a href="https://24ways.org/2018/fast-autocomplete-search-for-your-website/">Fast Autocomplete Search for Your Website</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Let's publish this to the internet, using the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html">datasette publish command</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm going to publish <code>trees.db</code> to Google Cloud Run using the following commmand:</p>
 datasette publish cloudrun trees.db --title "San Francisco Trees" --service sf-trees 
<p>This will create a new Docker container with Datasette and the bundled trees database, push that to Google's cloud infrastructure, and Google will then deploy it to Cloud Run and provide a URL.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The Datasette website at <a href="https://datasette.io/">datasette.io</a> has details of both Datasette and the many other pieces that make up the overall Datasette project.</p>
<p>There are new 56 plugins in <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins">the plugin directory</a> there.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>There's also a collection of <a href="https://datasette.io/tools">tools</a> for working with SQLite databases - both manipulating existing databases and creating new ones with data pulled from APIs, different file formats and other relational databases.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>Now thet the publish flow has finished, you can interact with the trees database online at <a href="https://sf-trees-j7hipcg4aq-uc.a.run.app/trees/trees">sf-trees-j7hipcg4aq-uc.a.run.app</a>.</p>
<p>To deploy it using the datasette-cluster-map plugin, run this:</p>
 datasette publish cloudrun trees.db --title "San Francisco Trees" \
  --service sf-trees --install=datasette-cluster-map 
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>The official <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette website</a> is itself an instance of Datasette. It uses <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/tree/main/templates">custom templates</a> for the homepage and other pages.</p>
     
 

 
    
     
        <p>You can browse the underlying data tables at <a href="https://datasette.io/content">datasette.io/content</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>It also has a search engine (built using <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/dogsheep-beta">dogsheep-beta</a>) which can search across plugins, releases, documentation, blog entries and more.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=css">an example search for CSS</a>.</p>
     
 
 
    
     
        <p>If you'd like to have a one-on-one conversation with me about Datasette you can sign up for <a href="https://calendly.com/swillison/datasette-office-hours">Datasette office hours</a>. I love talking to people about these projects!</p>

<p>In a 1999 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=642&amp;v=FiK7s_0tGsg">interview</a> David Bowie said that “the potential for what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable.” I had no problem imagining the good, it was the bad where my imagination failed. The web of the late 90s was a cornucopia of wonder, delight, and inspiration. So was the blogosophere of the early 2000s. I know a lot of us are nostalgic for those eras, and depressed about how things have turned out. The bad is really quite bad, and sometimes I feel like there’s no way forward.</p>
<p>And then something wonderful happens. This time the spark was David Grinspoon aka @DrFunkySpoon. I’ve written before about a Long Now talk in which he posits that we might not just be living through the beginning of a geological epoch called the Anthropocene but rather — and far more profoundly — the dawn of an eon that he calls <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2017/09/25/welcome-to-the-sapiezoic/">the Sapiezoic</a>. Today he posted <a href="https://twitter.com/DrFunkySpoon/status/1358064758763753478">a stunning new visualization of plate tectonics</a>.</p>
<p>As always when I think about plate tectonics, I’m reminded of the high school science teacher who introduced me to the topic. His name is John Ousey, and this happened almost 50 years ago. What always stuck with me is the way he presented it. Back then, plate tectonics was a new idea. As Mr. Ousey (he later became Dr. Ousey) described the continents sliding apart, I can still see the bemused look on his face. He was clearly wrestling with the concept, unsure whether to believe things really happen that way. That healthy skepticism, coupled with trust in the scientific process, made an indelible impression on me.</p>
<p>One of the wonders of the Internet is the ability to find people. It took some sleuthing, but I did find him and this ensued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote to John Ousey and he replied!</p>
<p>"I learned about Plate Tectonics (then called Continental Drift) by taking weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton. It was brand new and I'm not sure that he was totally convinced about it either."</p>
<p>— Jon Udell (@judell) <a href="https://twitter.com/judell/status/1358106780153249792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>That’s the kind of magic that can still happen, that does happen all the time.</p>
<p>I learned for the first time that John Ousey’s introduction to plate tectonics came by way of “weekend courses taught by the great teacher/researcher Ehrling Dorf of Princeton” who was himself perhaps “not totally convinced.” Despite uncertainty, which he acknowledged, John Ousey was happy to share an important new idea with his Earth science class.</p>
<p>What a privilege to be able to thank him, after all these years, for being a great teacher who helped me form a scientific sensibility that has never mattered more than now. And to share a moment of appreciation for an extraordinary new visualization of the process once known as continental drift. Yes, there’s a dark side to our connected world, darker than I was once willing to imagine. But there is also so much light. It’s always helpful to consider deep geological time. That video shows a billion years of planetary churn. We’ve only been connected like this for 25 years. Maybe we’ll figure it out. For today, at least, I choose to believe that we will.</p>

   Most of what I worked on this week was covered in Serving map tiles from SQLite with MBTiles and datasette-tiles. I built two new plugins: datasette-tiles for serving map tiles, and datasette-basemap which bundles map tiles for zoom levels 0-6 of OpenStreetMap. I also released download-tiles for downloading tiles and bundling them into an MBTiles database.

  <p>Most of what I worked on this week was covered in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Feb/4/datasette-tiles/">Serving map tiles from SQLite with MBTiles and datasette-tiles</a>. I built two new plugins: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-tiles">datasette-tiles</a> for serving map tiles, and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-basemap">datasette-basemap</a> which bundles map tiles for zoom levels 0-6 of OpenStreetMap. I also released <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/download-tiles">download-tiles</a> for downloading tiles and bundling them into an MBTiles database.</p>
 sqlite-utils 3.4.1 
<p>I added one new feature to <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>: the <code>sqlite-utils import</code> command can now be configured to read CSV files using alternative delimiters, by passing the <code>--delimiter</code> option or the <code>--quotechar</code> option.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#cli-insert-csv-tsv-delimiter">covered in the documentation</a>, which provides the following example:</p>
 <code>name;description
Cleo;|Very fine; a friendly dog|
Pancakes;A local corgi
</code> 
<p>Imported using:</p>
  sqlite-utils insert dogs.db dogs dogs.csv \
  --delimiter=";" --quotechar="|"  
 Datasette 0.54.1 
<p>I spotted a subtle but nasty regression in Datasette: a change I made to how hidden form fields worked on the table page meant that clearing the <code>_search</code> search input and re-submitting the form didn't take effect, and the search would persist. <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-54-1">Datasette 0.54.1</a> fixes that bug.</p>

    Framing the problem <p>I am fighting bias and prejudice about risk perceptions; please read the next lines before you click off.&nbsp; We tend to be blind sighted to “risk” because we have all lived it, read it and listened to risk statements.&nbsp; The ones on the TV and radio for financial products, the ones at the beginning of investment statements, ones for health and safety for machinery, ones for medicine, ones on the packets of cigarettes, the one when you open that new app on your new mobile device. We are bombarded with endless risk statements that we assume we know the details of, or just ignore.&nbsp; There are more books on risk than on all other management and economics topics together.&nbsp; There is an entire field on the ontologies of risk; such is the significance of this field. This article is suggesting that all that body of knowledge and expertise has missed something.&nbsp; A bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly, and already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the Board pack or PowerPoint deck for new investment, intervention case or for the adoption of the new model, there is a risk and assumptions list.&nbsp; We have seen these so many times we don’t read them.&nbsp; These statements are often copies, and the plagiarism of risk statements inaccurately copied is significant; no effort is put in as such statements have become a habit in the process methodology. &nbsp; The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all. Quite frankly, we see risk as the prime reason to stop something and occasionally manage it closer but never too understand something better.&nbsp; If you are operating a digital or data business you have new risks that are not in your risk statement, you have not focussed on them before, you are unlikely to have been exposed to them, and this article is to bring them to your attention.&nbsp; Is that worth 8 minutes?</p><p>Many thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peadar-duffy-b47360a/">Peadar Duffy</a> whom I have been collaborating with on this thinking, and he has published <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6762051599817875456/">a super article on the same topic (quantum risk) here</a>&nbsp;</p> The purpose of business&nbsp; <p>We know that 3% of our data lake is finance data today; shockingly, 90% of our decisions are based on this sliver of data (Source Google). As we have to aim for a better ratio of “data: decisions” that includes non-financial data; we will make progress towards making better decisions that benefit more than a pure shareholder primacy view of the world.&nbsp; As leaders, we have a desire to make the best possible decisions we can. We fuse data, experience and knowledge to balance our perception of risk, probability and desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The well-publicised “<a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business Roundtable</a>” report in Aug 2019 redefines a corporation’s purpose to promote ‘An Economy That Serves All … [Americans]’.&nbsp; The idea that company purpose should be closer to ecosystem thinking has been gaining prevalence since the financial crisis in 2008.&nbsp; The thinking has significant supporters such as <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/uk/individual/larry-fink-ceo-letter">Larry Fink</a>,&nbsp; Blackrock’s founder and CEO, who is an influential voice for ESG reporting and promotes changes to decision making criteria for better outcomes. His yearly letters are an insightful journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Donald Brydon's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/852960/brydon-review-final-report.pdf">Dec 2019 report</a> highlights that governance and audit need attention if we are to deliver better decisions, transparency and accountability. The report concludes that audit has significant failings and our approach to tick box compliance is not serving directors, shareholders or society to the level expected. Given that so much of our risk management depends on the quality of the audit, internal and external, it is likely that we are unduly confident in data that is unreliable. This point alone about audit failure could be sufficient for this article’s conclusion; however, we are here to explore Quantum Risk. Quantum Risk only exists because of the business dependency we now have on data from our co-dependent supply chains to dependent ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Quantum Risk is NEW&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>As a term from physics that describes particles’ properties, “quantum” will help frame new risk characteristics.&nbsp; The primary characteristics of quantum particles’ behaviour are:- the uncertainty principle, composite systems and entanglement. &nbsp; In a language, I understand these characteristics for Quantum risk are:</p>  <p>When you observe the same risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same risk can be in many places simultaneously, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your risk and my risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem; they are coupled but may not be directly connected.</p>   Framing Risk <p>Risk, like beauty, privacy, trust, transparency and many other ideals, is a personal perspective on the world; however, we all accept that we have to live with risk.</p><p>Risk, and the management of risk, fundamentally assumes that you can identify it first. &nbsp;If you cannot identify the risk, there is no risk to consider or manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Having identified the risk, you assess the risks to categorise and prioritise them using the classic impact vs likelihood model.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the management (review and control) of risk determines if you are doing the right things or action is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible to add a third axis to a classic likelihood, impact risk model, “quality of knowledge.” The third axis visually highlights that a focus on high risks accumulates the most knowledge as that is where the management focus and control is required, and it needs data which becomes knowledge.&nbsp; &nbsp; If there is a deficit in knowledge because of <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">poor data</a>, it translates into an increased risk hidden because of poor data at any point in the matrix.&nbsp; Poor data (knowledge) can mean that either the impact (consequence) will be more severe or the likelihood (probability) is more likely. In part, we can overcome poor data problems by recognising that it always exists, but it easily hides the rather current issues of pandemics and systemic risk. However, if the quality of knowledge is based on erroneous data (<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2021/02/what-is-purpose-of-data-v2.html">data without rights and attestation</a>), we have no truth to the likelihood and impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Some sophisticated models and maths help qualify and understand the nature of risk depending on its nature and size.&nbsp; However, the list of risks that any one company faces is defined, specified and has been thought about over a long period.&nbsp; Uncovering new risk is considered unlikely; however, it is this that we are exploring and given our natural confirmational bias towards risk (we know it) - this is hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Classic risk models are framed to gain certainty, where risk is the identification, understanding, management and control of uncertainty.&nbsp; Existing risk models are highly efficient within this frame of reference, and we can optimise to our agreed boundaries of control with incredible success.&nbsp; Risk within our boundary (sphere of direct control) is calculated, and it becomes a quantified measure, enabling incentives to be created that provide a mechanism for management control. &nbsp; Risk outside our boundary (indirect control on a longer supply or value chain), whilst it is someone else’s risk we are dependent on them to manage it. Such dependencies are vital in modern global businesses. We have developed methodology (contracts) and processes (audit) to ensure that we are confident that any risk to us, inside or outside of our direct control, is identified and managed.</p><p>However, as leaders, we face three fundamental issues on this move to an economy that serves broader eco-systems as the boundaries we are dependent on have become less clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. The quality of the data and implied knowledge we receive from our direct and dependent* eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>2. The quality of the knowledge we receive from our indirect and interdependent** eco-system, even if based on audit for financial and non-financial data, is unreliable and is increasingly complicated due to different data proposes and ontologies.</p><p>3. Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (assumption first boundary is direct and already in control in our risk model)</p><p>* Dependent: balancing being able to get what I want by my own effort as contingent on or determined by the actions of someone else to make it work&nbsp; ** Interdependence combine my efforts with the efforts of others to achieve successful outcomes together but does not have to be mutual or controlled&nbsp;</p> Risk as a shared belief has wider dependencies.&nbsp; <p>Who is responsible and accountable at second and third-order data boundaries? (Point 3 above) introduces the concept of second and third-order boundaries for broader (inter)-dependent ecosystems. This short section explains where those boundaries are and why they matter in the context of a business’s purpose moving toward a sustainable ecosystem (ESG.)</p><p>The figure below expands on the dependency thinking into a visual representation. The three-axis are values/ principles as a focus [self, society, planet earth], who has accountability/ obligations [no-one, an elected authority such as a director, society or all of humanity], and the health of our eco-systems (prime, secondary, tertiary and all).</p><p>The small blue area shows the limitations of our current shareholder primacy remit, where Directors have a fiduciary duty to ensure that their prime business thrives and value is created for shareholders (stakeholders,) at the expense of others. Having a healthy ecosystem helps (competition, choice, diverse risk, margin.)&nbsp; As envisaged by the Business Roundtable, a sustainable ecosystem is the orange area, expanding the Directors remit to more eco-systems and embracing more of a “good for society” value set but does not increase director accountability.&nbsp; ESG v1.0 widens the remit to the green area; this step-change expands all current thinking and dependencies of any one player on others on a broader ecosystem. We become sustainable together.&nbsp;</p><p></p> How is it possible for unidentified risks to exist? <p>In simple terms, there is no new unknown risk; however, what is known to someone may not be known by everyone. Risk is hiding in plain sight. As we are expanding our remits as discussed in the last section above, we are increasingly dependent on others managing their risk to the same level we manage risk and share data across the ecosystem. This is where Quantum Risk arises, at the boundaries, in the long-tail of the universe of risk.</p><p>In the figure below, The Growing Universe of Risk. We are very good at the management of insurable, measurable known:known (identified and shared) risk. We are also very good at un-insurable, measurable (impact, likelihood, knowledge) and known:unknown risk mainly because the determined likelihood of occurrence and impact is moderate.&nbsp; Indeed, we have created excellent tools to help mitigate and accept uninsurable, un-measurable “unknown:unknown” risk.&nbsp; In mitigation we accept that the data quality&nbsp; (knowledge) is poor, but the impact is low, as is the likelihood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum risk is the next step out; it is emergent at the boundaries of (inter)-dependencies created as we need to create sustainable ecosystems where we share data. We are increasingly reliant on data from indirectly related players to our ecosystem, and we have no power or control. We have no rights to data and no clue on attestation. Quantum risk is not in our current risk model, or existing risk frameworks and is unimagined to us.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br> Business Risk Vs Data Risk <p>Business risk is something that every business has to deal with.&nbsp; Kodak and Nokia maybe not as well as say IBM, Barclays or Microsoft. &nbsp; Mobile phone networks should have seen mobile data services coming and therefore the advent of international voice and video apps that meant there was always going to be a natural decline in SMS, local and international mobile revenue. Most rejected this business risk in 2005 only seeing growth in core areas.&nbsp; However good hindsight is, apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram came about due to the timing of three interrelated advances, which created business risk. &nbsp; Device capability, network capability and pricing.&nbsp; Device designers and manufacturers have to keep pushing technology to keep selling devices; device technology will always advance. &nbsp; Network capacity was always going to increase, and packet-switched capability has massive economies of scale over voice circuits. Large, fast packet circuits were always going to win.&nbsp; Pricing by usage prevents usage; bundles work for increasing capacity.&nbsp; For a mobile operator, the objective is to fill the network capacity that is built to maximise ROI, bundles work, as does Apps that move revenue from one product to the next.&nbsp; This is a business risk created by change and dependencies on others in your ecosystem, quantum risks are a business risk but hide in data.</p><p>Data Risk falls into three buckets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data that you collect directly as part of the process of doing business.&nbsp; Critically you can determine the attestation (provenance and lineage) of the data, and it comes from your devices, sensors and systems.&nbsp; There is a risk that you don’t collect, store, protect, analyse or know if the data is true.&nbsp; In truth, this is the front end of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put priority. Nothing new here.</p>  <p>Data you collect from third parties who you have a relationship with. A supplier, partners, collaborator, associate or public data.&nbsp; Whilst you are likely to have the “rights to use data” (contract), you are unlikely to have “attestation” (provenance and lineage) of the shared data back to the origin. You will have access to summary or management levels (knowledge and insights), and you should have audit and other contractual agreements to check. &nbsp; There is often a mutual relationship where you both share data, both dependent on the data quality. The risk is that you don’t qualify, check, question or analyse this 3rd party data.&nbsp; In truth, this is another head-end risk of the long tail in the universe of risk, and it is precisely where we put significant resources. The exception will be public data as there is no route to understanding bias, ontology or purpose, however public data is not usually used exclusively for decision making, with one exception right now ESG and this worries me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Quantum Risk is a data risk where you neither have control of nor access to, data. Still, this data set has become critical to decision making as we move to sustainable ecosystems, stewardship codes and ESG.&nbsp; However, it requires us to dig into the dark and mysterious world data ontologies, which we have to unpack quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   Ontologies&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>To explain your reasoning, rationale or position, you need to define how entities are grouped into basic categories that structure your worldview and perspective. If you have a different perspective, you will behave and act differently.&nbsp; Such a structure is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology">ontology</a> (how we view the world) and is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a> (how do we know what is true and how we have gone about investigating/ proving it?). Ontology is a branch of philosophy but is critical in understanding data and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">information science</a> as it encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. Think of data ontology as a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point you would have thought with 5,000 years of thinking about this we would have one top-level ontology from which everything would flow.&nbsp; Alas, we don’t have one for anything.&nbsp; There is no black and white agreed way to look at anything in philosophy, physics, biology, humanities, data, climate, language, sound, knowledge, compute, behaviour and every other topic. This means that it is safe to assume your way of describing your world, in your organisation, through data is different from everyone else in your ecosystem.&nbsp; Those same data points represented in 1 and 0’s mean completely other things in different ontologies. Your worst scenario is different ontologies inside your silos which means you have different world views but may not know this.&nbsp; <a href="https://medium.com/hello-cdo">Ontology is one of the roles for a CDO, explored here</a>.&nbsp; Now to epistemology, which is concerned with the creation of knowledge, focusing on how knowledge is obtained and investigating the most valid ways to reach the truth. Epistemology essentially determines the relationship between the data, analyst and reality and is rooted in your ontological framework. Different data science teams can have the same data set and very different views, and then we add the statistics team.&nbsp; What truth or lies do you want?&nbsp; This matters when data is shared - how do you know what your business partners thinks is true about their data?</p><p>It only gets more complicated the more you unpack this and I will write an article about this soon. However, as shown in the figure, knowing how you view the world in data, does not guarantee that everyone else in your ecosystem has the same view.&nbsp; I have seen very few contracts for data sharing at business data levels share the ontology and mapping schedules between then. Yes we often share naming/ data dictionary level, but that is not ontology. Assuming that shared data has the same purpose between the partner is “quantum risk.” This risk is at the boundaries, and it only appears when you look.&nbsp; Imagine you are <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">sharing data</a> in your ecosystem on critical systems and as you read this, you realise you have not asked the question about the different world views you and your partners have towards collecting, analysing, and reporting for data.&nbsp; The event is not the same thing.&nbsp; Remember, at the start, we know everything about risk. I am in the same bucket. This is all new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Responses to Quantum Risk <p>I made two bold claims at the beginning. “The problem we all have with risk is that we know it all,” and “a bold statement, but quantum risk is new, big, ugly and is already here, it's just that we are willingly blind to it.”&nbsp; I wish it were easy, but Quantum Risk emerges at our digital business boundaries where we share data, the further we go out the less attestation and rights we have. The complexity of Quantum Risk creates havoc with our existing frameworks and models as:</p>  <p>When you observe the same quantum risk twice, it might not be there, and it will look different.</p>  <p>The same quantum risk can be in many places at the same time, but it is only one risk.</p>  <p>Your quantum risk and my quantum risk directly affect each other across our data ecosystem, but they are not connected and not seen.</p>  <p>Given this, how do we respond? We need to get better with understanding the <a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/does-data-have-a-purpose-57249c7c8e1e">purpose of our data</a>; we need to find CDO expertise to help us unpack our data ontologies and rethink what we consider are boundaries for commercial purposes, which means revisiting our contracts and terms.&nbsp; One question for those who get this far, have you tested how your users understand your Terms and Conditions on data use and privacy. I have never seen it in a test schedule as it is a barrier not a value proposition. We tell users to “Click here” fast and trust us. It is an obvious gap to investigate from a partner when you depend on that data and it is shared with you, and your advertising model now depends on it.</p><p>Any good economist/ strategist will immediately recognise the opportunity to game data at the boundary. How can I create an advantage, and what are the implications is another whole topic to unpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>As a final thought, will your corporation consider Quantum Risk?&nbsp;</p><p>If your fellow senior leadership team is focused on the head end of the long tail, you will see a focus on implementing processes that align to regulation/ rules/ law and policies. You are likely to manage risk very well and be rewarded for doing so via cascading KPI’s.&nbsp; Quantum risk will be thought about when there are best practices or a visible loss of competitive position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Corporates with a more mature risk profile know there are loopholes and whilst have a focus on compliance, they have a hand in the lobby forums so they can benefit by putting risk onto others and gaining an advantage from being the owner of IP when the lobby work becomes policy.&nbsp; Quantum risk thinking will emerge when there is a clear identification of competitive advantage.</p><p>The most mature risk leadership teams are creating new thinking to ensure that they are sustainable and not forced to make retrospective changes as they just focussed on compliance and had delivery based KPI linked bonuses.&nbsp; These are the pioneers in digital and will pick up quantum risk first.&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>I wrote this essay in 2006 as part of a series of Internet explainers I did for New Hampshire Public Radio. It never aired for reasons lost to history, so I’m publishing this 15-year-old time capsule here for the first time. My motive is of course not purely archival. I’m also reminding myself why I should still practice now what I preached then.</p>
 How and why to tell your story online 
<p>Teens and twenty-somethings are flocking to social websites like MySpace and Facebook, where they post photos, music, and personal diaries. Parents, teachers, and cops wish they wouldn’t. It’s a culture war between generations, and right now everybody’s losing.</p>
<p>Kids: Listen up. Did you hear the story about the college student who didn’t get hired because of his Facebook page? Or the teenage girl whose MySpace blog told an attacker when she’d be home alone? These things happen very rarely, but they can happen. Realize that the words and pictures you publish online will follow you around for the rest of your lives. Realize that wrong choices can have embarrassing or even tragic consequences.</p>
<p>Now, grownups, it’s your turn to listen up. You’re right to worry about the kids. But there’s another side to the story. The new forms of Internet self-publishing — including social networks, blogs, podcasting, and video sharing — can be much more than narcissistic games. Properly understood and applied, they’re power tools for claiming identity, exerting influence, and managing reputation. Sadly, very few adults are learning those skills, and fewer still are teaching them.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to condemn bad online behavior. We’ve got to model good online behavior too — in schools, on the job, and in civic life. But we’re stuck in a Catch-22 situation. Kids, who intuit the benefits of the new social media, fail to appreciate the risks. Grownups, meanwhile, see only risks and no benefits.</p>
<p>There’s a middle ground here, and we need to approach it from both sides of the generation gap. The new reality is that, from now on, our lives will be documented online — perhaps by us, perhaps by others, perhaps by both. We may or may not influence what others will say about us. But we can surely control our own narratives, and shape them in ways that advance our personal, educational, professional, and civic agendas.</p>
<p>Your online identity is a lifelong asset. If you invest in it foolishly you’ll regret that. But failing to invest at all is equally foolish. The best strategy, as always, is to invest wisely.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple test to guide your strategy. Imagine someone searching Google for your name. That person might be a college admissions officer, a prospective employer, a new client, an old friend, or even a complete stranger. The reason for the search might be to evaluate your knowledge, interests, agenda, accomplishments, credentials, activities, or reputation.</p>
<p>What do you want that person to find? That’s what you should publish online.</p>
<p>To find three examples of what I mean, try searching the web for the following three names: Todd Suomela, Martha Burtis, Thomas Mahon. In each case, the first Google result points to a personal blog that narrates a professional life.</p>
<p>Todd Suomela is a graduate student at the University of Michigan. On his blog, Todd writes about what he’s learning, and about how his interests and goals are evolving. He hasn’t launched his professional career yet. But when he does, his habit of sharing the information resources he collects, and reflecting thoughtfully on his educational experience, will serve him well.</p>
<p>Martha Burtis is an instructional technologist at the University of Mary Washington. She and her team research and deploy the technologies that students, faculty, and staff use to learn, teach, and collaborate. On her blog, Martha writes about the tools and techniques she and her team are developing, she assesses how her local academic community is making use of those tools and techniques, and thinks broadly about the future of education.</p>
<p>Thomas Mahon is a Savile Row tailor. His shop in London caters to people who can spend two thousand pounds on a classic handmade suit. I’ll never be in the market for one of those, but if I were I’d be fascinated by Mahon’s blog, EnglishCut.com, which tells you everything you might want to know about Savile Row past and present, about how Mahan practices the craft of bespoke tailoring, and about how to buy and care for the garments he makes.</p>
<p>For Todd and Martha and Thomas, the benefits of claiming their Net identities in these ways run wide and deep. Over time, their online narratives become autobiographies read by friends, colleagues, or clients, and just as importantly, read by people who may one day become friends, colleagues, or clients.</p>
<p>In most cases, of course, the words, pictures, audio, and video you might choose to publish online won’t attract many readers, listeners, or viewers. That’s OK. The point is that the people they do attract will be exactly the right people: those who share your interests and goals.</p>
<p>We’ve always used the term ‘social networking’ to refer to the process of finding and connecting with those people. And that process has always depended on a fabric of trust woven most easily in the context of local communities and face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>But our interests and goals aren’t merely local. We face global challenges that compel us to collaborate on a global scale. Luckily, the new modes of social networking can reach across the Internet to include people anywhere and everywhere. But if we’re going to trust people across the Internet, we’ll need to be able check their references. Self-published narrative is one crucial form of evidence. The public reaction to such narratives, readily discoverable thanks to search engines and citation indexes, is another.</p>
<p>Is this a new and strange new activity? From one perspective it is, and that’s why I can’t yet point to many other folks who’ve figured out appropriate and effective ways to be online, as Todd and Martha and Thomas have.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, Internet self-publishing is just a new way to do what we’ve been doing for tens of thousand years: telling stories to explain ourselves to one another, and to make sense of our world.</p>

  <p>Working on <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/31/weeknotes/">datasette-leaflet</a> last week re-kindled my interest in using Datasette as a GIS (Geographic Information System) platform. SQLite already has strong GIS functionality in the form of <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/spatialite.html">SpatiaLite</a> and <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> is currently the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins?sort=downloads-this-week">most downloaded</a> plugin. Most importantly, maps are fun!</p>
 MBTiles 
<p>I was talking to <a href="https://macwright.com/">Tom MacWright</a> on Monday and I mentioned that I'd been thinking about how SQLite might make a good mechanism for distributing tile images for use with libraries like Leaflet. "I might be able to save you some time there" he said... and he showed me <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec">MBTiles</a>, a specification he started developing ten years ago at Mapbox which does exactly that - bundles tile images up in SQLite databases.</p>
<p>(My best guess is I read about MBTiles a while ago, then managed to forget about the spec entirely while the idea of using SQLite for tile distribution wedged itself in my head somewhere.)</p>
 The new datasette-tiles plugin 
<p>I found some example MBTiles files on the internet and started playing around with them. My first prototype used the <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-media">datasette-media</a> plugin, described here previously in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/30/fun-binary-data-and-sqlite/">Fun with binary data and SQLite</a>. I used some convoluted SQL to teach it that hits to <code>/-/media/tiles/{z},{x},{y}</code> should serve up content from the <code>tiles</code> table in my MBTiles database - you can see details of that prototype in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/datasette/serving-mbtiles">this TIL: Serving MBTiles with datasette-media</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious next step was to write a dedicated plugin: <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-tiles">datasette-tiles</a>. Install it and run Datasette against any MBTiles database file and the plugin will set up a <code>/-/tiles/db-name/z/x/y.png</code> endpoint that serves the specified tiles.</p>
<p>It also adds a tile explorer view with a pre-configured Leaflet map. Here's <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/-/tiles/japan-toner">a live demo</a> serving up a subset of Stamen's toner map - just zoom levels 6 and 7 for the country of Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/-/tiles/japan-toner"></a></p>
<p>Here's how to run this on your own computer:</p>
 <code># Install Datasette
brew install datasette
# Install the plugin
datasette install datasette-tiles
# Download the japan-toner.db database
curl -O https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/japan-toner.db
# Launch Datasette and open a browser
datasette japan-toner.db -o
# Use the cog menu to access the tile explorer
# Or visit http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/tiles/japan-toner
</code> 
 Creating MBTiles files with my download-tiles tool 
<p>A sticking point when I started playing with MBTiles was finding example files to work with.</p>
<p>After some digging, I came across the amazing <a href="https://export.hotosm.org/en/v3/">HOT Export Tool</a>. It's a project by the <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> that allows anyone to export subsets of data from OpenStreetMap in a wide variety of formats, including MBTiles.</p>
<p>I filed <a href="https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool/issues/371">a minor bug report</a> against it, and in doing so took a look at the source code (it's all open source)... and found <a href="https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool-python/blob/8e4165a454303abbea2bd18cf5ffcdd5b9d0370d/osm_export_tool/nontabular.py#L103-L108">the code that assembles MBTiles files</a>. It uses another open source library called <a href="https://github.com/makinacorpus/landez">Landez</a>, which provides functions for downloading tiles from existing providers and bundling those up as an MBTiles SQLite file.</p>
<p>I prefer command-line tools for this kind of thing over using Python libraries directly, so I fired up my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">click-app cookiecutter template</a> and built a thin command-line interface over the top of the library.</p>
<p>The new tool is called <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/download-tiles">download-tiles</a> and it does exactly that: downloads tiles from a tile server and creates an MBTiles SQLite database on disk containing those tiles.</p>
<p>Please use this tool responsibly. Downloading large numbers of tiles is bad manners. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/">OpenStreetMap Tile Usage Policy</a>, and use the tool politely when pointing it at other tile servers.</p>
<p>Basic usage is as follows:</p>
 <code>download-tiles world.mbtiles
</code> 
<p>By default the tool pulls tiles from OpenStreetMap. The above command will fetch zoom levels 0-3 of the entire world - 85 tiles total, well within acceptable usage limits.</p>
<p>Various options (described in <a href="https://datasette.io/tools/download-tiles">the README</a>) can be used to customize the tiles that are downloaded. Here's how I created the <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/japan-toner">japan-toner.db</a> demo database, linked to above:</p>
 <code>download-tiles japan-toner.mbtiles \ 
    --zoom-levels 6-7 \
    --country Japan \
    --tiles-url "http://{s}.tile.stamen.com/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" \
    --tiles-subdomains "a,b,c,d" \
    --attribution 'Map tiles by Stamen Design, under CC BY 3.0. Data by OpenStreetMap, under CC BY SA.'
</code> 
<p>The <code>--country Japan</code> option here looks up the bounding box for Japan <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?country=japan">using Nominatim</a>. <code>--zoom-levels 6-7</code> fetches zoom levels 6 and 7 (in this case that makes for 193 tiles total). <code>--tiles-url</code> and <code>--tiles-subdomain</code> configure the tile server to fetch them from. The <code>--attribution</code> option bakes that string into the <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/japan-toner/metadata">metadata table</a> for the database - which is then used to display it correctly in the tile explorer (and eventually in other Datasette plugins).</p>
 datasette-basemap 
<p>Out of the box, Datasette's current Leaflet plugins (<a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a>, <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-leaflet-geojson">datasette-leaflet-geojson</a> and so on) serve tiles directly from the OpenStreetMap tile server.</p>
<p>I've never felt particularly comfortable about this. Users can configure the plugins to run against other tile servers, but pointing to OpenStreetMap as a default was the easiest way to ensure these plugins would work for people who just wanted to try them out.</p>
<p>Now that I have the tooling for bundling map subsets, maybe I can do better.</p>
<p><a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-basemap">datasette-basemap</a> offers an alternative: it's a plugin that bundles a 22.7MB SQLite file containing zoom levels 0-6 of OpenStreetMap - <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/basemap/tiles?_facet=zoom_level">5,461 tiles total</a>.</p>
<p>Running <code>pip install datasette-basemap</code> (or <code>datasette install datasette-basemap</code>) will install the plugin, complete with that database - and register it with Datasette.</p>
<p>Start Datasette with the plugin installed and <code>/basemap</code> will expose <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/basemap">the bundled database</a>. Install <code>datasette-tiles</code> and you'll be able to browse it as a tile server: <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/-/tiles/basemap">here's a demo</a>.</p>
<p>(I recommend also installing <a href="https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-render-images">datasette-render-images</a> so you can see the tile images themselves in the regular table view, <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/basemap/tiles">like this</a>.)</p>
<p>Zoom level 6 is close enough that major cities and the roads between them are visible, for all of the countries in the world. Not bad for 22.7MB!</p>
<p>This is the first time I've built a Datasette plugin that bundles a full SQLite database as part of the Python package. The pattern seems to work well - I'm excited to explore it further with other projects.</p>
 Bonus feature: tile stacks 
<p>I added one last feature to <code>datasette-tiles</code> before writing everything up for my blog. I'm calling this feature tile stacks - it lets you serve tiles from multiple MBTiles files, falling back to other files if a tile is missing.</p>
<p>Imagine you had a low-zoom-level world map (similar to <code>datasette-basemap</code>) and a number of other databases providing packages of tiles for specific countries or cities. You could run Datasette like this:</p>
 <code>datasette basemap.mbtiles japan.mbtiles london.mbtiles tokyo.mbtiles
</code> 
<p>Hitting <code>/-/tiles-stack/1/1/1.png</code> would seek out the specified tile in the <code>tokyo.mbtiles</code> file, then fall back to <code>london.mbtiles</code> and then <code>japan.mbtiles</code> and finally <code>basemap.mbtiles</code> if it couldn't find it.</p>
<p>For a demo, visit <a href="https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/-/tiles-stack">https://datasette-tiles-demo.datasette.io/-/tiles-stack</a> and zoom in on Japan. It should start to display the Stamen toner map once you get to zoom levels 6 and 7.</p>
 Next steps 
<p>I've been having a lot of fun exploring MBTiles - it's such a natural fit for Datasette, and it's exciting to be able to build new things on top of nearly a decade of innovation by other geo-hackers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of features missing from <code>datasette-tiles</code>.</p>
<p>It currently only handles <code>.png</code> image data, but the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.3/spec.md">MBTiles 1.3 specification</a> also defines <code>.jpg</code> and <code>.webp</code> tiles, plus vector tiles using Mapbox's <code>.pbf</code> gzip-compressed protocol buffers.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec">UTFGrid</a> is a related specification for including "rasterized interaction data" in MBTiles databases - it helps efficiently provide maps <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/how-interactivity-works-with-utfgrid-3b7d437f9ca9">with millions of embedded objects</a>.</p>
<p>As a newcomer to the MBTiles world I'd love to hear suggestions for new features and feedback on how I can improve what I've got so far in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-tiles/issues">datasette-tiles issues</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to serve your own map tiles like this feels very much in the spirit of the OpenStreetMap project. I'm looking forward to using my own tile subsets for any future projects that fit within a sensible tile subset.</p>

    We continually move towards better data-led decisions; however, we can easily ask our dataset’s wrong question. Without understanding “What is the purpose of data” on which we are basing decisions and judgements, it is easy to get an answer that is not in the data. How can we understand if our direction, Northstar or decision is a good one?&nbsp; Why am I interested in this? I am focusing on how we improve governance and oversight in a data-led world.&nbsp; <p>I wrote a lengthy article on<a href="https://tonyfish.medium.com/data-is-data-90ba0b803178"> Data is Data.</a> It was a kickback at the analogies that data is oil, gold, labour, sunlight - data is not. Data is unique; it has unique characteristics. That article concluded that the word “Data” is also part of the problem, but we should think of data as if discovering a new element with unique characteristics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Data is a word, and it is part of the problem.&nbsp; Data doesn’t have meaning or shape, and data will not have meaning unless we can give it context. As<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theodoralau/"> Theodora Lau</a> eloquently put it; if her kiddo gets 10 points in a test today (data as a state), the number 10 has no meaning, unless we say, she scored 10 points out of 10 in the test today (data is information). And even then, we still need to explain the type of test (data is knowledge) and what to do next or how to improve (data is insights).&nbsp; Each of these is a “data” point, and we don’t differentiate the use of the word “data” in these contexts.</p><p>Data’s most fundamental representation is “state” where it represents the particular condition something is in at a specific time.&nbsp; I love<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hughmacleod/"> Hugh’s work @gapingvoid</a> (below) representation&nbsp; Information is knowing that there are different “states” (on/off). Knowledge is finding patterns and connections.&nbsp; Insight knows comparatives to state. Wisdom is the journey.&nbsp; We live in the hope that the data we have will have an impact.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the data community has rested on two key characteristics of data: non-rivalrous (which plays havoc with our current understanding of ownership) and non-fungible (which is true if you assume that data carries information.)&nbsp; Whilst these are both accurate observations; they are not that good as universal characteristics.</p>  <p>Non-rivalrous. Economists call an item that can only be used by one person at a time as "rivalrous." Money and capital are rivalrous. Data is non-rivalrous as a single item of data can simultaneously fuel multiple algorithms, analytics, and applications.&nbsp; This is, however, not strictly true. Numerous perfect copies of “data” can be used simultaneously because the marginal cost of reproduction and sharing is zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Non-fungible. When you can substitute one item for another, they are said to be fungible.&nbsp; One sovereign bill can be replaced for another sovereign bill of the same value; one barrel of oil is the same as the next.&nbsp; So the thinking goes, data is non-fungible and cannot be substituted because it carries information.&nbsp; However, if your view is that data carries state (the particular condition that something is in at a specific time), then data is fungible. Higher-level ideals of data that is processed (information, knowledge, insights) are increasingly non-fungible.</p>   Money as a framework to explore the purpose of data&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Sovereign currency (FIAT), money in this setting, has two essential characteristics.&nbsp; It has rivalrous and fungible.&nbsp; Without these foundational characteristics, money cannot fulfil its original purpose (it has many others now); a trusted exchange medium.&nbsp; Money removes the former necessity of a direct barter, where equal value had to be established, and the two or more parties had to meet for an exchange.&nbsp; What is interesting is that there are alternatives to FIAT which exploit other properties.&nbsp; Because of fraud, we have to have security features, and there is a race to build the most secure wall.</p><p></p><br><p>[Just as a side note - money is an abstraction and part of the rationale for a balance sheet was to try to connect the abstraction back to real things. Not sure that works any more]</p> Revising the matrix “what problem is to be solved?”&nbsp; <p>Adding these other options of exchange onto the matrix, we have a different way to frame what problem each type of currency offers as a method of exchange mechanism. This is presented in the chart below.&nbsp; Sand and beans can be used, but they provide a messy tool compared to a sovereign currency.&nbsp; Crypto works, and it solves the problem, but without exchange to other currencies, it had fundamental limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>If we now add digital data and other aspects of our world onto the matrix, we have a different perspective. We all share gravity, sunsets and broadcast TV/ radio on electromagnetic waves.&nbsp; However, only one atom can be used at a time, and that atom is not-interchangeable (to get the same outcome.)&nbsp; The point is that digital data is not in the same quadrant as sovereign currency and electrons as a beautiful solution based on being fungible and rivalrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the broadest definition of data which is “state”; chemical, atoms, gravity, electrons have state and therefore are also data.&nbsp; To be clear will now use Digital Data to define our focus and not all data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>These updates to the matrix highlight that, if data is non-rivalrous and non-fungible, these characteristics mean that is is very unclear to what problem digital data is solving.&nbsp; We see this all the time in the digital data market, as we cannot agree on what “data” is, it is messy.&nbsp;</p><p>The question for us as a digital data community is; “what are the axis [characteristics] that mean digital data is in the top corner of a matrix? This is where digital data is a beautiful solution to a defined problem, given that digital data is at its core is “knowing state.”&nbsp; I explored this question on a call with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott David</a>, and we ended up resting on “Rights and Attestation” as the two axes&nbsp;</p><p>Rights in this context are that you have gained rights from the Parties.&nbsp; What and how those rights were acquired is not the question; it is just that you have the rights you need to do what you need to do.</p><p>Attestation in this context is the evidence or proof of something.&nbsp; It is that you know what you have is true and that you can prove the state exists. How you do this is not the point; it is just you know it is provable.</p><p></p><p>As we saw with the money example, data will never have these (rights and attestation) characteristics exclusively; it is just when it has them, data is most purposeful.&nbsp; Without attestation, the data you have is compromised, and any conclusions you reach may not be true or real. Continually we have to test both our assumptions and the provability of our digital data. &nbsp; Rights are different as rights are not correlated with data quality, but rights may help resolve ownership issues.&nbsp; A business built without rights to the data they are using is not stable or sustainable.&nbsp; How and if those Rights were obtained ethically are matters to be investigated.&nbsp; Interestingly, these characteristics (rights and attestation)&nbsp; would readily fit into existing risk and audit frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a specific focus on ESG, sustainability, data for decision making, and better data for sharing.&nbsp; Given that most comparative ESG data is from public reports (creative commons or free of rights), it is essential to note there is a break in the attestation.&nbsp; ESG data right now is in the least useful data bucket for decision making, but we are making critical investment decisions on this analysis data set. It is something that we have to address.&nbsp;</p><br> In summary <p>If the purpose of data is “to share state” then the two essential characteristics data must have are rights and attestation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, as data becomes information (knowing state), knowledge (patterns of states), insight (context in states) and wisdom - these characteristics of rights and attestation matter even more.&nbsp; If you are making decisions on data that you don’t know if it is true or have the rights to it, becomes a dangerous place.&nbsp;</p><p>As a side, there is lots of technology and processes to know if the state is true (as in correct - not truth); if the state sensing is working and the level of accuracy; if the state at both ends has the same representation (providence/ lineage ); if it is secure; if we can gain information; if we can combine data sets and what the ontology is.&nbsp; But these are not fundamental characteristics; they are supportive and ensure we have a vibrant ecosystem of digital data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> I am sure there are other labels for such a matrix and interested in your views, thoughts and comments.&nbsp; <br>

   Cleaning Up Your Postgres Database 
 Craig Kerstiens provides some invaluable tips on running an initial check of the health of a PostgreSQL database, by using queries against the pg_statio_user_indexes table to find the memory cache hit ratio and the pg_stat_user_tables table to see what percentage of queries to your tables are using an index.

<p>Are you registered for the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> yet?  As <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=267">I wrote a decade, a year, and a day ago</a>, “It’s where Internet identity work gets done.”  That remains as true now is it was then!</p>
<p>As a personal testimonial, I wrote this to the IIW organizers after the 2020 IIWs:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Thanks again for running the most engaging and successful virtual meetings of the year (by far!).  While I’ve come to dread most of the large virtual meetings, IIW online remains true to the spirit of the last 15 years of useful workshops.  Yes, I miss talking to Rich and the attendees in the coffee line and having impromptu discussions throughout, and we’ll get back to that in time, but the sessions remain useful and engaging.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m also proud that Microsoft is continuing its 15-year tradition of sponsoring the workshop.  Rather than buying dinner for the attendees (the conversations at the dinners were always fun!), we’re sponsoring scholarships for those that might otherwise not be able to attend, fostering an even more interesting and diverse set of viewpoints at the workshop.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

  <p>Summary:      Generative identity allows us to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, contemplates and addresses the problems of social inclusion, and supports economic equality to everyone around the globe. This article describes the implementation self-sovereign identity through protocol-mediated credential exchange on the self-sovereign internet, examines its properties, and argues for it generative nature from those properties.</p>




<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">The Generative Self-Sovereign Internet</a> explored the generative properties of the self-sovereign internet, a secure overlay network created by DID connections. The generative nature of the self-sovereign internet is underpinned by the same kind of properties that make the internet what it is, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, I explore the generativity of self-sovereign identity—specifically the exchange of verifiable credentials. One of the key features of the self-sovereign internet is that it is protocological—the messaging layer supports the implementation of protocol-mediated interchanges on top of it. This extensibility underpins its generativity. Two of the most important protocols defined on top of the self-sovereign internet support the exchange of verifiable credentials as we'll see below. Together, these protocols work on top of the the self-sovereign internet to give rise to self-sovereign identity through a global identity metasystem.
</p>

<a></a>
 Verifiable Credentials 

<p>
    While the control of self-certifying identifiers in the form of DIDs is the basis for the autonomy of the self-sovereign internet, that autonomy is made effective through the exchange of verifiable credentials. Using verifiable credentials, an autonomous actor on the self-sovereign internet can prove attributes to others in a way they can trust. Figure 1 shows the SSI stack. The self-sovereign internet is labeled "Layer Two" in this figure. Credential exchange happens on top of that in Layer Three.
</p>


  <a></a>
  Figure 1: SSI Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows how credentials are exchanged. In this diagram, Alice has DID-based relationships with Bob, Carol, Attestor.org and Certiphi.com. Alice has received a credential from Attestor.org. The credential contains attributes that Attestor.org is willing to attest belong to Alice. For example, Attestor might be her employer attesting that she is an employee. Attestor likely gave her a credential for their own purposes. Maybe Alice uses it for passwordless login at company web sites and services and to purchase meals at the company cafeteria. She might also use it at partner websites (like the benefits provider) to provide shared authentication without federation (and it's associated infrastructure). Attestor is acting as a credential issuer. We call Alice a credential holder in this ceremony. The company and partner websites are credential verifiers. Credential issuance is a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">protocol that operates on top of the self-sovereign internet</a>.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Credential Exchange (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Even though Attestor.org issued the credential to Alice for its own purposes, she holds it in her wallet and can use it at other places besides Attestor. For example, suppose she is applying for a loan and her bank, Certiphi, who wants proof that she's employed and has a certain salary. Alice could use the credential from Attestor to prove to Certiphi that she's employed and that her salary exceeds a given threshold1. Certiphi is also acting as a credential verifier. Credential proof and verification is also  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">protocol that operates on top of the self-sovereign internet</a>. As shown in Figure 2, individuals can also issue and verify credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    We say Alice "proved" attributes to Certiphi from her credentials because the <a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-technology-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-all/">verification protocol uses zero knowledge proof</a> to support the minimal disclosure of data. Thus the credential that Alice holds from Attestor might contain a rich array of information, but Alice need only disclose the information that Certiphi needs for her loan. In addition, the proof process ensures that Alice can't be correlated though the DIDs she has shared with others. Attribute data isn't tied to DIDs or the keys that are currently assigned to the DID. Rather than attributes bound to identifiers and keys, Alice's identifiers and keys empower the attributes. 
</p>

<p>
    Certiphi can validate important properties of the credential. Certiphi is able to validate the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">fidelity of the credential</a> by reading the credential definition from the ledger (Layer One in Figure 1), retrieving Attestor's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attestor.org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, the presentation protocol allows Certiphi to verify that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked (using a revocation registry store in Layer 1). Certiphi does not need to contact Attestor or have any prior business relationship to verify these properties. 
</p>

<p>
    The global identity metasystem, shown as the yellow box in Figure 1, comprises the ledger at Layer 1, the self-sovereign internet at Layer 2, and the credential exchange protocols that operate on top of it. Together, these provide the necessary features and characteristics to support self-sovereign identity.
</p>

<a></a>
 Properties of Credential Exchange 

<p>
    Verifiable credentials have five important characteristics that mirror how credentials work in the offline world:
</p>
 
     Credentials are decentralized and contextual. There is no central authority for all credentials. Every party can be an issuer, a holder, or a verifier. Verifiable credentials can be adapted to any country, any industry, any community, or any set of trust relationships. 
     Credential issuers decide what data is contained in their credentials. Anyone can write credential schemas to the ledger. Anyone can create a credential definition based on any of these schemas. 
     Verifiers make their own decisions about which credentials to accept—there's no central authority who determines what credentials are important or which are used for a given purpose. 
     Verifiers do not need to contact issuers to perform verification—that's what the ledger is for. Credential verifiers don't need to have any technical, contractual, or commercial relationship with credential issuers in order to determine the credentials' fidelity. 
     Credential holders are free to choose which credentials to carry and what information to disclose. People and organizations are in control of the credentials they hold and to determine what to share with whom.  
 

<p>
    These characteristics underlie several important properties that support the generativity of credential exchange.  Here are the most important:
</p>

<p>
    Private— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design">Privacy by Design</a> is baked deep into the architecture of the identity metasystem as reflected by several fundamental architectural choices:</p> 
         Peer DIDs are pairwise unique and pseudonymous by default to prevent correlation.  
         Personal data is never written to the ledgers at Layer 1 in Figure 1—not even in encrypted or hashed form. Instead, all private data is exchanged over peer-to-peer encrypted connections between off-ledger agents at Layer 2. The ledger is used for anchoring rather than publishing encrypted data. 
         Credential exchange has built-in support for zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to avoid unnecessary disclosure of identity attributes. 
         As we saw earlier, verifiers don’t need to contact the issuer to verify a credential. Consequently, the issuer doesn’t know when or where the credential is used.  
     
<p></p>


<p>
    Decentralized—decentralization <a>follows directly from the fact that no one owns the infrastructure</a> that supports credential exchange. This is the primary criterion for judging the degree of decentralization in a system. Rather, the infrastructure, like that of the internet, is operated by many organizations and people bound by protocol. 
</p>

<p>
    Heterarchical—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy">heterarchy</a> is a "system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways." Participants in credential exchange relate to each other as peers and are autonomous. 
</p>

<p>
    Interoperable—verifiable credentials have a standard format, readily accessible schemas, and a standard protocols for issuance, proving (presenting), and verification. Participants can interact with anyone else so long as they use tools that follow the standards and protocols. Credential exchange isn't a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, interoperability relies on interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Interoperability supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    Substitutable—the tools for issuing, holding, proving, and verifying are available from multiple vendors and follow well-documented, open standards. Because these tools are interoperable, issuers, holders, and verifiers can choose software, hardware, and services without fear of being locked into a proprietary tool. Moreover, because many of the attributes the holder needs to prove (e.g. email address or even employer) will be available on multiple credentials, the holder can choose between credentials.  Usable substitutes provide choice and freedom. 
</p>

<p>Flexible—closely related to substitutability, flexibility allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. The characteristics of credential exchange allow for context-specific scenarios.
</p>


<p> Reliable and Censorship Resistant—people, businesses, and others must be able to exchange credentials without worrying that the infrastructure will go down, stop working, go up in price, or get taken over by someone who would do them harm. Substitutability of tools and credentials combined with autonomy makes the system resistant to censorship. There is no hidden third party or intermediary in Figure 2. Credentials are exchanged peer-to-peer. 
</p>

<p>Non-proprietary and Open—no one has the power to change how credentials are exchanged by fiat. Furthermore, the underlying infrastructure is less likely to go out of business and stop operation because its maintenance and operation are decentralized instead of being in the hands of a single organization. The identity metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a> as NEA: No one owns it, Everyone can use it, and Anyone can improve it. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
</p>


<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—people can act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one-sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
</p>

<p>Inclusive—inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
</p>

<p>Universal—successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. Credential exchange, built on the self-sovereign internet and based on protocol, has network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that the metasystem will be mandated. Rather, one protocol will mediate all interaction because everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it out of self-interest. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Generativity of Credential Exchange 

<p>Applying <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">Zittrain's framework for evaluating generativity</a> is instructive for understanding the generative properties of self-sovereign identity.</p>

<a></a>
 Capacity for Leverage 
<p>In Zittrain's words, leverage is the extent to which an object "enables valuable accomplishments that otherwise would be either impossible or not worth the effort to achieve." Leverage multiplies effort, reducing the time and cost necessary to innovate new capabilities and features.
</p>

<p>
    Traditional <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#anemic"> identity systems have been anemic</a>, supporting simple relationships focused on authentication and a few basic attributes their administrators need. They can't easily be leveraged by anyone but their owner. Federation through SAML or OpenID Connect has allowed the authentication functionality to be leveraged in a standard way, but authentication is just a small portion of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">overall utility of a digital relationship</a>.
</p>

<p>
    One example of the capacity of credential exchange for leverage is to consider that it could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml%22">disintermediates platform companies like Uber, AirBnB, and the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies build proprietary trust frameworks to intermediate exchanges between parties and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. Credential exchange can open these trust frameworks up to create open marketplaces for services. 
</p>

<p>
    The next section on Adaptability lists a number of uses for credentials. The identity metasystem supports all these use cases with minimal development work on the part of issuers, verifiers, and holders. And because the underlying system is interoperable, an investment in the tools necessary to solve one identity problem with credentials can be leveraged by many others without new investment. The cost to define a credential is very low (often less than $100) and once the definition is in place, there is no cost to issue credentials against it. A small investment can allow an issuer to issue millions of credentials of different types for different use cases.
</p>

    Adaptability can refer to a technology's ability to be used for multiple activities without change as well as its capacity for modification in service of new use cases. Adaptability is orthogonal to a technology's capacity for leverage. An airplane, for example, offers incredible leverage, allowing goods and people to be transported over long distances quickly. But airplanes are neither useful in activities outside transportation or easily modified for different uses. A technology that supports hundreds of use cases is more generative than one that is useful in only a few.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">Identity systems based on credential exchange</a> provide people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into. Credential exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">allows for ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The flexibility of credentials ensures they can be used in a variety of situations. Every form or official piece of paper is a potential credential.  Here are a few examples of common credentials:
</p>
 
     Employee badges 
     Drivers license 
     Passport 
     Wire authorizations 
     Credit cards 
     Business registration 
     Business licenses 
     College transcripts 
     Professional licensing (government and private) 
 
<p>
    But even more important, every bundle of data transmitted in a workflow is a potential credential. Since <a href="https://rufftimo.medium.com/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0"> credentials are just trustworthy containers for data</a>, there are many more use cases that may not be typically thought of as credentials:
</p>
 
     Invoices and receipts 
     Purchase orders 
     Airline or train ticket 
     Boarding pass 
     Certificate of authenticity (e.g. for art, other valuables) 
     Gym (or any) membership card 
     Movie (or any) tickets 
     Insurance cards 
     Insurance claims 
     Titles (e.g. property, vehicle, etc.) 
     Certificate of provenance (e.g. non-GMO, ethically sourced, etc.) 
     Prescriptions 
     Fractional ownership certificates for high value assets 
     CO2 rights and carbon credit transfers 
     Contracts 
 
<p>
    Since even a small business might issue receipts or invoices, have customers who use the company website, or use employee credentials, most businesses will define at least one credential and many will need many more. There are potentially tens of millions of different credential types. Many will use common schemas but each credential from a different issuer constitutes a different identity credential for a different context. 
</p>

<p>
    With the ongoing work in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, these use cases expand even further.  With a “redeemable credentials” feature, holders can prove possession of a credential in a manner that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spend</a> proof without a ledger. This works for all kinds of redemption use cases like clocking back in at the end of a shift, voting in an election, posting an online review, or redeeming a coupon.
</p>

<p>
    The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. Credential exchange protocols must be flexible enough to support many different situations. For example, in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I describe a use case that requires the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. Credential exchange readily adapts to these context-dependent, ad hoc situations. 
</p>



<a></a>
 Ease of Mastery 
<p>
    Ease of mastery refers to the capacity of a technology to be easily and broadly adapted and adopted. One of the core features of credential exchange on the identity metasystem is that supports the myriad use cases described above without requiring new applications or user experiences for each one. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">digital wallet that is at the heart of credential exchange activities on the self-sovereign internet</a> supports two primary artifacts and the user experiences to manage them: connections and credentials. Like the web browser, even though multiple vendors provide digital wallets, the underlying protocol informs a common user experience. 
</p>

<p>
    A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Accessibility 
<p>
    Accessible technologies are easy to acquire, inexpensive, and resistant to censorship. Because of it's openness, standardization, and support by multiple vendors, credential exchange is easily available to anyone with access to a computer or phone with an internet connection. But we can't limit its use to individuals who have digital access and legal capacity. Ensuring that technical and legal architectures for credential exchange support guardianship and use on borrowed hardware can provide accessibility to almost everyone in the world. 
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">Sovrin Foundation's Guardianship Working working group</a> has put significant effort into understanding the technical underpinnings (e.g., guardianship and delegation credentials), legal foundations (e.g., guardianship contracts), and business drivers (e.g., economic models for guardianship). They have produced an <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/guardianship-white-paper/">excellent whitepaper on guardianship</a> that "examines why digital guardianship is a core principle for Sovrin and other SSI architectures, and how it works from inception to termination through looking at real-world use cases and the stories of two fictional dependents, Mya and Jamie."
</p>


<a></a>
 Self-Sovereign Identity and Generativity 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">What is SSI?</a>, I made the claim that SSI requires decentralized identifiers, credential exchange, and autonomy for participants.  <a href="https://medium.com/@dickhardt">Dick Hardt</a> pushed back on that a bit and asked me if decentralized identifiers were really necessary? We had a several fun discussions on that topic.
</p>

<p>
    In that article, I unfortunately used decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials as placeholders for their properties. Once I started looking at properties, I realized that generative identity can't be built on an administrative identity system. Self-sovereign identity is generative not only because of the credential exchange protocols but also because of the properties of the self-sovereign internet upon which those protocols are defined and operate. Without the self-sovereign internet, enabled through DIDComm, you might implement something that works as SSI, but it won't provide the leverage and adaptability necessary to creating a generative ecosystem of uses that creates the network effects needed to propel it to ubiquity. 
</p>

<p>
    Our past approach to digital identity has put us in a position where people's privacy and security are threatened by the administrative identity architecture it imposes. Moreover, limiting its scope to authentication and a few unauthenticated attributes, repeated across thousands of websites with little interoperability, has created confusion, frustration, and needless expense.  None of the identity systems in common use today offer support for the same kind of ad hoc attribute sharing that happens everyday in the physical world. The result has been anything but generative.  Entities who rely on attributes from several parties must perform integrations with all of them. This is slow, complex, and costly, so it typically happens only for high-value applications.
</p>

<p>
    An identity metasystem that supports protocol-mediated credential exchange running on top of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_generative_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">self-sovereign internet</a> solves these problems and promises generative identity for everyone.  By starting with people and their innate autonomy, generative identity supports online activities that are life-like and natural. Generative identity allows us to live digital lives with dignity and effectiveness, contemplates and addresses the problems of social inclusion, and supports economic access for people around the globe. 
</p>

 Notes 

 
     For Alice to prove things about her salary, Attestor would have to include that in the credential they issue to Alice.

<p>Just got a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/historic-grindr-fine-shows-need-for-ftc-enforcement-action/">press release</a>&nbsp;by email from <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/get-to-know-david-rosen/">David Rosen</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/firstpersonpol">@firstpersonpol</a>) of the <a href="https://www.citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>&nbsp;press office.&nbsp;The headline says “Historic Grindr Fine Shows Need for FTC Enforcement Action.” The same release is also a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/historic-grindr-fine-shows-need-for-ftc-enforcement-action/">post</a>&nbsp;in the <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/">news</a> section of the Public Citizen website. This is it:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Norwegian Data Protection Agency today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/business/grindr-gdpr-privacy-fine.html?searchResultPosition=1">fined Grindr $11.7 million</a>&nbsp;following a Jan. 2020&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/popular-dating-health-apps-violate-privacy/">report</a>&nbsp;that the dating app systematically violates users’ privacy. Public Citizen asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general to investigate Grindr and other popular dating apps, but the agency has yet to take action. Burcu Kilic, digital rights program director for Public Citizen, released the following statement:</p>
<p>“Fining Grindr for systematic privacy violations is a historic decision under Europe’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and a strong signal to the AdTech ecosystem that business-as-usual is over. The question now is when the FTC will take similar action and bring U.S. regulatory enforcement in line with those in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“Every day, millions of Americans share their most intimate personal details on apps like Grindr, upload personal photos, and reveal their sexual and religious identities. But these apps and online services spy on people, collect vast amounts of personal data and share it with third parties without people’s knowledge. We need to regulate them now, before it’s too late.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first link goes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/business/grindr-gdpr-privacy-fine.html">Grindr is fined $11.7 million under European privacy law</a>, by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/natasha-singer">Natasha Singer</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/natashanyt">@NatashaNYT</a>) and Aaron Krolik. (This&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AaronKrolik">@AaronKrolik</a>? If so, hi. If not, sorry. This is a blog. I can edit it.) The second link goes to a Public Citizen post titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/popular-dating-health-apps-violate-privacy/">Popular Dating, Health Apps Violate Privacy</a>.</p>
<p>In the emailed press release, the text is the same, but the links are not. The first is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>https://default.salsalabs.org/T72ca980d-0c9b-45da-88fb-d8c1cf8716ac/25218e76-a235-4500-bc2b-d0f337c722d4</p></blockquote>
<p>The second is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>https://default.salsalabs.org/Tc66c3800-58c1-4083-bdd1-8e730c1c4221/25218e76-a235-4500-bc2b-d0f337c722d4</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are they not simple and direct URLs? And who is&nbsp;<a href="http://salsalabs.org" title="http://salsalabs. ">salsalabs.org</a>?</p>
<p>You won’t find anything at that link, or by running a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">whois</a> on it. But I do see there is a <a href="https://www.salsalabs.com/">salsalabs.com</a>, which has&nbsp; “SmartEngagement Technology” that “combines CRM and nonprofit engagement software with embedded best practices, machine learning, and world-class education and support.” since Public Citizen is a nonprofit, I suppose it’s getting some “smart engagement” of some kind with these links. PrivacyBadger tells me&nbsp;<a href="http://Salsalabs.com" title="http://Salsalabs. ">Salsalabs.com</a> has 14 potential trackers, including&nbsp;<a href="http://static.ads.twitter.com" title="http://static.ads.twitter. ">static.ads.twitter.com</a>.</p>
<p>My point here is that we, as clickers on those links, have at best a suspicion about what’s going on: perhaps that the link is being used to tell Public Citizen that we’ve clicked on the link… and likely also to help target us with messages of some sort. But we really don’t know.</p>
<p>And, speaking of not knowing, Natasha and Aaron’s New York Times story begins with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority said on Monday that it would fine Grindr, the world’s most popular gay dating app, 100 million Norwegian kroner, or about $11.7 million, for illegally disclosing private details about its users to advertising companies.</p>
<p>The agency said the app had transmitted users’ precise locations, user-tracking codes and the app’s name to at least five advertising companies, essentially tagging individuals as L.G.B.T.Q. without obtaining their explicit consent, in violation of European data protection law. Grindr shared users’ private details with, among other companies, MoPub, Twitter’s mobile advertising platform, which may in turn share data with <a href="https://www.mopub.com/en/legal/partners-v0">more than 100 partners,</a> according to the agency’s ruling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before this, I had never heard of <a href="https://www.mopub.com/">MoPub</a>. In fact, I had always assumed that Twitter’s privacy policy either limited or forbid the company from leaking out personal information to advertisers or other entities. Here’s how its <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information">Private Information Policy Overview</a> begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may not publish or post other people’s private information without their express authorization and permission. We also prohibit threatening to expose private information or incentivizing others to do so.</p>
<p>Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called doxxing, is a breach of their privacy and of the&nbsp;<a href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules">Twitter Rules</a>. Sharing private information can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected and can lead to physical, emotional, and financial hardship.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the MoPub site, however, it says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>MoPub, a Twitter company, provides monetization solutions for mobile app publishers and developers around the globe.</p>
<p>Our flexible network mediation solution, leading mobile programmatic exchange, and years of expertise in mobile app advertising mean publishers trust us to help them maximize their ad revenue and control their user experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Norwegian DPA apparently finds a conflict between the former and the latter—or at least in the way the latter was used by Grinder (since they didn’t fine Twitter).</p>
<p>To be fair, Grindr and Twitter may not agree with the Norwegian DPA. Regardless of their opinion, however, by this point in history we should have no faith that any company will protect our privacy online. Violating personal privacy is just too easy to do, to rationalize, and to make money at.</p>
<p>To start truly facing this problem, we need start with a simple fact: <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/if-your-privacy-hands-others-alone-you-dont-have-any">If your privacy is in the hands of others alone, you don’t have any</a>. Getting promises from others not to stare at your naked self isn’t the same as clothing. Getting promises not to walk into your house or look in your windows is not the same as having locks and curtains.</p>
<p>In the absence of personal clothing and shelter online, or working ways to signal intentions about one’s privacy, the hands of others alone is all we’ve got. And it doesn’t work. Nor do privacy laws, especially when enforcement is still so rare and scattered.</p>
<p>Really, to&nbsp;potential violators like Grindr and Twitter/MoPub, enforcement actions like this one by the Norwegian DPA are at most a little discouraging. The effect on our experience of exposure is still nil. We are exposed everywhere, all the time, and we know it. At best we just hope nothing bad happens.</p>
<p>The only way to fix this problem is with the digital equivalent of clothing, locks, curtains, ways to signal what’s okay and what’s not—and to get firm agreements from others about how our privacy will be respected.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://customercommons.org">Customer Commons</a>, we’re starting with signaling, specifically with <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/time-for-them-to-agree-to-our-terms-263ee87e9f41#.xz1fwq56k">first party</a> <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/tools/terms/">terms</a> that you and I can proffer and sites and services can accept.</p>
<p>The first is called <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">P2B1, aka #NoStalking</a>. It says “Just give me ads not based on tracking me.” It’s a term any browser (or other tool) can proffer and any site or service can accept—and any privacy-respecting website or service should welcome.</p>
<p>Making this kind of agreement work is also being addressed by<a href="https://sagroups.ieee.org/7012/"> IEEE7012, a working group on machine-readable personal privacy terms</a>.</p>
<p>Now we’re looking for sites and services willing to accept those terms. How about it, Twitter, New York Times, Grindr and Public Citizen? Or anybody.</p>
<p>DM us at <a href="https://twitter.com/customercommons">@CustomerCommons</a> and we’ll get going on it.</p>

<p>At the 2015 Postgres conference, the great IT philosopher Robert <a>r0ml</a> Lefkowitz delivered a talk entitled The Image of Postgres. Here’s the blurb.</p>
<blockquote><p>How do you think about what a database is? If you think of a database as only a place to store your data, then perhaps it does not really matter what the internals of that database are; all you really need is a home for your data to be managed, nothing more.</p>
<p>If you think of a database as a place where you develop applications, then your expectations of your database software change. No longer do you only need data management capabilities, but you require processing functions, the ability to load in additional libraries, interface with other databases, and perhaps even additional language support.</p>
<p>If your database is just for storage, there are plenty of options. If your database is your development framework, you need Postgres.</p>
<p>Why? Well, let’s get philosophical.</p></blockquote>
<p>For over a year, I’ve been using Postgres as a development framework. In addition to the core Postgres server that stores all the Hypothesis user, group, and annotation data, there’s now also a separate Postgres server that provides an interpretive layer on top of the raw data. It synthesizes and caches product- and business-relevant views, using a combination of PL/pgSQL and PL/Python. Data and business logic share a common environment. Although I didn’t make the connection until I watched r0ml’s talk, this setup harkens back to the 1980s when Smalltalk (and Lisp, and APL) were programming environments with built-in persistence. The “image” in r0ml’s title refers to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561145/what-is-a-smalltalk-image">Smalltalk image</a>, i.e. the contents of the Smalltalk virtual machine. It may also connote reputation, in the sense that our image of Postgres isn’t that of a Smalltalk-like environment, though r0ml thinks it should be, and my experience so far leads me to agree.</p>
<p>I started writing a book to document what I’ve learned and done with this idea. It’s been a struggle to find motivation because, well, being the patron saint of trailing-edge technologies is often lonely and unrewarding. A book on this particular topic is likely to appeal to very few people. Stored procedures? So last century! Yes, Python provides a modern hook, but I can almost guarantee that one of the comments on my first book — “has a vision, but too weird” — would come back around.</p>
<p>I’m tempted not to bother. Maybe I should just focus on completing and polishing the things the book would describe. </p>
<p>And yet, it’s hard to let go. This isn’t just a compelling idea, it’s delivering excellent results. I rewatched r0ml’s talk today and got fired up again. Does it resonate for you? Would you like to see the ideas developed? If you watch the talk, please let me know. </p>
<p>Here are some excerpts to pique your interest.</p>
<p>On databases vs file systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I submit that the difference between the database and a file system is that database is a platform for enforcing your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On ontology:</p>
<blockquote><p>
client: The business guys are always upset because they want to know how many customers we have and we can’t tell them.</p>
<p>r0ml: That doesn’t sound like a very hard problem. SELECT * from the customer table, right?</p>
<p>client: No you don’t understand the problem.</p>
<p>r0ml: OK, what’s the problem?</p>
<p>client: It depends what you mean by customer because if you’re selling cell phone insurance, is the customer the person who has the cell phone account? What if they have two handsets and they’re both insured? What if it’s a family account and there are kids on the plan, do they count as customers? What if it’s a business account and you have 1000 people covered but only 700 using?</p>
<p>r0ml: How my customers you have, that’s a business rule.</p>
<p>So figuring out what your schema is, and figuring out how you organize the stuff and what do you do in the database, that’s all part of enforcing your business rules.</p>
<p>You have to decide what these things mean.</p>
<p>It’s an ontological problem.</p>
<p>You have to classify your knowledge and then enforce your business rules.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On n-tier architecture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Let us think about the typical web application architecture. This architecture is called the three-tier architecture because it has four tiers. You have your browser, your web server, the thing that runs Python or PHP or JavaScript or Ruby or Java code, and then the database. And that’s always how you do it. And why do you do it that way? Well because that’s how everybody does it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On Smalltalk and friends:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the BYTE magazine cover from August of 1981. In the 70s and the 80s, programming languages had this sort of unique perspective that’s completely lost to history. The way it worked: a programming environment was a virtual machine image, it was a complete copy of your entire virtual machine memory and that was called the image. And then you loaded that up and it had all your functions and your data in it, and then you ran that for a while until you were sort of done and then you saved it out. And this wasn’t just Smalltalk, Lisp worked that way, APL worked that way, it was kind of like Docker only it wasn’t a separate thing because everything worked that way and so you didn’t worry very much about persistence because it was implied. If you had a programming environment it saved everything that you were doing in the programming environment, you didn’t have to separate that part out. A programming environment was a place where you kept all your data and business logic forever.</p>
<p>So then Postgres is kind of like Smalltalk only different.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well we took the UI out of Smalltalk and put it in the browser. The rest of it is the same, so really Postgres is an application delivery platform, just like we had back in the 80s.
</p></blockquote>

   Shortly after the 2016 election, I pulled out a book written by my grandfather,
chronicling the history of Bachhagel,
the village in southern Germany where he grew up.

  <p>Shortly after the 2016 election, I pulled out a book written by my grandfather,
chronicling the history of <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachhagel">Bachhagel</a>,
the village in southern Germany where he grew up.</p>
<p>I re-read the chapters describing how the Nazis, in short order, took over
life there in 1933. His eye-witness account describes in fascinating,
and horrifying detail, how quickly the established order and century-old
traditions were hollowed out and then overrun.</p>
<p>Bachhagel at the time was a tiny place, probably less than 1000 people, out in the
countryside, of no political or economic importance. I could have understood how
the Nazis would concentrate on the major population and economic centers to
crush the opposition, but Bachhagel certainly was as far away from that as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it just took a few months, after which the established order had
been swept out and the thugs were fully in charge, day to day, from school to church
to public events, and their entire worldview was the only thing that mattered.</p>
<p>With Joe Biden in the office this week, it seems we have turned a chapter.
And looking back to the 2016 election day, I realize that although the past four years were
bad, people died, children got separated, and many other outrages, we
have been lucky. In 2016, I had been expecting worse, and possibly much worse.</p>
<p>Why didn’t it turn out as bad as I had feared? It’s not that the defenders of the
republic did a particularly good job.  Instead, the would-be usurpers just
sucked at getting anything done, including just actually using the power in their.
hands. If it had been the original Nazis, the consequences would
have been so much worse.</p>
<p>I vastly prefer better defenses, however, than being lucky with having an
incompetent opponent.  In computer security terms, Trump was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)">Zero Day Vulnerability</a> of
the constitutional system of the US – a successful attack vector that previously had
not been known.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people still aren’t taking this attack vector as a seriously as they should,
otherwise we’d have specific legal and practical fix proposals all over the news,
which we don’t. Which means the vulnerability remains, and our primary defense
will remain the same: hoping that the attacker is incompetent. As long as we don’t
fix the system, the next attacker is going to try a similar route and they may very
well be more capable. In which case we’d really be in trouble.</p>
<p>So: I raise my glass to imcompetence. Next time, may we get a similar bunch of
incompetents. Or actually get our act together and make sure there won’t be a
next time.</p>

 Sufficiency Currency: What Communities Want <p>Starting out with some assumptions, I returned from 11 weeks of travel including visits to 7 intentional communities (ecovillages) with a more solidified idea of what the “sufficiency currency” might look like. Before I go into that, it’s useful for me to distinguish the major differences between the Sufficiency Currency project and other projects.</p><p>By the way, we aren’t even sure that “Currency” is the right name for the project, and you can <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/naming-sufficiency-currency/">check out this blog </a>for a discussion of different names for the&nbsp;project.</p> Sufficiency Currency&nbsp;Inquiry <p>The Sufficiency Currency project is looking at non-monetary currency solutions and the two major inquiries are:</p>  How can we create “group” measures and currencies. Production is a group activity, but money is an individual measure. What if we could only transact as a group or community? What would that type of communications would represent the complexity of interactions among communities?  If the purpose of an economy is to provide people’s basic survival needs (food, shelter, energy, health), what would we measure such that we can support everyone and increase the capacity of a society to grow to support more&nbsp;people?  <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p> Goals and Hypothesis <p>We assert that market economies are not appropriate for support systems, and that we should use a system of pooling for essential services. The idea of pooling asserts that when there is a visible shared pool, people don’t let other people starve, and that if there isn’t enough to go around, the group will be inclined towards group problem-solving.</p><p>The fundamental goals of the project&nbsp;are:</p>  Create a form of economy that looks directly at the sustainability of life in the economy, rather than a proxy measure&nbsp;(money).  Create local self-sufficiency for communities, and in particular, encourage local regenerative and healthy forms of food and energy production.  Specifically for the regenerative/intentional/ecovillage/permaculture movements, support three outcomes:  Make it easy to transact within the network as well as with bodies outside of the&nbsp;network.  Make it easy to expand the movement and better share the resources coming into the&nbsp;network.  For people who want to join or create regenerative communities, make it easier to do so through this unified economic structure.  <p>The initial hypothesis for the Sufficiency Currency is that there are three important measures that a group of communities would want to look at in order to meet&nbsp;the</p> Market Research: How Does It Really&nbsp;Look? <p>In September-November of 2020, I traveled to a number of Ecovillages in Italy, Slovenia and Spain, to discuss my vision and understand what they really need in terms of their interactions among themselves and with their neighboring communities who may or may not be ecovillages.</p><p>The first thing I realized was that there are quite a few community currency and cryptocurrency projects trying to push their ideas into ecovillages. There are some isolated examples of successful community currency attempts within the intentional community movement, and dozens, if not hundreds of failure stories. The communities themselves are quite aware that they don’t need an alternative monetary currency to function. They are also aware that using monetary and trade based currency doesn’t reflect their values. Finally, these people are busy and they don’t have a lot of spare time for currency experiments. Usually there are one or two people who are responsible for anything that would require a computer. Others have computers and phones, but they are highly disinterested in activities that would require any serious amount of time in front of a&nbsp;screen.</p><p>The most gratifying find was that the kind of pooling proposed in the Sufficiency Currency project does appeal to the ecovillages. It would have to be very easy to manage, but they are already managing multiple interactions in their vicinity, and systematizing that is of interest. In fact, the same kind of thinking process has come from some of the national ecovillage support networks, but it hasn’t been a priority, nor is it really within the core competencies of the coordination networks for intentional communities.</p><p>All of the communities have some form of trade with the other communities in the area. Depending on the location, they might be interacting with local farms and businesses, cooperatives, or other ecovillages. The agreements look different among different entities, but in general there is a looser type of trade than you would see between businesses. For example, at one ecovillage the nearby town flooded and they went down to help out, taking the volunteers with them and neglecting their harvesting work for a couple of days. There was no formal trade — it was just helping people out — and at the same time, they know that this will be helpful for them when it comes to their needs vis-à-vis the municipal government. Similarly, they had an informal agreement with a local agricultural cooperative, where they were helping with the farm work in return for some produce, but they were giving it a try for a year before they came to any formal agreement. The assumption of cooperation and reciprocation was more important than the specifics of the&nbsp;deal.</p> Designing the&nbsp;Currency <p>Designing the “representables”, or currency, for the communities is like designing any product. The first step is to get clear on the problems the community wants to solve. The way they described their problems were mostly in terms of overwhelm:</p>  Every contract needs to be negotiated separately and the documentation is scattered.  The negotiation takes a lot of&nbsp;time.  Different parties have different ideas of fairness, and fairness isn’t necessarily expressed in monetary&nbsp;value.  Some items are truly scarce, while some are abundant, and monetary exchange doesn’t help them identify that type of value or seek solutions.  Depending on the type of organization, the terms of business are different. If it’s another ecovillage, it’s a very different type of relationship than if it’s just a nearby village that doesn’t belong to the regenerative agriculture movement.  <p>When translated into measurable currencies that can be represented in software, the Sufficiency Currency would aim, firstly, to create an easy-to-use interface for putting together contacts between two entities. Secondly, the dashboard would include the following measures:</p>  Fairness. Although fairness is subjective, it’s probably the most important measure to maintain for long-term relationships. For a sustainable network of ecovillages, it’s important for the members to feel the other group is dealing fairly with&nbsp;them.  Scarcity and abundance. Some items are scarce, for example, the number of trucks that are available. A good representation might be dark or light colors, or thickness of a line. Others are abundance, for example, squash in the summer. Even if the trade is fair, some things might wear out over time while others are easily replenished. Representing the scarcity or abundance of something in the communities allows people to identify joint problems to solve. For example, if there aren’t enough trucks, perhaps they would train some community members to repair and assemble trucks from spare parts. One of the main functions of the currency is to help the communities take joint&nbsp;action.  Reputation. Reputation would be a multi-dimensional measure that allows communities to get information about one another, such as how ecologically conscious one community is, whether they have traded fairly in the past, etc. The reputation measures need to be developed over&nbsp;time.  <p>The three measures above are a start for creating an alternative to monetary trading. The goal over time will be to have the communities simply share both their resources and their challenges to grow over time as a movement.</p>

   <p>Unpacking and explaining the Peak Paradox model is <a href="https://www.peakparadox.com/post/peak-paradox">here</a>, you will need this backgrounder to understand the model so that this article will make sense; it is a 5-minute read. A new way of seeing the same thing will mean we can act differently; this is the peak paradox model’s core tenet.&nbsp;</p><p>----</p><p>A recurring question on an executives mind in the finance industry is; “Why does up or cross-selling not deliver in the way we forecast or predict?”&nbsp; Cross-selling is foundational hypnosis for growth.&nbsp; H0; this customer has one product, and therefore they should want my other products; all customers need all my core finance products.&nbsp; With years of data, it is evident that a customer who uses my payment system does not want my other products, and after years of cross-selling we still only have 30% of customers with all products. Whilst we can conclude there is a problem with the hypothesis, we choose to ignore this fact and continue to try to upsell as we don’t have a framework to explore why! If we try a different marketing message, this one will work (what was it about repeating the same thing and expecting a different outcome?)&nbsp;</p><p>This article maps core consumer financial services offerings of Payment (spending), Saving (available, current, on-demand and surplus), Borrowings (mortgage, credit, debt, overdraft, loans) and Investment (long-term growth and or income) onto the Peak Paradox model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>I will unpack a delta between what a bank or financial service providers products say about their products’ purpose in marketing and terms; and the consumers’ purpose for the same products.&nbsp; When mapped, it is evident that cross-selling will only work in a limited capacity, and in the majority of cases, there is a misalignment.&nbsp;</p><p>On paper, and with years of data, our upselling hypothesis appears to be misguided as the utopia for growth.&nbsp; The market has introduced a plethora of new banks,&nbsp; neo-banks, open banking platforms, banking 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and more; promising digital products for a new next generation. Each new company has a model that attracts customers from accepting the tempting offers from existing providers and then upselling. &nbsp; We will apply the Peak Paradox model on this perplexing and thorny topic because when we can see something through a different lens, we may decide to act differently, as we have new insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without a doubt, we all have a reason why upselling and cross-selling does not materialise to the level we predict/ want/ desire; but why does a customer then buy a very similar product from a different financial provider, even though we offer it?&nbsp; Finding the data to confirm that we have a specific, sound and justifiable explainable reason, which is different to others interruptions, leads to much tension, anxiety, stress, argument and disagreements in our teams and enterprises; both on why we miss the targets and what to do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We are taking the core banking products in turn.&nbsp; Remember the purpose here is to provide a non-conformational way for your team to look at the same problem with a new perspective.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Payment (spending available, accessible and current cash resource).&nbsp; Spending maps across the entire Peak Paradox map.&nbsp; We need to spend to survive and therefore is essential at Peak Human Purpose as without food and water we don’t tend to last very long. &nbsp; Spending on luxury goods meets a requirement for being at Peak Individual Purpose where you look after yourself.&nbsp; Giving gifts to friends, philanthropy and donations to charity moves the coverage to Peak Society Purpose. Finally, we cannot work without payments,&nbsp; payments get us towards Peak Work Purpose and covering the entire map.</p><p>The observation is that, only at this moment-in-time, when you are using your payment service, can you highlight if the payment provider’s values reflect your purpose or if you feel there is a conflict.&nbsp; Users have started to use different payment mechanisms to reflect an alignment between their use and how they perceive the payment providers own marketing.&nbsp; But does that allow them to use this payment provider for everything, or do they have two or more to cope with conflicts?&nbsp; Can the customer hold the conflict of using the same ethical payment platform to gamble and buy adult services as they give to charity?&nbsp; How does the market, market payment services?</p><p>Saving (surplus).&nbsp; Saving tend not used for day to day survival (yes individuals often find they have to as a reality of our economic mess), therefore saving does not tend to feature towards Peak Human Purposes for most consumers.&nbsp; However, if savings are for a house and the house is attractive to a mate for reproduction it can be argued that there is a connection to Peak Human Purpose, but is this saving or borrowings (loans). &nbsp; However, savings are used to further your own individual purpose or help those closest to you, which means there is at least some societal benefit.&nbsp; (A gift to charity will be in payments, payments on death to a charity by a Will is a different dimension to be explored,&nbsp; more case-studies will help your team explore this in more detail.]&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst not explicit, some savers understand the economics of savings by themselves leads to borrowings (lending) for others, me saving has an indirect benefit for society. Fewer savers may realise that spending savings are a better way of benefiting a societal purpose as it encourages economic activity and growth. &nbsp; The point is that “saving” is positioned differently on the Peak Paradox model to that of your payment service.&nbsp; How your company positions these products will have a direct impact on how users perceive them.&nbsp; Indeed how your competitor and the media report on these products directly affects user positioning.&nbsp; We seek the delta between your marketing, the markets positions, the media view, and the users’ own opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Borrowings (mortgage, credit, debt, overdraft, loans) Brownings at a consumer retail banking level, because the terms and conditions are for an individual or a couple who equally take on the responsibility, meaning that Borrowings are for Individual needs more than society.&nbsp; Since the use of borrowings that a requester has is vetted by the provider, a company’s processes and regulation (compliance) mean that borrowings focus on Peak Individual Purpose.&nbsp; Borrowings give the person(s) more agency, and one can argue more freedom, but that depends on responsible lending to ensure that levels of debt are not a burden, which sadly is not always the case.&nbsp; Borrowings to give to someone else still has to be repaid and when you look at the terms and the processes; borrowing to give away is not an acceptable practice - whereas guarantees are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, borrowings have a different position on the Peak Paradox model. &nbsp; There is a position where lending does support more basic human survival (payday loans), but this creates tension and conflicts in the users of borrowing products between two Peak Purposes.&nbsp; Debt can also be used as part of a personal guarantee to provide working capital for a business or enterprise.&nbsp; This means that borrowings are dragged towards Peak Work Purpose, and depending on if the Borrowings are for growth (thriving) or survival creates different tensions again. &nbsp; Consider, customers are not buying a specific product; they are buying a generic idea.&nbsp; When these ideas become confused, it creates tensions.&nbsp; We might like to give them cool marketing names to deceive ourselves to what is being offered, but it is quite evident in the terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Investment (long-term growth and or income from the investment - capital at risk).&nbsp; The final bucket considered here. Pre-crypto, climate and ethical investing; investment occupied an area between Peak Individual Purpose and Peak Work Purpose, with variance in risk and return creating an area.&nbsp; As real-time trading led to no responsibility for the shareholder, the area has shifted towards Peak Individual Purpose.&nbsp; Crypto, angel, seed and start-up investing has pushed the upper boundary even further to Peak Individual.&nbsp; However, social and impact investing (labelled here as ESG for convenience) has created a broader and wider market. Those who seek more ethical ideals that align with their own position of the map means the investment is also firmly heading into Peak Society Purpose.&nbsp; Such diversity. &nbsp; The same questions need to be reflected on: how is the positioning of investment products aligned to the individual’s need and purpose? Is there a gap between brand, marketing and overall positioning?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> What do we learn?&nbsp; <p>Financial services are a very cluttered landscape. Just offering slicker, quicker, faster, less paperwork, and sexy digital services are avoiding the very core of the problem that the Peak Paradox model exposes. &nbsp;Yes, we can play with terms and marketing. We can create great names, become ever more personalised and seemingly more differentiated in niche services, but fundamentally avoid the conflicts and tensions this creates.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovation.&nbsp; A term on the lips of every board, executive and management personnel in the finance industry.&nbsp; We have to be more innovative.&nbsp; We have clearly been more “clever” in how we bundle, describe, consider risk and differentiate our core products. Still, we appear not to have aligned our corporate purpose, with our products’ purpose with the customers’ purpose for financial services. &nbsp; Perhaps we should look at innovation in this area.&nbsp;</p><p>Positioning. Suppose we attracted a customer with a faster payment method for essential services, positioned towards Peak Human Purpose and Peak Social Purpose. Why would that customer naturally consider other series until you have either developed trust or re-educated them on your brand position?&nbsp; Fabulous branding for new customers’ attraction may generate the numbers and look good in the business plan until you need that same “easy to attract customer” to buy something else.&nbsp;</p><p>This is tricky as it might mean rewriting marketing and positioning, and will the marketing/branding team understand this, given that it could affect their KPI’s and bonus?&nbsp; &nbsp; Such actions also require time and reflection, always the most precious things in an early-stage growth company, as far too many jobs to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There a delta between an individual consumers perspective of the financial products they are using, the marketing position/ branding you offer and different core products align to other areas meaning that there is unlikely to be a natural cross-selling opportunity, with one exception. There is an alignment of all the products focussed at Peak Individual Purpose. Maybe that is why High Net Wealth (HNW) teams, wealth management and those looking after the ultra-wealthy in banks appear to have a very successful, and aligned business.&nbsp;</p><p>Trust. This asks how to explore the alignment between your product's purpose and the consumer purpose and how this correlates to the “trust” in your brand. If there is a high R2 does it lead to a propensity to utilise more than one product from a financial institute?&nbsp;</p><br><p>We need to add pensions, tax, gifts, inheritance, B2B, business, corporate and many other financial services to complete the picture, and then the role of the regulator and whose purpose they are working to protect! Anyone up for mapping one company's financial products? </p> <br>

<p></p>
<p>“Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/207927-give-me-a-lever-long-enough-and-a-fulcrum-on">said to have said</a>.</p>
<p>For almost all of the last four years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a> was one hell of an Archimedes. With the U.S. presidency as his lever and Twitter as his fulcrum, the 45th President leveraged an endless stream of news-making utterances into a massive following and near-absolute domination of news coverage, worldwide. It was an amazing show, the like of which we may never see again.</p>
<p>Big as it was, that show ended on January 8, when Twitter terminated the&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump">@RealDonaldTrump</a>&nbsp;account. Almost immediately after that, Trump was&nbsp;<a href="https://bgr.com/2021/01/11/president-trump-today-deplatformed-banned-from-major-internet-services-facebook-twitter/">“de-platformed” from all these other services as well</a>:&nbsp;PayPal, Reddit, Shopify, Snapchat, Discord, Amazon,&nbsp;Twitch, Facebook, TikTok, Google, Apple, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. That’s a lot of fulcrums to lose.</p>
<p>What makes them fulcrums is their size. All are big, and all are centralized: run by one company. As members, users and customers of these centralized services, we are also at their mercy: no less vulnerable to termination than Trump.</p>
<p>So here is an interesting question:&nbsp;What if Trump had his own fulcrum from the start?&nbsp;For example, say he took one of the many Trump domains he probably owns (or should have bothered to own, long ago), and made it a&nbsp;blog where he said all the same things he tweeted, and that site had the same many dozens of millions of followers today? Would it still be alive?</p>
<p>I’m not sure it would. Because, even though the base protocols of the Internet and the Web are <a href="https://worldofends.com/#BM2">peer-to-peer and end-to-end</a>, all of us are dependent on services above those protocols, and at the mercy of those services’ owners.</p>
<p>That to me is the biggest lesson the de-platforming of Donald Trump has for the rest of us. We can talk “de-centralization” and “distribution” and “democratization” along with peer-to-peer and end-to-end, but we are still at the mercy of giants.</p>
<p>Yes, there are work-arounds. The <a href="https://parler.com/">parler.com website</a>, de-platformed along with Trump, is back up and, <a href="https://twitter.com/VickerySec/status/1351227537985318929">according to</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/VickerySec">@VickerySec</a> (Chris Vickery), “routing 100% of its user traffic through servers located within the Russian Federation.” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSculthorpe/status/1350872780355596289">Adds</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSculthorpe/">@AdamSculthorpe</a>, “With a DDos-Guard IP, exactly as I predicted the day it went offline. DDoS Guard is the Russian equivalent of CloudFlare, and runs many shady sites. RiTM (Russia in the middle) is one way to think about it.” Encrypted services such as <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a> and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> also provide ways for people to talk and be social. But those are also platforms, and we are at their mercy too.</p>
<p>I bring all this up as a way of thinking out loud toward <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6756908441723277312/">the talk I’ll be giving</a>&nbsp;in a few hours (also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6756908441723277312/">see here</a>), on the topic “Centralized vs. Decentralized.” Here’s the intro:</p>
<blockquote><p>Centralised thinking is easy. Control sits on one place, everything comes home, there is a hub, the corporate office is where all the decisions are made and it is a power game.</p>
<p>Decentralised thinking is complex. TCP/IP and HTTP created a fully decentralised fabric for packet communication. No-one is in control. It is beautiful. Web3 decentralised ideology goes much further but we continually run into conflicts. We need to measure, we need to report, we need to justify, we need to find a model and due to regulation and law, there are liabilities.</p>
<p>However, we have to be doing both. We have to centralise some aspects and at the same time decentralise others. Whilst we hang onto an advertising model that provides services for free we have to have a centralised business model. Apple with its new OS is trying to break the tracking model and in doing so could free us from the barter of free, is that the plan which has nothing to do with privacy or are the ultimate control freaks. But the new distributed model means more risks fall on the creators as the aggregators control the channels and access to a model. Is our love for free preventing us from seeing the value in truly distributed or are those who need control creating artefacts that keep us from achieving our dreams? Is distributed even possible with liability laws and a need to justify what we did to add value today?</p></blockquote>
<p>So here is what I think I’ll say.</p>
<p>First, we need to respect the decentralized nature of humanity. All of us are different, by design. We look, sound, think and feel different, as separate human beings. As I say in <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2021/01/11/save/">How we save the world</a>, “no being is more smart, resourceful or original than a human one. Again, by design. Even identical twins, with identical DNA from a single sperm+egg, can be as different as two primary colors. (Examples:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverne_Cox">Laverne Cox</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_Lamar">M.Lamar</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Maines">Nicole</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/truejonasmaines">Jonas</a>&nbsp;Maines.)”</p>
<p>This simple fact of our distributed souls and talents has had scant respect from the centralized systems of the digital world, which would rather lead than follow us, and rather guess about us than understand us. That’s partly because too many of them have become dependent on surveillance-based personalized advertising (which is awful in ways I’ve detailed in 136 posts, essays and articles compiled <a href="http://j.mp/adbwars">here</a>). But it’s mostly because they’re centralized and can’t think or work outside their very old and square boxes.</p>
<p>Second, advertising, subscriptions and donations through the likes of (again, centralized) Patreon aren’t the only possible ways to support a site or a service. Those are industrial age conventions leveraged in the early decades of the digital age. There are other approaches we can implement as well, now that the pendulum is started to swing back from the centralized extreme. For example, the fully decentralized <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">EmanciPay</a>. A bunch of us came up with that one at <a href="http://projectvrm.org">ProjectVRM</a> way back in 2009. What makes it decentralized is that the choice of what to pay, and how, is up to the customer. (No, it doesn’t have to be scary.) Which brings me to—</p>
<p>Third, we need to start thinking about solving business problems, market problems, technical problems, from our side. <a href="http://customercommons.org/home/solutions/">Here is how Customer Commons puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is … no shortage of of business problems that can <a href="http://customercommons.org/2020/06/14/only/">only be solved from the customer’s side.</a> Here are a few examples :</p>
 
 Identity. Logins and passwords are burdensome leftovers from the last millennium. There should be (and already are) better ways to identify ourselves, and to reveal to others only what we need them to know. Working on this challenge is the SSI—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>—movement. The solution here for individuals is <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">tools of their own that scale</a>. 
 Subscriptions. Nearly all subscriptions are pains in the butt. “Deals” can be deceiving, full of conditions and changes that come without warning. New customers often get better deals than loyal customers. And there are no standard ways for customers to keep track of when subscriptions run out, need renewal, or change. The only way this can be normalized is from the customers’ side. 
 Terms and conditions. In the world today, nearly all of these are ones companies proffer; and we have little or no choice about agreeing to them. Worse, in nearly all cases, the record of agreement is on the company’s side. Oh, and since the GDPR came along in Europe and the CCPA in California, entering a website has turned into an ordeal typically requiring “consent” to privacy violations the laws were meant to stop. Or worse, agreeing that a site or a service provider spying on us is a “legitimate interest.” 
 Payments. For demand and supply to be truly balanced, and for customers to operate at full agency in an open marketplace (which the Internet was designed to be), customers should have their own pricing gun: a way to signal—and actually pay willing sellers—as much as they like, however they like, for whatever they like, on their own terms. There is already a design for that, called <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">Emancipay</a>. 
 Internet of Things. What we have so far are the Apple of things, the Amazon of things, the Google of things, the Samsung of things, the Sonos of things, and so on—all silo’d in separate systems we don’t control. Things we own on the Internet should be our things. We should be able to control them, as independent customers, as we do with our computers and mobile devices. (Also, by the way, things don’t need to be intelligent or connected to belong to the Internet of Things. They can be, or have, <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">picos</a>.) 
 Loyalty. All loyalty programs are gimmicks, and coercive. True loyalty is worth far more to companies than the coerced kind, and only customers are in position to truly and fully express it. We should have our own loyalty programs, to which companies are members, rather than the reverse. 
 Privacy. We’ve had privacy tech in the physical world since the inventions of clothing, shelter, locks, doors, shades, shutters, and other ways to limit what others can see or hear—and to signal to others what’s okay and what’s not. Instead, all we have are unenforced promises by others not to watching our naked selves, or to report what they see to others. Or worse, coerced urgings to “accept” spying on us and distributing harvested information about us to parties unknown, with no record of what we’ve agreed to. 
 Customer service. There are no standard ways to call for service yet, or to get it. And there should be. 
 Advertising. Our main problem with advertising today is tracking, which is failing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ad-tech-could-be-the-next-internet-bubble/">because it doesn’t work</a>. (Some history: ad blocking has been around since 2004, it took off in 2013, when the advertising and publishing industries gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was never more than a polite request in one’s browser not to be tracked off a site. By 2015, ad blocking alone was <a href="http://j.mp/bcott">the biggest boycott i world history</a>. And in 2018 and 2019 we got the GDPR and the CCPA, two laws meant to thwart tracking and unwanted data collection, and which likely wouldn’t have happened if we hadn’t been given that finger.) We can solve that problem from the customer side with <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a>,. This is where&nbsp;we&nbsp;advertise to the marketplace what we want, without risk that our personal data won’t me misused. (<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Intentcasting">Here is a list of intentcasting providers</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work">the ProjectVRM Development Work list</a>.) 
 
<p>We already have examples of personal solutions working at scale: the Internet, the Web, email and telephony. Each provides single, simple and standards-based ways any of us can scale how we deal with others—across countless companies, organizations and services. And they work for those companies as well.</p>
<p>Other solutions, however, are missing—such as ones that solve the eight problems listed above.</p>
<p>They’re missing for the best of all possible reasons: it’s still early. Digital living is still new—decades old at most. And it’s <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/09/26/how-early-is-digital-life/">sure to persist</a> for many decades, centuries or millennia to come.</p>
<p>They’re also missing because businesses typically think all solutions to business problems are ones for them. Thinking about customers solving business problems is outside that box.</p>
<p>But much work is already happening outside that box. And there already exist standards and code for building many customer-side solutions to problems shared with businesses. Yes, there are not yet as many or as good as we need; but there are enough to get started.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of levers there.</p>
<p>For those of you attending this event, I’ll talk with you shortly. For the rest of you, I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>This tutorial will walk you through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro kit you can ship to a remote location and then control from your studio. You can use this to ship a remote interview kit to someone where all they have to do is plug in a few connections and you'll be able to control everything remotely!</p>

<p></p>

<p>The overall idea is you'll ship out an ATEM Mini Pro (or ISO), a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K (or any other camera, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled by the ATEM!), and a Raspberry Pi. The guest will connect the Raspberry Pi to their home network, connect the camera's HDMI to the ATEM, turn everything on, and you'll immediately be able to control the remote end yourself!</p>

<p>The remote ATEM can then stream to any streaming service directly, or if you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu9OTROesp0">Streaming Bridge</a>, you can get a high quality video feed of the remote guest brought directly into your studio!</p>

 Devices Used in this Tutorial 

 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2LUZntd">ATEM Mini Pro</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3nURgKu">ATEM Mini Pro ISO</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lwar0g">GL.iNet AR750S Travel Router</a> 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38RrySV">Raspberry Pi 4</a> (a <a href="https://amzn.to/39ELjMD">Pi 3</a> will also work, but they aren't that much cheaper anyway) 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/2N8c1FP">MicroSD Card</a> for the Raspberry Pi, I like the 32gb A2 cards 
 a <a href="https://amzn.to/3swb22v">USB Ethernet adapter</a> to get an additional ethernet port on the Raspberry Pi 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/3bLCR0X">Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K</a> (any camera will do, but the Pocket 4K can be controlled remotely too!) 
 <a href="https://amzn.to/38PXY04">Blackmagic Streaming Bridge</a> to receive the remote ATEM video feed in your studio 
 

 Set up the Studio Side 

<p>We'll start with setting up the studio side of the system. This is where your computer to control the remote ATEM will be, and this end will have the VPN server. If you have a Streaming Bridge, it would be on this end as well in order to receive the streaming video feed from the remote ATEM.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First we're going to set up the GL.iNet router as a Wireguard server.</p>

<p>Plug your computer in to one of the two ethernet ports on the right, or connect to its WiFi hotspot. There's a sticker on the bottom showing the default wifi name and password as well as the IP address of the router. (It's probably <code>192.168.8.1</code>).</p>

<p>Open that address in your browser and it will prompt you to set up an admin password. Make sure you keep that somewhere safe like a password manager.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up Internet Access for the Travel Router 

<p>The first thing we need to do is get internet access set up on this router. You'll definitely want to hardwire this in to your studio network rather than use wifi. Plug an ethernet cord from your main router in the studio to the port on the left. Once that's connected, the admin dashboard should pop up a section to configure the wired connection. You can use DHCP to get it on your network. Eventually you'll want to give this device a fixed IP address by going into your main router and setting a static DHCP lease. The specifics of that will depend on your own router so I'll leave that up to you to look up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my case the travel router's IP address is 10.10.12.102.</p>

 Configure the Wireguard Server 

<p>Now we're ready to set up the travel router as a Wireguard server. Wireguard is relatively new VPN software that is a lot faster and easier to use compared to older VPN software like OpenVPN. It's conveniently already built in to the travel router as well, making it an excellent option for this.</p>

<p>Go to the VPN menu on the side and expand it to reveal the Wireguard Server tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click "Initialize Wireguard Server" and you'll be able to set it up. Enable the "Allow Access Local Network" toggle, and change the "Local IP" to <code>172.16.55.1</code>. (It doesn't really matter what IP range you use for the Wireguard interface, but this address is unlikely to conflict with your existing network.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can click "Start", and then go into the "Management" tab.</p>

<p>Click the big "Add a New User" button. Give it a name like "RemoteATEM". This will create a config for it which you'll use to set up the remote side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on the icon under "Configurations" and click the "Plain Text" tab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy that text into a text editor (not Word or Google Docs!). We're going to make a few changes to make it look like the below.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>We don't want the ATEM to send the video feed over the VPN, so change the AllowedIPs line to: <code>172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24</code>. If it's set to <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> then all the traffic on the remote end will be funneled through your VPN server and your studio's internet connection. That's usually what you want when you're using a VPN for privacy, but we don't want to add latency to sending the video feed if you're streaming from the remote end to YouTube directly. The IP address in the <code>Endpoint =</code> line is the public IP address of your studio network, so make sure you leave that line alone. You can remove the <code>DNS =</code> line since we aren't routing all network traffic through the VPN. Make sure you keep the PrivateKey and PublicKey that your router generated though!</p>

<p>This next part is the magic that makes it work. The key here is we need to let other devices on the WireGuard server end access devices on the LAN side of the WireGuard client. The ATEM will be behind the WireGuard client (described in the next section), the ATEM itself wouldn't normally be visible to other things on the Wireguard server side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the most complicated step. You'll need to edit a text file on the router by connecting to it via ssh. Open Terminal on a mac, or PuTTY on Windows.</p>

 <code>ssh root@192.168.8.1
</code> 

<p>The root ssh password is the same admin password you created when you first set up the router. (You won't see your keystrokes as you're typing your password.)</p>

<p>You'll need a text editor to edit the file. If you're familiar with <code>vi</code>, it's already installed. If you want something easier to use, then you can install <code>nano</code>.</p>

 <code>opkg update
opkg install nano
</code> 

<p>Now you can edit the file using nano:</p>

 <code>nano /etc/config/wireguard_server
</code> 

<p>Navigate to the bottom of the file and add this line:</p>

 <code>        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>The file should now look something like the below</p>

 <code>config servers
        option local_port '51820'
        option local_ipv6 'fd00:db8:0:abc::1'
        option private_key '&lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option public_key '&lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option access 'ACCEPT'
        option local_ip '172.16.55.1'
        option enable '1'

config peers 'wg_peer_9563'
        option name 'RemoteATEM'
        option client_key '&lt;CLIENT PUBLIC KEY&gt;'
        option private_key '&lt;CLIENT PRIVATE KEY&gt;'
        option client_ip '172.16.55.2/32'
        list subnet '192.168.5.0/24'
</code> 

<p>To save and exit, press control X, and press Y and enter when prompted. You'll need to reboot this device once this is set up, so click the "reboot" button in the top right corner of the admin panel.</p>

 Set Up Port Forwarding 

<p>The last step on the studio side is to set up port forwarding from your studio router to forward port 51820 to the IP address of the WireGuard server. This is what will let the remote end be able to connect to your studio VPN. How you do this will depend on what router you use in your studio. Most routers will have a web interface to configure them which will let you set up port forwarding rules.</p>

<p>You'll need to know the IP address of your studio router as well as the IP address of the travel router. Create a port forwarding rule to forward port 51820 to your travel router's IP address.</p>

<p>For example, this is what it looks like in my Unifi router to create the forwarding rule.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alright, we're set on this end! You now have a WireGuard server accessible from outside of your network! If you're curious to keep experimenting with WireGuard, you can even set up your mobile phone or laptop as a WireGuard client so that you can connect back to your studio on the go!</p>

<p>Next, we're ready to set up the remote end for the ATEM Mini Pro.</p>

 Set up the Remote Side for the ATEM 

<p>The remote kit side will have the ATEM Mini Pro, the camera, and the WireGuard client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When the WireGuard client powers on, it will connect to your studio network and make the ATEM Mini acessible from your studio network.</p>

<p>I want to preface this section by saying I tried really hard to make this work with another GL.iNet router, but ran into a few blockers before switching to using a Raspberry Pi. As such, this step is a lot more involved and requires quite a bit more command line work than I would like. If you are reading this and happen to know how to do this with the GL.iNet router instead, I would be very interested in hearing it! Feel free to get in touch with details!</p>

 Install Raspberry Pi OS 

<p>The first thing to do is burn the Raspberry Pi OS image to a MicroSD card. Download the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> app, and go through the steps of installing the Raspberry Pi OS. If you're comfortable on the command line, you can use the "lite" version which doesn't include the desktop environment. I prefer this since I'm never going to be connecting a monitor to this anyway after the first round of setup.</p>

<p>After the card is created, stick it in the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. You'll need a keyboard and monitor connected to set things up the first time. You'll also want to make sure the Raspberry Pi has an internet connection, so plug in an ethernet cord to the ethernet port on the Pi into your home router.</p>

 Install WireGuard 

<p>It looks like in the near future, WireGuard will be included by default in Raspberry Pi OS, so first check if it's already there by typing <code>which wg</code>, and if it shows you a path like <code>/usr/bin/wg</code> then you can skip this step since it's already installed!</p>

<p>If you need to install WireGuard, you can install it from the "testing" packages by running these commands:</p>

 <code>echo "deb http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian testing main" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list.d/testing.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wireguard
</code> 

<p>Now when you run <code>which wg</code> you should see that it's installed.</p>

 WireGuard Setup 

<p>Remember that big block of text you created in the previous step? It's time to use it! You'll need to paste that into the WireGuard configuration file on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code> 

<p>Paste in the full contents of the configuration replacing anything that is already in that file if any.</p>

 <code>[Interface]
Address = 172.16.55.2/32
ListenPort = 42170
PrivateKey = &lt;YOUR PRIVATE KEY&gt; 

[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 172.16.55.0/24, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &lt;YOUR IP ADDRESS&gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
PublicKey = &lt;YOUR PUBLIC KEY&gt;
</code> 

<p>Save and quit by pressing control X, then Y and enter when prompted.</p>

 Turn the Raspberry Pi into a Router 

<p>The Raspberry Pi will be sharing its internet connection with the ATEM Mini, so it's time to turn it into a router! (This is the reason I wanted to use a travel router instead, because this step is already done in that case.)</p>

<p>First, plug in the USB ethernet adapter to one of the USB ports, and connect an ethernet cable from that to the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up that ethernet device. Edit the file using the command below:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1
</code> 

<p>Paste in the following text exactly as written:</p>

 <code>auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.5.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
</code> 

<p>This creates a new network on the Raspberry Pi which will be the private network for the ATEM Mini.</p>

<p>We're going to set up a few more things first, then eventually reboot the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y isc-dhcp-server firewalld
</code> 

<p>Now edit the DHCP server config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
</code> 

<p>You'll need to set the <code>domain-name</code> and <code>domain-name-servers</code> as follows:</p>

 <code>option domain-name "rpi.local";
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8;
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the bottom and add the following lines as well:</p>

 <code>subnet 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        range 192.168.5.100 192.168.5.200;
        option routers 192.168.5.1;
        option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
}
</code> 

<p></p>

<p>Next, open the <code>/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server</code> file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
</code> 

<p>Add <code>eth1</code> to the <code>INTERFACESv4</code> line and save the file.</p>

 <code>INTERFACESv4="eth1"
INTERFACESv6=""
</code> 

<p>Now we can set up the firewall to allow this traffic through and enable IP masquerading.</p>

 <code>sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-masquerade --permanent
</code> 

<p>Lastly, we'll tell the WireGuard client to start up on boot by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
</code> 

<p>Finally, we're ready to reboot the Raspberry Pi and see if it all works!</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>With any luck, the Raspberry Pi will boot up and connect to your WireGuard server and everything will be working!</p>

<p>On the Raspberry Pi, you should be able to type <code>sudo wg</code> to see the status of the WireGuard client. If it worked, you'll see the endpoint you're connected to as well as a "latest handshake" and some transfer stats showing how much data has gone over the VPN.</p>

<p></p>

 Let's Try it Out! 

<p>With everything up and running, it's time to try to connect to your ATEM! You'll need to find or set the IP address of the ATEM on the remote side. You can try out <code>192.168.5.100</code> since it will be the first device that the DHCP server sees, or you can connect your ATEM over USB and use the ATEM Setup app to find the address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Of course, to really put it to the test, you'll want to unplug from USB and see if you can connect from your laptop through the VPN.</p>

<p>Remember, at this point your laptop running the ATEM Software Control app should be connected to your travel router either over wifi or ethernet. Your ATEM Mini is the remote end, and that's connected to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Open the ATEM Software Control app and type in the ATEM's IP address under "Manual IP Address". (It won't be able to auto-discover it on the network since it's going over a VPN.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you have a Blackmagic camera connected to the ATEM, you'll be able to control it from the Camera tab since it's connected to the ATEM via HDMI! No networking stuff to worry about there.</p>

 Using the Streaming Bridge 

<p>Now you're ready to choose where to stream! The remote ATEM can stream directly to YouTube if that's how you're using it. Because of the way we set up WireGuard, the ATEM will use the remote end's internet connection rather than sending the video through the VPN and out of your studio. That saves a hop and will give you better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to stream to your Streaming Bridge, that should "just work" by using the local IP address of the Streaming Bridge. Connect the Streaming Bridge to your travel router, then open the ATEM Setup app to find its IP address. In my case it's <code>192.168.8.127</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and choose "Local network with key". It's a "local network" because it's going over the VPN. The nice thing about doing it this way is you don't have to set up port forwarding in your studio's router to the bridge, since it will all happen over the VPN!</p>

<p>Next click the "External ATEM Mini Pro" tab to export the configuration file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You'll need to make one change in the file since the normal local network discovery that it does won't work over the VPN. Open the xml file in a text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, and replace the URL with the IP address of your Streaming Bridge, for example:</p>

 <code>&lt;servers&gt;
  &lt;server&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Default&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;rtmp://192.168.8.127:1935/app&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/servers&gt;
</code> 

<p>Now you can load that config file in the ATEM Software Control from the "Stream" menu in the top menu bar, and you'll have a new streaming destination to choose!</p>

<p></p>

 Recording Locally 

<p>If you also ship a USB drive plugged in to the remote ATEM, you can record the program locally as a backup! If you use a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, you can even tell the camera itself to record a high quality video to an SD card or SSD in the camera itself!</p>

<p>And that's it! Hopefully all of this worked for you. If you have any trouble, feel free to post a question on the <a href="https://forum.livevideotech.today/c/support/5">Live Video Tech</a> forums to get some assistance!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-leads-social-media-companies.html">According to CNBC</a>,
Facebook made $7.89 in revenue per average global user in the 3rd quarter last year (with a high of
$39.63 in the US and Canada, and a low of $2.22 outside US, Canada, Europe and Asia-Pacific).</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/financials?p=FB">According to Yahoo! Finance</a> and my calculation, if
its expenses in the same quarter were $13.4 billion, expense per user was  $13.4 / $21.5 * $7.89 = $4.92
on average (proportionally allocated given expense / revenue ratio).</p>
<p>Revenue per user is obviously quite different in different parts of the world, but what about costs?
It seems to me that on a per-user-basis, selling and serving all those ads in the US and Canada that led
to so much revenue per user is probably more expensive, compared to some places that have less commerce.
But as dramatically different as $39.63 and $2.22 on the revenue side? I don’t think so. Not even close.</p>
<p>In other words, users in the rest of the world at $2.22 of revenue per user are almost certainly
not profitable. Even if expenses there were only half of average, it would still not be enough.</p>
<p>Of course these numbers are averages across the regions, and chances are that the differences between users
within one region are also quite striking. I don’t have numbers on those. But I would bet that some
users in the US and Canada also bring in less revenue than the $4.92 in average cost per user.</p>
<p>Who would those unprofitable users be in the US, say? Well, those demographics
and those neighborhoods in the social graph in which advertisers see little opportunities to make a sale,
because, for example, everybody is unemployed and angry.</p>
<p>(So if, for example, a certain presidential campaign came by and wanted to specifically target this
demographic with political ads … I for one can vividly imagine the leap of joy of some Facebook business guy
who finally saw how to get promoted: “I turned a million users from being a cost center to being
a profit center”. And democracy be damned. Of course, I’m speculating here, but directionally I don’t
think I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>Which suggests another strategy to unseat Facebook as the dominant social network: focus on picking off the
users that generate the most revenue for Facebook, as they subsidize the rest. If that relatively small
subset of users jumped ship, the rest of the business would become unprofitable.</p>
<p>(I jotting this down because I hadn’t seen anybody suggest this strategy. We do need to find ways
of ending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> after all.)</p>

<p>This modular cage allows you to stack <a href="https://geni.us/f2B4y">Blackmagic Bidirectional SDI/HDMI 3G Converters</a> on a desk or behind other gear.</p>

<p>The design is composed of four parts: the main shelf, the top shelf, a top plate that sits on top of the top shelf, and an optional angled base. The angled base plate lets you mount the whole stack on top of rack gear that's mounted at a 9° angle, such as the <a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk">StarTech 8U desktop rack</a>. You can print as many of the main shelves as you need to stack.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2XliEqk"></a></p>



<p>The shelves are designed so that the converters can slip in from one side with enough of a gap on top to be able to insert and remove them even after a stack is assembled.</p>

<p>If you'd like, you can glue the stack together to make a solid structure. Otherwise the pegs are long enough that the stack is reasonably stable even without glue.</p>

  <p>Summary: DIDComm is the messaging protocol that provides utility for DID-based relationships. DIDComm is more than just a way to exchange credentials, it's a protocol layer capable of supporting specialized application protocols for specific workflows. Because of its general nature and inherent support for self-sovereign relationships, DIDComm provides a basis for a self-sovereign internet much more private, enabling, and flexible than the one we've built using Web 2.0 technologies.</p>




<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">DID-based relationships</a> are the foundation of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). The exchange of DIDs to form a connection with another party gives both parties a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship that is self-certifying and mutually authenticated</a>. Further, the connection forms a secure messaging channel called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DID Communication or DIDComm</a>. DIDComm messaging is more important than most understand, providing a secure, interoperable, and flexible general messaging <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/overlay-network">overlay</a> for the entire internet. 
</p>

<p>
    Most people familiar with SSI equate DIDComm with verifiable credential exchange, but it's much more than that. Credential exchange is just one of an infinite variety of protocols that can ride on top of the general messaging protocol that DIDComm provides. Comparing DIDComm to the venerable TCP/IP protocol suite does not go too far. Just as numerous application protocols ride on top of TCP/IP, so too can various application protocols take advantage of DIDComm's secure messaging overlay network. The result is more than a secure messaging overlay for the internet, it is the foundation for a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign internet with all that that implies</a>.  
</p>

<a></a>
 DID Communications Protocol 

<p>
    DIDComm messages are exchanged between software <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agents</a> that act on behalf of the people or organizations that control them. I often use the term "wallet" to denote both the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> and agent, but in this post we should distinguish between them. Agents are rule-executing software systems that exchange DIDComm messages. Wallets store DIDs, credentials, personally identifying information, cryptographic keys, and much more. Agents use wallets for some of the things they do, but not all agents need a wallet to function. 
</p>

<p>
    For example, imagine Alice and Bob wish to play a game of TicTacToe using game software that employs DIDComm. Alice's agent and Bob's agent will exchange a series of messages. Alice and Bob may be using a game UI and be unaware of the details but the agents are preparing plaintext JSON messages1 for each move using a TicTacToe protocol that describes the format and appropriateness of a given message based on the current state of the game.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Alice and Bob play TicTacToe over DIDComm messaging (click to enlarge)


<p>
    When Alice places an X in a square in the game interface, her agent looks up Bob's DID Document. She received this when she and Bob exchanged DIDs and it's kept up to date by Bob whenever he rotates the keys underlying the DID2. Alice's agent gets two key pieces of information from the DID Document: the endpoint where messages can be sent to Bob and the public key Bob's agent is using for the Alice:Bob relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice's agent uses Bob's public key to encrypt the JSON message to ensure only Bob's agent can read it and adds authentication using the private key Alice uses in the Alice:Bob relationship. Alice's agent arranges to deliver the message to Bob's agent through whatever means are necessary given his choice of endpoint. DIDComm messages are often routed through other agents under Alice and Bob's control.
</p>

<p>
    Once Bob's agent receives the message, it authenticates that it came from Alice and decrypts it. For a game of TicTacToe, it would ensure the message complies with the TicTacToe protocol given the current state of play. If it complies, the agent would present Alice's move to Bob through the game UI and await his response so that the process could continue. But different protocols could behave differently. For example, not all protocols need to take turns like the TicTacToe protocol does.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Properties 

<p>
    The DIDComm Protocol is designed to be
</p>
 
     Secure 
     Private 
     Interoperable 
     Transport-agnostic 
     Extensible 
 
<p>
    Secure and private follow from the protocol's support for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">heterachical (peer-to-peer) connections and decentralized design</a> along with its use of end-to-end encryption. 
</p>

<p>
    As an interoperable protocol, DIDComm is not dependent on a specific operating system, programming language, vendor, network, hardware platform, or ledger3. While DIDComm was originally developed within the Hyperledger Aries project, it aims to be the common language of any secure, private, self-sovereign interaction on, or off, the internet.  
</p>

<p>
    In addition to being interoperable, DIDComm should be able to make use of any transport mechanism including HTTP(S) 1.x and 2.0, WebSockets, IRC, Bluetooth, NFC, Signal, email, push notifications to mobile devices, Ham radio, multicast, snail mail, and more.
</p>

<p>
    DIDComm is an asynchronous, simplex messaging protocol that is designed for extensibility by allowing for protocols to be run on top of it. By using asynchronous, simplex messaging as the lowest common denominator, almost any other interaction pattern can be built on top of DIDComm. Application-layer protocols running on top of DIDComm allow extensibility in a way that also supports interoperability.
</p>

<a></a>
 DIDComm Protocols 

<p>
    Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Protocols formalize workflows for specific interactions like ordering food at a restaurant, playing a game, or applying for college.  DIDComm and its application protocols are one of the cornerstones of the SSI metasystem, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml#metasystem">giving rise to a protocological culture</a> within the metasystem that is open, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">agentic</a>, inclusive, flexible, modular, and universal.
</p>

<p>
    While we have come to think of SSI agents being strictly about exchanging peer DIDs to create a connection, request and issue a credential, or prove things using credentials, these are merely specific protocols defined to run over the DIDComm messaging protocol. Many others are possible. The follow specifications describe the protocols for these three core applications of DIDComm: 
</p>
 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">Connecting with others</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Requesting and issuing credentials</a> 
     <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Proving things using credentials</a> 
 
<p>
    There's a protocol for agents to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0031-discover-features/README.md">discover the protocols that another agent supports</a>. And another for one agent to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">make an introduction</a>4 of one agent to another. The TicTacToe game Alice and Bob played above is enabled by a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/tictactoe/README.md">protocol for TicTacToe</a>. Bruce Conrad who works on <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?mode=global">picos</a> with me <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/TicTacToe/blob/master/README.md">implemented the TicTacToe protocol</a> for picos, which are DIDComm. 
</p>

<p>
    Daniel Hardman has provided a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#roles-participants-parties-and-controllers">tutorial on defining protocols on DIDComm</a>. We can imagine a host of DIDComm protocols for all kinds of specialized interactions that people might want to undertake online including the following:
</p>
 
     Delegating 
     Commenting 
     Notifying 
     Buying and selling 
     Negotiating 
     Enacting and enforcing contracts 
     Putting things in escrow (and taking them out again) 
     Transferring ownership 
     Scheduling 
     Auditing 
     Reporting errors 
 
<p>
    As you can see from this partial list, DIDComm is not just a secure, private way to connect and exchange credentials. Rather DIDComm is a foundation protocol that provides a secure and private overlay to the internet for carrying out almost any online workflow. Consequently, agents are more than the name "wallet" would imply, although that's a convenient shorthand for the common uses of DIDComm today. 
</p>

<a></a>
 A Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>Because of the self-sovereign nature of agents and the flexibility and interoperable characteristics they gain from DIDComm, they form the basis for new, more empowering internet. While self-sovereign identity is the current focus of DIDComm, its capabilities exceed what many think of as "identity." When you combine the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">vast landscape of potential verifiable credentials</a> with DIDComm's ability to create custom message-based workflows to support very specific interactions, it's easy to imagine that the DIDComm protocol and the heterarchical network of agents it enables will have an impact as large as the web, perhaps the internet itself.
</p>

 

 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     DIDComm messages do not strictly have to be formatted as JSON. 
     Alice's agent can verify that it has the right DID Document and the most recent key by requesting a copy of Bob's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">key event log</a> (called delta's for peer DIDs) and validating it. This is the basis for saying peer DIDs are self certifying. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/10/fuse_with_two_owners.shtml">Fuse with Two Owners</a> shows an introduction protocol for picos I used in building Fuse in 2014 before picos used DIDComm. I'd like to revisit this as a way of building introductions into picos using a DIDComm protocol.

    In the world full of human bias,&nbsp; exploring paradox might help us explain our differences.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya (Identity Woman</a>) and I wrote “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/12/humans-want-principles-society-demands.html">Humans want principles, society demands rules and businesses want to manage risk, can we reconcile the differences?</a>&nbsp; Have been noodling on that framework of linking purpose and rules with a few friends. This article explores how to look for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox">paradox</a> within our known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive bias</a> and how to identify and manage differences. <p>----</p><p>I follow the excellent work of my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rorysutherland/">Rory Sutherland</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nireyal/">Nir Eyal</a> (Nir &amp; Far) who are both leading thinkers in behavioural science and economics along with the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>. I reflected following a call with the most read man on the planet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbie-stamp-70254/">Robbie Stamp</a> CEO of <a href="http://www.bioss.com/">BIOSS</a> (a company who can assess capabilities for complex decision making), about how to frame bias and conflicts. We are aware that there are over 180 cognitive biases of human behaviour, which because of differences between us; create unique tensions, alignments, conflicts and paradoxes.</p> The 180 cognitive biases of human behaviour create unique tension, alignment, conflict and paradox. <br><p>The famous infographic below from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/busterbenson/">Buster Benson</a> on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@buster">https://medium.com/@buster</a> has become foundational in presenting the array of human cognitive bias. Buster is well worth following, and I am looking forward to reading his new book "<a href="https://busterbenson.com/whyareweyelling/">Why Are We Yelling? The Art of Productive Disagreement"</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On another call with my friend, the insanely cleaver identity lawyer and polymath <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-david-35a5887/">Scott David, </a>we were noodling that we saw paradoxes within behavioural science, primarily when reflecting on the very long list of human biases.&nbsp; I love his quote “we have to find the paradox, or we are probably in a model.” On a similar call with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktormirovic/">Viktor Mirovic </a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://keencorp.com/">CEO of KeenCorp</a> - a company who identifies employee problems in real-time), we explored the gaps between our own bias and purpose and those biases/purpose that our companies have.&nbsp; Viktor and I reflected on what happens when there is a delta between you and the company and the (a)effects on teams and individuals performance.&nbsp; As you can imagine, this article and thinking are built ’the shoulders of giants and would not have come to be without those conversations and many others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The drawing below is to explore how to frame paradox within our known biases (maybe beliefs).&nbsp; We will unpack the diagram, examine how we manage the differences, and recognise that mostly we don't; which leads to harmful stress.&nbsp;</p> On discovering Peak Paradox <p>The four outer extremes are peaks in their own right; at these individual peaks, you can only hold one single view at the expense of all others.&nbsp; Therefore there is no conflict at a peak, and no compromise as this is the only view that can be held.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The axes are set up that on the X-axis (horizontal) is the conflict of our human purpose vs a commercial purpose. On the Y-axis (vertical) it is the conflict of individual vs everyone.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Peak Individual Purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the exclusion of anything else, you are only interested in yourself.&nbsp; Selflessness at the extreme.&nbsp; You believe that you are sovereign (not having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness), your voice and everything you say matters and everyone should agree. You are all-powerful and can do whatever you want and have the freedom and agency to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Work Purpose.&nbsp; Work in this context is commercial or economic. At the exclusion of anything else, the only reason a company exists is to deliver as much possible value to the shareholders.&nbsp; Employees, customers, the environment does not matter in terms of exploitation.&nbsp; The purpose is to be the biggest and most efficient beast on the planet and able to deliver enormous returns; Shareholder Primacy at its most pure. Simple, straightforward, no conflict and no compromise. Even to the point that rewarding the staff beyond fair would be a compromise.&nbsp; Compliance is met with the minimal standard ensuring that nothing is wasted.&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Society Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we have to deliver and ensure there is no suffering and poverty for any living thing. Humans must have equal education, health and safety.&nbsp; There must be total transparency and equality.&nbsp; Everything is equally shared, and on-one has more power, agency or influence than anyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Human Purpose.&nbsp; At the exclusion of anything else, we are here to survive as long as possible and escape death, which we do by reproducing as much as we can with the broadest community we can.&nbsp; We also have to adapt as fast as possible.&nbsp; We have to meet our chemistry requirements to stay alive for as long as possible to adopt and reproduce at the expense of everything else.&nbsp; Whilst all the peak purposes might be controversial (even to myself), saying purity of human purpose is chemistry/ biology might not go down very well. However, this is a model for framing thinking, so please go with it as it needs to be pure, and every other human purpose has conflicts with someone.</p><p>These extremes as peaks articulate that there is no conflict, no compromise, no tension - they are pure when at the extreme.&nbsp; It is not that we have to agree with them but to recognise they can exist.&nbsp; &nbsp; My gut says right-wing politics (given the interpretation of capitalist today and not its original meaning) follows the top edge between peak commercial purpose and peak individual purpose. Depending on the specific view individuals can be somewhere along the line, whereas parties are more complex in their overall position. &nbsp; Left-wing political views (today's interruption more socialist) follow the bottom right edge between peak commercial purpose and peak society. Again individual views may hold the line, but parties are trying to find the right balance of majority votes, commercial activity, tax, redistribution and a fairer society.&nbsp; Applying the same thinking Cults are likely to be positioned along the top left boundary between peak human purpose and peak individual purpose, whereas more fervent religious movements will tend towards the lower-left boundary between peak human purpose and peak society. Like political parties, world religions need a mass following for a voice and therefore are positioned with more paradoxes, which they solve with paradoxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Peak Paradox.&nbsp; The melting pot that is the middle of all of the peaks, the place where you are trying to rationalise all the extreme purposes into one acceptable position for everyone, but there is no resolution without compromise that will suit no-one.&nbsp; Peak Paradox is likely to be unsustainable due to the conflicts and compromises required or may itself be a paradox in so much when there it feels like nothing is there, like the eye of the storm when there is complete calm.&nbsp; It feels that many great thinkers and philosophers may try to find rest or stillness in this calm at peak paradox. There is a battle to get into the place of calm fighting the storms of opinions, and if you lose that moment of mindfulness, it is straight back into the storm. The unstable nature of standing on the point of a needle. This said:</p>  <p>Just because we may agree on the same peak purpose, that does not mean we can also agree on how to go about achieving or maintaining it.</p>  <p>Different peak purposes can have the same principles and values.&nbsp; You come from different peaks towards a livable compromise; however, as individuals, you can have the same principles and values, making the acceptance of difference more acceptable.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If there is no paradox or you cannot find one, you are at a boundary edge, where there is the greatest order, or at an extreme peak view.&nbsp;</p>  <p>At peak paradox, there is the highest disorder, in terms of a variety of views.</p>  <p>It is evident that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_test">our long list of personality testing</a> is to identify where you naturally identify with right now. You will change and adapt, but there is likely to be a natural affinity that tends towards one or more peaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>There are over 180 cognitive biases recognised,&nbsp; from this diagram, we can unpack that you are unlikely to have them all at the same time, but a subset of them depending on where you locate yourself.&nbsp;</p>   What is the relation between bias and paradox? <p>When there are no biases, surely we have overcome all our objections, and we can deal with everyone’s unique and individual views, and we must be at “Peak Paradox.”</p><p>When there is no paradox, surely we are at an extreme view where there are no tensions, no conflicts, and we have no biases that can distract us from accepting every position equally.</p><p>Most of us do not see the paradox in front of us. Still, we have many biases, suggesting that Peak Bias (number of biases), which means we reject most ideas accepting only a few, will occur early in a distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>As we can deal with more complex compromises, we can see more paradoxes in any position but can cope with the conflicts and tensions that arise, suggesting a long tail to peak paradox.&nbsp;</p><p></p> 4 case studies <p>I wrote about how to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-uncover-your-purpose-tony-fish/">uncover your purpose here</a>, but I can now see that personal purpose maps differently to paradox and bias. Mapping a few personal or individual purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Invent and Crete.&nbsp; “Necessity is the mother of all invention” and “Creativity is intelligence having fun” sum up rather well that part of our human make-up is to find ways to create or invent something that solves a problem we see or understand.&nbsp; Our personal purpose is to invent and create as we see what everyone else sees but can think what no-one else has thought. Irrespective of such a personal goal it maps all of the blue area on the Peak Paradox diagram as every paradox creates a problem that needs to be solved.&nbsp; Being creative as a purpose does not mean you will find anyone else on the same journey.</p><p>Creating Impact.&nbsp; Some individuals desire to have more of an impact whilst alive and some, because of what they do, have a lasting effect that changes our human journey, some good and some not so.&nbsp; This is the point about creating impact as a purpose; it is like all items that humans make: they can be used as tools for good or weapons for bad.&nbsp; Creating impact creates a paradox of how to create something that cannot be used for harm, but often we create something without seeing the harm.&nbsp; Our individual purpose is itself in conflict with the outcome we want. &nbsp; At every point under the blue area on the Peak Paradox chat, creating impact for good or ill is possible at every point.&nbsp;</p><p>Better ancestors.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/what-changes-when-you-consider.html">What changes when you consider governance for the next 1000 years</a> is a post about how we have to become better stewards and ancestors.&nbsp; We have to be more considerate if we want others to walk our path and not burn the earth.&nbsp; As a thinking piece, I focussed on the paradox of high commercial pressure, being between citizens, giving our children life and enabling more individuals to have agency.&nbsp; Almost peak paradox. Perhaps this is the case with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance">ESG </a>as a conceptual issue, we have to compromise, and we are not in agreement on what we need to compromise on?</p> Perhaps this is the case with ESG as a conceptual issue, we have to compromise, and we are not in agreement on what we need to compromise on? <br><p>Being Useful.&nbsp; There appears to be a human need that presents as wanting to be loved, wanted or useful.&nbsp; Over time we go through these different phases on a cyclic basis throughout life. What we conceive as “being useful” is profoundly personal and therefore could be anywhere in the central blue area on the Peak Paradox drawing. Being Useful today can mean you want to do well in assisting, where you are employed, achieve its goals or mission, and help you achieve your personal goal of more agency.&nbsp; Equally, being useful can mean creating less poverty and suffering in the world.&nbsp; Anyone who describes themselves with a desire to be useful is unlikely to find a massive community who have the same idea of what that means.</p><p>Personal purposes are both aligned to all peaks, and also in conflict with all the peaks, it is why we should see the paradoxes in our own life's purpose and find we cannot rest on one.&nbsp; We have to settle for a compromise that we find acceptable and does not bring conflict, tension or anxiety.&nbsp;</p> Towards better performance, strategy and judgement.&nbsp; <p>Teams and Culture. We have one culture; this is how we do it.&nbsp; These are our rules; these are our processes.&nbsp; We have one team, and all our thinking is aligned.&nbsp; After reading this, you might be as sceptical about such thoughts as I am.&nbsp; In my article “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/12/humans-want-principles-society-demands.html">Humans want principles, society demands rules and businesses want to manage risk, can we reconcile the differences?</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did not connect the dots between the delta or gap between where the company has decided to operate with its paradox, compromises, tensions and conflicts and how they would align to the individuals inside the organisation.&nbsp; I am sure there is a link here to transformation issues as well.&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://keencorp.com/">KeenCorp is looking at measuring this, something I am going to watch&nbsp;</a></p><p>Philanthropy is a private initiative from individuals. Interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy">Wikipedia</a> defines philanthropy as for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)">public good</a>, focusing on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life">quality of life</a>. However, often we see that the person who is giving has an idea of public good and priority that is not aligned to mine, which creates friction. &nbsp; Philanthropy has an interesting dynamic about how much it is for PR and how much it is indeed the individual’s purpose.&nbsp; Might have to analyse the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and see what it says about what paradoxes they are prepared to live with and help understand the criticism and support offered.&nbsp;</p><p>Investors, directors and the company.&nbsp; As a group, you can imagine that they are one the closest to a peak purpose.&nbsp; Investors as equity investors believe, one would hope, in the purity of shareholder primacy and would probably be outright supporters of this single focus.&nbsp; However, since we have lived that view, we are now much more paradoxical.&nbsp; ESG and stewardship codes mean that the purity has become a complex mix of different personal compromises, which currently are not disclosed and may be in conflict to the culture or purpose of the company that they invest into.&nbsp; The relationship between investors and Directors is also changing. However, it appears that the capital providers are willing to embrace ESG and a watered-down version of peak Shareholder Primacy. However, Directos, <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/why-is-innovation-perceived-as-so-much.html">KPI, remuneration committees and self-interested processes might be creating a level of friction to nobel ESG change that we did not anticipate</a>. <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Organisational wellness</a> should also now be a new measure and reported on, but how?&nbsp;</p><p>Governance.&nbsp; Governance of old did not have to embrace compromise, conflict or tensions.&nbsp; Investors and founders understood the simplicity of a very pure set of drivers.&nbsp; The founding team had largely sorted out the paradox and how they could work together.&nbsp; Indeed anyone who could not be soon off.&nbsp; Governance was then ensuring the right NorthStar, the suitable vessel and the right team.&nbsp; This model is no longer good enough. Suddenly, the directors are having to face up to conflicting peak purposes pulling in different directions by directors who have their own views and teams who also have a&nbsp; significant voice.&nbsp; Added to this is the dependence on the ecosystem who themselves will reach a different compromise which asks fundamental questions about your interaction with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> Take away   <p>If there is no paradox, compromise or conflict, you are in a model pretending it is life.</p>  <p>If it is too good to be true, you are probably at an extreme as there is no tension, conflict or paradox.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Are we in a place where our compromises are good for us? Can we perform?</p>  <p>We can identify stress that is probably harmful as we have compromised to someone else’s force, dominance, position and have ended up in a place where we do not naturally belong.</p>  <p>Is there an alignment, understanding and communication between our compromises and those around us in our team? Can we see and talk about the paradoxes in the team's decisions?</p>  <p>Neuro, race and gender diversity are critical for success, understanding our natural positions and compromises makes sense. Knowing the delta between our team is crucial.</p>  <p>Being able to talk to and understand all positions means we will be in a less divided and divisional world.</p>  <br><p>Next questions for me</p>  <p>Does this model allow me to plot products and companies to determine alignment?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ethics; is it our ability to deal with compromise and conflict and find a position we find acceptable?</p>  <br><p>@tonyfish&nbsp; Jan 2021</p><br>

<p>My superpower has always been finding new uses for old tech. In the late 90s I dusted off the venerable NNTP server, which had been the backbone of the Usenet, and turned it into my team’s Slack. In the late 2000s I used iCalendar to make citywide event calendars. In the late 2010s I went deep into SQL.</p>
<p>It’s always intensely pragmatic. But also, I can’t deny, whimsical.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I offer you the public pay phone at the Pinnacles Visitor Center. I stayed in that campground on a road trip just before the election. Given the tense political and epidemiological situation, I’d promised to message home regularly. There was no cell service in the park so I headed over to the office. It was closed, so I sat on the bench and connected to their WiFi. Or tried to. You could connect, sometimes, but you couldn’t move any data. The router was clearly in need of a reboot.</p>
<p>The only option left was the public phone. I can’t remember the last time I used one. Most people alive today have, perhaps, never used one. But there it was, so I gave it a shot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once upon a time, you could pick up the handset, dial 0 for operator, and place a so-called collect (charge-reversed) call. Now dialing 0 gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>The instructions taped to the phone (in the 90s I’m guessing) say you can call an 800 number, or use a calling card. I remember calling cards, I had one once. Not a thing lately.</p>
<p>And then there was this: “Dial 611 for help.”</p>
<p>Me: 611</p>
<p>611: Hello, this is Steve.</p>
<p>Me: I’m at the Pinnacles Visitor Center trying to send a message.</p>
<p>Steve: Use the WiFi.</p>
<p>Me: I can’t, it’s broken.</p>
<p>Steve: Huh, that’s interesting. Let me see if I can reboot the router.</p>
<p>And he did. So there you have it. The public phone still provides a valuable service. Its mission has evolved over the years. Nowadays, it exists to summon Steve the IT guy who can fix the WiFi by turning it off and on again. </p>
<p>Works like a charm!</p>

  <p>Summary: The self-sovereign internet, a secure overlay on the internet, provides the same capacity to produce change by numerous, unaffiliated and uncoordinated actors as the internet itself. The generative nature of the self-sovereign internet is underpinned by the same kind of properties that make the internet what it is, promising a more secure and private, albeit no less useful, internet for tomorrow.</p>



<p>
    This is part one of a two part series on the generativity of SSI technologies. This article explores the properties of the self-sovereign internet and makes the case that they justify its generativity claims. The second part will explore the generativity of verifiable credential exchange, the essence of self-sovereign identity. 
</p>

<p>
    In 2005, Jonathan Zitrain wrote a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%2520Internet.pdf">compelling and prescient examination of the generative capacity of the Internet and its tens of millions of attached PCs</a>. Zittrain defined generativity thus:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  denotes  a  technology’s  overall  capacity  to  produce  unprompted  change  driven  by  large,  varied,  and  uncoordinated  audiences.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Zittrain masterfully describes the extreme generativity of the internet and its attached PCs, explains why openness of both the network and the attached computers is so important, discusses threats to the generativity nature of the internet, and proposes ways that the internet can remain generative while addressing some of those threats. While the purpose of this article is not to review Zittrain's paper in detail, I recommend you take some time to explore it.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">Generative systems</a>  use a few basic rules, structures, or features to yield behaviors that can be extremely varied and unpredictable. Zittrain goes on to lay out the criteria for evaluating the generativity of a technology:
</p>
<blockquote>Generativity  is  a  function  of  a  technology’s  capacity  for  leverage  across  a  range  of  tasks,  adaptability  to  a  range  of  different  tasks,  ease  of mastery, and accessibility.</blockquote>

<p>
This sentence sets forth four important criteria for generativity:
</p>
 
     Capacity for Leverage—generative technology makes difficult jobs easier—sometimes possible. Leverage is measured by the capacity of a device to reduce effort. 
     
     Adaptability—generative technology can be applied to a wide variety of uses with little or no modification. Where leverage speaks to a technology's depth, adaptability speaks to its breadth. Many very useful devices (e.g. airplanes, saws, and pencils) are nevertheless fairly narrow in their scope and application. 
     
     Ease of Mastery—generative technology is easy to adopt and adapt to new uses. Many billions of people use a PC (or mobile device) to perform tasks important to them without significant skill. As they become more proficient in its use, they can apply it to even more tasks. 
     
     Accessibility—generative technology is easy to come by and access. Access is a function of cost, deployment, regulation, monopoly power, secrecy, and anything else which introduces artificial scarcity. 
     
 

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity metasystem I've written about in the past</a> is composed of several layers that provide its unique functionality. This article uses Zittrain's framework, outlined above, to explore the generativity of what I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">called the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, the second layer in the stack shown in Firgure 1. A future article will discuss the generativity of credential exchange at layer three.

 The Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, I make the case that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">network of relationships created by the exchange of decentralized identifiers</a> (layer 2 in Figure 1) forms a new, more secure layer on the internet. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml#properties">protocological properties of DIDComm</a> make that layer especially useful and flexible, mirroring the internet itself.
</p>

<p>
    This kind of "layer" is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network">overlay network</a>. An overlay network comprises virtual links that correspond to a path in the underlying network. Secure overlay networks rely on an identity layer based on asymmetric key cryptography to ensure message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> (HTTPS) is a secure overlay, but it is incomplete because it's not symmetrical. Furthermore, it's relatively inflexible because it overlays a network layer using a client-server protocol1.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02143v12.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) Design</a>, Sam Smith makes the following important point about secure overlay networks:
</p>

<blockquote>The important essential feature of an identity system security overlay is that it binds together controllers, identifiers, and key-pairs. A sender controller is exclusively bound to the public key of a (public, private) key-pair. The public key is exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The sender controller is also exclusively bound to the unique identifier. The strength of such an identity system based security overlay is derived from the security supporting these bindings.
 From <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02143v12.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) Design</a><br>Referenced 2020-12-21T11:08:57-0700
 </blockquote>

<p>
    Figure 2 shows the bindings between these three components of the secure overlay.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers that provide the basis for a secure overlay network.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>, I discuss the strength of these critical bindings in various identity system architectures. The key point for this discussion is that the peer-to-peer network created by peer DID exchanges constitute an overlay with an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic architecture</a>, providing not only the strongest possible bindings between the controller, identifiers, and authentication factors (public key), but also not needing an external trust basis (like a ledger) because they are self-certifying.
</p>

<p>
    DIDs allow us to create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">cryptographic relationships</a>, solving significant key management problems that have plagued asymmetric cryptography since it's inception. Consequently, regular people can use a general purpose secure overlay network based on DIDs. The DID network that is created when people use these relationships provides a protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm">DIDComm</a>, that is every bit as flexible and useful as is TCP/IP.
</p>


<p>
    Consequently, communications over a DIDComm-enabled peer-to-peer network are as generative as the internet itself. Thus, the secure overlay network formed by DIDComm connections represents a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign</a> internet, emulating the underlying internet's peer-to-peer messaging in a way that is both secure and trustworthy2 without the need for external third parties3.
</p>


<a></a>
 Properties of the Self-Sovereign Internet 

<p>
    In <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">World of Ends</a>, <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a> enumerate the internet's three virtues: 
</p>

 
     No one owns it. 
     Everyone can use it. 
     Anyone can improve it. 
 

<p>
    These virtues apply to the self-sovereign internet as well. As a result, the self-sovereign internet displays important properties that support it's generativity.  Here are the most important:
</p>

<p>
    Decentralized—decentralization <a>follows directly from the fact that no one owns it</a>. This is the primary criterion for judging the degree of decentralization in a system. 
</p>

<p>
    Heterarchical—a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy">heterarchy</a> is a "system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways." Nodes in a DIDComm-based network  relate to each other as peers. This is a heterarchy; there is no inherent ranking of nodes in the architecture of the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Interoperable—regardless of what providers or systems we use to connect to the self-sovereign internet, we can interact with any other principles who are using it so long as they follow protocol4. 
</p>


<p>
    Substitutable—The DIDComm protocol defines how systems that use it must behave to achieve interoperability. That means that anyone who understands the protocol can write software that uses DIDComm. Interoperability ensure that we can operate using a choice of software, hardware, and services without fear of being locked into a proprietary choice. Usable substitutes provide choice and freedom. 
</p>

<p>
    Reliable and Censorship Resistant—people, businesses, and others must be able to use the secure overlay network without worrying that it will go down, stop working, go up in price, or get taken over by someone who would do it and those who use it harm. This is larger than mere technical trust that a system will be available and extends to the issue of censorship.
</p>

<p>
    Non-proprietary and Open—no one has the power to change the self-sovereign internet by fiat. Furthermore, it can't go out of business and stop operation because its maintenance and operation are distributed instead of being centralized in the hands of a single organization. Because the self-sovereign internet is an agreement rather than a technology or system, it will continue to work. 
</p>

<a></a>
 The Generativity of the Self-Sovereign Internet 
<p>
    Applying Zittrain's framework for evaluating generativity is instructive for understanding the generative properties of the self-sovereign internet.
</p>

<a></a>
 Capacity for Leverage 

<p>
    In Zittrain's words, leverage is the extent to which an object "enables valuable accomplishments that otherwise would be either impossible or not worth the effort to achieve."  Leverage multiplies effort, reducing the time and cost necessary to innovate new capabilities and features.  Like the internet, DIDComm's extensibility through protocols enables the creation of special-purpose networks and data distribution services on top of it. By providing a secure, stable, trustworthy platform for these services, DIDComm-based networks reduce the effort and cost associated with these innovations.
</p>

<p>
    Like a modern operating system's application programming interface (API), DIDComm provides a standardized platform supporting message integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. Programmers get the benefits of a trusted message system without need for expensive and difficult development. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Adaptability 

<p>
    Adaptability can refer to a technology's ability to be used for multiple activities without change as well as its capacity for modification in service of new use cases. Adaptability is orthogonal to capacity for leverage. An airplane, for example, offers incredible leverage, allowing goods and people to be transported over long distances quickly. But airplanes are neither useful in activities outside transportation or easily modified for different uses. A technology that supports hundreds of use cases is more generative than one that is useful in only a few.
</p>

<p>
    Like TCP/IP, DIDComm makes few assumptions about how the secure messaging layer will be used. Thus the network formed by the nodes in a DIDComm network can be adapted to any number of applications. Moreover, because a DIDComm-based network is decentralized and self-certifying, it is inherently scalable for many uses.
</p>

<a></a>
 Ease of Mastery 

<p>
    Ease of use refers to the ability of a technology to be easily and broadly adapted and adopted. The secure, trustworthy platform of the self-sovereign internet allows developers to create applications without worrying about the intricacies of the underlying cryptography or key management.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, because of its standard interface and protocol, DIDComm-based networks can present users with a consistent user experience that reduces the skill needed to establish and use connections. Just like a browser presents a consistent user experience on the web, a DIDComm agent can present users with a consistent user experience for basic messaging, as well as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">specialized operations that run over the basic messaging system</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Of special note is key management, which has been the Achilles heal of previous attempts at secure overlay networks for the internet. Because of the nature of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a>, identifiers are separated from the public key, allowing the keys to be rotated when needed without also needing to refresh the identifier. This greatly reduces the need for people to manage or even see keys. People focus on the relationships and the underlying software manages the keys.5
</p>

<a></a>
 Accessibility 

<p>
    Accessible technologies are easy to acquire, inexpensive, and resistant to censorship. DIDComm's accessibility is a product of its decentralized and self-certifying nature. Protocols and implementing software are freely available to anyone without intellectual property encumbrances. Multiple vendors, and even open-source tools can easily use DIDComm. No central gatekeeper or any other third party is necessary to initiate a DIDComm connection in service of a digital relationship. Moreover, because no specific third parties are necessary, censorship of use is difficult. 
</p>


<a></a>
 Conclusion 


<p>
    Generativity provides decentralized actors to create cooperating, complex structures and behavior. No one person or group can or will think of all the possible uses, but each is free to adapt the system to their own use. The architecture of the self-sovereign internet exhibits a number of important properties. The generativity of the self-sovereign internet depends on those properties. The true value of the self-sovereign internet is that it provides an leveragable, adaptable, usable, accessible, and stable platform upon which others can innovate. 
</p>


 
<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Implementing general-purpose messaging on HTTP is not straightforward, especially when combined with non-routable IP addresses for many clients. On the other hand, simulating client-server interactions on a general-purpose messaging protocol is easy. 
     
     I'm using "trust" in the cryptographic sense, not in the reputational sense.  Cryptography allows us to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">trust the fidelity of the communication</a> but not its content. 
     Admittedly, the secure overlay is running on top of a network with a number of third parties, some benign and others not. Part of the challenge of engineering a functional secure overlay with self-sovereignty it mitigating the effects that these third parties can have within the self-sovereign internet. 
     
     Interoperability is, of course, more complicated than merely following the protocols. Daniel Hardman does an excellent job of discussing this for verifiable credentials (a protocol that runs over DIDComm), in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">Getting to Practical Interop With Verifiable Credentials</a>.
     
     More details about some of the ways software can greatly reduce the burden of key management when things go wrong can be found in <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/lost-phone/">What If I Lose My Phone?</a> by Daniel Hardman.

<p>Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between&nbsp;them.</p><p>As digital service delivery models mature, it is essential that information is protected as it travels across jurisdictional and organizational boundaries. Trust frameworks define and bring together the otherwise disparate set of best practice principles, processes, standards that apply when it comes to collecting and sharing information on the web. As individuals and entities increasingly share their information cross contextually, across industry boundaries, trust frameworks provide the common set of rules that apply regardless of such differences. For example, service providers ranging from government agencies, banks and telecommunication companies, to health care providers could all follow the same set of data sharing practices under one trust framework. This macro application serves to reduce the need for bilateral agreements and fragmentation across industry. Ultimately trust frameworks serve to increase trust, improve efficiencies, and deliver significant economic and social benefits.</p><p>Some use-cases will require more detailed rules to be established than those set out in a trust framework with broad scope. Where this is the case, more detailed rules around specific hierarchies and roles can be established within the context of the higher order trust framework. The goal is always for the components of the framework to be transparent, and adherence to those components to be public. This enables entities to rely on the business or technical process carried out by others with trust and confidence. If done correctly, a trust framework is invisible to those who rely on it every day. It allows individuals and entities to conduct digital transactions knowing that the trust frameworks underpin, create accountability, and support the decisions they’re&nbsp;making.</p> Use Cases for Trust Frameworks <p>Historically speaking, trust frameworks have been extraordinarily complex and only worth the investment for high-value, high-volume transactions, such as the ones established by credit card companies. Now, with the introduction of decentralized technologies, there is a need to create digital trust frameworks that work for a much broader variety of transactions. Realizing the scope of this work comes with the recognition that there will be many different trust frameworks, both small and large in scope, for different federations across the web. Given that context, it is important to preserve end-user agency as much as possible as trust frameworks are developed and adoption and mutual recognition increases.</p><p>Looking at the ecosystem today, we can broadly group trust frameworks into three categories:</p> Domain-specific Trust Frameworks   These are typically developed to serve a specific use-case, for example within a particular industry  Often driven by industry and/or&nbsp;NGOs  These have been able to develop faster than national trust frameworks (which are based in legislation), and as such may inform the development of national trust frameworks   National Trust Frameworks   Typically broad in application and to facilitate a policy objective (for example, increased trust in data&nbsp;sharing)  Driven by individual governments to address the needs of their citizens and residents  Based in legislation, with more enforcement powers than either Domain-specific Trust Frameworks or International Trust Frameworks  Likely to be informed by both Domain-specific Trust Frameworks and International Trust Frameworks   International Trust Frameworks   These are typically broad in nature and developed to serve many countries, much like a model&nbsp;law  Typically driven by governments, industry, or NGOs but geographically agnostic  Likely to inform National Trust Frameworks   Accreditation and Assurance <p>An important part of satisfying the operational components of a trust framework is the ability to accredit ecosystem participants against the trust framework. This is a logical extension of the rules, requirements, and regulations trust frameworks set out. Trust frameworks typically include an accreditation scheme and associated ongoing compliance testing.</p><p>One aspect of accreditation in the identity context is compliance with standards. In the context of identity related trust frameworks, there are several kinds of assurance that relying parties will typically seek. These can include binding, information, authentication, and federation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_assurance">identity assurance</a>. Each standard may define their own distinct levels of assurance. The <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Digital Identity Requirements</a> and <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identification-management/identification-management-standards/overview-of-the-identification-management-standards/">New Zealand Identification Management Standards</a> are a good example of how this works in practice.</p><p>The process of accreditation and a successful certification is a core part of trust frameworks as it proves to the wider ecosystem (including auditors) that the entity, solution, or piece of software meets the business and technical requirements defined. Digital identity systems are increasingly modular, and one solution might involve a variety of different components, roles and providers. These should be developed and defined as part of the process of standing up a trust framework, testing its capabilities and defining processes around accreditation.</p> Technical Interoperability <p>Trust frameworks help to improve interoperability between entities by defining a common set of operating rules. In addition to setting out business and legal rules, it is important that high level technical rules are specified as well. Trust frameworks must clearly define expectations around the technical standards to be used, as well as what aspects of these standards are normatively required, optional, or somewhere in between. When it comes to digital identity trust frameworks, this may mean building on open-source code or evaluating against open test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Test suites allow for normative testing around standards requirements and offer a way for parties to audit and ensure the processes being used throughout the identity lifecycle. They can be incredibly useful not only for entities using the trust framework, but for mutually recognized trust frameworks to understand and interpret the requirements coming from a particular set of&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Ongoing development of several digital identity trust frameworks based on the emerging decentralized web of trust can be found at industry organizations such as the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> as well as government-driven initiatives such as the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-trust-frameworks-ad96a4427991">Learn Concepts: Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important principle that we want to achieve when designing any system that involves handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</a> is to minimize the data disclosed in a given interaction. When users share information, they should be able to choose what and how much they share on a case-by-case basis, while the relying parties receiving the information must be able to maintain assurances about the presented information’s origin and integrity. This process is often referred to as selective disclosure of data. As technologists, by having solutions that easily achieve selective disclosure, we can drive a culture based on the minimum information exchange required to enhance user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Privacy and Correlation <p>Selective disclosure of information is particularly relevant when evaluating approaches to using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>. Because authorities are able to issue credentials to a subject’s digital wallet, the subject is able to manage which data they disclose to relying parties as well as how that disclosure is performed. This presents an opportunity for those designing digital wallets to consider the user experience of data disclosure, particularly as it relates to the underlying technology and cryptography being used for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The problem of user privacy as it relates to digital identity is a deep and complicated one, however the basic approach has been to allow users to share only the information which is strictly necessary in a particular context. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model spec</a> provides some guidance on how to do so, but stops short of offering a solution to the issue of managing user privacy and preventing correlation of their activities across different interactions:</p><blockquote>Organizations providing software to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> should strive to identify fields in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> containing information that could be used to correlate individuals and warn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holders</a> when this information is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><p>A number of different solutions have been deployed to address the underlying concerns around selective disclosure. Each solution makes a different set of assumptions and offers different tradeoffs when it comes to usability and convenience.</p> Approaches to Selective Disclosure <p>When it comes to solutions for selective disclosure of verifiable credentials, there are many different ways to tackle this problem, but three of the most common&nbsp;are:</p>  Just in time issuance — contact the issuer at request time either directly or indirectly for a tailored assertion  Trusted witness — use a trusted witness between the provider and the relying party to mediate the information disclosure  Cryptographic solutions — use a cryptographic technique to disclose a subset of information from a larger assertion   Just in time&nbsp;issuance <p>Just in time issuance, a model made popular by <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, assumes the issuer is highly available, which imposes an infrastructure burden on the issuer that is proportional to the number of subjects they have information for and where those subjects use their information. Furthermore, in most instances of this model, the issuer learns where a subject is using their identity information, which can be a serious privacy&nbsp;problem.</p> Trusted witness <p>Trusted witness shifts this problem to be more of a presentation concern, where a witness de-anonymizes the subject presenting the information and presents an assertion with only the information required by the relying party. Again, this model requires a highly available party other than the holder and relying party present when a subject wants to present information, one that must be highly trusted and one that bears witness to a lot of PII on the subject, leading to privacy concerns.</p> Cryptographic solutions <p>Cryptographic solutions offer an alternative to these approaches by solving the selective disclosure problem directly at the core data model layer of the VC, providing a simpler and more flexible method of preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There are a variety of ways that cryptography can be used to achieve selective disclosure or data minimization, but perhaps the most popular approach is using a branch of cryptography often known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, or ZKPs. The emergent feature of this technology is that a prover can prove knowledge of some data without exposing any additional data. Zero-knowledge proofs can be achieved in a flexible manner with verifiable credentials using multi-message digital signatures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>.</p> Traditional Digital Signatures <p>Traditional digital signatures look a bit like this. You have a message (virtually any kind of data for which you want to establish integrity) and a keypair (private and public key) which you use to produce a digital signature on the data. By having the message, public key, and the signature; verifiers are able to evaluate whether the signature is valid or not, thereby establishing the integrity of the message and the authenticity of the entity that signed the message. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity doing the signing is the issuer of the credential, while the entity doing the verification is the verifier. The keypair in question belongs to the issuer of the credential, which allows verifiers to establish the authority on that credential in a verifiable manner.</p> Sign  Verify  Multi-message Digital Signatures <p>Multi-message digital signature schemes (like <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+</a>), on the other hand, are able to sign an array of messages, rather than a single message over which the entire digital signature is applied. The same mechanism is used wherein a private key produces a digital signature over the messages you wish to sign, but now you have the flexibility of being able to break a message up into its fundamental attributes. In the context of verifiable credentials, each message corresponds to a claim in the credential. This presents an opportunity for selective disclosure due to the ability to derive and verify a proof of the digital signature over a subset of messages or credential attributes.</p> Sign  Verify <p>In addition to the simple ability to sign and verify a set of messages, multi-message digital signatures have the added capability of being able to derive a proof of the digital signature. In the context of verifiable credentials, the entity deriving the proof is the credential subject or holder. This process allows you to select which messages you wish to disclose in the proof and which messages you want to keep hidden. The derived proof indicates to the verifier that you know all of the messages that have been signed, but that you are only electing to disclose a subset of these messages.</p> Derive Proof  Verify Proof <p>The verifier, or the entity with which you’re sharing the data, is only able to see the messages or credential claims which you have selectively disclosed to them. They are still able to verify the integrity of the messages being signed, as well as establish the authenticity of the issuer that originally signed the messages. This provides a number of privacy guarantees to the data subject because relying parties are only evaluating the proof of the signature rather than the signature itself.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-selective-disclosure-4b9bf4e5c887">Learn Concepts: Selective Disclosure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With so much data being created and shared on the internet, one of the oldest challenges in building digital infrastructure has been how to consistently establish meaning and context to this data. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">semantic web</a> is a set of technologies whose goal is to make all data on the web machine-readable. Its usage allows for a shared understanding around data that enables a variety of real-world applications and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The challenges to address with the semantic web&nbsp;include:</p>  vastness — the internet contains billions of pages, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms  vagueness — imprecise concepts like ‘young’ or ‘tall’ make it challenging to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts  uncertainty — precise concepts with uncertain values can be hard to reason about, this mirrors the ambiguity and probabilistic nature of everyday&nbsp;life  inconsistency — logical contradictions create situations where reasoning breaks&nbsp;down  deceit — intentionally misleading information spread by bad actors, can be mitigated with cryptography to establish information integrity   Linked Data <p>Linked data is the theory behind much of the semantic web effort. It describes a general mechanism for publishing structured data on the internet using vocabularies like <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> that can be connected together and interpreted by machines. Using linked data, statements encoded in triples (subject → predicate → object) can be spread across different websites in a standard way. These statements form the substrate of knowledge that spans across the entire internet. The reality is that the bulk of useful information on the internet today is unstructured data, or data that is not organized in a way which makes it useful to anyone beyond the creators of that data. This is fine for the cases where data remains in a single context throughout its lifecycle, but it becomes problematic when trying to share data across contexts while retaining its semantic meaning. The vision for linked data is for the internet to become a kind of global database where all data can be represented and understood in a similar&nbsp;way.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to realizing the vision of the internet as a global database is enabling a common set of underlying semantics that can be consumed by all this data. A proliferation of data becomes much less useful if the data is redundant, unorganized, or otherwise messy and complicated. Ultimately, we need to double down on the usage of common data vocabularies and common data schemas. Common data schemas combined with the security features of verifiable data will make fraud more difficult, making it easier to transmit and consume data so that trust-based decisions can be made. Moreover, the proliferation of common data vocabularies will help make data portability a reality, allowing data to be moved across contexts while retaining the semantics of its original&nbsp;context.</p> Semantic Web Technologies <p>The work around developing semantic web technology has been happening for a very long time. The vision for the semantic web has been remarkably consistent throughout its evolution, although the specifics around how to accomplish this and at what layer has developed over the years. <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">W3C’s semantic web stack</a> offers an overview of these foundational technologies and the function of each component in the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the semantic web of data is to enable computers to do more useful work and to develop systems that can support trusted interactions over the network. The shared architecture as defined by the W3C supports the ability for the internet to become a global database based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data. Linked data are empowered by technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a>.</p>  RDF provides the foundation for publishing and linking your data. It’s a standard data model for representing information resources on the internet and describing the relationships between data and other pieces of information in a graph&nbsp;format.  OWL is a language which is used to build data vocabularies, or “ontologies”, that represent rich knowledge or&nbsp;logic.  SKOS is a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems such as classification systems in&nbsp;RDF.  SPARQL is the query language for the Semantic Web; it is able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in an RDF graph. Query languages go hand-in-hand with databases. If the Semantic Web is viewed as a global database, then it is easy to understand why one would need a query language for that&nbsp;data.  <p>By enriching data with additional context and meaning, more people (and machines) can understand and use that data to greater&nbsp;effect.</p> JSON-LD <p><a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> is a serialization format that extends JSON to support linked data, enabling the sharing and discovery of data in web-based environments. Its purpose is to be isomorphic to RDF, which has broad usability across the web and supports additional technologies for querying and language classification. RDF has been used to manage industry ontologies for the last couple decades, so creating a representation in JSON is incredibly useful in certain applications such as those found in the context of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a> representation of Verifiable Credentials makes use of a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. The primary benefit of the JSON-LD format used by LD-Proofs is that it builds on a common set of semantics that allow for broader ecosystem interoperability of issued credentials. It provides a standard vocabulary that makes data in a credential more portable as well as easy to consume and understand across different contexts. In order to create a crawl-able web of verifiable data, it’s important that we prioritize strong reuse of data schemas as a key driver of interoperability efforts. Without it, we risk building a system where many different data schemas are used to represent the same exact information, creating the kinds of data silos that we see on the majority of the internet today. JSON-LD makes semantics a first-class principle and is therefore a solid basis for constructing VC implementations.</p><p>JSON-LD is also widely adopted on the web today, with W3C reporting it is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">30% of the web</a> and Google making it the de facto technology for search engine optimization. When it comes to Verifiable Credentials, it’s advantageous to extend and integrate the work around VCs with the existing burgeoning ecosystem of linked&nbsp;data.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-semantic-web-250784d6a49f">Learn Concepts: Semantic Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ability to prove the integrity and authenticity of shared data is a key component to establishing trust online. Given that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/how-much-data-is-generated-each-day-cf4bddf29f/">we produce so much data</a> and are constantly sharing and moving that data around, it is a complex task to identify a solution that will work for the vast majority of internet users across a variety of different contexts.</p><p>The fundamental problem to address is how to establish authority on a piece of data, and how to enable mechanisms to trust those authorities in a broad set of contexts. Solving this problem on a basic level allows entities to have greater trust in the data they’re sharing, and for relying parties to understand the integrity and authenticity of the data being&nbsp;shared.</p><p>We use the overarching term verifiable data to refer to this problem domain. Verifiable data can be further expanded into three key&nbsp;pillars:</p>  Verifiable data  Verifiable relationships  Verifiable processes   Verifiable data <p>This refers to the authenticity and integrity of the actual data elements being&nbsp;shared.</p> Verifiable relationships <p>This refers to the ability to audit and understand the connections between various entities as well as how each of these entities are represented in&nbsp;data.</p> Verifiable processes <p>This describe the ability to verify any digital process such as onboarding a user or managing a bank account (particularly with respect to how data enables the process to be managed and maintained).</p><p>These closely-related, interdependent concepts rely on verifiable data technology becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p>The basic data model of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> may be familiar to developers and architects that are used to working with <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276046/document">attribute-based credentials</a> and data technologies. The issuer, or the authority on some information about a subject (e.g. a person), issues a credential containing this information in the form of claims to a holder. The holder is responsible for storing and managing that credential, and in most instances uses a piece of software that acts on their behalf, such as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">digital wallet</a>. When a verifier (sometimes referred to as a relying party) needs to validate some information, they can request from the holder some data to meet their verification requirements. The holder unilaterally determines if they wish to act upon the request and is free to present the claims contained in their verifiable credentials using any number of techniques to preserve their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials form the foundation for verifiable data in the emerging web of trust. They can be thought of as a container for many different types of information as well as different types of credentials. Because it is an open standard at the W3C, verifiable credentials are able to widely implemented by many different software providers, institutions, governments, and businesses. Due to the wide applicability of these standards, similar content integrity protections and guarantees are provided regardless of the implementation.</p> Semantics and&nbsp;Schemas <p>The authenticity and integrity-providing mechanisms presented by Verifiable Credentials provide additional benefits beyond the evaluation of verifiable data. They also provide a number of extensibility mechanisms that allow data to be linked to other kinds of data in order to be more easily understood in the context of relationships and processes.</p><p>One concrete example of this is the application of data schemas or data vocabularies. Schemas are a set of types and properties that are used to describe data. In the context of data sharing, schemas are an incredibly useful and necessary tool in order to represent data accurately from the point of creation to sharing and verification. In essence, data schemas in the Verifiable Credential ecosystem are only useful if they are strongly reused by many different parties. If each implementer of Verifiable Credentials chooses to describe and represent data in a slightly different way, it creates incoherence and inconsistency in data and threatens to diminish the potential of ubiquitous adoption of open standards and&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials make use of <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> to extend the data model to support dynamic data vocabularies and schemas. This allows us to not only use existing JSON-LD schemas, but to utilize the mechanism defined by JSON-LD to create and share new schemas as well. To a large extent this is what JSON-LD was designed for; the adoption and reuse of common data vocabularies.</p><p>This type of Verifiable Credential is best characterized as a kind of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proof</a>. It allows issuers to make statements that can be shared without loss of trust because their authorship can be verified by a third party. Linked Data Proofs define the capability for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data documents with mathematical proofs and asymmetric cryptography. It provides a simple security protocol which is native to JSON-LD. Due to the nature of linked data, they are built to compactly represent proof chains and allow a Verifiable Credential to be easily protected on a more granular basis; on a per-attribute basis rather than a per-credential basis.</p><p>This mechanism becomes particularly useful when evaluating a chain of trusted credentials belonging to organizations and individuals. A proof chain is used when the same data needs to be signed by multiple entities and the order in which the proofs were generated matters. For example, such as in the case of a notary counter-signing a proof that had been created on a document. Where order needs to be preserved, a proof chain is represented by including an ordered list of proofs with a “proof chain” key in a Verifiable Credential. This kind of embedded proof can be used to establish the integrity of verifiable data&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Overall, the ability for data to be shared across contexts whilst retaining its integrity and semantics is a critical building block of the emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of&nbsp;trust</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-verifiable-data-4515a62c8e40">Learn Concepts: Verifiable Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In order to coordinate the authentication needs of apps and services on the web, many of today’s users will leverage services such as password managers. These tools help users keep track of how they’ve identified themselves in different contexts and simplify the login process for different services. In many ways, the need to overlay such services in order to preserve non-negotiable security properties reflects the broken state of identity on the internet today. Users of these apps (i.e. the data subjects) are often an afterthought when a trust relationship is established between data authorities and apps or services consuming and relying on user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Asymmetry in the nature of the relationships between participants largely prevents users from asserting their data rights as subjects of the data. Users are left to deal with the problems inherent in such a model, foisting upon them the responsibility of implementing appropriate solutions to patch over the shortcomings of identity management under this legacy&nbsp;model.</p><p>The emerging <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-web-of-trust-101-77120941ea6c">web of trust</a> based upon self-certifying identifiers and user-centric cryptography is shifting this fundamental relationship by refashioning the role of the user. This role (known in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC data model</a> as a “holder”) is made central to the ecosystem and, importantly, on equal footing with the issuers of identity-related information and the relying parties who require that data to support their applications and services.</p><p>The reframing of the user as a first-class citizen and their empowerment as ‘holder’ represents a shift towards a new paradigm. Such a paradigm offers users greater sovereignty of their own information and empowerment to manage their digital identity. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets are applications that allow an end user to manage their digital credentials and associated cryptographic keys. They allow users to prove identity-related information about themselves and, where it’s supported, choose to selectively disclose particular attributes of their credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Agents <p>When working with technology standards that are inherently decentralized, it’s important to establish a common context and consensus in our choice of terminology and language. Convergence on key terms that are being used to describe concepts within the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies allows participants to reach a shared understanding. Consequently, participating vendors are able to understand how they fit into the puzzle and interoperability between vendor implementations is made possible.</p><p>Through dedicated research and careful coordination with the broader technical community, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Project</a> at <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> offers a useful definition for both wallets and&nbsp;agents.</p><blockquote>Wallets<br>Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agents<br>An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>The two concepts are closely related, and are often used interchangeably. In short, the Glossary Project found that an agent is most commonly a piece of software that lets you work with and connect to wallets. Wallets can be simple, while agents tend to be more complex. Agents often need access to a wallet in order to retrieve credentials, keys, and/or messages that are stored&nbsp;there.</p><p>At MATTR, we tend to use the terms ‘digital wallet’ or simply ‘wallet’ to holistically describe the software that is utilized by end-users from within their mobile devices, web browsers, or other such user-controlled devices or environments. A digital wallet can be thought of as a kind of agent, though we try to make the distinction between the software that sits on a user’s device and the data managed and logic facilitated by a cloud-based platform in support of the wallet’s capabilities. We like the term ‘wallet’ because it is analogous to real-world concepts that by and large parallel the primary function of a wallet; to store and retrieve identity-related information.</p> User-centric Design <p>As end users have often found themselves the casualty of the information systems used by the modern web, there has been little opportunity to allow users to directly manage their data and negotiate what data they wish to withhold or disclose to certain parties. Under the new web of trust paradigm, the rights of the data subject are codified in standards, processes, and protocols guaranteeing the user the power to exercise agency. The interjection of the wallet to support end-users as data subjects on equal footing with issuers of identity information and relying parties provides an indispensable conduit and control point for this information that enables new opportunities for user-centric design.</p><p>The innovation in this area is only just beginning and there is no limit to the kinds of new experiences application developers can design and deliver to users. Some examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Allowing users to synchronize their data across multiple applications  Allowing users to self-attest to a piece of data or attest to data self-asserted by&nbsp;peers  Allowing a user to explicitly give consent around how their data may be&nbsp;used  Allowing users to revoke their consent for access to the continued use of and/or persistence of a particular piece of&nbsp;data  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to other verified users, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  Allowing users to opt-in to be discoverable to certain service providers and relying parties, provided they can mutually verify particular claims and attributes about themselves  <p>These are just a handful of the potential ways that developers can innovate to implement user-centric experiences. MATTR offers the tools necessary to create new kinds of wallet and authentication experiences for users and we’re excited to see what developers come up with when given the opportunity to create applications and services inspired by these new standards and technologies.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/learn-concepts-digital-wallets-c88318055e42">Learn Concepts: Digital Wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The original vision for the World Wide Web was an open platform on which everyone could freely communicate and access information. It was built on the decentralized architecture of the internet, used open standards, and functioned as an accessible platform that would inherit and amplify the fundamentally decentralized nature of the network that underpinned it.</p><p>However, the reality today has fallen far short of its founding vision. The modern internet is largely centralized and siloed. The vast majority of web traffic belongs to a few powerful corporations that control the distribution of data through platforms designed to selectively serve up information based on in-depth analysis of their users’ data. The lack of an identity system native to the internet over time has created an imbalance of power that erodes users’ digital&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Several decades after the web was introduced, most of us are now accustomed to widespread spam, fraud, abuse, and misinformation. We don’t have any real agency over how our data is used, and the corporations controlling our data have shown their inability to properly shoulder the responsibility that comes with it. We’re locked into this system, with no reasonable ability to opt&nbsp;out.</p><p>As a result, the modern internet has made it incredibly difficult to establish trust with others online, creating many barriers to participation that often leave everyday users out of the value chain. Information and data, and the value they create, are no longer freely accessible by the users creating it — most of whom are utterly unaware of the limited agency they have in accessing it. To fix this fundamental problem of digital trust, we need to begin by building a system that allows users to control their identities and to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p> Evolution of Digital&nbsp;Trust <p>The emerging “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust</a>” is an idea that has been around since the dawn of the internet. To explain what motivated its creation, let’s take a look at how trust on the internet functions today.</p><p>Though we may not always be aware, we rely on a basic form of security practically every day we use the internet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web, uses a common infrastructure based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a> to allow users to authenticate and access websites, and protect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">privacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity">integrity</a> of the data exchanged while in transit. It is used to establish trust on all types of websites, to secure accounts, and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing&nbsp;private.</p>Centralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This is all based on the usage of cryptographic keys, instead of passwords, to perform security and encryption. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication">securely communicate</a> on an insecure public network (the internet), and reliably verify the identity of users via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signatures">digital signatures</a>. It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.</p><p>The type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> currently used by the internet primarily relies on a hierarchical system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authorities (CAs)</a>, which are effectively third-parties that have been designated to manage identifiers and public keys. Virtually all internet software now relies on these authorities. Certificate authorities are responsible for verifying the authenticity and integrity of public keys that belong to a given user, all the way up to a ‘self-signed’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate">root certificate</a>. Root certifications are typically distributed with applications such as browsers and email clients. Applications commonly include over one hundred root certificates from dozens of PKIs, thereby bestowing trust throughout the hierarchy of certificates which lead back to them. The concept is that if you can trust the chain of keys, you can effectively establish secure communication with another entity with a reasonable level of assurance that you’re talking to the right&nbsp;person.</p><p>However, the reliance on certificate authorities creates a centralized dependency for practically all transactions on the internet that require trust. This primarily has to do with the fact that current PKI systems tightly control who gets to manage and control the cryptographic keys associated with certificates. This constraint means that modern cryptography is largely unusable for the average user, forcing us to borrow or ‘rent’ identifiers such as our email addresses, usernames, and website domains through systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, and social networks. And because we need these identities to communicate and transact online, we’re effectively beholden to these systems which are outside of our control. In addition, the usability challenges associated with current PKI systems mean that much of Web traffic today is unsigned and unencrypted, such as on major social networks. In other words, cryptographic trust is the backbone of all internet communications, but that trust rarely trickles down to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>A fully realized web of trust instead relies on self-signed certificates and third party attestations, forming the basis for what’s known as a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)</a>. DPKI returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to, bringing the power of cryptography to everyday users (we call this user-centric cryptography) by delegating the responsibility of public key management to secure decentralized datastores, so anyone and anything can start building trust on the&nbsp;web.</p> A Trust Layer for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The foundational technology for a new DPKI is a system of distributed identifiers for people, organizations, and things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a> are self-certifying identifiers that allow for distributed discovery of public keys. DIDs can be stored on a variety of different data registries, such as blockchains and public databases, and users can always be sure that they’re talking to the right person or entity because an identifier’s lookup value is linked to the most current public keys for that identifier. This creates a kind of even playing field where the standards and requirements for key management are uniform across different users in an ecosystem, from everyday users to large corporations and everything in&nbsp;between.</p>Decentralized PKI&nbsp;System<p>This will, in the first place, give users far greater control over the manner in which their personal data is being used by businesses, allowing them to tweak their own experience with services to arrive at that specific trade-off between convenience and data protection that best suits their individual requirements. But more importantly, it will allow users to continue to federate data storage across multiple services while still delivering the benefits that come from cross-platform data exchange. In other words, it gives them the ability to manage all their data in the same way while being able to deal with data differently depending on the context they are in. This also allows them to move their personal data freely from one online platform to another without losing access to the services they need, and without fear of vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Eventually, this will allow for portability not only of data but of the trust and reputation associated with the subjects of that data. For instance, a user might be able to transfer their reputation score from one ride-sharing service to another, or perhaps use the trust they’ve established in one context in another context entirely.</p><p>This emerging decentralized web of trust is being forged by a global community of developers, architects, engineers, organizations, hackers, lawyers, activists, and more working to push forward and develop web standards for things like credential exchange, secure messaging, secure storage, and trust frameworks to support this new paradigm.

<p>If you've been putting off setting aside some time to learn about OAuth, now is your chance!</p>

<p>Over the last year, I've helped thousands of developers learn about OAuth by hosting live workshops in person, online events through O'Reilly and Okta, as well as by publishing videos on YouTube! I'm super thrilled to announce that I just finished packaging up the workshop and have launched it as a new course, "<a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0</a>"!</p>

<p>The course is 3.5 hours of video content, quizzes, as well as interactive exercises with a guided learning tool to get you quickly up to speed on OAuth, OpenID Connect, PKCE, best practices, and tips for protecting APIs with OAuth.</p>

<p>The course is <a href="http://oauth.wtf/course">available now on Udemy</a>, and if your company has a Udemy for Business subscription you can find it there as well! If you download the app, you can even sync the video course to a mobile device to watch everything offline!</p>

<p><a href="http://oauth.wtf/course"></a></p>

<p>The exercises in the course will walk you through the various OAuth flows to set up an OAuth server, get an access token, use a refresh token, and learn the user's name and email with OpenID Connect. You can see a sneak peek of the tool that interactively helps you debug your apps at <a href="https://oauth.school/">oauth.school</a>.</p>

 Free OAuth Videos 

<p>I've also got a bunch of videos about OAuth available on YouTube for you to watch at any time! Take a look at my <a href="https://oauth.net/videos/">curated playlist of videos</a> where you'll find everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td00HpMI3Q8">live sketch notes</a> of a conversation about PKCE and OAuth security, to a description of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=espX8qKjywI">OAuth phishing</a>, to&nbsp;details on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHzERullHe8">why you shouldn't use the implicit flow</a>.</p>

FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) is quickly emerging as an important interoperability standard that enables users to select and manage an authenticator of their own (security keys, or built-in platform authenticators, such as a mobile device) that works with their web browser of choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, etc.) for secure access to any websites or applications that support the WebAuthn standard."<br><br>"Oracle is happy to announce the general availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn for our cloud identity service. This means that websites and applications that are protected by Oracle can enable their audience of users to authenticate with FIDO2 authenticators for multi-factor authentication (MFA) as well as passwordless authentication. This simplifies the user experience and may reduce the number of authenticators that users need to access the variety of web applications they interact with on a regular basis. Ultimately, this gives users more choice, more control, and a frictionless user experience.</p><p>Read more on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/">Oracle Cloud Security Blog</a> &gt; <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/oracle-strengthens-interoperability-with-fido2-webauthn-support-for-cloud-identity">Oracle Strengthens Interoperability and User Experience with General Availability of FIDO2 WebAuthn Support for Cloud Identity</a>.</p>

<p>The trust infrastructure is concerned with the question of how and why the presented information can be trusted. It defines the rules for all stakeholders and enables legally binding relationships with the combination of governance frameworks, which are built on top of trust frameworks.</p><p>But before we dive deeper into the part of the trust infrastructure, we need to understand the core components and the different types of identity architecture first.</p> Core components of identity architecture <p>There are three core components within an identity system, which in general mainly manage relationships. These are identifiers enabling the means for “remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship” <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">as explained by Phil Windley</a>. In the case of SSI, these are decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which are created by a controller, which might be a person, organization or software system. Controllers can use different authentication factors, which according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview=/40044784/40044786/Guidance%20on%20Levels%20of%20Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the level of assurance for eIDAS (CEF DIGITAL)</a>, can be possession-based factors (e.g. hardware), knowledge-based factors (e.g. keys or passwords) or inherent factors (e.g. biometrics like a fingerprint). Oftentimes a combination of different authentication factors is used to demonstrate the authority of an identifier.</p>Architectural types of identity systems; Image adapted, original by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil&nbsp;Windley</a><p>Phil Windley distinguishes between administrative, algorithmic and autonomic systems, which are illustrated in the image above. We are of course quite familiar with administrative systems such as e-mail, mobile or social network services. Algorithmic systems in contrast leverage some sort of distributed ledger as verified data registry to register a public key / decentralized identifier on a ledger. This gives the controller more sovereignty of the identifier among other perks. However, due to privacy concerns, keys or identifiers of individuals should not be stored on a publicly accessible database. Hence, autonomic identity architecture was developed to enable the “controller to use her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably [sic] sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log” as <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">Phil Windley states</a>. Current SSI implementations tend to use a combination of algorithmic and autonomic architecture.</p> Governance frameworks <p>The <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/governance.html">Business Dictionary</a> defines governance as the “establishment of policies, and continuous monitoring of their proper implementation, by the members of the governing body.” It includes the mechanisms required to balance powers and defines their primary duties to enhance the prosperity and viability of the organization. The objective for governance entities is to ensure the alignment of involved stakeholders, the definition of the implementation and the processes and use-cases executed on top of it. The purpose of a governance framework is to define the different stakeholders, determine their rights and duties as well as defining the policies under which the network is operated. Therefore, it serves as a legal foundation for the operation of the particular network. It consists of several legal documents, which are published by the governing authority.</p><p>The governance of the network (the verifiable data registry also referred to as ledger or trust anchor) itself is only a small part of the total governance required. According to the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP) foundation</a> there are four layers, which require an adapted governance framework matching the needs of the particular layer.</p>The Trust over IP (ToIP) Stack; Image source: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a><p>As illustrated in the figure above, the Trust over IP stack is not only separated in layers, but also in technical and governance stacks within the layers. The stack is indented to provide the certainty for higher levels that the underlying ones can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Layer one includes the verifiable data registries, which can be implemented on different technology frameworks. The Sovrin Foundation is an example of a governance authority, which published a <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-%20content/uploads/Sovrin-Governance-Framework-V2-Master-Document-V2.pdf">governance framework for layer one</a>. Other public utilities include <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and <a href="https://bedrockconsortium.org/">Bedrock</a> among others. While the mentioned networks align their efforts particularly to the ToIP stack there are countless others, which can be used as a public utility as the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID specification registry</a> discloses. These range from generic public permissionless networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin to networks with permissioned write access, which serve a particular use-case.</p><p>Tim Bouma (Senior policy analyst for identity management at the treasury board secretariat of Canada) does not see the need of the government to build and operate a verifiable data registry and highlights the importance of a plurality of operators. However, he points out that the involvement and participation of governments is crucial in defining how the infrastructure is used and relied on as stated in a <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">personal interview</a>.</p>DID methods as specified in the W3C DID specification registry.<p>The second layer describes the communication between agents. Within the ToIP stack, this communication is indented to be executed via a hybrid of an algorithmic and atomic architecture such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/peer-did-method-spec">peer DIDs</a> or KERI implementations of self-certifying identifiers as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-%20identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">described by Ph.D. Samuel M. Smith</a>. This means that publicly resolvable DIDs are used for public entities and private peer DIDs for individuals. The following illustration provided by <a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a> provides an overview of these interactions.</p>SSI interactions and the usage of public and peer DIDs; Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/">Lissi</a><p>However, not all SSI implementations use peer DIDs. For instance, the <a href="https://ssi-ambassador.medium.com/essif-the-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-4572f6875e12">ESSIF</a>-MVP1 does not currently use peer DIDs but might add them later as deemed appropriate according to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITALEBSI/Technical+Specification+%282%29+-+DID+Modelling">technical specification of DID modelling</a>. Hence, the same type of DID is used for both issuer and holder. The governing authority of layer two is highly dependent on the communication protocols used by the implementation in question. For implementations, which use peer DIDs according to the DIDcomm protocol the governing entity is the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDcomm working group at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Both layer one and layer two define technical or rather cryptographic trust, in contrast to layer three and four, which define human&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Layer three protocols support the exchange of data such as verified credentials with different types of signatures, which enable a holder to create verifiable presentations as explained in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/README.md">ToIP Aries-RFC</a>. It states that one of the goals of the ToIP Foundation is “to standardize all supported credential exchange protocols so that any ToIP-compatible agent, wallet, and secure data store can work with any other agent, wallet, and secure data store.” An issuer can issue any set of claims to any holder, which can then prove them to any verifier. The verifier can decide, which issuers and which claims it&nbsp;trusts.</p><p>Layer four of the stack defines the rules for a particular digital trust ecosystem such as healthcare, finance, food products, education etc. These are led by a governance authority, which already exists or is established for this particular purpose. It consists of a variety of different stakeholders such as business entities, government agencies, individuals or other interested parties. These ecosystem frameworks also define the semantics of verified credentials. The semantic of a verified credential defines, which attributes are part of it and their meaning in the particular context. If you want to join an existing ecosystem or want to know more about their work you can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">public ToIP confluence documentary hub&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Trust frameworks <p>A trust framework sets the overall legal framework for digital interactions. These trust frameworks are technology agnostic and are uniquely adapted to the jurisdiction they serve. They set the rules for the recognition of electronic identification and authentication and specify the requirements to achieve a certain level of assurance (LoA).</p><p>The combination of the different governance frameworks as illustrated in the ToIP stack is sometimes also referred to as trust framework. However, jurisdictions have their own requirements for electronic authentication, which serve as the underlying trust framework. In the case of Europe, the eIDAS regulation clearly defines the requirements for authentication factors to achieve a certain level of assurance. For instance, to achieve the LoA substantial, two factors are necessary. According to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents?preview%20=%2F40044784%2F40044786%2FGuidance+on+Levels+of+Assurance.docx">Guidance for the application of the LoA</a> published by the CEF Digital, one out of the two factors needs to be&nbsp;either:</p><blockquote>I) a presentation of an identity document or <br>II) verification of the possession of evidence representing the claimed identity recognized by a member state or <br>III) a previous procedure executed by the same member state not related to the issuance of electronic identification, which provides the equivalent assurance or <br>IV) presenting a valid notified electronic identification mean with the LoA substantial or&nbsp;high.</blockquote><p>While these requirements can in theory also be defined in a governance framework, the incorporation of such requirements into statutory law facilitates the creation and enforcement of legally binding relationships. Hence, existing statutory law (or case-law depending on the jurisdiction) needs to be incorporated by different governance frameworks to achieve a holistic approach and enforce legal liability.</p><p>According to Tim Bouma as one of the main contributor to the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) these frameworks intertwine and complement each other <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">as stated in a personal interview</a>. He suggests that policymakers have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts to evaluate if they have the right concepts to build out a suitable framework and regulation. The PCTF “is not a ‘standard’ as such, but is, instead, a framework that relates and applies existing standards, policies, guidelines, and practices, and where such standards and policies do not exist, specifies additional criteria. It’s a tool to help assess a digital identity program that puts into effect the relevant legislation, policy, regulation, and agreements between parties.” <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_1/PSP-PCTF-V1.1-Consultation-Draft.pdf">PCTF&nbsp;V1.1</a></p><p>While the eIDAS regulation itself aims to be technology agnostic there are some aspects, which complicate the adherence of the regulation for SSI implementations. However, this is a topic for its own article. In the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2020-04/SSI_eIDAS_legal_report_final_0.pdf">eIDAS SSI legal report</a>, Dr. Ignacio Alamillo Domingo describes the potential shift of the eIDAS regulation as trust framework on Page 22 as followed: „Adopting the SSI principles imply, generally speaking, an increased complexity in trust management and a shifting from hierarchical or federated trust assurance frameworks (…) to network-based socio- reputational trust models or accumulative trust assurance frameworks that use quantifiable methods to aggregate trust on claims and digital identities.” Hence, we can already observe the suggestions and considerations to adapt the regulation to suit new innovative solutions.</p> Key takeaways:   Governance frameworks and trust frameworks need to be combined to form a holistic approach.  Governance frameworks of SSI implementations need to respect the requirements and specifications of trust frameworks of the jurisdiction in which use-cases with regulatory obligations are carried&nbsp;out.  Regulators need to evaluate existing regulations concerning electronic identification and authentication and their suitability with new identity architecture.  Governments should engage with the public sector to collaboratively explore the requirements for a legally binding trust infrastructure.  <p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

users first.
Despite all the good intents and ambitions of those who have done
founding work in these spaces, this perspective tends to get
increasingly pushed to the wayside as engineers are pressured to shift
their focus on the needs of their immediate employers and large
implementors.
I'm not saying that's bad; sometimes this even does help advance the
interest of users too, but... well we all know the ways in which it
can end up not doing so.
And I don't know about you, but the internet and the web have felt an
awful lot at times like they've been slipping from those early ideals.
Amy's platform shares in a growing zeitgeist (sadly, still in the
wispiest of stages) of thinking and reframing from the perspective of
user empowerment, privacy, safety, agency, autonomy.
Amy's platform reminds me of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8890">RFC 8890: The Internet Is For End Users</a>.
That's a perspective shift we desperately need right now... for the
internet and the web both.</p>
<p>That's all well and good for the philosophical-alignment angle.
But what about the "Technical" letter in TAG?
Amy's standing there is rock-solid.
And I know because I've had the pleasure of working side-by-side
with Amy on several standards (including
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>, of which we are
co-authors.</p>
<p>Several times I watched with amazement as Amy and I talked about some
changes we thought were necessary and Amy just got in the zone, this
look of intense hyperfocus (really, someone should record the Amy Spec
Editing Zone sometime, it's quite a thing to see), and they refactored
huge chunks of the spec to match our discussion.
And Amy knows, and deeply cares, about so many aspects of the W3C's
organization and structure.</p>
<p>So, if you can vote for, or know how to get your organization to vote
for, an AC rep... well, I mean do what you want I guess, but if you
want someone who will help... for great justice, vote Amy Guy to the
W3C TAG!</p>

   <p></p><p>I have been pondering on these topics for a while&nbsp; “Can AI have feelings?”&nbsp; “Should AI have emotion?”&nbsp; What would it mean for AI to be curious? <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/05/in-context-of-ai-can-dog-feel.html">I posted, can a dog feel disappointment?</a> Exploring our attachment to the projection of feelings. &nbsp; I have written an executive brief about how a “<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2019/09/as-executive-investor-or-board-member.html">board should frame AI” here</a>.</p><p>The majority of the debates/ arguments I read and hear centre on either creating the algorithms for the machine to know what we know or for the data to be in a form that allows the machine to learn from us.&nbsp; A key point in all the debates is that we (humanity) should control and it should look like us. The framing of a general rule for emotional AI is that it mimics us. However, I want to come at AI feelings from a different perspective based on my own experience, one where AI creates feelings by its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>I am on several neurodiverse scales; this means my mind is wired differently, and I am so pleased it is. My unique wiring gives me the edge in innovation, creativity, connecting diverse topics, sense-making and deep-insights.&nbsp; For thirty year,s I have remained working on concepts that become the mainstream ten years later.</p><p>As a specific area to develop my own view about AI and what it (the AI) should feel, I am running with an easy to identify with topic, empathy. &nbsp; Empathy is not something that comes naturally to me, and therefore I have had to learn it, it has been taught, and I am still not great at it.&nbsp; For the vast majority of humans, I am sure it is built-in.&nbsp; Now that might mean that those who have it built in just know how to learn it or that it really is built-in, but right now we don’t know.&nbsp; However, along with other humans, I find face-recognition (<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/face-blindness/">face blindness</a>) very hard. As a community, we learn coping strategies, along with spelling, language and the correct emotional response - empathy.&nbsp; My Twitter bio says that “I am highly skilled at being inappropriately optimistic,” which means I know don’t always read empathy very well.&nbsp; For me, empathy is a very definitely a learnt response; if I had not learnt it, I expect life might be very different.</p><p>Here is the point, now you know I have had to learn empathy specifically, what does it mean?&nbsp; Does it mean I am a robot or a machine? Does it mean I am less trustworthy?&nbsp; Is my empathy less valued than someone else’s empathy? Am I less human?</p><p>On an AI call the other day, I was articulating this personal story in response to the idea that all humans know how to respond and if we teach or create the ability for a machine to learn empathy it can never be human (a baseline response).&nbsp; My point was how it is the machine learning any different to me. Indeed we all have to learn something.&nbsp; However, we somehow feel that certain emotions and characteristics are natural and not learnt/ taught behaviours - they are not.&nbsp; Once we grasp this we have a real problem as our easy response to learnt response is genuine, we have removed a big part of the rejection of the concept from the debate, and we have to re-ask can a machine feel empathy or curious?</p><p>We have a stack of words allowing humans to articulate both feeling and emotions, the former being fast and driven by the chemistry of enzymes, proteins and hormones and the latter being the higher-order response created in the mind and nerves (brain chemistry). We try to separate these functions, but in reality, they are all linked in a complex web with our DNA, last meal, illness, inflation, time, experience, memory and microbiome to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>We are human and are built on a base of carbon.&nbsp; There is evidence why carbon was selected naturally as the nature of the bonds makes it uniquely stable and reactive. Carbon is fantastic as in bonding with other elements allowing electronics to move, which enabled the creation energy (ATP), signalling and life in the form we know it.&nbsp; However, carbon is a chemical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substrate">substrate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s phrase the question as “Can carbon can be curious?&nbsp; Can carbon have empathy?&nbsp; Can carbon have feelings? Can carbon have emotions?&nbsp; What carbon understands as curious, is unique to carbon, what carbon thinks is empathy, is unique to carbon. What carbon grasps as emotion, is unique to carbon. We have created a language to articulate these concepts to each other, we have labelled them, but they are uniquely carbon-based.&nbsp; They may even be uniquely species-based.</p><p>AI will be built on a substrate, it will most likely not be carbon, but it will be an element that has the right properties. Have to confess I am not really sure what they are right now. Here is the point.&nbsp; AI will have empathy; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will have curiosity; it will not be ours. AI will have emotions; it will not be ours.&nbsp; AI will likely use different words to describe what is means by being curious and will not parallel or map to our view.&nbsp; If it is learnt, does it matter - I had to learn, and that doesn’t make me less human!</p><p>Our carbon form defines to be alive as to use reproduction and adaption such that our species can escape death, which is a fundamental limitation of our carbon structure. Because of this requirement to escape death, what we think is curious is wrapped up in the same framing.&nbsp; An AI built on a different substrate that does not have to escape death as it has worked out how to secure power. This is 101 of asking an AI to do anything as it needs to ensure it can do it, and that requires energy.&nbsp; Therefore the AI will have a different set of criteria as not bound by escaping death and therefore what it thinks is curious will not be aligned to our framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We do this a lot.&nbsp; With other living things, humans, pets and even our Gods, we think they think like us that they have the same ideas and concepts of empathy, justice, value, purpose and love.&nbsp; Our limits of emotional concepts mean we cannot see past the paradox they create because we are limited to our own framing and understanding.&nbsp; We have to drop the restrictions and boundaries of an idea that AI will replicate us, our language, our knowledge, our methods or our approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AI will be “Different Intelligence” and because it leant not from us buy by itself, does that make it less intelligent?&nbsp;</p><br>

<p>今年もお世話になった皆様へ。 2020年は新型コロナ下の独立開業となり、どうなることかと思いましたが、なんとか年末を迎えることができました。ひとえに皆様のおかげでございます。未だにコロナが猛威を振るう中、ご挨拶の曲として何を選ぶかだいぶ思い悩みましたが、皆様に心安らかに新年をむかえていただきたく、J.S.バッハの「羊は安らかに草を食み」を選びました。 この曲は、1713年にバッハがザクセン=ワイセンベルク公クリスチャンの31歳の誕生祝いのために書いた曲で、「狩りのカンタータ」BWV 208 の第9曲にあたります。日本ではNHKラジオ番組『朝のバロック』のテーマ曲だったのでご存知の方も多いでしょう。19世紀のバッハ・リバイバル以来様々なアレンジで楽しまれていますが、元来はソプラノと２台のリコーダーと通奏低音という、衝撃的にシンプルなアレンジを施されたアリアです。 歌詞はこんな感じです。 羊飼いが上手く守るとき、 羊は安らかに草を食む。 指導者が善政を敷くとき、 人々も安寧に過ごし、 国々に幸せをもたらす。 激動の歳の瀬、日米ともにあらたなリーダーを迎えるなか、神の子羊の生誕祭を前にお届けするのにこれ以上ふさわしい曲があるでしょうか。 今回の演奏は、ソプラノパートをフルート(Altus 1407RE)、リコーダパートと通奏低音をピアノ(Yamaha C2X Chippendale)、加えて通奏低音としてスピネット（東海スピネット）・マリンバ（Korogi LV2400CC）が参加する四重奏によってお届けします。いずれも美しい楽器で、最後に４台の楽器全部が今年にふさわしい形でお目見えしますので、ぜひおわりまで見ていただければと思います。 このビデオが皆様に、安らかなひとときをお届けできますように。</p>The post <a href="https://www.sakimura.org/2020/12/4766/">季節のご挨拶〜J.

If they frame a story in a familiar way you are going to accept their tried and tested approach.&nbsp; You have accepted that the old worked and was true so applying it again must make sense. &nbsp; This saves brain energy and learning time and it is why we love heuristics.&nbsp; We have outsourced thinking and just accept it without considering.  <br> <p></p><p></p><br><p>However,&nbsp; this overly simplistic movement from one level to another level should be reconsidered in a wider systems approach where one can look at the order of the response (first, second, third and higher)&nbsp; Below is a graph showing the different order of responses to an input stimulus to force a change in the output to a new level. &nbsp; The black line is overdamped and takes a long time to get to the new level (normal.)&nbsp; The green line is the fastest with no over-shot.&nbsp; The red is faster but has a small overshot and needs correction.

Lots of red tape, compliance, law, committees, proof that added lag or a dampening effect creating a delay. &nbsp; Many companies in response to a disruption or change are closer to the red response line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, we are now in a long tail of oscillation response from the government to COVID19.&nbsp; Lockdown, flareup, lockdown, conspiracy, rules, new rules, more lockdown, fire-break, ignore, flareup, capacity issues, vaccine, distribution and logistic reality, new variants and more issues to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Gartner and McKinsey’s graphs are based on the historical acceptance of the old black and red lines of response, slow from government, faster from companies with an overshoot needing correction.&nbsp; Society would get to the new place after the stimulus but we went through, as Gartner or McKinsey described the different phases. &nbsp; The original Gartner team to their credit unlocked great insight and it became the bedrock observation of diffusion and reaction.</p><p>However. I am not sure that their old model works with with the new oscillating response system we have right now.&nbsp; @Gartner &amp; @McKinsey it might be time to rethink the model and please can we aim for a better normal not a new normal.&nbsp;</p>

     The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history</a> provides an exciting context for thinking about the struggle between belief and power and where next. <br><p></p><br><p>We are using this to considering the macroeconomics of where we are right now going into 2021. I am taking a view for North America and Eurozone.&nbsp; This viewpoint is certainly not valid for the Middle East, Africa, South America, Russia and most of Asia.&nbsp; I would love to read the same commentary from some in those regions.</p><p>The observation is, where are we in the Tytler cycle?&nbsp; I would propose for North America and Eurozone we are spread from liberty (the 1950 baby boomers) and dependence (massive increase in numbers due to COVID19 who are now dependent on a state.) &nbsp; The majority in our society are in the Selfishness, (I am an individual and have rights) and Complacency&nbsp; (my tiny footprint can only have a small impact on the climate and I cannot make a difference on the global stage).&nbsp; Whilst liberty was c.1800’s and Abundance was c.1950 they are still very much prevalent in thinking due to education, societies structure and social class movements.&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context for me is where next for automation and decision making towards #AI.&nbsp; I love the Arther C Clarke quote that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” I sense that the majority of us in NA and Euro are in the selfishness and complacency - which means we believe that I the individuals rights trump societies broader rights.&nbsp; “I will not give up my freedoms that others have fought and died for!”&nbsp; Power and agency are resting with the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have created below a circular tussle between belief and power as they dominate thinking as times change.&nbsp; AI is on route to being magic, which might close this long historic cycle as we start again.&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p>Belief and Power</p><p>Belief, in this example, is where society has a common on a shared belief in something and that this deity, idol common belief cannot exist without a shared belief.&nbsp; Power, in this case, is in the vacuum of belief someone/ something can use belief as a tool to gain power and keep control using power.&nbsp;</p><p>History has taught us that shared beliefs give power to royalty (consider influencers, celebrities conspiracy or take a belief to enable control) from which nation-states can rise as they wrestle with too much power resting in so few.&nbsp; From the vacuum emerges new shared beliefs. Note: a shared belief being that it will not exist without everyone believing (money, law, companies).&nbsp; Individuals come to gain individual powers from this shared belief system.&nbsp; Humanity seeks out purpose and finds a way for a complex judgment to be made, and thereby creating a way for something else to be held accountable for the randomness of the outcome.&nbsp; And so we repeat.</p><p>Where we stand, because of COVID19, there will be a negotiation between citizens and their government as governments have stepped into maintaining economic activity and survival.&nbsp; The negotiation between citizens and government will be a barter for rights, freedoms, power, control and sovereignty.&nbsp; #BREXIT puts in an interesting spin on it.&nbsp; We might not like the idea of bondage in the 21st century, but since many nation-states will have a view that its citizens owed it something for stepping in - we should call it for what it is, you might prefer tax.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a breath for a second.&nbsp; Right now, we are focussed on more productivity and more efficiency, which is centring on more automation.&nbsp; The “future of work” is a much-debated topic due to the known increase in automation.&nbsp; We are starting to ask ourselves who gave permission to the automated processes, does it ask for forgiveness when it goes wrong and who is responsible for explaining what our love for automation is doing. &nbsp; We are automating both internal and ecosystem dependent processes.&nbsp; This is fast taking us from algorithm automation to machine learning automation to Artificial Intelligence controlling systems that may become sovereign.&nbsp;</p><p>When the context of the cycle of power and belief is combined with&nbsp; #AI, it creates an interesting dynamic.&nbsp; We are about to head into for the next 20 to 30 years, and the emergence of a new movement to create a new shared belief.&nbsp; Are we about to outsource complex decisions on climate to a new shared belief, that says the hardship is worth suffering for the common good?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2020 was ****,&nbsp; 2021 might be equally as bad, however, 2030 will be a lot harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<p><a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC) is a hugely popular user authentication and identity protocol on the web today. It enables relying parties to verify the identity of their users and obtain basic profile information about them in order to create an authenticated user experience.</p><p>In typical deployments of OpenID Connect today, in order for a user to be able to exercise the identity they have with a relying party, the relying party must be in direct contact with what’s known as the OpenID Provider (OP). OpenID Providers are responsible for performing end-user authentication and issuing end-user identities to relying parties. This effectively means that an OpenID Provider is the Identity Provider (IdP) of the&nbsp;user.</p>In today’s OpenID Connect implementations, the Identity Provider mediates on behalf of the&nbsp;user<p>It’s the reason we often see buttons that say “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook” during the login journey in an application or service. The website or application you want to use must first authenticate who you are with a provider like Google or Facebook which controls and manages that identity on your behalf. In this context we can think of the IdP as the “man in the middle.” This relationship prevents users from having a portable digital identity which they can use across different contexts and denies users any practical control over their identity. It also makes it incredibly easy for IdPs like Google or Facebook to track what users are doing, because the “man in the middle” can gather metadata about user behavior with little agency over how this identity data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>In order to allow users to have practical control over their identity, we need a new approach.</p><p>Introducing <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, an extension to OpenID Connect which enables the end-user to request credentials from an OpenID Provider and manage their own credentials in a digital wallet. This specification defines how an OpenID Provider can be extended beyond being the provider of simple identity assertions into being the provider of credentials, effectively turning these Identity Providers into Credential Providers.</p>OIDC Credential Provider allows the user to manage their own credentials<p>To maximize the reuse of existing infrastructure that’s deployed today, OIDC Credential Provider extends the core OpenID Connect protocol, maintaining the original design and intent of OIDC while enhancing it without breaking any of its assumptions or requirements.</p><p>Instead of using OIDC to provide simple identity assertions directly to the relying party, we can leverage OIDC to offer a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) which is cryptographically bound to a digital wallet of the end-users choice. The digital wallet plays the role of the OpenID Client application which is responsible for interacting with the OpenID Provider and manages the cryptographic key material (both public and private keys) used to prove ownership of the credential. The credentials issued to the wallet are re-provable and reusable for the purposes of authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-related information by providers and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the user-controlled “wallet” layer between issuers and relying&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, a wallet makes a request to an OpenID provider in order to obtain a credential, and then receives the credential back into their wallet so they can later use it to prove their identity to relying parties. The interaction consists of three main&nbsp;steps:</p>  The Client sends a signed credential request to the OpenID Provider with their public&nbsp;key  The OpenID Provider authenticates and authorizes the End-User to access the credential  The OpenID Provider responds to the Client with the issued&nbsp;VC  <p>In this new flow, the credential request extends the typical OpenID Connect request in that it expresses the intent to ask for something beyond the identity token of a typical OIDC flow. Practically, what this means is that the client uses a newly defined scope to indicate the intent of the request. The Client also extends the standard OIDC Request object to add cryptographic key material and proof of possession of that key material so that the credential can be bound to the wallet requesting it. Though the credential can be bound to a public key by default, it can also support different binding mechanisms, e.g. the credential can optionally be bound to a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifer</a> (DID). In binding to a DID, the subject of the credential is able to maintain ownership of the credential on a longer life cycle due to their ability to manage and rotate keys while maintaining a consistent identifier. This eases the burden on data authorities to re-issue credentials when keys change and allows relying parties to verify that the credential is always being validated against the current public key of the end-user.</p><p>The request can also indicate the format of the requested credential and even ask for specific claims present within the credential. This is designed to allow multiple credential formats to be used within the OIDC&nbsp;flow.</p><p>On the provider side, OpenID Connect Providers are able to advertise which capabilities they support within the OIDC ecosystem using OpenID Connect Provider Metadata. This approach extends the metadata to support additional fields that express support for binding to DIDs, for issuing VCs, and advertising which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a>, credential formats, credentials, and claims they are offering. This information can be utilized by the end-user’s digital wallet to help the user understand whether or not they wish to proceed with a credential request.</p><p>In order to create a way for the wallet or client to connect to the OpenID Provider, the spec also defines a URL which functions as a Credential Offer that the client can invoke in order to retrieve and understand the types of credential being offered by the provider. The client registers the ‘openid’ URI scheme in order to be able to understand and render the offer to the user so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>The sum of these changes means that OpenID Connect can allow users to have a portable digital identity credential that’s actually under their control, creating an opportunity for greater agency in digital interactions as well as preventing identity providers from being able to easily track user behavior. The OpenID Connect Credential Provider <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">specification</a> is in the process of being contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item at the A/B Working Group, where it will continue to be developed by the community behind OpenID&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>MATTR is pleased to announce that our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/extensions/oidc-bridge">OIDC Bridge Platform Extension</a> now uses OIDC Credential Provider under the hood to facilitate issuing credentials with OpenID Connect. OIDC Bridge hides the complexity associated with setting up infrastructure for credential issuance and simply requires configuration of a standard OpenID Provider. We also simplify the process of verifying credentials issued over OIDC Credential Provider by allowing the wallet to respond to requests, present credentials, and prove ownership and integrity of their credentials via&nbsp;OIDC.</p>OIDC Bridge is an Extension to the MATTR&nbsp;Platform<p>This new set of capabilities allows OpenID Providers greater flexibility around which claims end up in a credential, and allows for the support of many different credential types with a straight-forward authentication journey for end-users.</p><p>Our Mobile Wallet supports the ability to invoke credential offers using OIDC Credential Provider as well as creating credential requests and receiving credentials from an OpenID Provider.</p><p>To find out more, check out our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/oidc-bridge/issue-oidc">tutorials</a> on MATTR Learn, read the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">spec</a>, or watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2WPwotNArI">recording</a> of our presentation on this spec from the recent Internet Identity Workshop.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">Introducing OIDC Credential Provider</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    This article explores why senior leaders need to develop skills to see past big noticeable loud noises and uncover small signals if we want to be part of a Board who makes the challenging judgment calls. <p>Prof Brian Cox said during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZorLUKe4Jg">opening keynote at Innotribe/ SIBOS 2019</a>, give or take a bit; “if you cannot find it in nature, it is not natural.”&nbsp; This got me thinking about how choice is created and then have we make decisions and judgement.&nbsp; How humans choose, decide and make complex judgement draws heavily on psychology and the behavioural sciences. Alongside judgement, I have a polymath interest in quantum mechanics, microbiome and consciousness. I was relaxing and watching “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000b1v2">His Dark Materials</a>” which it turns out was worth hanging in for and had finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible">Stuart Russels “Human Compatible”</a> and <a href="http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~rovelli/">Carlo Rovelli</a> “The Order of Time”.&nbsp; Then whilst <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p086tg3k/the-physics-that-suggests-we-have-no-free-will">watching this mini-series on the BBC about free will</a> this article emerged.&nbsp; Choice has a prediction that you have agency and can choose or make a decision. But how is choice possible when the foundations that we are built on/ from does not have a choice?&nbsp; Can data give us a choice?</p><p>----</p><p>Decision:&nbsp; The action or process of deciding something or of resolving a question. A decision is an act of or need for making up one’s mind. Whereas Choice: Is an act of choosing between two or more possibilities. It requires a right, agency, or opportunity to choose.</p><p>The origins of the two words add context. The word decision comes from “cutting off” while choice comes from “to perceive.” Therefore a decision is more about process orientation, meaning we are going through analysis and steps to eliminate or cut off options. With choice, it is more of an approach, meaning there is a perception of what the outcome of a particular choice may be. Because of this, let’s run with choice rather than a decision.&nbsp;</p><br><p>A Decision is about going through analysis and steps to eliminate or cut off options. Choice is an approach, meaning there is a perception of what the outcome may be.&nbsp;</p> Does energy have a choice? <p>We are using energy as represented by a magnet field.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Two magnets, north and south. Irrespective of position, they have to attract. Do they have a choice?&nbsp;</p><p>Three magnets north, north, south. &nbsp; They have a more complicated relationship as of position and distance now matter as they influence the actual outcome. But there is no choice; the rules define the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>At the majority of starting positions for the three magnets, there is only one outcome as such choice is predetermined. However, there are several situations when many magnets are sufficiently far apart and that there are only small forces at play (far-field). In this case, the result of movement may appear to be more random between possible outcomes. Any specific outcome is based on an unseen small momentary influence. The more magnets exerting small forces, the more random a positional change or choice may appear, as the level of complexity of the model increases beyond the rational.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, at a simple model of say three magnets, there is no choice. Whereas in a complicated model, with many magnets, it would appear that a degree of randomness or chaos is introduced (entropy).&nbsp; The simple model does not exist in nature as it is impossible to remove small signals even if they are hidden because of large-close forces.&nbsp; The point is that at this level of abstraction, energy itself does not have a choice, and the outcome is predictable, as there indeed a fixed number of possible outcomes, which can be modelled.</p><p>Stick with me here; we are exploring something that we don’t often want to face up to as leaders; we do not make decisions that we are accountable and responsible for, as there is no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Expanding as there are only three fundamental forces of energy, each governed by their own rules.</p><p>Gravity. There is only one kind of charge: mass/energy, which is always attractive. There’s no upper limit to how much mass/energy you can have, as the worst you can do is create a black hole, which still fits into our theory of gravity. Every quantum of energy, whether it has a rest mass (like an electron) or not (like a photon), curves the fabric of space, causing the phenomenon we perceive as gravitation. If gravitation turns out to be quantum in nature, there’s only one quantum particle, the graviton, required to carry the gravitational force. Based on maths and models, gravity suggests there is no choice as it is always attractive.&nbsp; However, as we know from our study, of say, our galaxy the Milkyway, a single force introduces many patterns and an appearance of randomness. But with enough observations and data, it can be modelled, it is predictable.</p><p>Electromagnetism.&nbsp; A fundamental force that readily appears on macroscopic scales gives us a little more basic variety. Instead of one type of charge, there are two: positive and negative electric charges. Like charges repel; opposite charges attract. Although the physics underlying electromagnetism is very different in detail than the physics underlying gravitation, its structure is still straightforward in the same way that gravitation is. You can have free charges, of any magnitude, with no restrictions, and there’s only one particle required (the photon) to mediate all the possible electromagnetic interactions.&nbsp; Based on maths and models, there is no choice. However, as we know from our study of, say, light waves, we get many patterns and an appearance of randomness.&nbsp;</p><p>The strong nuclear force is one of the most puzzling features of the universe.&nbsp; The rules become fundamentally different. Instead of one type of charge (gravitation) or even two (electromagnetism), there are three fundamental charges for the strong nuclear force. Inside every proton or neutron-like particle, there are at least three quark and antiquark combinations, but how many is unknown as the list keeps growing.&nbsp; Gluons are the particles that mediate the strong force, and then it gets messy.&nbsp; It is worth noting that we don’t have the maths or a model, but it appears that there is still ultimately no choice as you cannot have a net charge of any type, but how it balances is well beyond me. &nbsp; However, as we know from our study at CERN using the Large Hadron Collider, the strong nuclear force is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum">quantum </a>in nature and has a property that means it only exists when observed.&nbsp;</p><p>In nature, we have one, two or many forces, and each can create structure and randomness but can anything in nature truly make a choice or decision?</p> Extending, does information have a choice? <p>Two magnets, north and south, but information now defines distance and strength.&nbsp; Therefore information determines that there can only be one outcome. The observer knowing the information can only ever observe the single outcome — three magnets sort of facing off:&nbsp; north, north, south. &nbsp; A complicated relationship but position, distance and field strength are known; therefore, the outcome can be modelled and predicted.</p><p>Further, we can now move to a dynamic model where each of the magnets rotates and moves during the period. What happens when information includes the future probability position of the magnets.&nbsp; Does information enable the magnets not to move right now, as they know from information that it is not worth doing as it will not change the outcome and could conserve energy? (This being a fundamental law of thermodynamics.)</p><p>However, as with unpacking the onion, this is overly simplistic as gravity and electromagnetism are defined and bounded by the “Laws of Relativity and Thermodynamics”.” In contrast, the strong nuclear force is defined and bounded by the Laws of Quantum.&nbsp; Gravity and electromagnetism are deterministic in nature as there is no choice as per the laws. The interaction of a complex system can make something look random, but when removed from time and point observation, the laws define the pattern. Whereas the strong nuclear force being quantum means we don’t know its state until we observe it, which fully supports chaos/ randomness and perhaps something closer to being presented with a choice, aka free will.&nbsp; It is not so much you can do anything, more than you can pick between states rather than just a defined or a predetermined flow from start to this point bounded by the foundational laws of relativity.&nbsp;</p><p>Does information have a quantum property? Insomuch that it is only when the observer looks and can act, does it become that state? Think carefully about this in a context of bias.&nbsp;</p><p>Can information or knowledge enable choice?</p><p>Does information require energy as if so, does the very nature of an informational requirement changes the outcome? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a>.) Can something determine that to minimise energy expenditure it should wait as a better less energy requirement with the better outcome that will come by later?&nbsp; How would the information know to make that decision or choice? What rule would it be following?</p><p>We are asking that, based on information, the general rules are ignored.&nbsp; This idea means we would step over the first outcome or requirement, preferring to take a later option.&nbsp; Has information now built an experience which feeds into knowledge? But what is information in this context? Consider the colour of petals or leaves in autumn. Science reveals that colour is a derivative of visible light. A red leaf reflects wavelengths longer than those of a green leaf. Colour is a property not of the leaf but how the leaf interacts with light and also the eye and how we then determine how we will describe it as a common sound (words). Assuming the observer has the right level of vitamin C and brain structure - which all adds further dimensions. What we think of as intrinsic properties (information) of the world are merely effects of multiple causes coinciding, many small signals. Reality, in this sense, is not so much physical things, but interactions and flow.&nbsp; The same applies to touch and smell.&nbsp;</p><p>intrinsic properties (information) are merely effects of multiple causes coinciding</p><p>Remember we are asking how we get to make a choice, based on the idea that if it does not appear in nature, it is probably not natural.&nbsp; Have we convinced ourselves that complexity creates free-will?</p> Free-will, can you make a decision? <p>Reflecting on the title question. Is the data presented to you, enabling a real choice? &nbsp;Given that choice and free-will have a predication, that you have agency and can choose or decide, then we have a&nbsp; 2nd question. How is free-will possible when the foundations (energy types) you are building on does not appear to create choice?&nbsp; Yes, the appearance of randomness, yes only exists on observation - but does that create choice?</p><p>We have to admire those tiny signals which present themselves as choices at scale, as nothing has an overall significant effect. Everything has a flow. Does this lack of dominant signal create an illusion of free-will or ability to make a choice?&nbsp; When the signals are big, loud and noisy, drawing out small signals - is choice taken away?</p> Executive leadership <p>In the context of leadership, it is not that we are programmed, but is it that great leaders are highly tuned, and responsive to small signals that most of us don’t know are there because we are too busy or following instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>Leadership demands access to small signals to be able to exercise judgment. However is our love of traffic light dashboards, summaries, 1-minute overviews, elevator pitches, priorities, urgency, fast meetings, short pitches, executive summaries and KPI’s creating management signals that are driven by data which can only focus on the priority loud, noisy signals?&nbsp; The more layers and filters that data passes through both smaller signals are lost, and there is an increasing loudness to one path, no decision and removal of choice.&nbsp;</p><p>Does prominent signal notification mean we reduce our leadership's sensitivity only to see the obvious?&nbsp; The same leadership we then blame for not sensing the market signals, or not being responsive, nor following their lead when they do!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Decisions (choice) or judgement <p>Human brains are constructed or wired to create and discover patterns, to which we ascribe meaning and learning.&nbsp; Signals help us form and be informed about forming and changes in patterns and how they align or otherwise to a previous pattern. Therefore we love signals that help us form or manage patterns which we equally call rules and heuristics.&nbsp;</p><p>Management theory teaches and rewards us on prioritising signals, especially the loud, noisy, obvious ones that are easy to see and understand.&nbsp; Using the example of a cloud (one in the sky, not a server farm), it is an unmistakable signal.&nbsp; A cloud is right here, right now.&nbsp; It is big and obvious. &nbsp; Clouds are a data point; observing clouds provides us with highly structured single-source data. &nbsp; The data we collect about clouds in front of us is given to our data science team who will present back insights about the data that is collected, giving us all sorts of new information and knowledge about the data we have. Big signals win.&nbsp; The statistics team takes the same data set and provides forecasts and probabilities based on maths, inferring insights based on data that is not there. &nbsp; The outcome from both teams may be different, but they both present significant overriding signals telling us what decision to make, based on the clouds data.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Another approach is to look at the system: how and why did the cloud form? Where did it appear? Where is it going? By gathering lots of data from different sources and seeking many signals, we can look at systems.&nbsp; Sensors are detecting light level, wind direction and speed, ground temperature, air temperature for 100 KM round and 25 miles KM high - lots of delicate low signal data.&nbsp; It is unstructured data. &nbsp; Feeding the data into the teams, the data analytics team brings knowledge of the system, its complexity and what we know based on the data. &nbsp; The statistics team can provide forecasting and probability about clouds and not clouds.&nbsp; Small signals that in aggregate creating choice and allowing for judgment.&nbsp; Our small signals give confidence that our models work as we have cloud data and that cloud data confirms that our signals are picking up what our environment is saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Side note, the differences between “data analysis” using data science and statistics. Whilst both data scientists and statisticians use data to make inferences about a data subject, they will approach the issue of data analysis quite differently. For a data scientist, data analysis is sifting through vast amounts of data: inspecting, cleansing, modelling, and presenting it in a non-technical way to non-data scientists. The vast majority of this data analysis is performed on a computer. A data analyst will have a data science toolbox (e.g. programming languages like Python and R, or experience with frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark) with which they can investigate the data and make inferences.</p><p>If you're a statistician, instead of "vast amounts of data" you'll usually have a limited amount of information in the form of a sample (i.e. a portion of the population); data analysis is performed on this sample, using rigorous statistical techniques. A statistical analyst will generally use mathematical-based techniques like <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/hypothesis-testing/">hypothesis testing</a>, <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/probability-main-index/">probability</a> and various statistical theorems to make inferences. Although much of a statistician's data analysis can be performed with the help of statistical programs like R, the analysis is more methodical and targeted to understanding one particular aspect of the sample at a time (for example, the <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/mean-median-mode/#mean">mean</a>, <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/standard-deviation/">standard deviation</a> or <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/confidence-interval/">confidence interval</a>).</p><p>These data analysis approaches are fundamentally different and produce different signals; for a full story, you often need both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Does a leadership team choose or decide? <p>As a senior leader, executive or director, you have to face the reality of this article now. Right now, you have four significant noisy signals to contend with: Critical parts of your company are presenting your with large signals using:</p>  <p>statistical analysis based on an observable point&nbsp;</p>  <p>data science analysis based on an observable point</p>  <p>statistical analysis based on a system</p>  <p>data science analysis based on a system</p>  <p>Do you know what type of significant loud signals you are being given and are they drowning out all the small signals you should be sensing?&nbsp; Who sits around the table is sensing small signals? &nbsp; Are you being presented with a decision, or are you being guided to a favourable outcome based on someone else's reward or motivation?&nbsp; How do you understand the bias in the data, analysis and where are the small signals? Indeed to quote @scottdavid “You have to hunt for the paradoxes in the information being presented because if you cannot see a paradox you being framed into a one-dimensional model.”&nbsp;</p><p>Further, have you understood that data is emerging outside of your control from your ecosystem that has different ontologies, taxonomies and pedagogy, meaning that you will probably only discover signals and patterns that don’t exist.&nbsp;</p> Decision-making skill based on sensitivity <p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Leadership for “organisational-fitness” is different from the leadership required for “organisational- wellness” in Sept 2020</a>. The article explored the skills needed by executive leadership in decision making to help a company be fit and well ( different things)</p><p>The chart below highlights how skills should be formed over a period to create individuals who can work together with other professionals who can deal with highly complex decision making (judgment).&nbsp; The axes are ability and expertise level on the horizontal axis (x) and the decision environment on the vertical axis (y).&nbsp; The (0,0) point where the axis’s cross is when you first learn to make decisions.&nbsp; Note this has nothing to do with age or time.&nbsp; Starting from the Orange zone - this is where we make simple decisions. A bit like gravity, there is only one force and one outcome. You are encouraged to find it and make the right choice (even though ultimately there is no choice.) The grey areas on either side are where the “<a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/the-accumulation-of-an-executives-successfulness-with-kpi-measures-is-not-an-indicator-of-a-future-a170409a0c8a">Peters Principle</a>” can be seen in practice; individuals act outside of their capacity and/or are not given sufficient responsibility and become disruptive.&nbsp; The Pink area is where most adults get to and stay.&nbsp; We understand, like electromagnetic forces, there are two options or more.&nbsp; We search out the significant signals and those that bring us the reward to which we are aligned.&nbsp; We develop and hone skills at making binary choices. The yellow/ mustard zone is where many senior executives get trapped as they are unable to adapt from acting in their own interests to acting in the best interests of the organisation and eco-system as all their training is how to perform better in their own interests and rewards (KPI’s linked to bonus). In the yellow zone, you have to create and build a whole new mental model. &nbsp; Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes">John Mayard Keynes</a> as you learn more, you do U-turns, adapt your thinking, change your philosophy and adapt.&nbsp; Never stop learning. &nbsp; At this point, you wrestle with quantum decision making and find you are looking for the small signals in the chaos and need trusted advisors and equal peers.&nbsp; You seek out and find a paradox, never believing the data, not the analysis nor the steer that someone else is presenting. &nbsp; This is hard work but leads to better judgment, better decisions and better outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p> Take Away <p>Decisions are often not decisions; the choice is not always real, especially when the foundations of them are simple and binary.&nbsp; Leaders need to become very sensitive to signals and find the weak and hidden ones to ensure that, as complexity becomes a critical component of judgement, you are not forced to ratify choices.&nbsp; Ratification is when choices are not understood, the views are biased, and the decision likely fulfils someone else’s objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a director, we are held accountable and responsible for our decisions; we must take them to the best of our ability. As automation becomes more prevalent in our companies, based on data, we have to become more diligent than ever if we are making judgment, choices or decisions or just ratifying something that has taken our choice away to fulfil its own bias and own dependency using big signals.</p><br>

<p>On Monday, December 14th the 18th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* was held with a presentation from Jason Burnett, Director of Products from Digital Trust.  Digital Trust is working on the new GADI specification and is a central member of The DID Alliance.</p><p>The DID Alliance digital identity infrastructure  leverages existing FIDO Alliance infrastructure and processes combined with elements of decentralized technologies (DLTs and DIDs).  The GADI architecture is a federated identity ecosystem where Digital Address Platforms (DAPs).  The DAPs are run by known trusted identity providers and perform the Trust Anchors role,  and issue Digital Addresses to individuals.   The ecosystem uses a permissioned DLT model with only known trusted entities can perform the role of Trust Anchor.</p><p>The Digital Address is used as unique individual identifier that is controlled by the GADI ecosystem.   This is the fundamental difference in identity philosophy between GADI and SSI based systems.  The Digital Address is a lifetime connected identifier and under the control of the DAP.  The version 1.0 of the GADI specification is currently underway with a release expected in Q1 of 2021. </p><p>The DID Alliance was founded in late 2018 with a strong representation of members in South Korea and CVS/Aetna in the United States.  Digital Trust is the technology partner of The DID Alliance that is designing and implementing the GADI specification and reference architecture.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/491079655">https://vimeo.com/491079655</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:04:17 - Jason Burnett - Digital Trust</p>  <p>0:06:38 - The DID Alliance Core Principles</p>  <p>0:18:57 - DAP Ecosystem</p>  <p>0:22:53 - Components of GADI Digital Identity</p>  <p>0:34:35 - Questions</p>  <p>0:50:00 - Demo</p>  <p>1:02:00 - Questions</p>  <p>1:11:18 - Wrap-up</p>  <p></p><p>For more information on:</p>  <p>The DID Alliance: <a href="https://www.didalliance.org/">https://www.didalliance.org/</a></p>  <p>And as a reminder,  we continue to have online only events.

<p>This past spring, I noticed that our 20 year-old wooden shake roof needed serious work. The roof condition, combined with all of the recent wildfire activity in California, prompted us to replace the entire roof with asphalt shingles. This, of course, necessitated the removal and replacement of the solar <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/04/30/photovoltaic-part-1/">panels we had installed in 2006</a>.</p>



<p>In anticipation of doing this, we consulted with our local contractor, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/solar-lightworkers-inc-capitola">Solar Lightworkers</a>, to see what might be done to update the system as well as to add a bit of extra capacity since we now have an electric car. Photovoltaic technology has advanced quite a bit in the past 14 years, so we wanted to take as much advantage of that as possible while reusing components from our existing system. As described <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/08/photovoltaic-part-2-specifications-and-installation/">earlier</a>, our system had consisted of 24 200-watt Sanyo panels, with half of the panels facing south and half facing west. Because these two arrays peaked at different times of day, we had two inverters to optimize the output of each array.</p>



 Design 



 <a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/inverter.png"></a>SolarEdge inverter 



<p>Mark from Solar Lightworkers strongly recommended a <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/">SolarEdge</a> inverter that uses <a href="https://www.solaredge.com/us/products/power-optimizer#/">optimizers</a> to  minimize the impact of shading of some of the panels on the overall system output. This also compensates for the fact that different panels have maximum output at different times of day. As a result, a single inverter is sufficient for our new system. We also added four 360-watt LG panels to increase our capacity. This SolarEdge inverter is also capable of battery backup, but we haven’t opted into that yet.</p>



<p>Since our original installation, building codes had changed a bit requiring that the panels be installed at least 3 feet below the peak of the roof. This made us rethink the layout of the existing panels. When we did the original installation, we were concerned about the aesthetics of the panels on the front of the house. But since that time, so many other houses in our area have installed solar panels that we weren’t as concerned about appearance of panels on the front (south) side of the house. We still have some panels facing west, because they seem to be nearly as efficient economically as those facing west due to time-of-use electricity pricing.</p>



<a href="https://altmode.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/dsc01980.jpg"></a>South-facing solar panels



 Data Collection 



<p>I have enjoyed collecting data from our photovoltaic system, and have done so more or less continuously since the original system was installed, using a serial interface from one of my computers to the inverters. I wanted to continue that. The SolarEdge inverter comes with a variety of interfaces through which it can send data to SolarEdge’s cloud service, which I can view on their website. Wanting more detailed information, I found that they provide an API through which I can get data very comparable to what I got from the old inverters, and continue to analyze the data locally (as well as using their facilities, which are very good).</p>



<p>One of the unexpected benefits of the SolarEdge optimizers is the ability to see the performance of each panel individually. It turns out that one of the old panels had a power output almost exactly half of the others. I’m not sure how long that had been going on; perhaps since 2006. I found that the panels have a 20-year output warranty, so I contacted Panasonic, which had acquired the Sanyo product line, and filled out some paperwork and sent pictures. They sent me three very similar panels (replacing two panels with cosmetic defects as well as the one with low output) soon after. I was very happy with the service from Panasonic. Solar Lightworkers installed the new panels, and output is where it should be.</p>



 Performance 



<p>On a typical summer day with little shading, the system generated 23.7 kWh in on 8/30/2019 and 34.8 kWh (+47%) on 8/27/2020. The additional panels would account for 30% of that increase and the defective panel an additional 2%.  In the late fall, the old system generated 14.6 kWh on 11/25/2019, and the new system 22.9 kWh (+57%) on 11/26/2020. There are of course other variables, such as soot on the panels from the California wildfires this year.</p>



<p>It will take quite a while for the increased output to pay for the upgrades, of course, but much of that cost would have been incurred just as a result of the need to replace the roof. We are quite pleased with the performance of the new system.</p>

This has been achieved by contributing and reviewing content, attaining the consensus of the public sector jurisdictions, and monitoring related developments that might impact the development of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p><p>The main deliverable of the PSP PCTF WG has been the PSP PCTF, the various versions of which consist of a consolidated overview document, an assessment methodology, and an assessment worksheet.</p><p>The PSP PCTF WG has also facilitated other activities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Sharing information, updates, and lessons learned from various digital identity initiatives; and  Consultation and engagement with multi-jurisdictional and international fora.   Membership <p>At its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG had 111 confirmed members on its distribution list consisting of representatives from all jurisdictions and various municipalities across Canada, as well as international participants from the Digital Nations. The working group normally met on a weekly call that averaged 20 to 30 participants.</p> Achievements <p>PSP PCTF Deliverables</p><p>The PSP PCTF Version 1.2 is now available at: <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP</a>. It should be noted that this has been the iterative product of several prior versions:</p>  April 2018: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Alpha Version — Consolidated Overview document;  July 2019: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.0 — Consolidated Overview document;  June 2020: The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 — Consolidated Overview document; and  For each of these versions of the PSP PCTF, a companion PSP PCTF Assessment Worksheet consisting of approximately 400 conformance criteria.   PSP PCTF Assessments <p>The PSP PCTF was used in the following assessments conducted by the federal government to accept trusted digital identities from the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia:</p>  September 2018: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://account.alberta.ca/">MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program</a> for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Alpha Version); and  January 2020: Assessment and Acceptance of the <a href="https://id.gov.bc.ca/login/entry#start">British Columbia Services Card Program </a>for use by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account.html">Government of Canada</a> (using the PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.0).  <p>Insights and lessons learned from the application of these PSP PCTF assessments were brought back to the PSP PCTF WG and the learnings were incorporated into subsequent versions of the PSP&nbsp;PCTF.</p> Joint Council Briefings <p>The PSP PCTF is the result of a long-term and deep collective experience of the public sector. Efforts on the PSP PCTF began in late 2014 and have been reported regularly to the <a href="https://citizenfirst.ca/councils/joint-councils">Joint Councils</a> by the Identity Management Sub-Committee (IMSC) Working Group and its successor, the PSP PCTF Working Group. The following is the list of updates that are on record and are available for reference in the joint-councils-update folder (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs/joint-councils-updates">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>):</p>  February 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  October 2017 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  February 2018 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update;  September 2018 — Joint Councils Update; Whitehorse Declaration and MADI&nbsp;Update;  February 2019 — Joint Councils Update;&nbsp;and  February 2020 — Joint Councils&nbsp;Update.   Related Deliverables <p>In addition to the PSP PCTF itself, the following related deliverables should be&nbsp;noted:</p>  Whitehorse Declaration — a declaration of shared intent among the federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments to pursue the establishment of trustworthy digital identities for all Canadians (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/Declaration-Digital-ID-D%C3%A9claration-lidentit%C3%A9-num%C3%A9rique.pdf">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>);  IMSC Public Policy Paper — recommendations for a Pan-Canadian policy position on the question of roles and responsibilities of the public and private sector in digital identity (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/docs/2019-09-00%20IMSC-Public-Policy-Paper.pdf">GitHub link</a>);&nbsp;and  Many historical deliverables that are too numerous to list in this report. A Public Historical Archive of deliverables and briefings, many of which pre-date the efforts of the PSP PCTF are being compiled in a folder on a best-effort basis (<a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">GitHub&nbsp;link</a>).   Other <p>It also should be noted that content from the PSP PCTF Version 1.1 was incorporated into the National Standard of Canada, CAN/CIOSC 103–1, Digital Trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals, developed by the CIO Strategy Council, and approved by the Standards Council of Canada (<a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">Website&nbsp;link</a>).</p> PSP PCTF WG Work Plan 2020–2021 <p>At the time of its dissolution, the work plan of the PSP PCTF WG was as&nbsp;follows:</p>  PSP PCTF Version&nbsp;1.2    A Consolidated Overview document (released on December 4th, 2020) which includes:  A revised Normative Core (containing new concepts that were developed as a result of the credentials and relationships analysis&nbsp;work);  A revised Credential Model (based on the working group discussion document); and  An incorporated Relationship Model (based on work led by&nbsp;ISED).  <p>2. An Assessment Worksheet (draft released on December 4, 2020) which contains new and revised conformance criteria for assessment purposes</p><p>3. A re-assessment of the MyAlberta Digital Identity (MADI) Program for use by the Government of Canada (using the PSP PCTF Version 1.2) with planned completion by March&nbsp;2021.</p> PSP PCTF Thematic&nbsp;Issues <p>During the development of the PSP PCTF, the working group has identified several high-level thematic issues that must be addressed in order to advance the digital ecosystem.</p><p>Thematic Issue 1: Relationships (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a relationship model is required.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 2: Credentials (Priority: High)</p><p>The development of a generalized credential model is required. This model should integrate traditional physical credentials and authentication credentials with the broader notion of a verifiable credential.</p><p>This issue has been initially addressed in the PSP PCTF Version 1.2 Consolidated Overview document released in December&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Thematic Issue 3: Unregistered Organizations (Priority: High)</p><p>Currently, the scope of PSP PCTF includes all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada. There are also many kinds of unregistered organizations operating in Canada such as sole proprietorships, trade unions, co-ops, NGOs, unregistered charities, and trusts. An analysis of these unregistered organizations needs to be undertaken.</p><p>Thematic Issue 4: Informed Consent (Priority: High)</p><p>The current version of the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document does not adequately capture all the issues and nuances surrounding the topic of informed consent especially in the context of the public sector. A more rigorous exploration of this topic needs to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>Thematic Issue 5: Privacy Concerns (Priority: Medium)</p><p>In regards to the Identity Continuity and Relationship Continuity atomic processes, it has been noted that there are privacy concerns with the notion of dynamic confirmation. Further analysis based on feedback from the application of the PSP PCTF is required to determine if these atomic processes are appropriate.</p><p>Thematic Issue 6: Assessing Outsourced Atomic Processes (Priority: Medium)</p><p>The PSP PCTF does not assume that a single Issuer or Verifier is solely responsible for all of the atomic processes. An organization may choose to outsource or delegate the responsibility of an atomic process to another party. Therefore, several bodies might be involved in the PSP PCTF assessment process, focusing on different atomic processes, or different aspects (e.g., security, privacy, service delivery). It remains to be determined how such multi-actor assessments will be conducted.</p><p>Thematic Issue 7: Scope of the PSP PCTF (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been suggested that the scope of the PSP PCTF should be broadened to include academic qualifications, professional designations, etc. The PSP PCTF anticipates extensibility through the generalization of the PSP PCTF model and the potential addition of new atomic processes. Expanding the scope of the PSP PCTF into other domains needs to be&nbsp;studied.</p><p>Thematic Issue 8: Signature (Priority: Low)</p><p>The concept of signature as it is to be applied in the context of the PSP PCTF needs to be explored.</p><p>Thematic Issue 9: Foundation Name, Primary Name, Legal Name (Priority: Low)</p><p>The PSP PCTF has definitions for Foundation Name, Primary Name, and Legal Name. Since the three terms mean the same thing, a preferred term should be selected and used consistently throughout the PSP PCTF documents.</p><p>Thematic Issue 10: Additional Detail (Priority: Low)</p><p>It has been noted that the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document contains insufficient detail in regards to the specific application of the PSP PCTF. The PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be supplemented with detailed guidance in a separate document.</p><p>Thematic Issue 11: Review of the Appendices (Priority: Low)</p><p>A review of the current appendices contained in the PSP PCTF Consolidated Overview document needs to be undertaken. Each appendix should be evaluated for its utility, applicability, and appropriateness, and a determination made as to whether it should continue to be included in the document.</p> Recommendations for Next&nbsp;Steps   Continue the development of the PSP PCTF based on the thematic issues identified above. These thematic issues may be addressed as part of a working group, or through task groups, or practice&nbsp;groups.  Continue the application of the PSP PCTF through the Assessment Process with the Provinces and Territories, with a view to incorporating learnings back into subsequent versions of the PSP PCTF, and, evolving the assessment process toward a standards-based process that has a formal certification scheme with accredited bodies and independent assessors.  Support the changes in digital identity governance to ensure that the PSP PCTF is developed and used in the public interest and is aligned with other industry and international efforts.  Establish as required, working groups, task groups, or practice groups&nbsp;for:  Ongoing development and maintenance of the PSP PCTF and related assessment processes and certification schemes;  Carrying out specific time-bound tasks or address issues. (e.g., addressing the thematic themes through discussion papers, analysis of other trust frameworks, etc.);  Testing practical applications of the PSP PCTF standards and conformance criteria through assessments and use cases;&nbsp;and  Sharing knowledge and lessons learned in relation to the application of the PSP PCTF and the assessment process.  Facilitate broader engagement using the PSP PCTF, including:  Engaging standards development organizations, domestic and international, to support the standards development and certification scheme development;  Engaging international organizations having an interest in applying or adapting the PSP PCTF for their purposes;  Collaborating with industry associations wishing to advance the aims of their membership, or their specific sector;&nbsp;and  Encouraging dialogue with other governments, either bilaterally facilitated through the federal government, or multilaterally through established bodies (e.g., UNCITRAL, the Digital Nations).   Conclusion <p>At the time of its dissolution, the PSP PCTF WG was an important vehicle for ensuring public sector communication and discussion across Canada in order to cultivate a shared understanding of how identity and digital identity could be best developed for the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Much has been achieved by the working group, building on prior work going back more than a decade. However much more work remains. It is hoped that the work accomplished to date and the recommendations put forward in this report will be considered by the JEDI to support their mandate to accelerate the specific goals of the digital identity priority of the Joint Councils.</p>

   I said something strange this morning: 
 
 Identity is a Katamari, language is a continuous reverse engineering
effort, and thus language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris. 
 
 This sounds like nonsense probably, but has a lot of thought about it.
I have spent a lot of time in the decentralized-identity community …

<p>I said something strange this morning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identity is a Katamari, language is a continuous reverse engineering
effort, and thus language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like nonsense probably, but has a lot of thought about it.
I have spent a lot of time in the decentralized-identity community and
the ocap communities, both of which have spent a lot of time hemming
and hawing about "What is identity?", "What is a credential or
claim?", "What is authorization?",
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Dec/0028.html">"Why is it unhygienic for identity to be your authorization system?"</a>
(that mailing list post is the most important writing about the nature
of computing I've ever written; I hope to have a cleaned up version of
the ideas out soon).</p>
<p>But that whole bit about "what is identity, is it different than an
identifier really?" etc etc etc...</p>
<p>Well, I've found one good explanation, but it's a bit silly.</p>
 Identity is a Katamari 
<p>There is a curious, surreal, delightful (and proprietary, sorry) game,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>.
It has a silly story, but the interesting thing here is the game
mechanic, involving rolling around a ball-like thing that picks up
objects and grows bigger and bigger kind of like a snowball.
It has to <a href="https://youtu.be/FQxEitzJ-H0?t=636">be seen</a> or played to
really be understood.</p>
<p>This ball-like thing is called a "Katamari Damacy", or "soul clump",
which is extra appropriate for our mental model.
As it rolls around, it picks up smaller objects and grows bigger.
The ball at the center is much like an identifier.
But over time that identifier becomes obscured, it picks up things,
which in the game are physical objects, but these metaphorically map
to "associations".</p>
<p>Our identity-katamari changes over time.  It grows and picks up
associations.  Sometimes you forget something you've picked up that's
in there, it's buried deep (but it's wiggling around in there still
and you find out about it during some conversation with your
therapist).  Over time the katamari picks up enough things that it is
obscured.  Sometimes there are collisions, you smash it into something
and some pieces fly out.  Oh well, don't worry about it.  They
probably weren't meant to be.</p>
 Language is reverse engineering 
<p>Shout out to my friend <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/">Jonathan Rees</a> for
saying something that really stuck in my brain (okay actually most
things that Rees says stick in my brain):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Language is a continuous reverse engineering effort, where both
sides are trying to figure out what the other side means."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, but its truth is the bane of ontologists and static
typists.  This doesn't mean that ontologies or static typing are
wrong, but that the notion that they're fixed is an illusion... a
useful, powerful illusion (with a great set of mathematical tools
behind it sometimes that can be used with mathematical
proofs... assuming you don't change the context), but an illusion
nonetheless.  Here are some examples that might fill out what I mean:</p>
 
 
<p>The classic example, loved by fuzzy typists everywhere: when is a
   person "bald"?  Start out with a person with a "full head" of hair.
   How many hairs must you remove for that person to be "bald"?  What
   if you start out the opposite way...  someone is bald... how many
   hairs must you add for them to become not-bald?</p>
 
 
<p>We might want to construct a precise recipe for a
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassi#Mango_lassi">mango lassi</a>.
   Maybe, in fact, we believe we can create a precise typed
   definition for a mango lassi.
   But we might soon find ourselves running into trouble.  Can a vegan
   non-dairy milk be used for the Lassi?  (Is vegan non-dairy milk
   actually milk?)  Is ice cream acceptable?  Is added sugar
   necessary?  Can we use artificial mango-candy powder instead of
   mangoes?  Maybe you can hand-wave away each of these, but here's
   something much worse: what's a mango?  You might think that's
   obvious, a mango is the fruit of mangifera indica or maybe
   if you're generous fruit of anything in the mangifera genus.
   But mangoes evolved and there is some weird state where we had
   almost-a-mango and in the future we might have some new states
   which are no-longer-a-mango, but more or less we're throwing darts
   at exactly where we think those are... evolution doesn't care,
   evolution just wants to keep reproducing.</p>
 
 
<p>Meaning changes over time, and how we categorize does too.
   Once someone was explaining the <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">Web Ontology Language</a>
   (which got confused somewhere in its acronym ordering and is
   shortened to OWL (update: it's a Winnie the Pooh update, based
   on the way the Owl character spells his name... thank you Amy
   Guy for informing me of the history)).
   They said that it was great because you could clearly define what
   is and isn't allowed and terms derived from other terms, and that
   the simple and classic example is Gender, which is a binary choice
   of Male or Female.
   They paused and thought for a moment.
   "That might not be a good example anymore."</p>
 
 
<p>Even if you try to define things by their use or properties rather
   than as an individual concept, this is messy too.
   A person from two centuries ago would be confused by the metal
   cube I call a "stove" today, but you could say it does the same
   job.
   Nonetheless, if I asked you to "fetch me a stove", you would probably
   not direct me to a computer processor or a car engine, even though
   sometimes people fry an egg on both of these.</p>
 
 
<p>Multiple constructed languages (Esperanto most famously) have been
made by authors that believed that if everyone spoke the same language,
we would have world peace.
This is a beautiful idea, that conflict comes purely from
misunderstandings.
I don't think it's true, especially given how many fights I've seen
between people speaking the same language.
Nonetheless there's truth in that many fights are about a conflict
of ideas.</p>
<p>If anyone was going to achieve this though, it would be the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> community, which
actually does have a language which is syntactically unambiguous,
so you no longer have ambiguity such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_flies_like_an_arrow;_fruit_flies_like_a_banana">"time flies like an arrow"</a>.
Nonetheless, even this world can't escape the problem that some terms
just can't be easily pinned down, and the best example is the
<a href="https://mw.lojban.org/papri/jbocre:_Bear_goo">bear goo</a>
debate.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: both of us can unambiguously construct a sentence
referring to a "bear".
But when it is that bear no longer a bear?
If it is struck in the head and is killed, when in that process has it
become a decompositional "bear goo" instead?
And the answer is: there is no good answer.
Nonetheless many participants want there to be a pre-defined bear,
they want us to live in a pre-designed universe where "bear" is a clear
predicate that can be checked against, because the universe has a
clear definition of "bear" for us.</p>
<p>That doesn't exist, because bears evolved.  And more importantly, the
concept and existence a bear is emergent, cut across many different
domains, from evolution to biology to physics to linguistics.</p>
<p>Sorry, we won't achieve perfect communication, not even in Lojban.
But we can get a lot better, and set up a system with fewer stumbling
blocks for testing ideas against each other, and that is a worthwhile
goal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you and I are camping and I shout, "AAH!  A bear!
RUN!!", you and I probably don't have to stop to debate bear goo.
Rees is right that language is a reverse engineering effort, but we
tend to do a pretty good job of gaining rough consensus of what the
other side means.  Likewise, if I ask you, "Where is your stove?", you
probably won't lead me to your computer or your car.  And if you hand
me a "sugar free vegan mango lassi made with artificial mango flavor"
I might doubt its cultural authenticity, but if you then referred to
the "mango lassi" you had just handed me a moment ago, I wouldn't have
any trouble continuing the conversation.  Because we're more or less
built to contextually construct language contexts.</p>
 Language is a quadratic explosion of Katamaris 
<p>Language is composed of syntax partly, but the arrangement of symbolic
terms mostly.  Or that's another way to say that the non-syntactic
elements of language are mostly there as identifiers substituted
mentally for identity and all the associations therein.</p>
<p>Back to the Katamari metaphor.  What "language is a
reverse-engineering effort" really means is that each of us are
constructing identities for identifiers mentally, rolling up katamaris
for each identifier we encounter.  But what ends up in our ball will
vary depending on our experiences and what paths we take.</p>
<p>Which really means that if each person is rolling up a separate,
personal identity-katamari for each identifier in the system, that
means that, barring passing through a singularity type event-horizon
past which participants can do direct shared memory mapping, this is
an O(n^2) problem!</p>
<p>But actually this is not a problem, and is kind of beautiful.  It is
amazing, given all that, just how good we are at finding shared
meaning.  But it also means that we should be aware of what this means
topologically, and that each participant in the system will have a
different set of experiences and understanding for each
identity-assertion made.</p>
<p>Thank you to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Stephen Webber, Corbin Simpson,
Baldur Jóhannsson, Joey Hess, Sam Smith, Lee Spector, and Jonathan
Rees for contributing thoughts that lead to this post (if you feel
like you don't belong here, do belong here, or are wondering how the
heck you got here, feel free to contact me).  Which is not to say that
everyone, from their respective positions, have agreement here; I know
several disagree strongly with me on some points I've made.  But
everyone did help contribute to reverse-engineering their positions
against mine to help come to some level of shared understanding,
and the giant pile of katamaris that is this blogpost.</p>

    Exploring how the S-Curve can help us with leadership, strategy and decisions making in an age of emergence: (properties or behaviours which only emerge when the parts interact as part of an inclusive whole)  History and context <p>There is a special place in our business hearts and minds for the “S” curve or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>, calling it by its proper maths name. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">origin of the S curve</a> goes back to the study of population growth by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre-François Verhulst</a> c.1838. Verhulst was influenced by Thomas Malthus’ “An Essay on the Principle of Population” which showed that growth of a biological population is self-limiting by the finite amount of available resources. The logistic equation is also sometimes called the Verhulst-Pearl equation following its rediscovery in 1920. Alfred J. Lotka derived the equation again in 1925, calling it the law of population growth but he is better known for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_J._Lotka">predator: prey model</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 1957 business strategists Joe Bohlen and George Beal published the <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7044374.pdf">Diffusion Process</a>. Taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">adoption curve</a> and adding cumulatively the take up the product to gain a “classic S curve.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The market adoption curve became the basis for explaining innovation and growth as a broader market economic concept by the late 1960s. We started to consider the incubation of ideas to create new businesses and how we need a flow of products/ services within big companies.</p><p>From this thinking emerged two concepts, as the shareholder primacy model became central to growth.&nbsp; The first is the concept of “Curve Jumping” to ensure that you continue growth by keeping shareholders happy through the continuous introduction of new products, as the existing ones have matured. Of course, the downside is that if a business cannot jump because of its current cost base or ability to adopt the latest technology to perpetuate the ascension of the curve, new companies will emerge with competitive advantages (product or cost) as they jump to new technologies.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine">Milton Friedman’s</a> emphasis on shareholder value maximisation at the expense of other considerations was driving companies to keep up with the next curve of fear of being left behind competitively. Some sorts of competition are healthier for markets than others, and it appears that competition and anxiety relating to retaining technology leadership at all costs have been driving capitalism in a particularly destructive direction, rather than encouraging useful and sustainable friendly innovation.&nbsp; There is an economics essay to be written here, but this piece is about the S curve.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p> Right here, right now. <p>We live in a time when crisis and systematic “emergent properties” are gaining attention and prominence.&nbsp; Emergence by definition occurs when an entity or system is observed to have properties that its parts do not pose or display on their own. Properties or behaviours which only emerge when the parts interact in the broader system, as we see our businesses, we understand as complex adaptive systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst shareholder primacy as an economic driver faded in 1990 to be replaced finally in 2019 with<a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/files/Mayer_2.19.19.transcript.pdf"> Colin Mayer</a> work on the <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2020/11/value-creation-and-corporate-governance">Purpose Model</a>, a modern standard for corporate responsibility which makes an equal commitment to all stakeholders. Shareholder primacy’s simplicity has remained a stalwart of leadership training, teaching and therefore, management thinking.&nbsp; Its simplicity meant we did not have to deal with contradictions and conflicting requirements that a broader purpose would expose. The <a href="https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans">Business Round Table Aug 2019</a> and Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink letters to CEOs/ Shareholders are critical milestones in turning thinking away from pure shareholder returns as the reason for a business to exist. The shift is towards eco-systems and ESG (Environmental sustainability, Social responsibility and better oversight and Governance) as primary drives.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.frc.org.uk/investors/uk-stewardship-code">FCA Stewardship code</a>, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/172/2011-04-22">Section 172 of the companies act</a> and decision reporting are some of the first legislative instruments on this journey. With now over 50 series A funded startups active in ESG reporting, impact investing has become a meme as the development of a more standardised and comprehensive purpose reporting has strengthened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shareholder primacy’s simplicity meant we did not have to deal with contradictions and conflicting requirements that a broader purpose would expose.</p><p>With this new framing, it is time to revisit the S-Curve.&nbsp;</p> Framing the S-Curve for an evolutionary journey <p>If you have not yet discovered <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwardley/">Simon Wardley</a> and his <a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps">mapping thinking</a>, stop here and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMlFv2Sod54">watch this</a>. &nbsp; Simon has a brilliant S-Curve with pioneers, settlers and town planners, really worth looking up. His <a href="https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/08/on-diffusion-and-evolution.html">model is about evolution (journey towards commodity) rather than diffusion (take up over time).</a>&nbsp; To quote Simon “The evolution of a single act from genesis to commodity may involve hundreds if not thousands of diffusion curves for each evolving instance of that act, each with their own chasm.”</p><p>The next S-Curve below, I am building on Simon’s axis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity">Ubiquity</a> (how common something is) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certainty">Certainty</a> (the likelihood of the outcome being as determined) which is an evolution S-Curve.&nbsp; On these axes, we are plotting the systems and company development - time is not present, but as we will see, we have to remove time from the framing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Starting in the bottom left is the activity of Innovation where uniquity is low, as it is an idea, and it is not available to everyone. The certainty that any innovation will work is low.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>The top right corner is the perceived north star.&nbsp; Ubiquity is high as everyone has it, and there is high certainty that it works.&nbsp; In this top right corner are commodities and utilities, technology at scale, by example turning on the water tap and drinking water flows.&nbsp; Linking innovation and commodity is an evolution or journey S-Curve. Under this curve, we can talk about the transformation of the company, the companies practices, data, controls and what models it will most likely utilise.&nbsp; The chart below highlights the most popular thinking in each stage and is certainly not exclusive.&nbsp; Agile works well in all phases, <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/pathways-to-general-ai-unimagined.html">AI can be used anywhere, except for choice</a>, and data is not as definite as the buckets would suggest.&nbsp; Control changes as we evolve from lean/ MVP in the first delivery, to using methodologies such as agile and scrum, then Prince 2 as a grown-up project management tool at scale and then towards quality management with 6 Sigma.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: I have a passionate dislike of the term “best practice” as it only applies when in the linear phase but is literally applied everywhere.&nbsp; At linear, you have evidence and data to support what “best” looks like.&nbsp; At any stage before ubiquity and certainty, best practice is simply not possible other than by lucking out.&nbsp; A desire for best practice ignores that you have to learn and prove what is it before you find it is best. And to all those who have the best - you can still do better, so how can it be best?</p><p></p><p>If one considers the idea of time and S-Curves you get to curve jumping or continual product development as set out earlier.&nbsp; The purpose of an evolution or journey S-Curve presented in this way is that when time is not the axis, any significant business will have all these activities present at all times (continual adaptation/ evolution not diffusion). In nature, all different levels of species exist at the same time from a single cell, to complex organisms.&nbsp; Innovation is not a thing; it is a journey, where you have to be all the camps, on the route, at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Innovation is not a thing; it is a journey where you have to be all the camps, on the route, at the same time.&nbsp;</p> Evolution S-Curve and governance <p>HBR argues that most capitalists markets are in a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/08/22/so-long-to-shareholder-primacy/">post-shareholder primacy model</a>, meaning the purpose of an organisation is up for debate. Still, we are on the route to a more inclusive purpose and <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2020/11/value-creation-and-corporate-governance">reason for a company to exist</a>.&nbsp; Law already exists in the UK as <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/preparing-directors-for-duties-and.html">Section 172 of the Companies Act</a> in the form of directors duties.&nbsp; The global pandemic has highlighted a bunch of significant weakness that emerges from our focus on growth and shareholder focus, including, as examples only:</p>  <p>Highly integrated long supply chains are incredibly efficient, but are very brittle and not resilient&nbsp; - we lost effectiveness.</p>  <p>A business needs to re-balance towards effectiveness.&nbsp; A food company in a pandemic exists to get food to customers (effectiveness) not to drive efficiency at any cost.</p>  <p>Ecosystem sustainability is more important than any single company's fortunes.</p>  <p>ESG, risk, being better ancestors, costing the earth and climate change are extremely difficult on your own.</p>  <p>Our existing risk models focus on resource allocation, safety and control. This framing means that new risk created in a digital-first world may be outside of the frame and therefore hidden in plain sight.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Given this framing and context, it is worth overlaying governance on the S-curve of start-up development, which we will now unpack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Governance has centrally focussed on corporates and large companies who offer products and services to mass markets. By concentrating governance on companies who have scale, if they are well managed, and is there independence of oversight, we have framed governance as only of interest for companies where there is an interest to wider society on their behaviour. Indeed it becomes a burden rather than a value.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies of scale tend to be found in the linear quadrant, top right, where growth is mainly incremental and linear.&nbsp; Regulation and markets focus on “BEST practices” which have been derived over a long period. The data used is highly modelled, and the application of AI creates new opportunities and value.&nbsp; Control is exercised through the utilisation of 6 Sigma for quality (repeatability) and other advanced program management techniques. KPI’s enable the delegation of actions and the monitoring, control thereof.&nbsp; The business model is that of exercising good or “best” decision making, based on resource allocation and risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unpacking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance">Corporate Governance</a> is a broad and thorny topic, but foundations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadbury_Report">The Cadbury Report (1992)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance#Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (2002) have been instrumental in framing </a>mandates.&nbsp; However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance,_risk_management,_and_compliance">governance, compliance and risk management</a> became one topic in c.2007 and lost the clear separation of function.&nbsp; Regulation has also formed an effective backstop to control behaviours and market abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The point is, when a company is at the scale, we have created “best governance practises and guidance”,&nbsp; along with excellent risk frameworks and stewardship codes for investors. &nbsp; Many of the tools and methods have stood the test of time and provide confidence to the market.&nbsp; However, these tools and frameworks are designed for companies at scale.&nbsp; On the journey from startup to scale, the adoption of such heavyweight practices in early development would be overly burdensome for emergent companies and are not a best or a good fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Remembering that any company of scale has all these phases present at the same time, but there are five possible camps or phases where we need governance; three are in orange and two in yellow. &nbsp; The yellow blocks represent phases where there is a degree of stability insomuch that there can be growth, but there is not a wholesale change in everything.&nbsp; The orange block represents phases where everything is changing. &nbsp; Yellow blocks indicate complicated oversight,&nbsp; where orange suggests complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, it is not that companies or markets in a linear phase are not complex; it is that the management at linear has more certainty in terms of practices and forecasting coupled with having to deal with less change. When there is a product of service at linear it delivers significant noisy signals and priorities that often overshadow any data or insights from other phases.&nbsp; Management at scale requires a focus on understanding the delta between the plan and the executed outcome and making minor adjustments to optimise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The management during the yellow stable growth camps/ phases is complicated as patterns and data will not always be that useful.&nbsp; Data will not be able to point to a definitive decision directly. Governance provides assurance and insights as management continually searches for the correct data to make decisions on, which may not be there.&nbsp; Management during an orange highly volatile camps/ phases is more complicated as you cannot rely on existing data during a transition between what you had and the new. Simply put if you did, you will only get what you have and not be able to move to the new.&nbsp; The idea of transition is that the old is left behind. Experienced leadership will show skills in seeking small signals from the noisy existing data and the noise. When considering governance through this dynamic lens, it is apparent that it becomes much more challenging and that we cannot rely on the wisdom and best practices of linear.&nbsp;</p><p>Plans at scale are more comfortable and more predictable; they are designed to enable the measurement of a delta. Plans during innovation are precisely the opposite, not easy and highly unpredictable.&nbsp; Using the same word “plan” in both cases means we lose definition and distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A plan at scale is built on years of data and modelled to be highly reliable; it is accurate and has a level of detail that can create KPIs for reporting.&nbsp; The plan and the model is a fantastic prediction tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A plan at start-up and growth is about direction and intention. Failure to have one would be catastrophic,&nbsp; but with the first few hours of the words being committed to a shared document, the plan is out of date.&nbsp; To be useful, it has to lack precision, detail and measurement but will set out stages, actions and outcomes.&nbsp; It must have a purpose, direction and how to frame complex decisions.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Similarly, governance at scale is more comfortable and more predictable; governance is about understanding where and how delta might arise and be ready for it. Governance during innovation is precisely the opposite, not easy and highly unpredictable.&nbsp; Using the same word “Governance” in both cases means we lose definition and distinction.</p><p>Using the same word “Governance” at scale and in startup cases means we lose definition and distinction. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> Complexity: Organisational mash-ups <p>Many businesses are mash-ups<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/the-changing-nature-of-business.html"> of previous transformations</a>, plus current evolution. This observation has two ramifications: One, the structure, processes and skills are neither fully aligned to the original model or various constructions of a new model.&nbsp; Two, data shows that as you categorise focus and alignment in the more senior positions, and who have been in post longer, most have a compass or alignment coupled with a mash-up of a previous model. Bluntly they stopped on the evolution path creating a dead end.&nbsp; Senior management who tend to have a closed mindset, rather than an open and continually learning one, tend to fall back on the experience of previous best practices, models and pre-transformational ideals, adding a significant burden to governance for any stage.&nbsp; The concept that there is a direct coupling between innovation and KPI measurement, which makes it harder for corporates to innovate and evolve <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/why-is-innovation-perceived-as-so-much.html">is explored in this article.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All companies have an increasing dependence on ecosystems for their growth and survival.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/09/leadership-for-organisational-fitness.html">Ecosystem health</a> is critical for companies at scale for supply chains and customers.&nbsp; Companies who operate at scale and in the linear phase, therefore, are dependent on companies who are in different stages on a planned route to scale. Thus, not only is a scale company dealing with its internal governance and innovation requirements as already noted, but the directors have to understand data from an ecosystem, who is also trying to understand what their data is telling them about their evolution path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Directors have to understand data from an ecosystem, who is also trying to understand what their data is telling them about their evolution path.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Governance is not about best practices and processes at any stage; it is about a mindset of an entire organisation and now ecosystem.&nbsp; When you reflect on it, Directors with governance responsibilities have to cope with data for decisions from chaotic and linear requirements at the same time — equally relying on individuals and teams who have different perceptions both inside and outside of the organisation. Never has <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">data-sharing</a> been more important as a concept, both as a tool or weapon (inaccurate data) in competitive markets. &nbsp; How can a director know that the data they get from their ecosystem can support their decision making and complex judgement?</p> Take Away <p>The S-curve has helped us on several journeys thus far. It supported our understanding of adoption and growth; it can now be critical in helping us understand the development and evolution of <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/07/what-changes-when-you-consider.html">governance towards a sustainable future</a>.&nbsp; An evolutionary S-curve is more applicable than ever as we enter a new phase of emergence.&nbsp; Our actions and behaviours emerge when we grasp that all parts of our ecosystem interact as a more comprehensive whole.&nbsp;</p><p>A governance S-curve can help us unpack new risks in this dependent ecosystem so that we can make better judgements that lead to better outcomes. What is evident is that we need far more than proof, lineage and provenance of data from a wide ecosystem if we are going to create better judgement environments, we need a new platform. Such a new platform is my focus and why I am working on <a href="https://www.digital20.com/">Digital20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

  <p>Summary:      DIDComm-capable agents provide a flexible infrastructure for numerous internet of things use cases.  This post looks at Alice and her digital relationship with her F-150 truck. She and the truck have relationships and interactions with the people and institutions she engages as she co-owns, lends and sells it. These and other complicated workflows are all supported by a standards-based, open-source, protocol-supporting system for secure, privacy-preserving messaging.</p>


 

<p>
    In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>, I introduced the role that Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) can play in the internet of things (IoT). The self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT) relies on the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">DID-based relationships</a> that SSI provides, and their support for standardized <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">protocols running over DIDComm</a>, to create an internet of things that is much richer, secure, and privacy respecting than the  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>  we're being offered today.  In this post, I extend the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">use cases I offered in the previous post</a> and discuss the role the heterarchical relationships found in the SSIoT play. 
</p>

<p>
    For this post, we're going to focus on Alice's relationship with her F-150 truck and its relationships with other entities. Why a vehicle? Because in 2013 and 2014 I built a commercial <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/fuse.shtml">connected car product called Fuse</a> that used the relationship-centric model I'm discussing here1. In addition, vehicles exist in a rich, complicated ecosystem that offers many opportunities for interesting relationships. Figure 1 shows some of these. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Vehicle relationships (click to enlarge)


<p>
   The most important relationship that a car has is with its owner. But there's more than one owner over the car's lifetime. At the beginning of its life, the car's owner is the manufacturer. Later the car is owned by the dealership, and then by a person or finance company. And, of course, cars are frequently resold. Over the course of its lifetime a car will have many owners. Consequently, the car's agent must be smart enough to handle these changes in ownership and the resulting changes in authorizations. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the owner, the car has relationships with other people: drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The nature of relationships change over time. For example, the car probably needs to maintain a relationship with the manufacturer and dealer even after they are no longer owners. With these changes to the relationship come changes in rights and responsibilities. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to relationships with owners, cars also have relationships with other players in the vehicle ecosystem including: mechanics, gas stations, insurance companies, finance companies, and government agencies. Vehicles exchange data and money with these players over time.  And the car might have relationships with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/02/10-4_good_buddy_vehicle_to_vehicle_communication.shtml">other vehicles</a>, traffic signals, the roadway, and even <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">potholes</a>.
</p>

<p>The following sections discuss three scenarios involvoing Alice, the truck, and other people, institutions, and things.
</p>

<a></a>
 Multiple Owners 
<p>
    One of the relationship types that the CompuServe of Things fails to handle well is multiple owners. Some companies try and others just ignore it. The problem is that when the service provider intermediates the connection to the thing, they have to account for multiple owners and allow those relationships to change over time. For a high-value product, the engineering effort is justified, but for many others, it simple doesn't happen. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Multiple Owners (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the relationships of two owners, Alice and Bob, with the truck. The diagram is simple and hides some of the complexity of the truck dealing with multiple owners. But as I discuss in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/10/fuse_with_two_owners.shtml">Fuse with Two Owners</a> some of this is simply ensuring that developers don't assume a single owner when they develop services. The infrastructure for supporting it is built into DIDComm, including standardized support for sub protocols like <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">Introduction</a>.
</p>

<a></a>
 Lending the Truck 

<p>
    People lend things to friends and neighbors all the time. And people rent things out. Platforms like AirBnB and Outdoorsy are built to support this for high value rentals. But what if we could do it for anything at any time without an intermediating platform? Figure 3 shows the relationships between Alice and her friend Carol who wants to borrow the truck.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Borrowing the Truck (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Like the multiple owner scenario, Alice would first have a connection with Carol and introduce her to the truck using the Introduction sub protocol. The introduction would give the truck permission to connect to Carol and also tell the truck's agent what protocols to expose to Carol's agent. Alice would also set the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#lifespan">relationship's longevity</a>. The specific permissions that the "borrower" relationship enables depend, of course, on the nature of the thing. 
</p>

<p>
    The data that the truck stores for different activities is dependent on these relationships. For example, the owner is entitled to know everything, including trips. But someone who borrows the car should be able to see their trips, but not those of other drivers. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">Relationships dictate the interactions</a>. Of course, a truck is a very complicated thing in a complicated ecosystem. Simpler things, like a shovel might simply be keeping track of who has the thing and where it is. But, as we saw in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#vrm">The Self-Sovereign Internet of Things</a>, there is value in having the thing itself keep track of its interactions, location, and status. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Selling the Truck 
<p>
    Selling the vehicle is more complicated than the previous scenarios. In 2012, we prototyped this scenario for Swift's Innotribe innovations group and presented it at Sibos. Heather Vescent of <a href="https://thepurpletornado.com/">Purple Tornado</a> created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzsqtdx40qg&amp;feature=emb_logo">video that visualizes how a sale of a motorcycle might happen</a> in a heterarchical DIDComm environment2.  You can see a <a href="https://vimeo.com/51827693">screencast of the prototype in operation here</a>. One important goal of the prototype was to support <a href="https://www.searls.com/">Doc Searls's</a> vision of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527/">Intention Economy</a>. In what follows, I've left out some of the details of what we built. You can find the complete write-up in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/06/buying_a_motorcycle_a_vrm_scenario_using_personal_clouds.shtml">Buying a Motorcycle: A VRM Scenario using Personal Clouds</a>. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 4: Selling the Truck (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In Figure 4, Alice is selling the truck to Doug. I'm ignoring how Alice and Doug got connected3 and am just focusing on the sale itself. To complete the transaction, Alice and Doug create a relationship. They both have relationships with their respective credit unions where Doug initiates and Alice confirms the transaction. At the same time, Alice has introduced the truck to Doug as the new owner. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, Doug, and the truck are all connected to the DMV and use these relationships to transfer the title. Doug can use his agent to register the truck and get plates. Doug also has a relationship with his insurance company. He introduces the truck to the insurance company so it can serve as the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml#vrm">service intermediary</a> for the policy issuance. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice is no longer the owner, but the truck knows things about her that Doug shouldn't have access to and she wants to maintain. We can create a digital twin of the truck that is no long attached to the physical device, but has a copy of all the trip and maintenance information that Alice had co-created with the truck over the years she owned it. This digital twin has all the same functionality for accessing this data that the truck did. At the same time, Alice and Doug can negotiate what data also stays on the truck. Doug likely doesn't care about her trips and fuel purchases, but might want the maintenance data. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Implementation 

<p>
    A few notes on implementation:
</p>
 
     
        The relationships posited in these use cases are all <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">DIDComm-capable relationships</a>. 
     
     
        The workflows in these scenarios use DIDComm messaging to communicate. I pointed out several places where the Introduction DIDComm protocol might be used. But there might be other DIDComm protocols defined. For example, we could imagine workflow-specific messages for the scenario where Carol borrows the truck. The scenario where Doug buys the truck is rife with possibilities for protocols on DIDComm that would standardize many of the interactions. Standardizing these workflows through protocol (e.g., a common protocol for vehicle registration) reduces the effort for participants in the ecosystem. 
     
     
        Some features, like attenuated permissions on channel are a mix of capabilities. DIDComm supports a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0031-discover-features">Discovery</a> protocol that allows Alice, say, to determine if Doug is open to engaging in a sale transaction. Other permissioning would be done by the agent outside the messaging system.
     
     
        The agents I'm envisioning here are smart, rule-executing agents like those available in <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189992/Persistent+Compute+Objects">picos</a>. Picos provide a powerful model for how a decentralized, heterarchical, interoperable internet of things can be built. <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/aries-cloudagent-pico">Picos provide an DIDComm agent programming platform</a> that is easily extensible. Picos live on an open-source pico engine that can run on anything that supports Node JS. They have been used to build and deploy several production systems, including the Fuse connected-car system discussed above.
     
 

<a></a>
 Conclusion 

<p>
    DIDComm-capable agents can be used to create a sophisticated relationship network that includes people, institutions, things and even soft artifacts like interaction logs. The relationships in that network are rich and varied—just like relationships in the real world. Things, whether they are capable of running their own agents or employ a soft agent as a digital twin, are much more useful when they exist persistently, control their own agent and digital wallet, and can act independently. Things now react and respond to messages from others in the relationship network as they autonomously follow their specific rules. 
</p>

<p>
    Everything I've discussed here and in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml">previous post</a> are doable now. By removing the intermediating administrative systems that make up the CompuServe of Things and moving to a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture we can unlock the tremendous potential of the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things. 
</p>

 Notes 

 
     Before Fuse, we'd built a more generalized IoT system based on a relationship network called <a href="https://www.windley.com/tags/squaretag.shtml">SquareTag</a>. SquareTag was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/05/using_products_to_build_customer_relationships.shtml">social product platform</a> (using the vernacular of the day) that promised to help companies have a relationship with their customers through the product, rather than merely having information about them. My company, Kynetx, and others, including Drummond Reed, were working to introduce something we called <a href="https://www.windley.com/liveweb/">"personal clouds"</a> that were arrayed in a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2012/05/moving_toward_a_relationship_network.shtml">relationship network</a>.  We built this on a actor-like programming model called <a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview">"picos"</a>. The pico engine and programming environment are still available and have been updated to provide DID-based relationships and support for DIDComm. 
     
     In 2012, DIDComm didn't exist of course. We were envisioning something that Innotribe called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98RYtKQaWcA">Digital Asset Grid (DAG)</a> and speaking about "personal clouds" but the envisioned operation of the DAG was very much like what exists now in the DIDComm-enabled peer-to-peer network enabled by DIDs.
     
     In the intentcasting prototype, Alice and Doug would have found each other through a system that matches Alice's intent to buy with Doug's intent to sell. But a simpler scenario would have Alice tell the truck to list itself on Craig's List so Alice and Doug can meet up there.

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity offers much more than just better ways to log in. The identity metasystem is really a sophisticated messaging system that is trustworthy, secure, and extensible. While decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials have much to offer the Internet of Things (IoT), the secure messaging subsystem promises an IoT that goes well beyond those initial scenarios. This post gives and introduction to SSI and IoT. The follow-on post goes deeper into what a true Internet of Things founded on SSI can provide.</p>




<p>
    I've been contemplating a self-sovereign internet of things (SSIoT) for over a decade. An SSIoT is the only architecture which frees us from what I've called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml">CompuServe of Things</a>. Unlike the CompuServe of Things, the SSIoT1 supports rich, peer-to-peer relationships between people, things, and their manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
    In the CompuServe of Things, Alice's relationships with her things are intermediated by the company she bought them from as shown in Figure 1. Suppose, for example, she has a connected coffee grinder from Baratza. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative relationships in today's CompuServe of Things (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, Alice uses Brataza's app on her mobile device to connect with Baratza's IoT cloud. She registers her coffee grinder, which only knows how to talk to Baratza's proprietary service API. Baratza intermediates all of Alice's interactions with her coffee grinder. If Baratza is offline, decides to stop supporting her grinder, goes out of business, or otherwise shuts down the service, Alice's coffee grinder becomes less useful and maybe stops working all together. 
</p>

<p>
    In an SSIoT, on the other hand, Alice has direct relationships with her things. In  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a>, I showed a diagram where Alice has relationships with people and organizations. But I left out things because I hadn't yet provided a foundational discussion of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm-enabled digital relationships</a> that's necessary to really understand how SSI can transform IoT. Figure 2 is largely the same as the diagram in the post on operationalizing digital relationships with just a few changes: I've removed the ledger and key event logs to keep it from being too cluttered and I've added a thing: a Baratza coffee grinder2.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: Alice has a relationship with her coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In this diagram, the coffee grinder is a fully capable participant in Alice's relationship network. Alice has a DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. She also has a relationship with the company who makes it, Baratza, as does the coffee grinder. Those last two are optional, but useful—and, importantly, fully under Alice's control. 
</p>


<a></a>
 DID Relationships for IoT 

<p>
    Let's focus on Alice, her coffee grinder, and Baratza to better understand the contrast between the CompuServe of Things and an SSIoT.  
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 3: Alice's relationships with her coffee grinder and it's manufacturer (click to enlarge)


<p>
    In Figure 3, rather than being intermediated by the coffee grinder's manufacturer, Alice has a direct, DID-based relationship with the coffee grinder. Both Alice and the coffee grinder have agents and wallets. Alice also has a DID-based relationship with Baratza which runs an enterprise agent. Alice is now the intermediary, interacting with her coffee grinder and Baratza as she see's fit. 
</p>

<p>
    Figure 3 also shows a DID-based relationship between the coffee grinder and Baratza. In an administrative CompuServe of Things, we might be concerned with the privacy of Alice's data. But in a Self-Sovereign Internet of Things, Alice controls the policies on that relationship and thus what is shared. She might, for example, authorize the coffee grinder to share diagnostic information when she needs service. She could also issue a credential to Baratza to allow them to service the grinder remotely, then revoke it when they're done. 
</p>

<p>
    The following sections describe three of many possible use cases for the Self-Sovereign Internet of Things. 
</p>

<a></a>
 Updating Firmware 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.embedded-computing.com/articles/firmware-security-for-iot-devices">problems with the CompuServe of Things</a> is securely updating device firmware. There are many different ways to approach secure firmware updates in the CompuServe of things—each manufacturer does it slightly differently. The SSIoT provides a standard way to know the firmware update is from the manufacturer and not a hacker.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 4: Updating the firmware in Alice's coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    As shown in Figure 4, Baratza has written a public DID to the ledger. They can use that public DID to sign firmware updates. Baratza embedded their public DID in the coffee grinder when it was manufactured. The coffee grinder can resolve the DID to look up Baratza's current public key on the ledger and validate the signature. This ensures that the firmware package is from Baratza. And DIDs allow Baratza to rotate their keys as needed without invalidating the DIDs stored in the devices.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, we could also solve this problem with digital certificates. So, this is really just table stakes. The advantage of using SSIoT for secure firmware updates instead of digital certificates is that if Baratza is using it for other things (see below), they get this for free without also having to support the certificate code in their products or pay for certificates.
</p>

<a></a>
 Proving Ownership 

<p>
    Alice can prove she owns a particular model of coffee grinder using a verifiable credential.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 5: Alice uses a credential to prove she owns the coffee grinder (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 5 shows how this could work. The coffee grinder's agent is running the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0028-introduce/README.md">Introduction</a> protocol and has introduced Alice to Baratza. This allows her to form a relationship with Baratza that is more trustworthy because it came on an introduction from something she trusts.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, Alice has received a credential from her coffee grinder stating that she is the owner. This is kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)">imprinting</a>. While it may not be secure enough for some use cases, for things like a coffee grinder, it's probably secure enough. Once Alice has this credential, she can use it to prove she's the owner. The most obvious place would be at Baratza itself to receive support, rewards, or other benefits. But other places might be interested in seeing it as well: "Prove you own a Baratza coffee grinder and get $1 off your bag of beans."
</p>


<a></a>
 Real Customer Service 

<p>
    We've all been in customer hell where we call a company, get put on hold, get ask a bunch of questions to validate who we are, have to recite serial numbers or model numbers to one agent, then another, and then lose the call and have to start all over again. Or been trapped in a seemingly endless IVR phone loop trying to even get to a human. 
</p>

<p>
    The DID-based relationship Alice has created with Baratza does away with that because DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication, reducing effort and increasing security. As a result, Alice has a trustworthy communication channel with Baratza that both parties can use to authenticate the other.  Furthermore, as we saw in <a>the last section</a>, Alice can prove she's a bona fide customer.
</p>

<p>
    But the ability of DIDComm messaging to support higher-level application protocols means that the experience can be much richer. Here's s simple example. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	Figure 6: Alice uses a specialized wallet to manage the vendors of things she owns (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In Figure 6, Alice has two coffee grinders. Let's further assume that Alice has a specialized wallet to interact with her things. <a href="https://searls.com">Doc Searls</a> has suggested we call it a "briefer" because it's more capable than a wallet. Alice's briefer does all the things her credential wallet can do, but also has a user interface for managing all the things she owns and the relationships she has with them3. Students in <a href="https://picolabs.io">my lab at BYU</a> have been working on a prototype of such an interface we call <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io">Manifold</a> using agent-enabled digital twins called "<a href="https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/overview?homepageId=1189866">picos</a>".
</p>

<p>
    Having two things manufactured by Baratza presents a problem when Alice wants to contact them because now she is the intermediary between the thing and its vendor. But if we flip that and let the thing be the intermediary, the problem is easily resolved. Now when Alice wants to contact Baratza, she clicks one button in her briefer and lets her coffee grinder intermediate the transaction. The grinder can interject relevant information into the conversation so Alice doesn't have to. Doc does a great job of describing why the "thing as conduit" model is so powerful in <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">Market intelligence that flows both ways</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You'll recall from <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/didcomm_and_the_self-sovereign_internet.shtml">DIDComm and the Self-Sovereign Internet</a>, that behind every wallet is one or more agents. Alice's briefer has an agent. And it has relationships with each of her things. Each of those has one or more agents. These agents are running an application protocol for vendor message routing. The protocol is using sub protocols that allow the grinder to act on Alice's behalf in customer support scenarios. You can imagine that CRM tools would be fitted out to understand these protocols as well. 
</p>

<p>
    There's at least one company working on this idea right now, <a href="https://www.hearro.com/">HearRo</a>. Vic Cooper, the CEO of HearRo recently told me:
</p>
<blockquote>Most communications happen in the context of a process. [Customers] have a vector that involves changing some state from A to B. "My thing is broken and I need it fixed." "I lost my thing and need to replace it." "I want a new thing and would like to pay for it but my card was declined." This is the story of the customer service call.  To deliver the lowest effort interaction, we need to know this story. We need to know why they are calling. To add the story to our context we need to do two things: capture the intent and manage the state over time. SSI has one more super power that we can take advantage of to handle the why part of our interaction. We can use SSI to operationalize the relationships.
</blockquote>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalized  relationships</a> provide persistence and context. When we include the product itself in the conversation, we can build customer service applications that are low effort because the trustworthy connection can include not only the who, but also the what to provide a more complete story. We saw this in the example with two coffee grinders. Knowing automatically which grinder Alice needs service for is a simple bit of context, but one that reduces effort nonetheless. 
</p>

<p>
    Going further, the interaction itself can be a <a href="http://picolabs.io/">persistent object</a> with it's own identity, and DID-based connections to the participants4. Now the customer and the company can bring tools to bear on the interaction. Others could be invited to join the interaction as necessary and the interaction itself now becomes a persistent nexus that evolves as the conversation does. I recently had a month long customer service interaction involving a few dozen calls with Schwab (don't ask). Most of the effort for me and them was reestablishing context over and over again. No CRM tool can provide that because it's entirely one-sided. Giving customers tools to operationalize customer relationships solves this problem. 
</p>

 A Self-Sovereign Internet of Things 

<p>
    The Sovrin Foundation has an IoT working group that recently released a <a href="https://sovrin.org/library-iot/">whitepaper on Self-Sovereign Identity and IoT</a>. In it you'll find a discussion of some problems with IoT and where SSI can help. The paper also has a section on the business value of SSI in IoT. The paper is primarily focused on how decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials can support IoT. The last use case I offer above goes beyond those, primarily identity-centric, use cases by employing DIDComm messaging to ease the burden of getting support for a product.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/12/relationships_in_the_self-sovereign_internet_of_things.shtml"> next blog post, I'll extend that idea to discuss how SSI agents that understand DIDComm messages can support relationships and interactions</a> not easily supported in the CompuServe of Things as well as play a bigger role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">vendor relationship management</a>. These and other scenarios can rescue us from an administrative, bureaucratic CompuServe of Things and create a generative IoT ecosystem that is truly internet-like. 
</p>


 

<a></a>
 Notes 
 
     Some argue that since things can't be sovereign (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.mq7pzglc1j96">Appendix B of the Sovrin Glossary for a taxonomy of entities</a>), they shouldn't be part of SSI. I take the selfish view that as a sovereign actor in the identity metasystem, I want my things to be part of that same ecosystem. Saying things are covered under the SSI umbrella doesn't imply they're sovereign, but merely says they are subject to the same overarching governance framework and use the same underlying protocols. In the next post on this subject, I'll make the case that even if things aren't sovereign, they should have an independent existence and identity from their owners and manufacturers.
     
     The choice of a coffee grinder is based simply on the fact that it was the example <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> gave when we were having a discussion about this topic recently.
     
     This idea has been on my mind for a while. This post from 2013, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/06/facebook_for_my_stuff.shtml">Facebook for My Stuff</a> discusses it in the "social" venacular of the day. 
         The idea that a customer service interaction might itself be a participant in the SSIoT may cause some to shake their heads. But once we create a true internet of things, it's <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/pot_holes_and_picos.shtml">not just material, connected things that will be on it</a>. The interaction object could have its own digital wallet, store credentials, and allow all participants to continue to interact with it over time, maintaining context, providing workflow, and serving as a record that everyone involved can access.

<p>This year, the IndieWeb community has been making progress on iterating and evolving the IndieAuth protocol. IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables it to work with personal websites and in a decentralized environment.</p>

<p>There are already a good number of IndieAuth providers and apps, including a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Wordpress_IndieAuth_Plugin">WordPress plugin</a>, a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/indieweb">Drupal module</a>, and built-in support in <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, <a href="https://withknown.com/">Known</a> and <a href="https://dobrado.net/">Dobrado</a>. Ideally, we'd have even more first-class support for IndieAuth in a variety of different blogging platforms and personal websites, and that's been the goal motivating the spec updates this year. We've been focusing on simplifying the protocol and bringing it more in line with OAuth 2.0 so that it's both easier to understand and also easier to adapt existing OAuth clients and servers to add IndieAuth support.</p>

<p>Most of the changes this year have removed IndieAuth-specific bits to reuse things from OAuth when possible, and cleaning up the text of the spec. These changes are also intended to be backwards compatible as much as possible, so that existing clients and servers can upgrade independently.</p>

<p>This post describes the high level changes to the protocol, and is meant to help implementers get an idea of what may need to be updated with existing implementations.</p>

<p>If you would like an introduction to IndieAuth and OAuth, here are a few resources:</p>

 
 <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web">IndieAuth: OAuth for the Open Web</a>

 <a href="https://oauth2simplified.com">OAuth 2.0 Simplified</a>, the book 
 <a href="https://indieauth.net/">indieauth.net</a> 
 

<p>The rest of this post details the specifics of the changes and what they mean to client and server developers. If you've written an IndieAuth client or server, you'll definitely want to read this post to know what you'll need to change for the latest updates.</p>

 <a>Adding PKCE Support</a> 
 <a>Grant Type Parameters</a> 
 <a>Providing "me" in the Token Request</a> 
 <a>Removing Same-Domain Requirement</a> 
 <a>Returning Profile Information</a> 
 <a>Editorial Changes</a> 
 <a>Dropped Features and Text</a> 
 

 Response Type 

<p>The first thing an IndieAuth client does is discover the user's authorization endpoint and redirect the user to their server to authorize the client. There are two possible ways a client might be wanting to use IndieAuth, either to confirm the website of the user who just logged in, or to get an access token to be able to create posts on their website.</p>

<p>Previously, this distinction was made at this stage of the request by varying the <code>response_type</code> query string parameter. Instead, the <code>response_type</code> parameter is now always <code>response_type=code</code> which brings it in line with the OAuth 2.0 specification. This makes sense because the response of this request is always an authorization code, it's only after the authorization code is used that the difference between these two uses will be apparent.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send <code>response_type=code</code> in the initial <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Only accept <code>response_type=code</code> requests, and for backwards-compatible support, treat <code>response_type=id</code> requests as <code>response_type=code</code> requests.</p>

 Indicating the User who is Logging In 

<p>In earlier versions of the specification, the authorization request was required to have the parameter <code>me</code>, the value of which was whatever URL the user entered into the client to start the flow. It turns out that this parameter isn't strictly necessary for the flow to succeed, however it still can help improve the user experience in some cases. As such, it has now been changed to an optional parameter.</p>

<p>This parameter is a way for the client to tell the IndieAuth server which user it expects will log in. For single-user sites this value is completely unnecessary, since there is only ever one <code>me</code> URL that will be returned in the end. It turns out that most single-user implementations were already ignoring this parameter anyway since it served no purpose.</p>

<p>For multi-user websites like a multi-author WordPress blog, this parameter also served little purpose. If a user was already logged in to their WordPress site, then tried to log in to an IndieAuth client, the server could just ignore this parameter anyway and return the logged-in user's <code>me</code> URL at the end of the flow.</p>

<p>For multi-user authorization endpoints like the (to-be deprecated) indieauth.com, this parameter served as a hint of who was trying to log in, so that the authorization server could provide a list of authentication options to the user. This is the only case in which this parameter really provides a user experience benefit, since without the parameter at this stage, the user would need to type in their website again, or be shown a list of authentication provider options such as "log in with Twitter".</p>

<p>There's yet another case where the user may enter just the domain of their website, even though their final <code>me</code> URL may be something more specific. For example, a user can enter <code>micro.blog</code> in an IndieAuth sign-in prompt, and eventually be logged in to that app as <code>https://micro.blog/username</code>. There is no requirement that the thing they type in to clients has to be an exact match of their actual profile URL, which allows a much nicer user experience so that users can type only the domain of their service provider which may provide profiles for multiple users. And in this case, the client providing the <code>me</code> URL to the server also doesn't serve any purpose.</p>

<p>The change to the spec makes the <code>me</code> parameter in the authorization request optional. In this sense, it's more of a hint from the client about who is trying to log in. Obviously the server can't trust that value in the request at this point, since the user hasn't logged in yet, so it really is more of a hint than anything else.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Continue to include the <code>me</code> parameter in the request if you can, but if you are using an OAuth client that doesn't let you customize this request, it's okay to leave it out now.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Most servers were already ignoring this parameter anyway, so if you fell into that category then no change is needed. If you were expecting this parameter to exist, change it to optional, because you probably don't actually need it. If it's present in a request, you can use it to influence the options you show for someone to authenticate if they are not yet logged in, or you could show an error message if the client provides a <code>me</code> URL that doesn't match the currently logged-in user.</p>

 Adding PKCE Support 

<p>Probably the biggest change to the spec is the addition of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) mechanism. This is an extension to OAuth 2.0 that solves a number of different vulnerabilities. It was originally designed to allow mobile apps to securely complete an OAuth flow without a client secret, but has since proven to be useful for JavaScript apps and even solves a particular attack even if the client does have a client secret.</p>

<p>Since IndieAuth clients are all considered "Public Clients" in OAuth terms, there are no preregistered client secrets at all, and PKCE becomes a very useful mechanism to secure the flow.</p>

<p>I won't go into the details of the particular attacks PKCE solves in this post, since I've talked about them a lot in other talks and videos. If you'd like to learn more about this, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/td00HpMI3Q8?t=38">sketch notes video</a> where I talk about PKCE and my coworker draws sketchnotes on his iPad.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, PKCE is a very useful mechanism, isn't terribly complicated to implement, and can be added independently by clients and servers since it's designed to be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>The change to the spec is that PKCE has been rolled into the core authorization flow. Incidentally, the OAuth spec itself is making the same change by rolling PKCE in to the <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> update.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always include the PKCE parameters <code>code_challenge</code> and <code>code_challenge_method</code> in the <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-request">authorization request</a>.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: If a <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in an authorization request, don't allow the authorization code to be used unless the corresponding <code>code_verifier</code> is present in the request using the authorization code. For backwards compatibility, if no <code>code_challenge</code> is provided in the request, make sure the request to use the authorization code does not contain a <code>code_verifier</code>.</p>

 Using an Authorization Code 

<p>Whew, okay, you've made it this far and you've sent the user off to their authorization endpoint to log in. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to your application. Now you're ready to use that authorization code to either get an access token or confirm their <code>me</code> URL.</p>

<p>There are two changes to this step, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#redeeming-the-authorization-code">redeeming the authorization code</a>.</p>

 Grant Type Parameters 

<p>The first change, while minor, brings IndieAuth in line with OAuth 2.0 since apparently this hadn't been actually specified before. This request must now contain the POST body parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Always send the parameter <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code> when redeeming an authorization code. Generic OAuth 2.0 clients will already be doing this.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For backwards compatibility, treat the omission of this parameter the same as providing it with <code>grant_type=authorization_code</code>. For example if you also accept requests with <code>grant_type=refresh_token</code>, the absence of this parameter means the client is doing an authorization code grant.</p>

 Providing "me" in the Token Request 

<p>The request when using an authorization code, either to the token endpoint or authorization endpoint, previously required that the client send the <code>me</code> parameter as well. The change to the spec drops this parameter from this request, making it the same as an OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>This has only some minor implications in very specific scenarios. We analyzed all the known IndieAuth implementations and found that the vast majority of them were already ignoring this parameter anyway. For single-user endpoints, the additional parameter provides no value, since the endpoint would be self-contained anyway, and already know how to validate authorization codes. Even multi-user endpoints like the WordPress plugin would know how to validate authorization codes because the authorization and token endpoints are part of the same software.</p>

<p>The only implementations leaving this parameter out would break are separate implementations of authorization endpoints and token endpoints, where the user has no prior relationship with either. The biggest offender of this is actually my own implementation which I am eventually going to retire, indieauth.com and tokens.indieauth.com. I initially wrote indieauth.com as just the authorization endpoint part, and later added tokens.indieauth.com as a completely separate implementation, it shares nothing in common with indieauth.com and is actually entirely stateless. Over the years, it turns out this pattern hasn't actually been particularly useful, since a website is either going to build both endpoints or delegate both to an external service. So in practice, the only people using tokens.indieauth.com were using it with the indieauth.com authorization endpoint.</p>

<p>Removing this parameter has no effect on most of the implementations. I did have to update my own implementation of tokens.indieauth.com to default to verifying authorization codes at indieauth.com if there was no <code>me</code> parameter, which so far has been sccessful.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: No need to send the <code>me</code> parameter when exchanging an authorization code. This makes the request the same as a generic OAuth 2.0 request.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: For servers that have an authorization endpoint and token endpoint as part of the same software, make sure your token endpoint knows how to look up authorization codes. Most of the time this is likely what you're already doing anyway, and you were probably ignoring the <code>me</code> parameter already. If you do want to provide a standalone token endpoint, you'll need to create your own encoding scheme to bake in the authorization endpoint or <code>me</code> value into the authorization code itself. But for the vast majority of people this will require no change.</p>

 Removing Same-Domain Requirement 

<p>One of the challenges of a decentralized protocol like this is knowing who to trust to make assertions about who. Just because someone's authorization server claims that a user identified as "https://aaronpk.com/" logged in doesn't mean I actually did log in. Only my authorization server should be trusted to assert that I logged in.</p>

<p>In the previous version of the spec, the way this was enforced was that clients had to check that the final <code>me</code> URL returned had a matching domain as what the user initially entered, after following redirects. That means if I entered <code>aaronpk.com</code> into the client, and that redirected to <code>https://aaronparecki.com/</code>, the client would then expect the final profile URL returned at the end to also be on <code>aaronparecki.com</code>. This works, but it has a few challenges and limitations.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for client developers was keeping track of the chain of redirects. There were actually separate rules for temporary vs permanent redirects, and the client would have to be aware of each step in the redirect chain if there was more than one. Then at the end, the client would have to parse the final profile URL to find the host component, then check if that matches, and it turns out that there are often some pretty <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/395845">low</a>-level <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/305974">bugs</a> with <a href="https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2016-8624.html">parsing</a> URLs in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31429439/parsing-an-url-without-a-path-but-with-a-slash-in-the-query">variety</a> of languages that can lead to unexpected security flaws.</p>

<p>On top of the technical challenges for client developers, there was another problem in the specific case where a user may control only a subfolder of a domain. For example in a shared hosting environment where users can upload arbitrary files to their user directory, <code>https://example.com/~user</code>, the same-domain restriction would still let <code>/~user1</code> claim to be <code>/~user2</code> on that domain. We didn't want to go down the route of adding more URL parsing rules like checking for substring matches, as that would likely have led to even more of a burden on client developers and more risk of security holes.</p>

<p>So instead, this entire restriction has been replaced with a new way of verifying that the final profile URL is legitimate. The new rule should drastically simplify the client code, at the slight cost of a possible additional HTTP request.</p>

<p>The new rule is that if the final profile URL returned by the authorization endpoint is not an exact match of the initially entered URL, the client has to go discover the authorization endpoint at the new URL and verify that it matches the authorization endpoint it used for the flow. This is described in a new section of the spec, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>This change means clients no longer need to keep track of the full redirect chain (although they still can if they would like more opportunities to possibly skip that last HTTP request), and also ensures users on shared domains can't impersonate other users on that domain.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: Remove any code around parsing the initial and final URLs, and add a new step after receiving the user's final profile URL: If the final profile URL doesn't match exactly what was used to start the flow, then go fetch that URL and discover the authorization endpoint and confirm that the discovered authorization endpoint matches the one used at the beginning. Please read <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization-server-confirmation">Authorization Server Confirmation</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: No change.</p>

 Returning Profile Information 

<p>If the application would like to know more about the user than just their confirmed profile URL, such as their name or photo, previously there was no easy or reliable way to find this information. It's possible the user's profile URL may have an <code>h-card</code> with their info, but that would only include public info and would require bringing in a Microformats parser and making another HTTP request to find this information.</p>

<p>In the latest version of the spec, we've added a <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#profile-information">new section</a> returned in the response when redeeming an authorization code for the authorization server to return this profile data directly. To request this information, there are now two scopes defined in the spec, <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code>. When the client requests the <code>profile</code> scope, this indicates the client would like the server to return the user's <code>name</code>, <code>photo</code> and <code>url</code>. The <code>email</code> scope requests the user's email address.</p>

<p>The response when redeeming an authorization code that was issued with these scopes will now contain an additional property, <code>profile</code>, alongside the <code>me</code> URL and access token.</p>

 <code>{
  "access_token": "XXXXXX",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "scope": "profile email create",
  "me": "https://user.example.net/",
  "profile": {
    "name": "Example User",
    "url": "https://user.example.net/",
    "photo": "https://user.example.net/photo.jpg",
    "email": "user@example.net"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This comes with some caveats. As is always the case with OAuth, just because a client requests certain scopes does not guarantee the request will be granted. The user or the authorization server may decide to not honor the request and leave this information out. For example a user may choose to not share their email even if the app requests it.</p>

<p>Additionally, the information in this <code>profile</code> section is not guaranteed to be "real" or "verified" in any way. It is merely information that the user intends to share with the app. This means everything from the user sharing different email addresses with different apps, or the URL in the profile being a completely different website. For example a multi-author WordPress blog which provides <code>me</code> URLs on the WordPress site's domain, <code>example.com</code>, may return the author's own personal website in the <code>url</code> property of the profile information. The client is not allowed to treat this information as authoritative or many any policy decisions based on the profile information, it's for informational purposes only. Another common vulnerability in many existing OAuth clients is that they assume the provider has confirmed the email address returned and will use that to deduplicate accounts. This has the problem of if a user can edit their email address and have it returned in an OAuth response without the server confirming it, the client may end up being tricked into thinking a different user logged in. Only the <code>me</code> URL is the one that can be trusted as the stable identifier of the user, and everything in the <code>profile</code> section should be treated as if it were hand-entered into the client.</p>

<p>Changes for clients: If you would like to find the user's profile information, include the <code>profile</code> or <code>email</code> scope in your authorization request. If you don't need this, then no changes are necessary.</p>

<p>Changes for servers: Authorization servers should be able to recognize the <code>profile</code> and <code>email</code> scopes in a request, and ask the user for permission to share their profile information with clients, then return that along with the final <code>me</code> URL and access token. It's also completely acceptable to not support this feature at all, as clients shouldn't be relying on the presence of this information in the response anyway.</p>

 Editorial Changes 

<p>There was a good amount of work done to clean up the text of the spec without changing any of the actual requirements. These are known as editorial changes.</p>

<p>The term "domain" has been replaced with the more accurate term "host" in most places. This matches the URL spec more closely, and reduces the confusion around registerable domain like <code>example.com</code> or <code>example.co.uk</code> and subdomains. In all cases, there has been no need to use the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/">public suffix list</a> because we have always meant full hostname matches.</p>

<p>Language around the term "profile URL" was cleaned up to make sure only the final URL returned by the authorization server is referred to as the "profile URL". The user may enter lots of different things into the client that might not be their profile URL, anything from just a hostname (<code>aaronpk.com</code>) to a URL that redirects to their profile URL. This cleans up the language to better clarify what we mean by "profile URL".</p>

<p>With the change to use <code>response_type=code</code> for both versions of the flow, it meant the authorization and authentication sections were almost entirely duplicate content. These have been consolidated into a single section, <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/#authorization">Authorization</a>, and the only difference now is the response when the authorization code is redeemed.</p>

 Dropped Features and Text 

<p>Any time you can cut text from a spec and have it mean the same thing is a good thing. Thankfully we were able to cut a decent amount of text thanks to consolidating the two sections mentioned above. We also dropped an obscure feature that was extremely under-utilized. For the case where a token endpoint and authorization endpoint were not part of the same software, there was a section describing how those two could communicate so that the token endpoint could validate authorization codes issued by an arbitrary authorization endpoint. This serves no purpose if a single piece of software provided both endpoints since it would be far more efficient to have the token endpoint look up the authorization code in the database or however you're storing them, so virtually nobody had even bothered to implement this.</p>

<p>The only known implementations of this feature were my own <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code>, and Martijn's <code>mintoken</code> project. <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/44">We both agreed</a> that if we did want to pursue this feature in the future, we could write it up as an extension. Personally I plan on shutting down <code>indieauth.com</code> and <code>tokens.indieauth.com</code> in the near-ish future anyway, and the replacement that I build will contain both endpoints anyway, so I don't really plan on revisiting this topic anyway.</p>

 Conclusion / Future Work 

<p>Well if you've made it this far, congrats! I hope this post was helpful. This was definitely a good amount of changes, although hopefully all for good reasons and should simplify the process of developing IndieAuth clients and servers in the future.</p>

<p>We didn't get to every open IndieAuth issue in this round of updates, there are still a few interesting ones open that I would like to see addressed. The next largest change that will affect implementations would be to continue to bring this in line with OAuth 2.0 and always <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/58">redeem the authorization code at the token endpoint</a> even if no access token is expected to be returned. That would also have the added benefit of simplifying the authorization endpoint implementation to only need to worry about providing the authorization UI, leaving all the JSON responses to the token endpoint. This still requires some discussion and a plan for upgrading to this new model, so feel free to chime in on the discussions!</p>

<p>I would like to give a huge thank-you to everyone who has participated in the discussions this year, both on GitHub and in our virtual meetings! All the feedback from everyone who is interested in the spec has been extremely valuable!</p>

<p>We'll likely schedule some more sessions to continue development on the spec, so keep an eye on <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/tag/indieauth">events.indieweb.org</a> for upcoming events tagged #indieauth!</p>

<p>
    Recently, I've been making the case for self-sovereign identity and why it is the correct architecture for online identity systems.
</p>

 
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a>, I discuss why identity systems are really built to manage relationships rather than identities. I also show how the architecture of the identity system affects the three important properties relationships must have to function effectively: integrity, lifespan, and utility.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> I introduced a classification scheme that broadly categorized identity systems into one of three broad architectures: administrative, algorithmic, or autonomic.  
     In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>, I discuss how the architecture of an identity system affects the authenticity of the relationships it manages. 
 

<p>
   This post focuses how people can operationalize the relationships they are party to and become full fledged participants online. Last week, Doc Searls posted <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">What SSI Needs</a> where he recalls how the graphical web browser was the catalyst for making the web real. Free (in both the beer and freedom senses) and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">substitutable</a>, browsers provided the spark that gave rise to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_systems">generative</a> qualities that ignited an explosion of innovation.  Doc goes on to posit that the SSI equivalent of the web browser is what we have <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">called a "wallet"</a> since it holds, analogously to your physical wallet, credentials.
</p>

<p>
    The SSI wallet Doc is discussing is the tool people use to operationalize their digital relationships. I created the following picture to help illustrate how the wallet fulfills that purpose.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Relationships and Interactions in Sovrin Network (click to enlarge)


<p>
    This figure shows the relationships and interactions in SSI networks enabled by the Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> protocols. The most complete example of these protocols in production is the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the figure, Alice has an SSI wallet1. She uses the wallet to manage her relationships with Bob and Carol as well as a host of organizations. Bob and Carol also have wallets. They have a relationship with each other and Carol has a relationship with Bravo Corp, just as Alice does2.  These relationships are enabled by <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">autonomic identifiers</a> in the form of peer DIDs (blue arrows).  The SSI wallet each participant uses provides a consistent user experience, like the browser did for the Web. People using wallets don't see the DIDs (identifiers) but rather the connections they have to other people, organizations, and things. 
</p>

<p>
    These autonomic relationships are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml#autonomic">self-certifying</a> meaning they don't rely on any third party for their trust basis. They are also mutually authenticating: each of the parties in the relationship can authenticate the other. Further, these relationships create a secure communications channel using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm protocol</a>. Because of the built-in mutual authentication, DIDComm messaging creates a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml"> batphone-like experience</a> wherein each participant knows they are communicating with the right party without the need for further authentication. As a result, Alice has trustworthy communication channels with everyone with whom she has a peer DID relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    Alice, as mentioned, also has a relationship with various organizations. One of them, Attester Org, has issued a verifiable credential to Alice. They issued the credential (green arrows) using the Aries credential exchange protocol that runs on top of the DIDComm-based communication channel enabled by the peer DID relationship Alice has with Attester. The credential they issue is founded on the credential definition and public DID (an algorithmic identifier) that Attester Org wrote to the ledger.
</p>

<p>
    When Alice later needs to prove something (e.g. her address) to Certiphi Corp, she presents the proof over the DIDComm protocol, again enabled by the peer DID relationship she has with Certiphi Corp. Certiphi is able to validate the fidelity of the credential by reading the credential definition from the ledger, retrieving Attester Org's public DID from the credential definition, and resolving it to get Attester Org's public key to check the credential's signature. At the same time, Certiphi can use cryptography to know that the credential is being presented by the person it was issued to and that it hasn't been revoked.
</p>

<p>
    This diagram has elements of each architectural style described <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>.
</p>

 
     Alice has relationships with five different entities: her friends Bob and Carol as well as three different organizations. These relationships are based on autonomic identifiers in the form of peer DIDs. All of the organizations use enterprise wallets to manage autonomic relationships4.  

   As a credential issuer, Attester Org has an algorithmic identifier in the form of a public DID that has been recorded on the ledger. The use of  algorithmic identifiers on a ledger3 allows public discovery of the credential definition and the public DID by Certiphi Corp when it validates the credential. The use of a ledger for this purpose is not optional unless we give up the loose coupling it provides. Loose coupling provides scalability, flexibility, and isolation. Isolation is critical to the privacy protections that verifiable credential exchange via Aries promises.  

   Each company will keep track of attributes and other properties they need for the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml#utility">relationship to provide the needed utility</a>. These are administrative systems since they are administered by the organization for their own purpose and their root of trust is a database managed by the organization. The difference between these administrative systems and those common in online identity today is that only the organization is depending on them. People have their own autonomic root of trust in the key event log that supports their wallet.  
 

<p>
    Alice's SSI wallet allows her to create, manage, and utilize secure, trustworthy communications channels with anyone online without reliance on any third party. Alice's wallet is also the place where specific, protocol-enabled interactions like credential exchange happen. The wallet is flexible tool that Alice uses to manage her digital life. 
</p>

<p>
    We have plenty of online relationships today, but they are not operational because we are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">prevented from acting by their anemic natures</a>. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online</a>. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so within some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. The SSI wallet is the platform upon which people can stand and become digitally embodied to operationalize their digital life as full-fledged participants in the digital realm.
</p>

 

<a></a>
 Notes 

 
     Alice's SSI wallet is like other wallets she has on her phone with several important differences. First, it is enabled by open protocols and second, it is entirely under her control. I'm using the term "wallet" fairly loosely here to denote not only the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">wallet</a> but also the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">agent</a> necessary for the interactions in an SSI ecosystem. For purposes of this post, delineating them isn't important. In particular, Alice may not be aware of the agent, but she will know about her wallet and see it as the tool she uses.  
     Note that Bob doesn't have a relationship with any of the organizations shown. Each participant has the set of relationships they choose to have to meet their differing circumstances and needs. 
     I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others.  
     Enterprise wallets speak the same protocols as the wallets people use, but are adapted to the increased scale an enterprise would likely need and are designed to be integrated with the enterprise's other administrative systems.

<p>This article takes the mental models of identity and explores how they can be achieved with a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution.</p><p>To pin down the meaning and definition of identity is a challenging task due to its uniquely human nature. It can have totally different meanings for different people. However, there are reoccurring themes when speaking about the term. The following five mental models describe what people refer to, when speaking about identity and provide a useful structure of how these models can be executed in a digital environment leveraging SSI infrastructure and components. While the concept of SSI can be applied for individuals, legal entities and things alike, the following paragraph solely focuses on individuals and explains how these models can serve as a guideline for SSI implementations. The five mental models were published by <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/mental-models.md">experts of the RWOT community</a> and are quoted in the following paragraphs.</p>Mental models of identity. Image source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> Space-time <p>“The space-time mental model sees identity as resolving the question of the physical continuity of an entity through space and time. (…) It answers the question: Does the physical body under evaluation have a continuous link through space and time to a known&nbsp;entity?”</p><p>An identity is established in the past, it acts in the present and continues to be useful in the future. To secure the sum of recorded interactions and relationships in digital form one requires a backup when using a wallet, which stores the identity data and their associated cryptographic keys locally on the device of the user. This backup enables the user to restore the received credentials as well as established relationships. When losing access to the wallet, the backup enables the user to reestablish the aspects described in the space-time mental model. A backup generally consists of the identity data itself and a key, which is used to en- and decrypt the backup&nbsp;data.</p> Presentation <p>“The presentation mental model sees identity as how we present ourselves to society. This is the mental model behind Vendor Relationship Management, user-centric identity, and self-sovereign identity. (…) It answers the question: Is this how the subject chooses to be&nbsp;known?”</p><p>Individuals can choose, which information about them should be known by third parties or the public. The granularity of this information varies dependent on the social context. While one might only want to provide the required minimum of information to a government authority, one might have the desire to share very personal details with a certain social circle such as family or friends. Hence, the user requires different social profiles and circles, which help to present the right information to the target audience. Since one part of a SSI ecosystem is the creation of trusted peer to peer relationships, these contacts can be sorted by the user and allocated to a social circle according to the preferences of the individual.</p><p>However, when it comes to the sharing of information it gets tricky. There are currently no SSI implementations with enable a user-experience similar to current social media platforms. Hence, the presentation of information is currently limited to one contact at a&nbsp;time.</p> Attribute <p>“The attribute mental model sees identity as the set of attributes related to an entity as recorded in a specific system. Enshrined in ISO/IEC 24760–1, an international standard for identity management, this mental model is the primary focus for many engineers. (…) It answers the question: Who is this data&nbsp;about?”</p><p>From a birth certificate to a university degree or a language certification, we collect a variety of credentials, which attest certain information about us. The sum of all these credentials can also be seen as one mental model of identity. These credentials are issued, stored and managed by the individual and are standardized within the specification of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials data model 1.0 by the W3C</a>. It is the only mental model with a formal specification.</p><p>SSI implementations use cryptography to provide the necessary proofs that presented information is about the individual in question. There are different options of implementations to ensure that a certain identifier relates to the specific person, however most implementations use decentralised identifiers (DIDs) to identify the identity&nbsp;subject.</p> Relationship <p>“The relationship mental model sees identity emerging through interactions and relationships with others. Our identity is not about what we are in isolation from others, but is rather defined by the relationships we have. This is the fundamental model in the South African idea of ‘Ubuntu’, meaning ‘I am because we are.’ (…) It answers the question: How is this person related?”</p><p>The relationship to other individuals or entities can help to determine the status of a person within society. We can observe different domains of relationships, which depend on the social context like a professional, official, legal, personal, public, business or employment context to name a few. For example a representative of a government like a diplomat has special rights and obligations due to this relationship. Depended on the context, e.g. an interview of said diplomat, it can touch multiple domains by being an official interview, with legal consequences, which is presented to the public and can have a direct effect on the employment relation for the diplomat. Generally, individuals initiate and maintain hundreds or even thousands of relationships to different entities. An SSI solution enables an individual to initiate this relationship by accepting or requesting a connection. Once established this connection serves as communication channel to facilitate the exchange of (verified) information between the two parties. Since both parties are able to validate the identity of the other party it enables the necessary trust in a digital environment. However, a the establishment of a connection isn’t necessary and credentials can also be issued or requested without one. There are special protocols, which standardise the credential exchange and communication between two entities like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DiDcomm protocol</a>.</p> Capability <p>“The capability mental model pragmatically defines identity in terms of an individual’s capability to perform some task, including their physical ability now, in the past, or in the future. It is the inevitable approach for anyone in an emergency. (…) It answers the question: What can the subject actually&nbsp;do?”</p><p>The primary reason why an identity is required in the online world in the first place are the capabilities that come with it. Without an identity one is still able to browse the web and gather information, however when it comes to online shopping, banking, government applications, employee portals, access control and many other aspects, an identity is necessary to execute those actions. Not all actions require a verified identity. In most cases a self-attested identity is sufficient for the verifier. However, there are multiple cases for which the verifier either has a legitimate interest for only allowing access to verified parties or is obligated by law to verify the identity of an individual. An example for the first case can be access to information for a specific audience like a university, which wants to grant students access to internal documents. The students would not be required to verify their identity every time they want to access the repository, but instead only need to prove that they are a student of said university, without disclosing further personal details. The second case includes telecommunication providers, or financial institutions, which need to comply with know your costumer (KYC) regulations.</p> Mindmap of the mental models enabled by&nbsp;SSI Mindmap: Mental models of identity enabled by SSI.

Source: SSI Ambassador / Adrian&nbsp;Doerk<p>To conclude it can be said, that all mental models of SSI can be enabled to a certain degree, however when it comes to the space-time (backup) mental model or the presentation (social network) model, we also see that the integration of the concept is quite nascent and requires more development to be comparable with current centralised alternatives.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article does not represent the official view of any entity, which is mentioned in this article or which is affiliated with the author.

   <p>The linkage between principles and rules is not clear because we have created so many words and variances in language that there is significant confusion. We are often confused about what we mean as we are very inconsistent in how we apply words and language, often to provide a benefit to ourselves or justify our belief. To unpack the relationships we need to look at definitions, but we have to accept that even definitions are inconsistent. Our conformational bias is going to fight us, as we want to believe what we already know, rather than expand our thinking.</p> <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/in-digital-age-how-can-we-reconnect.html">(building on orignal article with Kaliyia)</a>  Are we imagining principles or values?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Worth noting our principles are defined by our values. Much like ethics (group beliefs) and morals (personal beliefs) and how in a complex adaptive system my morals affect the group’s ethics and a group’s ethics changes my morals. Situational awareness and experience play a significant part in what you believe right now, and what the group or society believes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o4DCO95oqzY/X8jXDWBHwwI/AAAAAAAABPw/QPfeCF53Br4yhl4tYdGGbU3orr12RTaawCLcBGAsYHQ/Screenshot%2B2020-11-23%2B141123.png"></a></p><p>Values can be adaptable by context whereas principles are fixed for a period, withstanding the test of time.&nbsp; When setting up a framework where we are setting our principles implies that we are saying that we don’t want them to change every day, week, month, year, that they are good and stable for a generation but we can adapt/ revise/ adjust principles based on learning.&nbsp; Fundamentally principles are based on values which do change, so there are ebbs and flows of conflict between them, this means we frame principles and often refuse to see that they are not future proof forever.&nbsp; Indeed the further a principle is away from the time it was created, the less it will have in common with values.&nbsp;</p> Are we confusing principles and rules?&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Considering characteristics, conceptually principles are abstract and universal whereas a rule is specific and particular. Principles cope with exceptions, rules need another rule.&nbsp; Principles provide the power of thought and decision making, rules prevent thought and discretion.&nbsp; Principles need knowledge and experience to deliver outcomes, rules don’t.&nbsp; Principles cope with risk, conflict and abstraction; conflict is not possible for a rule, it is this rule or a rule is needed.&nbsp;</p><p></p> <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Yj9HHNCyphw/X8jXM9LLAeI/AAAAAAAABP0/b-mXkRMofagbF3axiVZhCQyWZ-P6_qkhwCLcBGAsYHQ/Screenshot%2B2020-11-23%2B141111.png"></a> <br><p></p><p>The word “rule” needs some more unpacking as it can take on many meanings. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/rule">The history and origin of the word “Rule” is here</a>.&nbsp; The choice of the word rule is designed to be ambitious, allowing the reader to apply your own context, thereby creating more relevance to your own circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>For me, you or someone;</p>  <p>Rules are written or unwritten or both</p>  <p>Rules are mine, created by me that you need to follow. They are yours, crafted by you that you need me to obey. They are shared and we believe that they create a better society</p>  <p>Rules can be the law, just a guide, the standard you need to meet or the rituals that creates success.&nbsp; But which law, they one we should not break or the one where we follow the spirit?&nbsp; As a guide to guide me from here to where.&nbsp; As a standard is that absolute or is a range good enough.&nbsp; My rituals, did I learn them, did you teach me or somehow are they just there?</p>  <p>Rules equally give you more freedom (safety, less murder) and remove your freedom (choice). Rules give me more agency and at the same time remove it.</p>  <p>Rules define my boundaries but are the ones I have created for myself and I have continually refined them as I learn, or are my rules ones that come from history; because we have always done it this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rules are they creating my view on values or are the rules I have someone else’s values?</p>  <p>Rules are only there to be broken</p>  <p>Rules allow me to create something as I have done something, have experience and have learnt. Rules allow me to repeat and not make the same mistake or improve and adapt.&nbsp; Rules save me time and energy - I love my heuristics</p>  <p>Rules allow me to manage, prevent and control risk</p>  <p>But whose rules are they?</p><p>Back to the relationship between rules and principles.&nbsp; In companies and for a social policy we set rules and principles into matrices as below.&nbsp; Asking is it better to break rules or comply, is better to uphold principle or challenge them.&nbsp; This helps us to define where social norms stop and laws are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A review round the four quadrants highlights that there is no favourable sector and indeed as a society who wants to get improve, we continually travel through all of them.&nbsp; Companies and executives often feel that upholding principles and obeyed rules (top right) creates the best culture, but also ask the organisation to be adaptive, agile and innovative.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that principles are based on values, the leadership team will be instrumental into how upheld the principles are. Whereas the companies level of documentation for processes, procedures and rules will define what is to be obeyed, the culture of the top team will determine if they are to be obeyed or not.&nbsp;</p><p>The matrix below thinks about the combinations of values and principles. Where values are either mine as an individual or we as a collective society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p> <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7_kyLB6I9F0/X9sNdhc_geI/AAAAAAAABQY/9amGEb6O_CYtJjjsA1-LuXjlL6ej-BJgQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1054/Screenshot%2B2020-12-17%2B074833.png"></a> <br><br><p></p><p>The fundamental issue with the two representations (rules or values and principles)&nbsp; is that they cannot highlight the dynamic nature of the relationship between them.&nbsp; By example, our collective values help normalise an individuals bias and that collective values informs and refine principles.&nbsp; Indeed as principles become extreme and too restrictive say as our collective values become too godly, our collective values opt to no-longer uphold them. &nbsp; When our individualism leads to the falling apart of society we raise the bar to create better virtues as it makes us more content, loved and at peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Movement within the “stable compromise” domain has been explored many times but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history </a>expands it very well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, a rules-based approach prescribes or describes in detail a set of rules and how to behave based on known and agreed principles. Whereas a principle-based approach develops principles which set the limits that enable controls, measures, procedures on how to achieve that outcome is left for each organisation to determine.</p> Risk frameworks help us to connect principles and rules <p>Having explored that a rules-based approach prescribes in detail the rules, methods, procedures, processes and tasks on how to behave and act, whereas a principle-based approach to creating outcomes crafts principles that frame boundaries, leaving the individual or organisation to determine its own interruption.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In a linear system, we would agree on principles which would bound the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>In a non-linear system, we would agree on the principles, which would bound the rules and as we learn from the rules we would refine the principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>In a complex adaptive system, we are changing principles, as our values change because of the rules which are continually be modified to cope with the response to the rules.</p>  <p>This post is titled “In a digital age, how can we reconnect values, principles and rules?” and the obvious reason is that rules change, values, which change principles that means our rules need to be updated. However, this process of learning and adoption depends on understanding the connection which offers closed-loop feedback. &nbsp;An effective connection is our risk frameworks.</p><br><p>The diagram below places rules and principles at two extremes. As already explored we move from principles to rules but rarely go back to rethink our principles, principally because of the time.&nbsp; Rules should refine and improve in real-time,&nbsp; principles are generational.&nbsp; However to create and refine rules we use and apply a risk framework.&nbsp; The risk framework identifies risk and to help us manage it, we create rules that are capable of ensuring we get the right data/ information to be able to determine if we have control over risk. &nbsp; As humans, we are not experts in always forecasting the unimagined and so when we implement rules things break and clever minds think how to bend, break or avoid them.&nbsp; To that end we create more rules to manage exceptions.&nbsp; However, occasionally we need to check that our rules are aligned to our principles and indeed go back and check and refine our principles.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Starting from “Principles” these are anchored in ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity">Human Dignity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity_(European_Union)">Subsidiarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity">Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_theology">Covenantal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">The common good</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship">Stewardship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Equality">Equality</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once we decide that one or more of these should anchor our principles and form a north star, a direction to travel in and towards. The reason to agree on the Principle(s) is that collectively we agree on a commitment to get to a better place. We state our principles as an ambition, goal, target with allow us to understand, manage and control uncertainty using a risk framework. The risk framework frame or bounds the risk we are prepared to take.&nbsp; The risk framework enables us to define rules that get to our known outcomes.&nbsp; We implement the rules to create controls using regulation, code and standards. Our risk frameworks use tools to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on the risk, the delta in risk and compliance with the rules.&nbsp; Whilst all is good we use the risk framework to create more rules and better framing and boundaries, creating better outcomes.&nbsp; However, when the desired outcomes are not being created we revert to the principles, check our north star and take our new knowledge to refine/ redefine the risk we are prepared to take.</p> Data introduces new Principle problems!&nbsp; <p>Having established this framework, the idea is to apply this to data.&nbsp; We have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve with data.&nbsp; However, we don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework for data at any level, individual, company, society, national or global.&nbsp; This is not a bill of rights, this is “what do we think is the north star for data and on what principle should data be?”&nbsp; How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><p>“what do we think is the north star for data and on what principle should data be?”&nbsp; How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><p>The question is how do our principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes, the world we designed for was physical; it is now digital-first. Now we are becoming aware that the fabric has changed, where next? &nbsp; By example, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis </a>is the legal system and database.&nbsp; With a case in mind, you use this tool to uncover previous judgments and specific cases to determine and inform your thinking.&nbsp; However, this database is built on humans and physical first.&nbsp; Any digital judgements in this database are still predicated on the old frameworks, what is its value when the very fabric of all those judgements changes.&nbsp; Do we use it to slow us down and prevent adoption?&nbsp; Time to unpack this</p><p>Physical-world first (framed as AD 00 to 2010)</p><p>Classic thinking (western capital civilisation philosophy) defined values and principles which have created policy, norms and rules.&nbsp; Today’s policy is governed by people and processes. We have history to provide visibility over time and can call on millennia of thought, thinking and wisdom.&nbsp; Depending on what is trending/ leading as a philosophy we create norms.&nbsp; In a physical and human first world, we have multi-starting positioning. We can start with a market, followed by norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture - creating law and regulations&nbsp; OR we can start with norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture, followed by market-creating law.&nbsp;</p><p>Without our common and accepted belief our physical world would not work. Law, money, rights are not real, they are command and control schema with shared beliefs.&nbsp; Our created norms are based on our experience with the belief.&nbsp; We cope by managing our appetite to risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital world first (frame as AD 2020 - AD MMMCCX )</p><p>People-in-companies rather than people-in-government form the new norms as companies have the capital to include how to avoid the rules and regulations.&nbsp; The best companies are forming new rules to suit them. Companies have the users to mould the norms with the use of their data. Behaviour can be directed. Companies set their own rules.&nbsp; Doctrine/architecture creates the market, forming norms, and the law protects those who control the market.&nbsp; Policy can create rules but it has no idea how rules are implemented or governed as the companies make it complex and hide the data. There are few signs of visible “core” human values, indeed there are no shared and visible data principles.&nbsp; We are heading to the unknown and unimagined.</p><p>The companies automate, the decisions become automated, the machine defines the rules and changes the risk model. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined as we have no data principles.</p><p>By example. Our news and media have changed models. The editor crafted control to meet the demand of an audience were willing to pay to have orchestrated content that they liked.&nbsp; As advertising became important, content mirrored advertising preferences and editorial became the advertising and advertising the content.&nbsp; Digital created clicks that drove a new model to anything that drives clicks works.&nbsp; The fabric changed from physical to digital and in doing so we lost the principles and rules of the physical first world to a digital-first world that has not yet agreed on principles for data.&nbsp;</p> Data is data <p>This article<a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2019/01/data-is-data-it-is-not-oil-or-gold-or.html"> Data is Data</a> explores what data is and is my reference to define data.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine looking at this framework of “principles, rules and risk” within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity.&nbsp; How would say their data and privacy be presented?</p><p>With data (privacy, protection, use, collection) we have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve.&nbsp; We appear to be missing an agreed risk framework for individuals, company’s, societies (national &amp;global)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The stated <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">GDPR principles are</a> set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a>:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.</p>  <p>Purpose limitation.</p>  <p>Data minimisation.</p>  <p>Accuracy.</p>  <p>Storage limitation.</p>  <p>Integrity and confidentiality (security)</p>  <p>Accountability.</p>  <p>We know they are called “Principles” by the framing of the heading in Article 5, however, if we read them slowly are these principles, values or rules? Consider are these boundaries, stewardship ideals or a bit of a mashup. &nbsp; By example to get round “Purpose Limitation,” terms and conditions&nbsp; become as wide as possible so that all and or any use is possible.&nbsp; Data minimisation is only possible if you know the data you want, which is rarely the case if you are a data platform. &nbsp; If a principle of The European Union is to ensure the free “movement / mobility” of people, goods, services and capital within the Union (the ‘four freedoms’), does data identity ideals and GDPR align?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Considering the issue about the “regulation of” Big Tech, in general should they exist, as <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">no one entity should have that much power</a> and control over people’s data and ability to transact? So the framings that accepts them as acceptable, won’t create rules that actually moves towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is.&nbsp; If we add in open API’s and the increasing level of <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/data-portability-mobility-sharing.html">data mobility, portability and sharing</a> whose “rules or principles” should be adopted?</p><p>How do your principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework, say in the US today, is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s&nbsp; and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket.&nbsp; Alas, IMHO, GDPR is not a lot better than rules with no truly human based core principles.</p> Conclusion <p>We appear to have outdated “principles” driving rules in a digital-first world.&nbsp;</p><p>Our commercial world is now dominated by companies setting “their” norms without reference to any widely agreed-upon values. The down side of big tech gaining so much power that they are actually seen by people-in-government as “equivalent to nation-states” is telling.&nbsp; Right now we need historians, anthropologists, ontologists, psychologists, data scientists and regular everyday people who are the users to be able to close the loop between the rules we have, the risk frameworks we manage and the principles that we should be aiming for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Take Away</p>  <p>How are we checking the rules we have are aligned to our principles?</p>  <p>How are we checking our principles?</p>  <p>Is our risk framework able to adapt to new principles and changes to rules?</p>  <p>How do we test the rules that define and constrain can create better outcomes?</p>

   <p></p><p>In my post on <a href="https://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2020/11/in-digital-age-how-can-we-reconnect.html">Principles and Rules</a>, I explored the connection between our human desire for principles, our commercial need for risk and our love of rules.&nbsp; It explored the fact that we create rules, to manage risks, that end up not aligned with our principles and made some suggestion about how we can close the loop.&nbsp;</p><p>In the article, I skipped over the word “rules” without unpacking it.&nbsp; This post is to unpack the word “rule”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/rule">The history and origin of the word “Rule” is here</a>.&nbsp; Irrespective of the correct use of the word “rule,” we use words in both correct and incorrect situations. Incorrect being there is a more precise or accurate word in the context or situation but we chose the word we do so as to create ambiguity, to avoid controversy, to soften the message and because of naivety.&nbsp; We know that words and our language itself are filled with convenient generalisations that help us to explain ourselves whilst at the same time avoid the controversy created by unique circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Principles and Rules article, the choice of the word rule was ambitious. This allows readers to apply their own context to it, thereby creating more relevance to their own circumstances when reading.&nbsp; It was not a legal contract scenario, writing definitions at the beginning to provide that level of clarity and common interpretation.&nbsp;</p><p>So in the idea was ambiguity - this post, however, is to expand an ontology of the word “rules.”</p><p>For me, you or someone;</p>  <p>Rules are written or unwritten or both</p>  <p>Rules are mine, created by me that you need to follow. They are yours, crafted by you that you need me to obey. They are shared and we believe that they create a better society</p>  <p>Rules can be the law, just a guide, the standard you need to meet or the rituals that creates success.&nbsp; But which law, they one we should not break or the one where we follow the spirit?&nbsp; As a guide to guide me from here to where.&nbsp; As a standard is that absolute or is a range good enough.&nbsp; My rituals, did I learn them, did you teach me or somehow are they just there?</p>  <p>Rules equally give you more freedom (safety, less murder) and remove your freedom (choice). Rules give me more agency and at the same time remove it.</p>  <p>Rules define my boundaries but are the ones I have created for myself and I have continually refined them as I learn, or are my rules ones that come from history; because we have always done it this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>Rules are they creating my view on values or are the rules I have someone else’s values?</p>  <p>Rules are only there to be broken</p>  <p>Rules allow me to create something as I have done something, have experience and have learnt. Rules allow me to repeat and not make the same mistake or improve and adapt.&nbsp; Rules save me time and energy - I love my huristics</p>  <p>Rules allow me to manage, prevent and control risk</p>  <p>But whose rules are they?</p>  <br><p>The takeaway</p><p>When our principles become rules, do we question either the rules or principles enough?</p> <br>

<p>When I got to Milano, I thought: How did they know? This feels just like a post-apocalyptic film. But how did the directors know this is how it feels? It’s not that surprising, of course. Cities have gone through wars and pestilence since the existence of&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Milano after the plague, or not after the plague. Certainly the worst of it hasn’t happened yet. We are in the middle of it. Maybe just the beginning of it. Whatever it&nbsp;is.</p><p>I remember a warm data workshop with Nora Bates. She said: The disaster has already struck. It just hasn’t struck everyone&nbsp;yet.</p>Empty office buildings in&nbsp;Milan<p>When I left Ljubljana, why did I leave Ljubljana? Numbers were rising. Measures were tightening. Will I be able to get to Spain? Will I be able to get back? Maybe with my Slovenian plates nobody will stop&nbsp;me.</p><p>In Milan I sat with one of my father’s best friends in a rooftop restaurant in the outdoor seating. They took our temperatures before we got on the elevator. I can’t visit my father but at least his friend lives within driving distance of&nbsp;me.</p><p>Four hours is a long way to go out of one’s way for a meal and Milan doesn’t seem so advisable, but who knows when we will get to see our loved ones again? She gets me an AirBnB because hotels make me choke with the poisonous sanitizer they use to cleanse the&nbsp;air.</p><p>We have dinner. I tell her it’s hard to speak to Americans about what’s happening in the States. She says “Whenever I bring it up, your father says ‘I don’t want to talk about it.’.”. I don’t want to talk about it either, but it’s all I ever talk about. I’m American, or at least that’s what one of my passports says. My residency permit says Slovenia. It’s my only hope of staying out of a red zone at this point. Red zone. I’m not worried about disease. Civil war is another&nbsp;thing.</p><p>The laundry place wouldn’t take my underwear or socks. If I want laundry done, I have to do it myself, they said. I don’t know if that’s because of the pandemic or a Milanese tradition. At a little coastal town two hours East, the proprietor of the self-service laundromat did my laundry for me at no extra&nbsp;charge.</p><p>This is my first post on the <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/blog/">Sufficiency Currency blog</a>. It’s about the wisdom of taking a road trip in Europe in the middle of a pandemic. At the beginning of the collapse of civilization. In a bizarre moment of suspension, where things seem to be going on as usual; waiting for the other shoe to drop. America is in the throes of a civil war and California has no air and we’re sharing TikTok videos and Instagram sunsets. Everyone knows the economy’s dead, but we’re working and shopping and paying rent as if nothing happened, like we’re under hypnosis.</p><p>Or a psychedelic trip. One big global psychedelic trip, and not the good&nbsp;kind.</p>Who is that masked&nbsp;man?<p>Zipping along the highway in a rental car in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad Trip. That doesn’t sound very&nbsp;wise.</p><p>At one of the ecovillages, they make their own toothpaste. It’s not really toothpaste; it’s a kind of a powder. I asked one of the volunteers how to use the tooth powder. I knew the answer, but I was hoping I was wrong. She said: we just dip our toothbrushes into the jar. I don’t need a pandemic to know that dipping my toothbrush in the communal jar of tooth-powder is a bad idea. I brought my own toothpaste, like a civilized person. I brought the biological kind so they can’t complain.</p><p>As I drive my car along the Riviera, I see it out of the corner of my eye, for a brief second between tunnels, the dark blue sign with the circle of stars around the word France. If I hadn’t been paying attention, I wouldn’t have noticed. OK Google doesn’t say “Welcome to France.” When you cross between states in the US, Google tells you “Welcome to New Jersey.” In Europe, no such thing. OK Google is silent. She knows I crossed and I know I crossed. Maybe she’s pretending to honor GDPR as if she doesn’t know my every move. She knows if I am speeding but doesn’t tell the cops. She definitely knows that I got a small cut on my right index finger. Now she knows the prints of my middle finger, too. “OK, Google,” I say. “That’s me,” she&nbsp;answers.</p><p>The border crossing is easy. Finding lunch on the French Riviera in the off season during a pandemic isn’t. I have cake and coffee instead of something that feels French — or like lunch. The coffee shop has no WiFi. I guess you’re supposed to be enjoying yourself by the marina, not&nbsp;working.</p><p>The Sufficiency Currency project is about creating an alternative form of economic activity. Not marketplaces. Not money. An evolution of how we perceive our economic activity.</p><p>“People have always used money. What else is there?” people&nbsp;ask.</p><p>People haven’t always used money and there are still peoples on earth who don’t. Every system is born, lives and dies. Money is just a human invention and the financial system is like every other human invention. We can and will invent something else. Hopefully very&nbsp;soon.</p><p>A road trip to replace the world’s financial system in the middle of the Zombie Apocalypse Psychedelic Bad&nbsp;Trip.</p><p>Follow he <a href="https://voiceofhumanity.one/">Voice of Humanity project&nbsp;here.</a></p>

<p>On Monday, November 23rd the Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* held its 17th event, the focus of this event was on Guardianship and SSI.  Our presenter was Philippe Page of The Human Colossus Foundation and is a current member of the Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group.   </p><p>Guardianship is a legal status where one individual is under the legal care of another.  A natural guardian relationship is between parent and child, legal guardians are persons who are recognized by the courts as having the legal authority and duty of care for another.  </p><p>While there are long standing legal precedents and processes around the assignment, management and revocation of guardianships, these requirements were not met by existing digital identity management solutions. With SSI, this mechanism now exists.  SSI can work in conjunction with traditional identity and credential management systems while being able to integrate into existing legal processes and provides a robust mechanism for revocation.</p><p>Guardianship is a complex topic, with many subtleties and layers.  In the humanitarian sector the it is a reality of daily life when supporting and assisting migrants, refugees and displaced persons.  It is a topic we all are faced with in our lifetimes; whether as a child (being cared for) or as an adult (caring for or being cared for).  In this first event on this topic, Philippe has provided an overview of how SSI and Guardianship fit together and how SSI meets the lifecycle stages (Inception, Creation, Usage and Termination) of guardianship.  </p><p>An objective of these events is to educate the community on how high assurance digital identities unlock new possibilities across all entities and industry sectors.   Using the tripartite relationship in clinical drug trials of patient, doctor and pharma company, Philippe covered how guardianship can also be used to manage consent to derive a business value unlocked with high assurance digital identity.  </p><p>Guardianship is an important legal concept, and will be a topic we will return to in 2021.</p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/482803989">https://vimeo.com/482803989</a></p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction</p>  <p>0:03:55 - Philippe Page - Introduction</p>  <p>0:08:03 - Overview</p>  <p>0:08:41 -  Guardianship background</p>  <p>0:20:15 - Core Components</p>  <p>0:33:51 - Scaling and Standardization</p>  <p>0:39:04 - Bridging Economic Actors &amp; Human Centricity</p>  <p>0:45:45 - Applications</p>  <p>1:02:08 - Questions</p>  <p>For more information on:</p><p>	- Sovrin Foundation Guardianship Working Group :&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">https://sovrin.org/guardianship/</a></p><p>	- The Human Colossus Foundation : <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">https://humancolossus.foundation/</a></p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

The author recognizes that there may be errors and biases, and welcomes constructive feedback to correct or ameliorate.</p><p>We all like secrets. When we possess a secret, it gives us a heightened sense of individuality — that we know some that nobody else knows — giving us a special perspective or an option for the future that only we can exercise — in other words,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/power">power</a>.</p><p>It turns out, imaginary or not, secrets are fundamental to the power that we have as individuals and institutions in the digital realm. Passwords, codes — those things that grant us or enable us to grant special access to those things that valuable, like bank accounts, emails, or the drafts and finals of our deliberations, the list goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>It turns out, that up until, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-day-cryptography-changed-forever-1b6aefe8bda7">August 1, 1977</a>, secrets had a fundamental fault — we had to share them to use them. That meant you had to trust someone else, and that could eventually lead to the betrayal of your secret, and by extension, you.</p><p>In 1977, the public introduction of asymmetric cryptography heralded a new generation of secret capabilities. The first major capability was the establishment of shared secrets across insecure channels enabling encryption between two parties without the requirement of a secret backchannel. The second was enabling commitments using secrets that are not shared, more commonly known as digital signatures.</p><p>What had been discovered by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (and also Jame Ellis), is changing the world as we know it. It’s been only 43 years. Yes, that seems like an ice-age ago, but in the grand scheme of history, it is only a&nbsp;wink.</p><p>My concluding remark in this brief post is that<a href="https://youtu.be/4cia_v4vxfE"> you ain’t seen nothing yet</a> (with apologies to BTO). I have been learning about many related schemes, based on that 1977 publicly-announced breakthrough: elliptic curves, homomorphic commitment schemes, proof-of-work, etc.</p><p>It’s one thing to understand these as mathematical, but it is another thing to understand what these things might be leveraged as institutional capabilities, either built by an institution itself or leveraged from an ecosystem that lets you keep your own&nbsp;secrets.</p><p>That’s the key — keeping your own secrets — keeping those things that give you the&nbsp;power.</p>

    So the technical term for that delay or lag from then you finish speaking to you hearing when the next person speaks is wrapped up in an idea of “Latency”. &nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(audio)">Latency </a>is measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond">milliseconds (ms), which is thousandths of seconds</a>. Latency for a face to face conversation is like zero. For say a landline call, it is defined by an ITU standard and is judged by the ability to offer a quality of service.&nbsp; Ideally, about 10ms will achieve the highest level of quality and feels familiar.&nbsp; A latency of 20 ms is tremendous and is typical for a VoIP call as it is perfectly acceptable.&nbsp; A latency of even 150 ms is, whilst noticeable, permitted, however, any higher delay or lag times and the quality diminishes very fast. At 300 ms or higher, latency becomes utterly unacceptable as a conversation becomes laboured, driven by interruptions and lack flow.&nbsp; <p>We all know the phrases of “no-one left behind” or “you are only as strong as your weakest team member.” Well, the same applies for latency, one person in a remote place, low broadband speed, on a (shared) WIFI extension, with poor buffering on a cheap router;&nbsp; we are now all down to the slowest person in the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Analogy to get to the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>“Jet lag”, also called “jet lag disorder,” is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Your body has its own internal clock (circadian rhythms) that signals your body when to stay awake and when to sleep. Jet lag occurs because your body's clock is still synced to your original time zone, instead of to the time zone where you've travelled. The more time zones crossed, the more likely you are to experience jet lag. Jet lag can cause fatigue, an unwell feeling, difficulty staying alert and gastrointestinal problems. Jet lag is temporary, but it can significantly reduce your vacation or business travel comfort. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to help prevent or minimise jet lag.</p><br><p>Stay with me. We are bringing JetLag and voice/ video lag (Latency) together.&nbsp; We know the effects of JetLag - fatigue, unwell feeling, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and is temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The question is, can VoiceLag create the same. Anecdotally I believe Yes based on 8 months of video calls.&nbsp; At the end of a day of video, Teams, Hangout or Zoom calls, we know we have fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of alertness, gastrointestinal problems and it is temporary. A good night of sleep, we can do it all again. &nbsp; I know that now making a day of mobile or landline calls I don’t suffer the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, is this voice lag or voice latency or video time or a little part of each? We definitely know that video calls are exhausting, but the assumption for this feeling was the new structure, a new approach, differences and styles, watch yourself continually, only seeing one person, having to be present 100% of the time.&nbsp; This is all true, but we also lack flow on video call due the latency and lag.&nbsp; Lacking flow means conversation is paused, interrupted and slow. This delay takes a lot of energy.&nbsp; We cannot get into flow to sharing our creative thinking, we have to hold ideas and opinions back, we have to wait for signals to speak - it is all exhausting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We need to focus on the remove of lag to create flow. We need to stop moving at the rate of the slowest person, let’s get everyone up to flow speed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><br><br>

The editors met yesterday to discuss the issues that were pulled out of the previous draft text and document a process for how to resolve these and future issues. We would like to explain how we plan on using labels on GitHub issues to keep track of discussions and keep things moving. <br> <br>When there are substantive issues or pull requests, the editors will avoid merging or closing those outright, and instead mark them as "pending", so that these can be brought to the attention of the larger group. If no additional discussion happens on these, the merge or close action will be taken in 7 days. Note for this first round we are setting the deadline for the issues below as Dec 11th due to the US holiday and the fact that this is the first time using this process. <br> <br>"Pending Merge" <br>When specific text is proposed in a PR (by anyone, not limited to the editors), and the editors believe this text reflects the consensus of the working group, this marks that the PR will be merged in 7 days unless there is a clear alternative proposal accepted by the working group. <br> <br>"Pending Close" <br>When the editors believe an issue no longer needs discussion, we'll mark it "Pending Close". The issue will be closed in 7 days unless someone brings new information to the discussion. This tag is not applied to issues that will be closed by a specific pull request. <br> <br>There are two additional labels we will use to flag issues to the group. <br> <br>"Needs Text" <br>The editors suggest this issue needs additional text in the spec to clarify why this section is needed and under what circumstances. Without a concrete proposal of text to be included in the spec, this section will be removed in a future update. <br> <br>"Postponed" <br>This issue can be reconsidered in the future with a more concrete discussion but is not targeted for immediate concrete changes to the spec text. When used on its own, this label does not indicate that an issue is targeted to be closed. An issue may also be marked "Pending Close", and this is used so that we can distinguish closed issues between discussions that have concluded or things that we may want to revisit in the future. Remember that closed issues are not deleted and their contents are still findable and readable, and that new issues can reference closed issues. <br> <br>With these labels in mind, here are the list of issues and their statuses we were able to discuss on our last editor's call. The action on these pending issues will be taken on Dec 11th to give the group enough time to review this list. For this first round, many of the issues are marked "Pending Close" as we're looking for low hanging fruit to prune the list of issues down. In the future, you can expect to see more "Pending Merge" issues as we're bringing proposed text to review by the WG. <br> <br>Postponed: <br> <br>• Generic claim extension mechanism <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/131</a> <br> <br>Pending Merge: <br> <br>• Make access token mandatory for continuation API calls <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/pull/129</a> <br> <br>Postponed and Pending Close: <br> <br>• Fetchable Keys <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/47</a> <br>• Including OpenID Connect Claims <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/64</a> <br>• Application communication with back-end <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/82</a> <br>• Additional post-interaction protocols <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/83</a> <br> <br>Pending Close: <br>     <br>• HTTP PUT vs POST for rotating access tokens <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/100</a> <br>• Use of hash with unique callback URL <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/84</a> <br>• Interaction considerations <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/81</a> <br>• Expanding dynamic reference handles <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/76</a> <br>• Post interaction callback nonce <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/73</a> <br>• Unique callback URIs  <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/55</a> <br>• Instance identifier <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/46</a> <br>• Requesting resources by reference <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/36</a> <br>• Mapping resource references <br>** <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35">https://github.com/ietf-wg-gnap/gnap-core-protocol/issues/35</a>

<p>Some on the next 10-ish years in identity management.</p><p>[This was originally written in December 2019: pre-pandemic, pre-US presidential election, pre-George Floyd. Truly, it was written in the “Before Times.” I thought about updating this before posting but that felt wrong – somehow dishonest. So here is the lightly touched up text of my talk which was given first in Tokyo at the OpenID Foundation Summit and then again as part of the all-virtual Identiverse. If you want to skip the text and <a href="https://players.brightcove.net/6154186074001/V3qAkKf6t_default/index.html?videoId=6184188772001">go straight to the video, you can</a>!&nbsp;</p><p>My deepest thanks go to Naohiro Fujie and Nat Sakimura for prompting me to write this, Andi Hindle for his feedback. – IG 11/24/2020]</p><p>It is my honor to present to you today. Today, it is my privilege to talk to you about my vision of the future of digital identity. When Naohiro-san asked me to speak on this topic, I was both honored and panicked. In my daily role, I focus on a 12 to 18 month time frame. My primary task is to help my stakeholders and, yes I have a multi-year vision, but I primarily focus on how my team can execute in the next few months to help those stakeholders. I don’t, as a matter of my daily routine, think about the future.</p><p>So I was a little panicked. I am not a futurist. I am no longer an industry analyst. I am just a practitioner trying to help where I can. How then should I talk about the next ten years of our industry?</p><p>I can name 4 ways to think about the future and with your permission I will briefly try all 4.</p> Looking at the Past to See the Future <p>One way to talk about the future is to look back at past predictions and see how they fared. I’ll choose 3 predictions:</p>  The Need for Password Vaulting  SAML is Dead  The Year of PKI (Again…Still)   The Need for Password Vaulting <p>In 2014, I said that <a href="https://youtu.be/_TsYqOq9iDk?t=449">by 2017 the need for password vaulting would be gone</a>. Well, it’s 2020 and there are systems that simply refuse to participate in single sign-on schemes. My guess is that in the next 5 years the need for enterprise password vaulting (not including privileged account management) will be gone.</p><p>In non-enterprise settings, password managers are more prevalent than ever, at least browser-based ones. My guess is that WebAuthn will drive passwordless use cases and when combined with OS-based software tokens the need for passwords and password vaulting in our daily lives will dramatically decrease in the next 5 to 10 years. But more on that later.</p> SAML is Dead <p>Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/n40173">Craig Burton famously stated that SAML was dead</a>. It’s 2020 and SAML remains dead. It is so dead that my company is involved with at least 70,000 different SAML federations. (May all of our endeavors be so successful upon their demise.)</p> The Year of PKI <p>Since 1977 it has been the year of PKI. It is now the year of PKI. It will continue to be the year of PKI until it becomes impossible to safely distribute keys. (But I’ll get to that in a bit.)</p><p>While looking at past predictions is one way to talk about the future it is not completely sufficient.&nbsp;</p> Continuous Future <p>Another way to think about the future is to imagine a continuous one… one in which today’s technologies and techniques progress in a linear fashion towards the future. Promising things that are growing today continue to grow into the future. There are four items I’d like to discuss briefly:</p>  OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal  SAML Will Still Be Dead  Passwords Will Also Be Dead  WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On   OIDC and SCIM Will Be the New Normal <p>The next decade of IAM, especially workforce-centric IAM, will be based on OpenID Connect and SCIM. This implies that OAuth and JOSE will continue in their role as critical supporting standards. This is not to say that other protocols, such as SAML or Kerberos, will not be important, but OIDC and SCIM will be the assumed pieces of our infrastructures.</p> SAML Will Still Be Dead <p>The reason why SAML is “dead” is because it works and it is a legacy technology. It is mature. It is popular. And that will not change in the next&nbsp;5 years. Now, I do not expect a resurgence of SAML federations but I also do not expect rapid migration from SAML to OIDC (unless prompted by a shift in platform or provider.) Consider that it took years to stamp out WS-Federation; SAML will take a similar path. In 10 year’s time, the SAML zombie herd will be quite thin but still shuffling onwards and very much considered a legacy protocol.</p> Passwords Will Also Be Dead <p>Good news! The password is dead! And I mean this in both senses: passwords work and passwords are legacy. In the next 5 years, consistent best practices will roll through our enterprises: long passwords, infrequent changes, and strengthening with a second factor.</p><p>At the same time, we can see how the use of passwords will decline significantly over the next 10 years. Enterprise is already showing this to be the case: federation as the primary means of resource access. We are not far off from having 1 password per enterprise user. What about in the consumer space?</p> WebAuthn Will be an Alternative to Social Sign-On <p>As a consumer, how do I get the best experience getting into sites and apps? One approach is to use a password manager. But in 2016 only 3% of internet users use a password manager app and only 2% use a browser-based one <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/01/26/2-password-management-and-mobile-security/">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. While those numbers have undoubtably grown, I cannot imagine they have cracked double digits.</p><p>Another approach is to use social sign-on to get into sites and apps. I believe people use social sign-on to avoid the twin hassles of creating an account and managing a password.</p><p>But I believe by 2030, there will be parity between WebAuthn and social sign-on. This is predicated on active clients ruling our mobile worlds and the use of desktops continuing to decline. Concerns over personal privacy combined with the ease of use in which the mobile OS is the dominant active client that “magically” signs one in, will bring a meaningful alternative to social sign-on.</p><p>WebAuthn is the standard that makes this happen at the wire-level. Ubiquitous browser support is a key enabling step which is well underway. Connecting OS-level biometric recognition to services via enabled-browsers is the obvious next step. Those two things will deliver a “magical” mobile sign-in experience in which I just look at my phone and I am in the app. we should expect to see play out over the next 3 to 5 years and mainstream adoption in 5 to 10.</p><p>These items will help us, in different ways, to improve the state of account management. But we cannot only think about digital identity by itself; we have to think about the technological landscape that surrounds our industry.</p> The Adjacent World <p>If we are going to talk about the future of identity we cannot do so without looking at adjacent technology and trends:</p>  Active Clients Will be Mainstream  Quantum Computing and PKI  Balkanization of the Internet   Active Clients Will be Mainstream <p>The next 10 years will be dominated by digital things acting on our behalf: active clients. Our password managers, personal digital assistants, and digital wallets will take a far greater role in finding, delivering, and interacting with online services.</p><p>In the next 5 years, the mobile OS and its features will be the primary active client for the vast majority of the online world. Using alternatives to mobile OS provided wallets, password managers, strong authentication clients, will be possible but will struggle to gain widespread adoption. That might change in 10 years with regulatory action or significant market externalities, but it is unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, when it comes to digital assistants, as my colleague Peter Schwartz, futurist, said to me, “If you aren’t Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant you have no chance. Everything will be brokered through one of those three.” Your digital assistant service will be brokered through one of those 3 or possibly a mega-platform such as WeChat.</p><p>All of this has implications in the death of passwords. If the mobile OS vendor doesn’t want to support WebAuthn, DID Auth, or the next great thing we can dream up, it is going to be extremely difficult to gain meaningful adoption by people and thus service providers will be unlikely to adopt as well.</p> Quantum Computing and PKI <p>In the next ten years, we will see quantum computing effect cryptography. For the most part, our hashing algorithms will be okay in a post-quantum world. But it is our key exchange algorithms that might fall. As my colleague Taher Elgamal, noted mathematician and father of SSL, told me, “We need to get moving.” We have 5 years to adopt new key exchange mechanisms assuming we get a new method by 2025… which we may not. A failure to act will undermine cryptographic trust. And that has profound implication for not just our industry but all industries.</p> Balkanization of the Internet <p>In the next 10 years we will see the internet split into at least 2 separate internets. There will be an internet for China (and possibly a separate one for Russia) and one for the rest of the world. Even if these internets are not physically separated, national policy, censorship, and enterprise risk management will drive logically separated ones.</p><p>What this likely means for identity professionals is that within these separate Internets, separate identity schemes will arise. If today identity is the perimeter of the enterprise, in 10 years, identity will be the perimeter of these Balkanized Internets. We can see the beginnings of this with WeChat and given nationalism on the rise around the world, one can easily imagine non-interoperable identity perimeters to our online worlds. And this an outcome we must fight.</p><p>Predicting where currently successful things will continue to be successful is often the role of an industry analyst – a role I used to do. But I think there is a more challenging and exciting way to think about the future – one isn’t based on likely successfully and frankly reasonably obvious things.</p> The Discontinuous Future <p>A third way to think about the future is to imagine one not as a smooth path forward but one abruptly shifts and radically changes. This discontinuous future is hidden by our biases, our investment in our current projects and approaches, and our natural tendency to rely on the familiar to navigate the dimly lit room that is the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the discontinuous future is focused, not on account management, but actual identity management. So what if we choose, just for the next few minutes, to imagine this hidden, discontinuous future? What would we see there?</p><p>I believe we will see 3 actions and 1 actor in this discontinuous future.</p>  Introductions  Recognition  Counselors  Data Handling<br>   Introductions <p>The act of introducing someone is the act of creating a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine digital assistants managing our introductions. In this case, one service says to another “This is an entity which I know about and with whom you should have a relationship.”&nbsp; In some regards you can think of this a social sign-on++.</p> Recognition <p>The act of recognition is a way to acknowledge parties in a relationship and is a way to demonstrate the existence of the relationship to some other entity or service. For example, I am a member of IDPro or I am an employee of Salesforce or I am a citizen of Japan. I think the act of acknowledging a relationship will supersede our current forms of consent. The relationship defines “normal” acceptable behavior between the parties. So long as actions are within the regular boundaries of the relationship then the person doesn’t need to provide additional consent. The parties’ behavior within the context of the relationship would be monitored by active clients.</p> Counselors <p>Counselors are new actors in this discontinuous future. They are entities who can:</p>  Act on your behalf  Vouch for you and your relationships  Create and sever relationships on your behalf  Can counsel you on your behavior  <p>Counselors can provide data needed to form a relationship. They can step in before you share data with a service that could be considered risky. Imagine something stepping in before you hand over your form of payment and email address and suggest using an anonymous one instead. Imagine that service can even generate that anonymous forms of payment and a pseudonymous email for you. That is the future role of a counselor.</p><p>For some a counselor could be a government or a private-sector supplied service. These counselors are true value-add active clients.</p> Data Handling <p>How we handle data will change in the discontinuous future. I believe that pseudonymization and differential privacy will have to be applied at the time of introduction. We will finally have an infrastructure that supports the idea that data gathered at the time of use is superior to previously stored away data. Provenance and relationship metadata will be applied all the time, even for insights derived from shared information. Finally, common privacy-preserving processing fabrics will arise to enable industry sectors to derive industry-specific insights and industry-shared risks; think of this as an industry-specific shared signals and attribute exchange.</p><p>I believe focusing on these actors and actions will enable use to move toward true digital identity management.</p> The Fourth Way <p>There is a fourth way to think about the future: They say that the way to predict the future is to create it. This might seem daunting. Not everyone can create a new protocol, not everyone can write a specification, not everyone can build something that has never been seen before.</p><p>But, each of us, in our own way, can create the future. We create the future by hiring without bias to form diverse work environments. We create the future by respectfully using data shared with us. We create the future by ensuring that our systems run in an environmentally sustainable manner. We create the future by ensuring the algorithms we use are ethical and without bias. We create the future by providing something wonderful for all of our stakeholders. And in these ways, we create a future far more meaningful than any talk about the future can describe.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

     Who is the “we”, this piece is co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a> and me, who together have worked for over 45 years on identity and personal data. For this article, we are looking at the role of values, principles and rules within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity.   <p>As we write this there is an ongoing conversation about the regulation of Facebook and the regulation of big tech in general. We see a problem with the frame of the conversation because we believe ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist as in no-one entity should have that much power and control over the global population’s identities, “their” data and the conversion we have. So any frame that accepts BIG TECH as acceptable won’t create rules that actually move towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is.</p>         <p>With this piece, we are seeking to look at how principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework we have today is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket.</p><p>So let’s get to the question at hand “Why does it matter that we connect values, principles and rules?” The connection is not clear because we have created so many words and variance in languages that there is significant confusion. We are often confused in ourselves to what we mean, we are very inconsistent in how we apply our understanding, often to provide a benefit to ourselves or justify our belief. To unpack the relationship we need to look at definitions, but we have to accept that even definitions are inconsistent. Our conformational bias is going to fight us, as we want to believe what we already know, rather than expand our thinking.</p> Are we imagining principles or&nbsp;values? <p>Worth noting our principles are defined by our values. Much like ethics (group beliefs) and morals (personal beliefs) and how in a complex adaptive system my morals affect the group’s ethics and a group’s ethics changes my morals. Situational awareness and experience play a significant part in what you believe right now, and what the group or society believes.</p><p>Values can be adaptable by context whereas principles are fixed for a period, withstanding the test of time. When setting up a framework where we are setting our principles implies that we are saying that we don’t want them to change every day, week, month, year, that they are good and stable for a generation but we can adapt/ revise/ adjust principles based on learning. Fundamentally principles are based on values which do change, so there are ebbs and flows of conflict between them, this means we frame principles and often refuse to see that they are not future proof forever. Indeed the further a principle is away from the time it was created, the less it will have in common with values.</p> Are we confusing principles and&nbsp;rules? <p>Considering characteristics, conceptually principles are abstract and universal whereas a rule is specific and particular. Principles cope with exceptions, rules need another rule. Principles provide the power of thought and decision making, rules prevent thought and discretion. Principles need knowledge and experience to deliver outcomes, rules don’t. Principles cope with risk, conflict and abstraction; conflict is not possible for a rule, it is this rule or a rule is needed.</p><p>We love rules-of-thumb, as such rules and heuristics provide time-saving frameworks which mean we don’t have to think. Not having to think saves energy for things we like to do. Take away the little ways you have that creates a stable place for yourself and you end up exhausted. Travel to a new place and you don’t know where the simple amenities of life are, COVID19 took away the structure of our lives which created exhaustion until we found a new routine. However, we often confuse “our heuristics”, the way I do something, or “my rules” as a principle. This diet rule is a principle for losing weight. We should accept that we purposely interchange rules, values and principles to provide assurance and bias to the philosophy, theory, thesis or point we are trying to gain acceptance of.</p><p>In companies and for a social policy we set rules and principles into matrices as below. Asking is it better to break rules or comply, is better to uphold principle or challenge them.</p><p>A review round the four quadrants highlights that there is no favourable sector and indeed as a society who wants to get improve, we continually travel through all of them. Companies and executives often feel that upholding principles and obeyed rules (top right) creates the best culture, but also ask the organisation to be adaptive, agile and innovative.</p><p>Given that principles are based on values, the leadership team will be instrumental into how upheld the principles are. Whereas the companies level of documentation for processes, procedures and rules will define what is to be obeyed, the culture of the top team will determine if they are to be obeyed or not.</p><p>The matrix below thinks about the combinations of values and principles. Where values are either mine as an individual or we as a collective society.</p><p>The fundamental issue with the two representations (rules or values and principles) is that they cannot highlight the dynamic nature of the relationship between them. By example, our collective values help normalise an individuals bias and that collective values informs and refine principles. Indeed as principles become extreme and too restrictive say as our collective values become too godly, our collective values opt to no-longer uphold them. When our individualism leads to the falling apart of society we raise the bar to create better virtues as it makes us more content, loved and at peace.</p><p>Movement within the “stable compromise” domain has been explored many times but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fraser_Tytler,_Lord_Woodhouselee">Tytler cycle of history </a>expands it very well.</p><p>In summary, a rules-based approach prescribes or describes in detail a set of rules and how to behave based on known and agreed principles. Whereas a principle-based approach develops principles which set the limits that enable controls, measures, procedures on how to achieve that outcome is left for each organisation to determine.</p> Risk frameworks help us to connect principles and&nbsp;rules <p>Having explored that a rules-based approach prescribes in detail the rules, methods, procedures, processes and tasks on how to behave and act, whereas a principle-based approach to creating outcomes crafts principles that frame boundaries, leaving the individual or organisation to determine its own interruption.</p>  In a linear system, we would agree on principles which would bound the rules.  In a non-linear system, we would agree on the principles, which would bound the rules and as we learn from the rules we would refine the principles.  In a complex adaptive system, we are changing principles, as our values change because of the rules which are continually be modified to cope with the response to the rules.  <p>This post is titled “In a digital age, how can we reconnect values, principles and rules?” and the obvious reason is that rules change, values, which change principles that means our rules need to be updated. However, this process of learning and adoption depends on understanding the connection which offers closed-loop feedback. An effective connection is our risk frameworks.</p><p>The diagram below places rules and principles at two extremes. As already explored we move from principles to rules but rarely go back to rethink our principles, principally because of the time. Rules should refine and improve in real-time, principles are generational. However to create and refine rules we use and apply a risk framework. The risk framework identifies risk and to help us manage it, we create rules that are capable of ensuring we get the right data/ information to be able to determine if we have control over risk. As humans, we are not experts in always forecasting the unimagined and so when we implement rules things break and clever minds think how to bend, break or avoid them. To that end we create more rules to manage exceptions. However, occasionally we need to check that our rules are aligned to our principles and indeed go back and check and refine our principles.</p><p>Starting from “Principles” these are anchored in ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity">Human Dignity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity_%28European_Union%29">Subsidiarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity">Solidarity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_theology">Covenantal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good">The common good</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship">Stewardship</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Principles_on_Equality">Equality</a>.</p><p>Once we decide that one or more of these should anchor our principles and form a north star, a direction to travel in and towards. The reason to agree on the Principle(s) is that collectively we agree on a commitment to get to a better place. We state our principles as an ambition, goal, target with allow us to understand, manage and control uncertainty using a risk framework. The risk framework frame or bounds the risk we are prepared to take. The risk framework enables us to define rules that get to our known outcomes. We implement the rules to create controls using regulation, code and standards. Our risk frameworks use tools to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report on the risk, the delta in risk and compliance with the rules. Whilst all is good we use the risk framework to create more rules and better framing and boundaries, creating better outcomes. However, when the desired outcomes are not being created we revert to the principles, check our north star and take our new knowledge to refine/ redefine the risk we are prepared to take.</p> Data and Identity Principles <p>Having established this framework, the idea is to apply this to the authors favourite topics of data and identity. We have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve through identity and data ownership. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global. This is not a bill of rights, this is “what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder us?</p><blockquote>“what do we think is the north star for data and identity and on what principle they are built?” How do these principles help us agree on risks, and will our existing rules help or hinder&nbsp;us?</blockquote><p>Our problems probably started a while back when information could travel faster than people (the telegraph rollout of 1850). This was a change in the fabric of values and principles. The person who was trusted was passed over and that person-to-person trust was no longer needed. Delays that allowed time for consideration gave way to immediacy; a shift in values and principles.</p><p>The question is how do our principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes, the world we designed for was physical; it is now digital-first. Now we are becoming aware that the fabric has changed, where next? By example, <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/">Lexis </a>is the legal system and database. With a case in mind, you use this tool to uncover previous judgments and specific cases to determine and inform your thinking. However, this database is built on humans and physical first. Any digital judgements in this database are still predicated on the old frameworks, what is its value when the very fabric of all those judgements changes. Do we use it to slow us down and prevent adoption? Time to unpack this</p><p>Physical-world first (framed as AD 00 to 2010)</p><p>Classic thinking (western capital civilisation philosophy) defined values and principles which have created policy, norms and rules. Today’s policy is governed by people and processes. We have history to provide visibility over time and can call on millennia of thought, thinking and wisdom. Depending on what is trending/ leading as a philosophy we create norms. In a physical and human first world, we have multi-starting positioning. We can start with a market, followed by norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture — creating law and regulations OR we can start with norms, followed by doctrine/ architecture, followed by market-creating law.</p><p>Without our common and accepted belief, our physical world would not work. Law, money, rights are not real, they are command and control schema with shared beliefs. Our created norms are based on our experience with the belief. We cope by managing our appetite to risk.</p><p>Digital world first (frame as AD 2020 — AD MMMCCX )</p><p>People-in-companies rather than people-in-government form the new norms as companies have the capital to include how to avoid the rules and regulations. The best companies are forming new rules to suit them. Companies have the users to mould the norms with the use of their data. Behaviour can be directed. Companies set their own rules. Doctrine/architecture creates the market, forming norms, and the law protects those who control the market. Policy can create rules but it has no idea how rules are implemented or governed as the companies make it complex and hide the data. There are few signs of visible “core” human values, indeed there are no shared and visible data principles. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined.</p><p>The companies automate, the decisions become automated, the machine defines the rules and changes the risk model. We are heading to the unknown and unimagined as we have no data principles.</p><p>By example. Our news and media have changed models. The editor crafted control to meet the demand of an audience were willing to pay to have orchestrated content that they liked. As advertising became important, content mirrored advertising preferences and editorial became the advertising and advertising the content. Digital created clicks that drove a new model to anything that drives clicks works. The fabric changed from physical to digital and in doing so we lost the principles and rules of the physical first world to a digital-first world that has not yet agreed on principles for data.</p> To our favourite topic: Data and&nbsp;Identity <p>Imagine looking at this framework of “principles, rules and risk” within the industry and sectors seeking to re-define, re-imagine and create ways for people to manage the digital representations of themselves with dignity. How would privacy and identity be presented?</p><p>Within data and identity, we have an abundance of rules and regulations and as many opinions on what we are trying to achieve. We don’t appear to have an agreed risk framework at any level, individual, company, society, national or global.</p><p>The stated <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">GDPR principles are</a> set out in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a>:</p>  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.  Purpose limitation.  Data minimisation.  Accuracy.  Storage limitation.  Integrity and confidentiality (security)  Accountability.  <p>We know they are called “Principles” by the framing of the heading in Article 5, however, are these principles, values or rules? Further are these boundaries, stewardships or a bit of a mashup. By example to get round “Purpose Limitation,” terms and conditions become as wide as possible so that all and or any use is possible. Data minimisation is only possible if you know the data you want, which is rarely the case if you are a data platform. If a principle of The European Union is to ensure the free “movement/mobility” of people, goods, services and capital within the Union (the ‘four freedoms’), does data identity ideals and GDPR align?</p><p>Considering the issue with “the regulation of Facebook” or the “regulation of” Big Tech, in general, is that ON PRINCIPLE they shouldn’t exist, <a href="https://medium.com/@tonyfish/power-agency-and-influence-a-new-framework-about-complex-relationships-73f5e97295ef">no one entity should have that much power</a> and control over people’s identities and their data? So the framings that accept them, as acceptable, won’t create rules that actually moves towards the principle of ending the current hegemony but rather just seek to regulate it as is. If we add in open API’s and the increasing level of data mobility, portability and sharing whose “rules or principles” should be adopted?</p><p>How do your principles change when the underlying fabric of what is possible changes? The entire privacy framework, say in the US today, is based on early 1970’s reports written in the United States to address concerns over mass state databases that were proposed in the mid-late 1960’s and the growing data broker industry that was sending people catalogues out of the blue. It doesn’t take account for the world we live in now where “everyone” has a little computer in their pocket. Alas, IMHO, GDPR is not a lot better than rules with no truly human-based core principles.</p> The lobby of&nbsp;time <p>By example here is the <a href="https://simson.net/ref/2004/csg357/handouts/01_fips.pdf">1973: The Code of Fair Information Practices</a> This Code was the central contribution of the HEW (Health, Education, Welfare) Advisory Committee on Automated Data Systems. The Advisory Committee was established in 1972, and the report released in July. The simplicity and the power of the code have been eroded and water down so that the code is now ineffective. Would we be in a much better place if we had adopted such thinking at the time?</p>  There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence is secret.  There must be a way for a person to find out what information about the person is in a record and how it is used.  There must be a way for a person to prevent information about the person that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposes without the person’s consent.  There must be a way for a person to correct or amend a record of identifiable information about the person.  Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuses of the data.   Conclusion <p>We have outdated “principles” driving rules in a digital-first world. This world is now dominated by companies setting norms and without reference to any widely agreed-upon values. The downside of big tech gaining so much power that they are actually seen by people-in-government as “equivalent to nation-states” is telling. We have small well-networked organizations attempting to make a dent in this. <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData</a>, for example, has generated, from an engaged collaborative community, a set of ideals (principles) that provide a good starting point for a wider constructive discussion, but we need historians, anthropologists, ontologist, psychologist, data scientists and regular every day people who are the users to be able to close the loop between the rules we have, the risk frameworks we manage to and the principles that we should be aiming for.</p><p>How can we leverage innovative democratic deliberative processes like <a href="https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/methods/citizens-jury">citizen’s jury</a>’s that are used in some parts of Europe to close the loop between rules and principles around emerging technology?</p><p>Take Away</p>  How are we checking the rules we have are aligned to our principles?  How are we checking our principles?  Is our risk framework able to adapt to new principles and changes to rules?  How do we test the rules that define and constrain create better outcomes?

As this is an opinion, I take full responsibility for any implied, explicit, or unconscious bias. I am open to feedback and correction; this opinion is subject to change at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’re almost there for truly global trusted interoperability. We almost have all of the networks we need. Let’s go through the networks we already have or will have soon (please note — I am only focusing on electronic networks, not physical or social networks)</p><p>Global Communication Network — The Internet as we know it today. Conceptualized as a singular, ubiquitous thing that we take for granted, it is actually a network of networks and an amalgam of protocols and technologies abstracted and unified bound by a set of rules known as Internet Protocol. We can just communicate with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>Global Location Network — This is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is so embedded in our lives — it is baked into the chips that we wear and take with up(watches, Fitbits, cycling computers, etc.), we no longer notice its presence. We can just know where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>Global Monetary Network — This network is still emerging. Bitcoin is the frontrunner, but there are contenders and competitors, such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). However this will play out, we will soon be able to exchange monetary value with one another, without the backing of governments and relying on financial intermediaries we have used for centuries.</p><p>So what is the next stop for the network? It’s&nbsp;this:</p><p>Global Verification Network — A network to independently verify without reliance on trusted intermediaries. Simply put, someone presents you with something — a claim, a statement, or whatever, and you will be able to prove that it is true without accepting it a face value or calling home to a centralized system that could deny you service, surveil you, or give you a false confirmation (for whatever reason). The business of trust can then be between you and the presenter, and you decide what you need to independently verify.</p><p>The exact capabilities of this global verification network are still to be determined but it is becoming clearer every day. Much of what is required as ingredients already exist as siloed bespoke add-ons onto the Internet as we today (TLS, etc.). Further, the cryptography that will enable this global verification network has already existed for years if not&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The hardest part ahead is not the technology, it’s the wholesale re-conceptualization of what is required for a global verification network that puts the power of the network back into the endpoints that is you and&nbsp;me.</p><p>In the coming weeks, I will be providing more detail, but I want you to take away from this post, that the next major stop for networks is a global verification network.</p>

In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines two tags for time:  CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC 3339) and tag 1 (POSIX “seconds since the epoch”).  Since then, additional requirements have become known.  This specification defines a CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar without a time.  It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date 1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric date representation without a time.  This specification is the reference document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that a gifted musical singer/songwriter appears in this RFC in a contextually appropriate fashion, should you need an additional incentive to read the specification. ;-)</p>

As I struggled to understand the Buddhist description of selflessness, I realized I was limited by an existing indoctrination that had a very different (mis?) interpretation of selflessness, that comes from my midwestern religious upbringing.</p> Selflessness <p>I was taught selflessness as some aspect of Christianity, that Jesus was selfless and we should be too. And I learned that this kind of selflessness was about thinking about others, considering others, putting others before you. And I was indoctrinated that I should put others before&nbsp;me.</p><p>Well this didn’t work so great for me. While I was busy putting others before me, I did not receive the same treatment. I was expected to put others before me, AND ALSO meet all my own needs. Hello burnout, not to mention unfairness.</p> Selfish <p>I rebelled against this and went to take care of my needs first (well first I had to figure out what I needed cause I’d been brainwashed by society). This caused the Christians in my life to call me selfish. But if I didn’t take care of my needs, and other people didn’t take care of my needs either, where did that leave me? Was I supposed to be ok with&nbsp;that?</p> Selflessness Redux <p>As I’ve gone deeper into the Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist canon of emptiness, I came against “selflessness” again. Selflessness is supposedly one of the easiest ways to understand the weight and important of emptiness (I disagree, but that is a post for another day), because by starting with selflessness, you supposedly realize emptiness directly and relatedly to yourself. (There are also some epic mental logistics!)</p><p>Selfless in the Buddhist canon means you (and everyone) has an ever changing “I” aka this thing you think is you, that you ascribe an identity too, is not solid or everlasting — it is constantly changing based on the context and relation to the world. A bunch of years ago, I gave a talk called “How We Create I(dentity)” which talked about how we each have complex identities that change based on&nbsp;context.</p><p>Remember the uproar when Facebook was like you can only have one identity there, and it has to be the legal you? That’s the wrong view of identity. Your FB identity is constrained to the FB platform. (And teaser: your FB identity is dependent on the platform&nbsp;too.)</p> Dependent Arising <p>This “you” is dependent on many things. It’s dependent on the evolution of DNA so you have a brain and a body to move around in this world. It’s dependent on the social structure and education and global politics and the food you eat and what your ancestors ate and food is itself dependent on the earth and the&nbsp;sun.</p><p>We have a business description for this: the supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Think about it. You go to a store, you have shelves of products. Those products didn’t just magically appear out of nothing! They don’t exist on their own. The box of cookies exists because of all the steps it took along the supply chain, from the growing of the farmer’s wheat, the harvest tracked on an IoT connected John Deere tractor, the grain shipped cross border (and taxed) to a factory, which makes, say, King Arthur flour, which then is sold to bakeries, and those bakeries use human and machine labor to combine the flour with eggs, sugar, butter, baking soda, and chocolate, which is baked, packaged, marketed, shipped to your store where you can buy and eat them during a global pandemic.</p><p>This is called “dependent arising.” Which basically means, the thing does not, can not, exist on its own, of its own&nbsp;accord.</p><p>The box of cookies does not magically pop into existence from emptiness. It comes into existence bit by bit as it moves along the supply chain. We Create the Identity (and the product) of the&nbsp;thing.</p> The Supply Chain of&nbsp;You <p>Now, apply this scenario to you. You are the box of cookies. Your existence is dependent on many things. You can not exist separately. You are dependent arising. If you understand and accept that you are a result of the “supply chain of you” and you are constantly changing based on context, you may also accept/realize that you are not as solid as you think you&nbsp;are.</p><p>This is selflessness. It is the understanding that your existence is dependent on the world around you AND this constantly changing you is not a solid everlasting thing. You have no self to center on — because the self is a constantly changing projection. (I like to think about the self as disco lights at the club creating the ambiance of the dancefloor.)</p> Resolution? <p>My Christian understanding of selflessness is about putting others first because&nbsp;??? IDK Jesus said&nbsp;so?</p><p>My Buddhist understanding of selflessness is about realizing I could not exist without everything in the world, and that I do not exist — my identity/self does not exist — outside of the world. And so in this understanding I see how I connect and am created/influenced by everything.</p><p>In the Christian sense, if I do not put others first, I am “bad,” but this is self alienating. Whereas in the Buddhist sense, who I am is created by the world, and thus, I have the power to influence and create others as much as they have to influence and create me. So I can authentically consider others in order to influence and co-create who they are. Which if I think about it, is perhaps not so different from intention of considering others in the first place, with one key difference, considering others as if they are you instead of not-you, because together We Create (individual &amp; collective) I(dentity).</p>

 Understanding the future of the Internet and the flows of identity &amp; personal information 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed interviewing Kaliya Young, The Identity Women, last week, during an Identity Praxis Experts Corner Interview on November 13, 2020.</p>
  
 About Kaliya and Her Purpose 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaliya, “The Identity Women,” is a preeminent expert in all things identity and personal information management standards, protocols, resources, and relationships.</p>
<p>If you listen to our interview, you’ll hear about her purpose and passion, how she is living it, and how she helps guide the world down a path toward self-sovereignty. At the end of this path is the promise that one day people—you, me…everyone—will have control, i.e., self-determination and agency, over their identity and personal information.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kaliya’s purpose is to answer this profound question: “How do we own, control, manage, and represent ourselves in the digital world, independently of the BigTech companies (Facebook, Google, etc.)?”</p></blockquote>
<p>For the last 15+ years, Kaliya has been at the center of the self-sovereign identity (SSI) movement.</p>
<p>The SSI movement is all about creating open standards and technologies that change how identity and personal information are collected, managed, and exchanged throughout society. In other words, SSI is about getting our identity out of the grip of BigTech and into the hands of the individual, the data subject. But, SSI is so much more; it is also about evolving the Internet, making it more efficient and secure, and creating new opportunities for businesses to innovate and to forge new and lasting relationships with the people they serve.</p>
<p>The Opportunities form SSI.</p>
<p>In our interview, Kaliya highlights several opportunities that SSI can make possible, including:</p>
 
 The availability of new protocols will make it possible to securely and efficiently move data across the Internet without it being centralized in a few players’ hands. 
 The possibility for people to have control over their identity and data is created and moved, rather than it being in control of BigTech like Facebook and Google (see Kaliya’s Jan. 2020 interview in Wired, where she discusses making Facebook obsolete). 
 The chance for businesses to build a new kind of trusted, secure, and transparent relationship with their customers, and to do so while saving time, money, and reducing risk (Kaliya recommends that you check out DIDComm Messaging, an emerging protocol that is promised to bring this opportunity to light). 
 
 SSI Use Cases 
<p>It is still early days for SSI, but people worldwide are working diligently to create the foundation of SSI so that a wealth of privacy and people-centric services can come to light.</p>
<p>Following my interview with Kaliya, I took a look at the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group (VCWG), as recommended by Kaliya. The W3C VCWG is a team diligently working on adding a new, secure identity management layer to the Internet. Among other efforts that they are working on, I found that, in Sept. 2020, they released a list of use cases and technical requirements for self-sovereign identity, see the Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers draft spec.</p>
 Here is a list of high-lighted use cases, 
 
 The online shopper is assured that the product they’re buying is authentic. 
 Owners of manufactured goods, e.g., a car, can track the product’s ownership history and the provenance of every part (original and replaced) while preserving players’ anonymity up and down the supply chain for the life of the product. 
 Support for data vaults, aka personal data stores; people can securely store their data in the cloud and be confident that they and only they have access to it and that they can offer fine-grained access to their data when&nbsp;they want to. For example, they can securely share their age in a way that someone else can verify and trust without needing the person’s actual birth date or any additional information. 
 Track verifiable credentials back to their issuer; people or organizations looking to verify someone’s data will be able to track a verifiable credential or piece of data back to a trusted source, like a chamber of commerce, bank, or DMV. 
 New and improved data exchange consent management, not just for data exchange but to manage online tracking&nbsp;to power personalization and analytics 
 Power secure and anonymous payments 
 Secure physical and digital identity cards or licensing credentials that allow for fine-grained control of exactly what data is shared when the proof of identity or licensee rights need to be verified 
 
 The Challenges for SSI 
<p>According to Kaliya, the most significant challenges that we must overcome to make SSI a reality include,</p>
 
 Counteract the inertia of the status-quo; people don’t like change; they are used to existing knowledge-based authentication practices, processes, and systems. 
 People’s awareness generation and adoption of new SSI empowered services. 
 Education for everyone: developers, users, executives, customers, clients, investors, regulators, and so much more. 
 The new market model, i.e., we now face a three-sided market, and all the business models and systems operations must evolve to accommodate the new use cases. 
 
 Kaliya: A wealth of resources and knowledge&nbsp; 
<p>Kaliya is a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>She knows the SSI industry structure. She knows the leading players. She can point you to the right resources to introduce you to people that can help you understand, plan, and execute SSI solutions and services.</p>
<p>To put a fine point on it, working with Kaliya can save you months, if not years, of stumbling around in the dark as you look to figure out what SSI can do for you and your business.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the people and resources that Kaliya high-lighted and alluded to in our interview:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 W3C Credentials community group, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards. 
 Trust over IP Foundation, a leading industry group spearheading SSI standards and governance models. 
 Kim Cameron and the 7 Laws of Identity, a godfather and visionary in all things identity 
 DIDComm Messaging Protocol, a protocol for trusted data exchange 
 Internet Identity Workshop, a bi-annual incoherence where all things SSI are discussed 
 Domains of Identity, a book she wrote on identity. 
 Comprehensive Guide to Self Sovereign Identity, a book she wrote on self-sovereign identity. 
 
<p>That’s it for now. Enjoy. We’ll be sure to bring Kaliya back soon.</p>

Trust frameworks are being developed by the private sector and the public sector, as collaborative or sector-specific efforts. Trust mark and trust certification programs are also emerging alongside trust framework development efforts.</p><p>These trust framework development efforts are worthy undertakings and the results of these efforts should automatically engender trust. But the problem that we are now faced with, all good intentions aside, is — how do we truly trust a trust framework?</p><p>The answer is simple — with standards.</p><p>Trust frameworks need standards to be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Within the Canadian context, a <a href="https://www.scc.ca/standards/what-are-standards">standard</a> is defined by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of Canada</a>,&nbsp;as:</p><p>“a document that provides a set of agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results. Standards establish accepted practices, technical requirements, and terminologies for diverse&nbsp;fields.”</p><p>This standard definition might sound straightforward — making a ‘standard” might sound easy but the hard part is all the work leading up to agreeing on those things that are part of a standard — an agreed-upon rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their&nbsp;results.</p><p>That’s where trust frameworks come into play. Much of the work that eventually ends up in a standard is years if not decades in the making. For years I have been part of developing the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>. This work had started in earnest in early 2015, and building on work that goes as far as back as 2007 (you can find a lot of the historical material in the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/tree/master/docs">docs</a> folder in the PCTF repository on&nbsp;GitHub)</p><p>What has come out of all of this work is a trust framework — a set of agreed on principles, definitions, standards, specifications, conformance criteria, and assessment approach.</p><p>This definition of a trust framework, sounds pretty much like a standard, doesn’t it? Yes and no. What the trust framework has not gone through is a standards development process that respects and safeguards the interests of all stakeholders affected by the standard. Within the Canadian context, that’s where Standards Council of Canada comes into play by specifying how standards should be <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/what-are-standards/developing-standards#Development%20of%20National%20Standards%20of%20Canada">developed</a> and how to <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/accreditation">accredit</a> certain bodies to be standards development organizations.</p><p>So trust frameworks, however good and complete they are, still need to go through the step of becoming an official standard. Fortunately, this is the case in Canada, where the <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework </a>was used to develop <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/standards/">CAN/CIOSC 103–1:2020 Digital trust and Identity — Part 1: Fundamentals</a>. This standard was developed by the <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/home/">CIO Strategy Council</a>, a standards development organization accredited by the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en">Standards Council of&nbsp;Canada.</a></p><p>In closing, there are lots of trust frameworks being developed today. But to be truly trusted, a trust framework needs to either apply existing standards or become a standard itself. In Canada, we have been extremely fortunate to see the good work that we have done in the public sector to be transformed into a national standard that serves the interests of all Canadians.</p>

<p>Companies and organizations have strategic decisions to make at the Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) front. First, they have to decide whether to invest into a dedicated CIAM solution or to build on existing infrastructure. If there is already a foundation, what should be their next steps to have a mature CIAM strategy in place? If they do not have a CIAM solution, where do they start? Applications, systems, identities tend to be siloed while as a business grows, it’s imperative they are cohesive and well-integrated in order to provide a superior customer experience.</p><p>An effective CIAM solution will help connect various applications and systems such as CRM, data management, analytics and marketing platforms. This helps to move towards a 360-degree view of the customer which is a key prerequisite for successful digital transformation.</p><p>In the following webinar recording, I join with KuppingerCole Senior Analyst and Lead Advisor Matthias Reinwarth to explain how CIAM helps to achieve digital transformation, best practices in CIAM and pitfalls to avoid. Also we talk about the 5 pillars in CIAM essential for your CIAM strategy and maturity models to determine stage of&nbsp;growth.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/the-role-of-ciam-in-digital-transformation-66e0fff623d">The Role of CIAM in Digital Transformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You as somebody who is very familiar with the topic of SSI, what would you think about, when you read the term growth factor of self-sovereign identity, what comes to your&nbsp;mind?</p><p>Tim Bouma: I believe the main growth factor is going to be adoption by users and it has to be really easy. Another growth factor is that SSI will need to be part of an infrastructure. I’m not sure if SSI is viable being marketed as a separate product because I don’t think end-users really understand it. The growth factor is going to be similar to plumbing — some additional standardized capabilities that we need to build. It will be as exciting as buying a 1/4 inch washer and bolt. It will just be part of the infrastructure and the demand will be from higher-order products not for SSI itself. I’d say most people won’t even know what it is, nor should they know about it. It’s not that different from the markets in the early days of PC networking. Remember you had your choice of drivers and different companies providing those things and after a while, it just gets baked in the operating system and people don’t even know that they’re using it. As it for being a discrete market, I see very quickly being subsumed by a higher-order products and like subsumed into mobile operating systems, into desktop devices, tablets, etc. It’s not that different from how a lot of other products or technologies evolved over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: We as SSI for German consortia we want to build infrastructure for Europe, so you might have read our press release. Probably not — no worries. So basically, our idea is to come up with a base layer infrastructure which is used as a public utility as defined in the Trust over IP stack level one with a European scope in terms of the governance and a worldwide usage. So considering this plan as public private partnership. What would be your recommendations for the governance for this&nbsp;network?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Well, you are totally aligned with my thinking. In fact, we’re about to announce a challenge. There’s a couple of things going on within the government, Canada. We’re launching a technology challenge (note: since this interview the challenge has been <a href="http://github.com/canada-ca/ucvdcc">launched.</a>) to figure out exactly what layer one would be for the digital infrastructure with the standards, and also what specifically is the scope of layer one and I can point you to that link afterwards, but that’s what I’ve been working on. We were just awarding the contracts as we speak. We’re getting six vendors to help us out. I think to answer your questions, I have some good ideas, but I’m not 100% sure because it is relatively new area and I think we need to be quite open on having our assumptions challenged and change during the course, but I see a very clear differentiation between the technical interoperability and the business interoperability, and in fact the challenge that I’m doing We’ve got six different use cases ranging from government security clearances to issuing of cannabis licenses to name a few. I’m not concerned about the content of the credential because that’s more business interoperability. I’m concerned that whatever credential, SSI credential or whatever is being issued into the system can actually be verified from the system irrespective of what’s inside. I hope I’m not losing track your question here. I see a very clear division of the private sector operating that system. I don’t see why government needs to build it and operate it. We don’t do that for networks, we don’t do that for payment rails. It has to be done in a way that governments have optionality that if a new operator comes along that’s more trustworthy or has different characteristics, there’s no reason why they can’t be used. There’s a risk. Maybe it’s not a risk for this to turn into a natural monopoly if we aren’t careful to make sure that we don’t have the standards 100% right? We have to be very, very careful that we want to have a plurality of operators. But that doesn’t mean a whole lot of them. I see that there were probably only for national infrastructure that maybe one or two domestic operators. And then probably, you know there’s going to be some international operators, but they need to work together so that’s a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Who exactly do you mean with operators? Do you mean the Stewards?</p><p>Tim Bouma: OK, so there’s two different things. There’s a steward, the governance which and again this is going to be a tricky and I’ve noticed that the Trust over IP Foundation revised their model that you could have governance at each of the layers. And so the question is governance at which layer and then what’s the composition of that governance? I would see at layer one. It’s largely a technical&nbsp;issue. It could be just part predominantly private sector players, maybe some government or nonprofit, but I just don’t know yet. I think where a government really will play is not in the infrastructure itself, but how that infrastructure is used and relied on for doing administration of programs. Provision of services. You know it could be passports. It can be currency. It could be educational credentials or whatever. I think government needs to be concerned at that level, but less so at the lower levels. But having confidence in those lower&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: When we speak about adoption, one of the big topics is use cases in general. We think that more or less the low hanging fruit, which is really easy to implement, is where you have the issuer also as a relying party. For example a University, which issued a student ID and then checks it again to issue him some other credentials. What would you think would be good for the start for different use cases? Let me reframe the question shortly. What are your recommendations for use cases to start with? What is the best&nbsp;one?</p><p>Tim Bouma: We had six vendors propose to us and they came up with six different use cases, and they’re quite varied, and I don’t think I can say which one is going to take off by adoption or not, but there is a government security clearances, there’s a cannabis licensing, there’s one for having your digital birth certificate, there’s one for a job site permit, it came from oil and gas. I’m not so sure which one is going to play out. I think what’s more important is really having a crystal clear understanding of what’s the digital infrastructure that can serve all of those use cases. That’s where my thinking is. What’s the absolute minimum that needs to be built? That could be an infrastructure so I think any one of these use cases can take off, but I think that model of issuer Holder verifier and we’ve generalized it to methods. It doesn’t have to be a blockchain. It could be a database. It could be different ways of doing it. There’s a super pattern there that will just serve all the use cases and this is where I’ve been putting a lot of intellectual effort just on my own time just to understand what the parallels are to digital currency and digital identity. It all boils down to kind of the similar idea is that I need to independently verify something. And I need to do it in a way that’s as flexible as possible, and then I need to have some additional functions. Digital currency. You need a transfer capability for digital identity or digital verification. I don’t think you need that. What are the absolute minimal requirements for this digital infrastructure? And it’s kind of like standardizing on paper and ink for doing contracts. You know you need paper and you need ink. What should we all standardize on? 8 1/2 by 11 or 8, four and a special type of ink that you need to use or just ink. Can’t be pencil or graphite or crayon and that’s good enough to move on to all the other very use cases. I don’t know what use case is going to take off. I think the important thing for us to do is do the critical thinking to figure out what are the common patterns on underneath there that are going to apply in all of those use cases. And as I said my working hypothesis now is that the issuer, holder, verifier with some ornamentation will do the&nbsp;job.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Considering you your knowledge with the pan Canadian trust framework. You, as a policymaker, what will be your recommendation for policymakers in the European Union which work for example at the European self-sovereign identity framework?</p><p>Tim Bouma: It’s interesting. ’cause I actually had a call on this very same issue. I think policymakers actually have to go back to the drawing board and take a look at all the concepts and see if they have the right concepts to actually build out a framework and regulation, and that’s what we’ve been doing with Pan Canadian Trust Framework. We’ve recognized that what we tried to do is ingest all the latest concepts, such as issuer, holder, verifier credentials and express them in a way that does not limit them by assumption, like you don’t assume the credential is a document for example, or physical document. Or it’s just manifested only as a physical document. A credentials is a claim that can be independently verifiable and coming up with those concepts. So when you’re actually building up the frameworks and regulations you have a robust and a framework that doesn’t constrain you to a particular technological approach. There may be new technologies that come along that you didn’t even anticipate, but if you’ve done your critical thinking up front, there should be no reason why you can’t adopt that, so I think we’re just at this interesting point right now. I think we have an opportunity to go back to the drawing board. And this is just not an issue of just updating like eIDAS or other regulations and just tweaking a bit. It’s like going back to the drawing board and just say do we have the right policy constructs, which then could become regulatory requirements or legislative requirements. I think that we’re building a next generation of solutions here, and I think it’s really important that that we have the right constructs going forward, and I think we do have good confidence because I’ve looked at my evolution of thinking. You know I really started to get deep in the space in 2016 and really spend a lot of time internalizing the concepts. And it’s just a lot of iterations, but I feel like we’re in a good spot now to actually have a conversation of what these frameworks and regulations might be. It’s not just taking a paper analogue and saying, You know, just let’s do a digital equivalent of that, or a document analogue. We have to think about it differently.</p><p>Adrian Doerk: Then I would like to come to my last question. What do you think will be the negative sites or the danger sites of&nbsp;SSI?</p><p>Tim Bouma: Aside from all the hype and blue-sky stuff that has no merit. You see this often with any type of new technology, for example that SSI will solve hunger. It will solve society’s problems. First of all, just making sure it doesn’t get implicated in outrageous claims and that it has nothing that those are deeper problems to solve. So I think, as Gartner calls it, there’s the hype cycle. Of course, when you have the hype cycle, you get the what I call the allergic reaction that people will say, “We’re not going to use it because, you know, it’s got a bad name.” The other thing that we need to be concerned with or cognizant of is that we could build some capabilities that are outside of the states control. And I don’t know how that would manifest itself. All right, the great example is the Bitcoin Blockchain. It basically is a system that just runs on its own and no one can stop it because the way it’s structured, there’s no Corporation or operator that you can actually like take down and the algorithms, proof of work, and that it’s all open and permissionless. People are valuing like whatever is associated with their Bitcoin address because they value it. And there’s basically no way that a state or large actor can actually control that. And also not really bad thing. You know the way I’ve been describing it is that in the Bitcoin context from the economic context, we may have a new macroeconomic factor coming on the horizon that we need to work into our models around a proof of work turning energy into a digital assets and how that plays out, don’t know. So I, I think some of the downsides might be is. There may be some key capabilities that could be built. That could be viewed as illegal or unlawful in certain contexts, and so they they ban it outright. So I think we have to be very careful with this new technology to make sure that we bring the stakeholders along so we can embrace the positive side of the technology. Every technology is a two-edged sword, gunpowder, guns, you know anything? There’s an upside and there’s the downside, right? And I think that’s something that we have to be very cognizant of just like you know. In the mid 90s you had the crypto wars with the clipper chip. You can only have expert with certain key strengths and that caused a reaction and so we have to be careful that we don’t get caught into those same traps of us against the government or government against them. I think we have to figure out how to work this out together.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since my last post… Overwhelmed by trying to keep up with the fast flows of information, and my own internal processes, I took a break from social media, stopped working on most of the projects I had begun, and turned inward. I’ve also been busy leveling up, and discovering my potential.</p>

<p>So what exactly have I doing with all that time?</p>



 Managing Emotions 

<p>If you haven’t been following my story, so far, the short version is that I quit drinking a few years ago, and all of this info-gathering has been an important part of my recovery process, and a path to creating a new life.</p>

<p>All the same, however far along I had come in my work, and self-education, I still had the challenges processing every day emotions, which I’d been primarily avoiding by processing as much information on valuable topics as possible.</p>

<p>Turning that around, I shifted most of my info-gathering from blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralized-identity, to focus more on mental hygiene and emotional agility.</p>

<p>The most valuable information I’ve encountered in that regard is <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/book-chapter-1">Marshall Rosenberg’s Nonviolent Communication</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re interested, in nonviolent communication, with the kind of honesty that supports people connecting with each other in a way that makes compassionate giving inevitable, that makes it enjoyable for people to contribute to each other’s well being. - Marshall Rosenberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve got a couple projects brewing on that topic, and will write more about that later, so don’t want to take too much space for that now.</p>

<p>In brief, I can say that spending time with the teachings of Marshall Rosenberg has made a significant contribution to my mental health and emotional wellbeing.</p>

<p>If you’re curious to learn more, I called a session at my first IIW on the topic, you can check out the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Introduction%5CDiscussion_-_Marshall_Rosenberg%27s_Nonviolent_Communication_(perhaps_discussing_integration_with_standards_processes)">notes for that session on the IIW Wiki</a>, which provides a high-level overview, and lots of links.</p>

 Developing the backend for a sustainable weekly newsletter 

<p>I’d been chatting with <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Identity Woman</a> for around a year, after contacting her about the potential for our collaborating on decentralized identity. At some point, she proposed the idea of writing a newsletter together, under the <a href="https://identosphere.net">Identosphere.net</a> domain.</p>

<p>Instead of jumping in head first, like I usually do, we’ve spent a lot of time figuring out how to run a newsletter, sustainably, with as few third party services as possible, while I’m learning my way around various web-tools.</p>

<p>We’re tackling a field that touches every domain, has a deep history, and is currently growing faster than anyone can keep up with. But this problem of fast-moving information streams isn’t unique to digital identity, and I’d like to share this process for others to benefit from.</p>

 GitHub Pages 

<p>I started in Decentralized ID creating freelance content, and ended up building an Awsome List, to organize my findings. Once that list outgrew the Awesome format, I began learning to create static web-sites with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

 
   <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack</a>  (a resource I’ve created along that journey) 
 

<p>Static Websites are great for security and easy to set up, but if you’re trying to create any type of business online, you’re gonna want some forms so you can begin collecting e-mail subscribers! Forms are not supported natively through Jekyll or GitHub Pages.</p>

 Enter Staticman 

<p><a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman">Staticman</a> is a comments engine for static websites, but can be used for any kind of form, with the proper precautions.</p>

<p>It can be deployed to Heroku with a click of a button, made into a GitHub App, or run on your own server.  Once set up, it will submit a pull-request to your repository with the form details (and an optional <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> integration).</p>

<p>I set it up on my own server and created a <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html">bot account on GitHub</a> with permissions to a private repository for the Staticman app to update with subscriptions e-mails to.</p>

<p>Made the form, and a <code>staticman.yml</code> config file in the root of the private repository where I’m collecting e-mail addresses.</p>

 The Subscription Form 

   <code>&lt;center&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subscribe for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form class="staticman" method="POST" action="https://identosphere.net/staticman/v2/entry/infominer33/subscribe/master/subscribe"&gt;

    &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
</code>   
 The staticman.yml config in the root of my private subscribe repo 

   <code>subscribe:

 Planet Pluto Feed Reader 

<p>Trying to keep up with Self-Sovereign Identity, kaliya and I started out with Feedly, but the pricing for collaborative feed creation is nearly <a href="https://feedly.com/i/pro/welcome">$50 a month</a> for two users. There was no way I could go with that for very long.</p>

<p>One of the most promising projects I found, in pursuit of keeping up with all the info, is <a href="https://github.com/web-work-tools/awesome-planet-pluto">Planet Pluto Feed Reader</a>, by Gerald Bauer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In online media a planet is a feed aggregator application designed to collect posts from the weblogs of members of an internet community and display them on a single page. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)">Planet (Software)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the uninitiated, I should add that websites generate RSS feeds that can be read by a newsreader, allowing users to keep up with posts from multiple locations without needing to visit each site individually. You very likely use RSS all the time without knowing, for example, your podcast player depends on RSS feeds to bring episodes directly to your phone.</p>

<p>What <a href="https://github.com/feedreader/">Pluto Feed reader</a> does is just like your podcast app, except, instead of an application on your phone that only you can browse, it builds a simple webpage from the feeds you add to it, that can be published on GitHub, your favorite static web-hosting service, or on your own server in the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="http://planet-templates.github.io/"></a></p>

<p>Pluto is built with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, using the <a href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/erb/">ERB templating</a> language for <a href="https://github.com/planet-templates">web-page design</a>.</p>

<p>One of the cool things about ERB is it lets you use any ruby function in your web-page template, supporting any capability you might want to enable while rendering your feed. This project has greatly helped me to learn the basics of Ruby while customizing its templates to suit my needs.</p>

 Feed Search 

<p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub-Radar">RSSHub Radar</a> browser extension to find feeds for sites while I’m browsing. However, this would be a lot of work when I want to get feeds for a number of sites at once.</p>

<p>I found a few simple python apps that find feeds for me. They aren’t perfect, but they do allow me to find feeds for multiple sites at the same time, all I have to do is format the query and hit enter.</p>

<p>As you can see below, these are not fully formed applications, just a few lines of code. To run them, it’s necessary to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a>, install the package with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> (<code>pip install feedsearch-crawler</code>), and type <code>python</code> at the command prompt, which takes you to a Python terminal that will recognize these commands.</p>

<p>From there you can type\paste python commands for demonstration, practice, or for simple scripts like this. I could also put the following scripts into their own feedsearch.py file and type <code>python feedsearch.py</code>,  but I haven’t gotten around to doing anything like that.</p>

<p>Depending on the site, and the features you’re interested in, either of these feed seekers has their merits.</p>

 Feedsearch Crawler 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/DBeath/feedsearch-crawler">DBeath/feedsearch-crawler</a> 
 

   <code>from feedsearch_crawler import search
import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
import output_opml
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    feeds = search(items)
    output_opml(feeds).decode()
    logger = logging.getLogger("feedsearch_crawler")
</code>   

 Feed seeker 

 
   <a href="https://github.com/mitmedialab/feed_seeker">mitmedialab/feed_seeker</a> 
 

   <code>from feed_seeker import generate_feed_urls
list = ["http://bigfintechmedia.com/Blog/","http://blockchainespana.com/","http://blog.deanland.com/"]
for items in list:
    for url in generate_feed_urls(items):
        print(url)
</code>   

 GitHub Actions 

<p>Pluto Feed Reader is great, but I needed to find a way for it to run a regular schedule, so I wouldn’t have to run the command every time I wanted to check for new feeds. For this, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a>.</p>

<p>This is an incredible feature of GitHub that allows you to spin up a virtual machine, install an operating system, dependencies supporting your application, and whatever commands you’d like to run, on a schedule.</p>

 Identosphere Blogcatcher 

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher">Identosphere Blogcatcher</a> (<a href="https://github.com/identosphere/planetid-reboot">source</a>) is a feed aggregator for personal blogs of people who’ve been working on digital identity through the years, inspired by the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161029051802/http://planetidentity.org/">Planet Identity</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a page for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/companies/">companies</a>, and another for <a href="https://identosphere.net/blogcatcher/organizations/">organizations</a> working in the field.</p>

 Identosphere Weekly Highlights 

<p>Last month, <a href="https://twitter.com/identitywoman">Kaliya</a> suggested that since we have these pages up and running smoothly, we were ready to start our newsletter. This is just a small piece of the backend information portal we’re working towards, and not enough to make this project as painless and comprehensive as possible, but we had enough to get started.</p>

<p>Every weekend we get together, browse the BlogCatcher, and share essential content others in our field will appreciate.</p>

<p>We’ll be publishing our 6th edition, at the start of next week, and our numbers are doing well!</p>

<p></p>

<p>This newsletter is free, and a great opportunity for us to work together on something consistent while developing a few other ideas.</p>

 <a href="https://identosphere.substack.com/">identosphere.substack.com</a> 

<p>Setting up a newsletter without third-party intermediaries is more of a challenge than I’m currently up for, so we’ve settled on Substack for now, which seems to be a trending platform for tech newsletters.</p>

<p>It has a variety of options for both paid and free content, and you can read our content before subscribing.</p>

 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">Support us on Patreon</a> 

<p>While keeping the newsletter free, we are accepting contributions via Patreon. (yes another intermediary, but we can draw upon a large existing userbase, and it’s definitely easier than setting up a self-hosted alternative.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere"></a></p>

<p>So far, we have enough to cover a bit more than server costs, and this will ideally grow to support our efforts, and enable us to sustainably continue developing these open informational projects.</p>

 Python, Twitter Api, and GitHub Actions 

<p>Since we’re publishing this newsletter, and I’ve gotten a better handle on my inner state, I decided it was time to come back to twitter. However, I knew I couldn’t do it the old way, where I manually re-tweeted everything of interest, spending hours a day scrolling multiple accounts trying to stay abreast of important developments.</p>

<p>Instead, I dove into the twitter api. The benefits of using twitter programmatically can’t be understated. For my first project, I decided to try an auto-poster, which could enable me to keep an active twitter account, without having to regularly pay attention to twitter.</p>

<p>I found a simple guide <a href="https://dototot.com/how-to-write-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-tweepy/">How To Write a Twitter Bot with Python and tweepy</a> composed of a dozen lines of python. That simple script posts a tweet to your account, but I wanted to post from a pre-made list, and so figured out how to read from a <a href="https://yaml.org/">yaml</a> file, and then used <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python">GitHub actions</a> to run the script on a regular schedule.</p>

<p>While that didn’t result in anything I’m ready to share here, quite yet, somewhere during that process I realized that I could write python. After playing around with Ruby, in ERB, to build the BlogCatcher, and running various python scripts that other people wrote, tinkering where necessary, eventually I had pieced together enough knowledge I could actually write my own code!</p>

 Decentralized ID Weekly Twitter Collections 

<p>With that experience as a foundation I knew I was ready to come <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/">back to Twitter</a>, begin trying to make more efficient use of its wealth of knowledge, and see about keeping up my accounts without losing too much hair.</p>

<p>I made <a href="https://gist.github.com/vickyqian/f70e9ab3910c7c290d9d715491cde44c">a script that searches twitter</a> for a variety of keywords related to decentralized identity, and write the tweet text and some other attributes to a csv file. From there, I can sort through those tweets, and save only the most relevant, and publish a few hundred tweets about decentralized identity to a weekly <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-a-twitter-collection-via-api-1378ecfe20df">twitter collection</a>, that make our job a lot easier than going to 100’s of websites to find out what’s happening. :D</p>

<p>Soon, these will be regularly published to <a href="https://decentralized-id.com">decentralized-id.com</a>, which I found out is an approved method of re-publishing tweets, unlike the ad hoc method I was using before, sharing them to discord channels (which grabs metadata and displays the preview image \ text), exporting their contents and re-publishing that.</p>

<p>I do intend to share my source for all that after I’ve gotten the kinks worked out, and set it running on an action.</p>

 Twitter collections I’ve made so far 

 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322735918386733057">Self Sovereign ID 101</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a> 
   <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">November Week 1 #SSI #DID</a> 
 

 Decentralized-ID.com 

<p>Now we have a newsletter, and are seeking patrons, it seemed appropriate to work on developing <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/posts/">decentralized-id.com</a>, cleaning up some of its hastily thrown together parts, and adding a bunch of content to better represent the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>That said, I’ve not given up on <a href="https://bitcoinfo.xyz">Bitcoin</a>, or <a href="https://sourcecrypto.pub">Crypto</a>. On the contrary, I’m sure this work is only expanding my future capacity to continue working to fulfil the original vision of those resources.</p>

 Web-Work.Tools 

<p>With the information and skills i’ve gathered over the past year, <a href="https://web-work.tools">web-work.tools</a> was starting to look pretty out of date, relative to the growth of my understanding.</p>

<p>I updated <a href="https://web-work.tools/jamstack/github-pages-starter-pack/">GitHub Pages Starter Pack \ Extended Resources</a> quite a lot to reflect those learnings, and separate the wheat from the chaff of the links I gathered when I was first figuring out how to use GitHub pages.</p>

 Thanks for stopping by!

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating.

<p>Travel always has its ups and downs but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced both at the same time as intensely as right now.</p>
<p>I’m at Moonstone Beach in Cambria, just south of San Simeon, in a rented camper van. After a walk on the beach I hop in, reverse, clip a rock, blow a tire, and come to rest alongside the guard rail facing the ocean.</p>
<p>I call roadside assistance; they can deliver a tire but not until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I may be about to win the road trip breakdown lottery. I’m snuggled in my two-sleeping-bag nest on the air mattress in the back of the van, on a bluff about 25 feet above the beach, with the van’s big side door open, watching and hearing the tide roll in.</p>
<p>The worst and best parts of my trip are happening at the same time. I screwed up, am stuck, cannot go anywhere. But of all the places I could have been stuck on this trip, I’m stuck in the place I most want to be.</p>
<p>The sign says the gate closes at 6, but nobody has shown up by 7 when everyone else is gone. I can’t reach the authorities. This would be the campsite of my dreams if I’m allowed to stay.</p>
<p>The suspense is killing me. </p>
<p>Eventually a cop shows up, agrees that I can’t go anywhere, and gives me permission to stay for the night. I win the lottery! Nobody ever gets to stay here overnight. But here I am.</p>
<p>We’re all stuck in many ways for many reasons. A road trip during the final week before the election seemed like a way to silence the demons. Roaming around the state didn’t really help. But this night on the bluff over Moonstone Beach most certainly will.</p>
<p>In the light of the full moon, the crests of the waves are sometimes curls of silver, sometimes wraiths of foam that drift slowly south, continually morphing.</p>
<p>I don’t know how we’re all going to get through this winter. I don’t know what comes next. I don’t even have a plan for tomorrow. But I am so grateful to be here now.</p>

  Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail.

<p>
 Well it's happened again. I've done yet another rebuild of this website using Django and Wagtail. For my previous build, I used Gatsby to build a static site which I hosted on Netlify. The dynamic content of the site was stored in an instance of Ghost which was then pulled in at build-time.
</p>
<p>
 Overall, I was quite disappointed with Gatsby. I found the framework to be quite over-engineered. At one point, I found myself trying to resize a photo or something and it required some (to me at least) very complex configuration and some fancy graphQL query just to get the image to load. Another issue I have is with the offline plugin. Gatsby uses service workers to cache your entire site offline which can then be served by a service worker in case your users have spotty internet. Or no internet. The problem comes with removing this service worker once you move away from the framework. I needed to do quite a bit of research to figure out how to delete the service worker once I moved over to the new site since Gatsby chooses to use caching very aggressively which is not recommended.
</p>
<p>
 I understand why Gatsby makes these choices. Their goal is to make websites load insanely fast which I think they accomplish at a great cost of complexity. And they work hard to ensure that Gatsby sites score highly on the Google Lighthouse test. I have two issues with these goals. First, I'm not sure pursuing a high score on Lighthouse is a good goal to optimize for. Making a website load quickly is important, but Lighthouse will ding you for things using a particular Javascript library instead of their recommended smaller library. This is a game of cat-and-mouse which has little benefit beyond speeding up your website (which is important). Second, the amount of complexity that Gatsby introduces will likely slow down the development of your site and stifle your creativity. I can't comment on the experience of using Gatsby in the context of a larger team, but for me I know it led to making fewer improvements to the site because of the complexity.
</p>
<p>
 As for Ghost as a headless CMS – I think there are some limitations there. Overall, Ghost is a great platform. It's reliable and usable and has a good writing experience. I do think that their push into the JAMStack fad was mostly a marketing play since some limitations were never addressed even after several years. I would definitely use Ghost again, just not as a headless CMS. I would use it how it was primarily designed to be used.
</p>
<p>
 So why did I choose Django and Wagtail? Well, I've been using Django on and off for a long time. Probably 7 years at this point. The framework is reliable and seriously productive. Wagtail is built as a Django "app" so it's very familiar to me and it's very powerful. Overall, I'm content with the developer experience so far. I think the admin interface that is used to publish content could use some work. It's functional but frankly it's pretty ugly. Especially compared to something like Statamic which has been getting some attention lately.
</p>
<p>
 It's been a while since I've run my blog with server-rendered pages with dynamic content as opposed to a static site published to a CDN. I think the fact that I can log into a dashboard and publish content is so much more ergonomic from a writing and publishing perspective that I'm more likely to write more. Compared to the process of building a static site and deploying an update, it's quite nice. The downside, obviously, is that I need to worry again about load on the site and downtime during traffic spikes. I'm hopeful that this is something that I can avoid by using caching and a CDN. The site now has virtually no javascript. Compared to Gatsby this is a big change. We'll see how it turns out but my theory is that I should be able to achieve similar speeds (good enough anyway) using some clever caching and a CDN. Browsers are pretty good at rendering plain HTML after all.

For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After a cup of menstrual blood went flying across the Senate floor, I had assumed 2019 would be California’s wildest legislative session for a while. Covid-19 proved me unfortunately wrong. The Legislative process, calendar and agenda was quickly thrown into the dumpster fire of March and everyone turned back to the white&nbsp;board.</p><p>When the Legislature returned from its two-month long “stay at home” recess in May, it passed a stripped-down state budget which reflected lower revenues given the pandemic-induced recession. They then began prioritizing and shelving hundreds of bills that would no longer make the cut in the truncated legislative calendar. Faced with less time to hold hearings and less money to spend on new proposals, legislators shelved an estimated three-quarters of the bills introduced at the beginning of the two-year&nbsp;session.</p><p>Here’s what happened for BAC’s blockchain/crypto sponsored bills:</p><p>AB 953 (Ting, San Francisco), which would have allowed state and local taxes to be paid with stablecoins, was sadly withdrawn, lacking a clear Covid-19&nbsp;nexus.</p><p>AB 2004 (Calderon, Whittier) marked the first time verifiable credentials saw legislative debate. The bill to allow the use of verifiable credentials for covid-19 test results and other medical records made it through both houses with bipartisan support. Due to state budget restraints, it was ultimately vetoed, however the concept gained significant legislative momentum quickly. We are actively working on our strategy for verifiable credentials policy next&nbsp;year.</p><p>AB 2150 (Calderon, Whittier) spun through several dizzying iterations. The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition worked closely with Assemblymember Calderon’s office to suggest amended language that would have directed the Department of Business Oversight to study the applicability of SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce’s Proposal to an intrastate safe harbor. An idea that in previous years seemed far fetched suddenly had political legs and was well received by the agency and several committees. It died in the Senate Appropriations Committee along with nearly everything else that had a significant price tag or wasn’t urgently related to the pandemic.</p><p>Fruitful discussions with the DBO about crypto regulation were well timed, however. Given the microscope on consumer protections due to the economic distress caused by the pandemic, the agency received a $19.2 million allocation and a new name: California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (CDFPI- much worse acronym&nbsp;imo).</p><p>HERE’S THE PART YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO:</p><p>With this new agency budget/mission, comes a very likely change in the way cryptocurrency is regulated in <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1864">CA. AB 1864</a> does a few&nbsp;things:</p>  Establishes a Financial Technology Innovation Office based in San Francisco  Requires the department to promulgate rules regarding registration requirements  Charges this department with regulating currently unregulated financial services including issuers of stored value or such&nbsp;business  <p>This marks a departure from the agency’s previous approach. Virtual currency businesses did not have any separate registration requirements or the need to apply for a money transmitter license. BAC participated in stakeholder calls this summer about the agency’s expansion and we are continuing to engage with the agency about how these registration requirements will be created. Cryptocurrency businesses need to understand that the agency has been given the authority to create these standards without going back to the legislature, so early engagement is&nbsp;key.</p><p>Interested in joining our coalition and having a seat at the table? Contact: <a href="mailto:ally@blockadvocacy.org">ally@blockadvocacy.org</a></p><p>BAC has previously facilitated educational workshops with the Department of Business Oversight and hosted roundtables with Gov. Newsom, Treasurer Ma and the Legislature to build an understanding of the importance of the blockchain industry in&nbsp;CA.</p>

<p>How to enable the Enterprise to move from existing centralized or federated identity access management systems to a decentralized model was the topic in the 15th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup*. &nbsp;In both the private and public sector the capital investments in IAMs runs into the billions of dollars, for decentralized identity models to make serious inroads in this sector providing a of roadmap or transition journey that both educates and enables the enterprise to make the move is required. </p><p>In our 15th event we discussed the routes &nbsp;being taken by Raonsecure and IdRamp. &nbsp;Both Raonsecure and IdRamp are being successful in making the introduction of &nbsp;decentralized identity concepts to the market and helping their customers start on this transition journey. </p><p>Alex David (Senior Manager, Raonsecure) started with brief update on the forces driving decentralized identifiers in the Korean market and then presented Raonsecure’s Omnione product. &nbsp;In keeping with the theme on the ‘bridging’ to bring DIDs and VCs into the market Alex went through six different pilots, &nbsp;and proof of concept solutions that Omnione has implemented in the Korean market. &nbsp;These include working with the Korean Military Manpower Association on DID based authentication and issuing of verifiable credentials (VCs) to Korean veterans to the use of DIDs for driverless car identification in an autonomous vehicle pilot in Sejong, Korea. </p><p>Mike Vesey (CEO, IdRamp) introduced IdRamp and discussed their core objective of bringing DIDs and VCs into the enterprise market by creating a ’non-frightening’ educational path to adoption of decentralized identity. &nbsp;IdRamp is a session based transactional gateway (no logging) to all things identity, providing common service delivery and compliance and consent management across identity platforms. &nbsp;They are not an identity service provider but resemble more closely as a digital notary in the generation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. &nbsp;The service integration capability of IdRamp was demonstrated with the use of employee issued verifiable credentials to authenticate to a enterprise service (in this case a Zoom session login). &nbsp; </p><p>Finally, the seed of an upcoming event was planted. &nbsp;As with any new technology market breaking through the ’noise’ of everyday life is very difficult. &nbsp;This is no different for DIDs and VCs. &nbsp;You will have to watch the recording to get the topic….&nbsp; </p><p>For a recording of the event please check out the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/472937478">https://vimeo.com/472937478</a> </p><p>Time markers: </p>  <p>0:00:00 - Introduction </p>  <p>0:05:04 - State of DIDs in South Korea</p>  <p>0:13:29 - Introducing Omnione</p>  <p>0:24:00 - DIDs and VCs in action in South Korea</p>  <p>0:51:18 - Introduction to IdRamp </p>  <p>1:04:00 - Interactive demo on IdRamp </p>  <p>1:08:00 - Wallets and compatibility</p>  <p>1:11:00 - Service integration demo &amp; discussion</p>  <p>1:31:57 - Upcoming events</p>  <p>For more information on Raonsecure Omnione:&nbsp;<a href="https://omnione.net/en/main">https://omnione.net/en/main</a> </p><p>For more information on IdRamp:&nbsp;<a href="https://idramp.com/">https://idramp.com/</a> </p><p>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

 MyData Canada Privacy Law Reform Submission <p>MyData Canada recently submitted a report to the Government of Ontario in response to its <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-strengthening-privacy-protections-ontario">consultation</a> for strengthening privacy protections in Ontario. You can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g03gwjdh76wllt9/MyData%20Canada%20Ontario%20Privacy%20Reform%20Submission%20%28Final%29.pdf?dl=0">download the submission</a> from the <a href="https://mydatacanada.webflow.io/">MyData Canada</a> site. I am a board member of MyData Global and a member of the MyData Canada hub. This is a brief summary of some of the recommendations in that report.</p><p>Part of what MyData Canada would like the province of Ontario to address is the current ‘gatekeeper model’ where each of us cede control to information about us under terms or privacy policies based on a flawed consent model. As the report puts it,</p><blockquote>Behind each of the gate-keepers (“data controllers” in GDPR terms) in the centralized model are thousands of intermediaries and data brokers invisible to the individuals whose data they process. Individuals’ personal data is used in ways they could not anticipate, and often without their awareness or even the opportunity to meaningfully consent.</blockquote><p>This needs to be fixed.</p> Background <p>Canada has a multi-jurisdictional privacy environment. That means that both levels of government have privacy commissioners and privacy laws. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, does not have a private sector privacy law. This leaves a number of categories of persons and organizations uncovered; don’t ask why, it’s a constitutional jurisdictional thing. Thus the consultation and submission. MyData Canada believes that,</p><blockquote>…our proposed approach will help accelerate the development and uptake of privacy- focused, human-centric innovation and ultimately serve to regain public trust and confidence in the digital economy.</blockquote> 2-Branch Privacy Reform <p>MyData Canada proposes a two branch approach to privacy law reform; a harmonization branch, and a transformation branch.</p>  The harmonization branch proposes an incremental approach to enable any new Ontario law to work harmoniously with other regimes, both in Canada and in the rest of the world. This branch is intended to ensure that Ontario is a low friction end point for cross border data flows with other data protection data. At the same time this branch will introduce a regulatory framework with a functional equivalency to the CCPA in the US and to the GDPR in the EU. In essence, this broad framework skates to where the puck will be with respect to global data protection laws.  The digital transformation branch proposes to simultaneously create a ‘next-generation’ regulatory space within Ontario. This space will allow Ontario based companies or organization to create new forward looking and individually centred solutions. To continue the metaphor, this branch will allow breakaway solutions that will disrupt the current platform information gatekeepers and return autonomy to individuals.   Harmonize Up <p>Rather than seeking a lowest common denominator or participating in a race to the bottom, MyData recommends harmonizing ‘up’ including the following:</p>  Adopting a principled and risk based approach to privacy regulation;  Coordinating with other provinces and the federal government, perhaps including a pan-Canadian council of information and privacy commissioners;  Aligning with Convention 108 and 108+;  Increased enforcement powers; and  Implementation support for businesses and organizations for compliance.   Digital Transformation <p>Create a regulatory environment to reward first movers with privacy enhancing technologies that put people at the centre of their own data. Recommendations include:</p>  Creating a privacy technology incubator;  Host regulatory sandboxes and hackathons;  Grants and other incentives for privacy ‘retrofits’;  Create and support a regime for seals, badges, and privacy trust marks;  Foster interoperability by requiring api or similar means to prevent or counter ‘platform dominance’ and network affects; and  Create up-skilling programs for a multi-disciplinary privacy engineering centre of excellence in Ontario.   Summing up <p>The above is just a summary of the first recommendations of the report. It includes further recommendations on:</p>  Taking a comprehensive approach to move beyond compliance;  Adopting a Consumer Protection and Human Rights oriented regulatory enforcement model  Adopting a multi-stakeholder and inclusive model to spur innovation and open data  <p>If you find this interesting please download and share the report.</p>

<p>Back in June, I wrote about <a title="Test Postgres Extensions With GitHub Actions">testing Postgres extensions</a> on
multiple versions of Postgres using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. The pattern relies on
Docker image, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>, which contains scripts to build and run any
version of PostgreSQL, install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and
release an extension. I’ve since updated it to support testing on the the latest
development release of Postgres, meaning one can test on any major version from
8.4 to (currently) 14. I’ve also created GitHub workflows for all of my PGXN
extensions (except for <a href="https://pgtap.org">pgTAP</a>, which is complicated). I’m quite happy with it.</p>
<p>But I was never quite satisfied with the release process. Quite a number of
Postgres extensions also release on GitHub; indeed, <a href="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca">Paul Ramsey</a> told me
straight up that he did not want to manually upload extensions like <a href="https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http">pgsql-http</a>
and <a href="http://postgis.net">PostGIS</a> to PGXN, but for PGXN to automatically pull them in when they were
published on GitHub. It’s pretty cool that newer packaging systems like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev">pkg.go.dev</a> auto-index any packages on GibHub. Adding such a feature to PGXN
would be an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But since I’m low on TUITs for such a significant undertaking, I decided instead
to work out how to automatically publish a release on GitHub and PGXN via
<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. After experimenting for a few months, I’ve worked out a
straightforward method that should meet the needs of most projects. I’ve proven
the pattern via the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml"><code>release.yml</code></a>, which successfully
published the v0.1.7 release today on both <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/releases/tag/v0.1.7">GitHub</a> and
<a href="https://pgxn.org/dist/pair/0.1.7/">PGXN</a>. With that success, I updated the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>
documentation with a starter example. It looks like this:</p>

        asset_name: ${{ steps.bundle.outputs.bundle }}
        asset_content_type: application/zip
</code> 
 
 <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 
<p>Lines 4-5 trigger the workflow only when a tag starting with the letter v is
pushed to the repository. This follows the common convention of tagging
releases with version numbers, such as <code>v0.1.7</code> or <code>v4.6.0-dev</code>. This
assumes that the tag represents the commit for the release.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 10 specifies that the job run in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
we have our tools for building and releasing extensions.</p>
 
 
<p>Line 13 passes the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> variable into the container. This is the
GitHub <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens/new">personal access token</a> that’s automatically set for every build. It
lets us call the <a href="https://docs.github.com/">GitHub API</a> via actions later in the workflow.</p>
 
 
<p>Step “Bundle the Release”, on Lines 17-19, validates the extension
<code>META.json</code> file and creates the release zip file. It does so by simply
reading the distribution name and version from the <code>META.json</code> file and
archiving the Git repo into a zip file. If your process for creating a
release file is more complicated, you can do it yourself here; just be sure
to include an <code>id</code> for the step, and emit a line of text so that later
actions know what file to release. The output should look like this, with
<code>$filename</code> representing the name of the release file, usually
<code>$extension-$version.zip</code>:</p>
 <code>::set-output name=bundle::$filename
</code>  
 
<p>Step “Release on PGXN”, on lines 20-25, releases the extension on PGXN. We
take this step first because it’s the strictest, and therefore the most
likely to fail. If it fails, we don’t end up with an orphan GitHub release
to clean up once we’ve fixed things for PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p>With the success of a PGXN release, step “Create GitHub Release”, on lines
26-35, uses the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release">create-release</a> action to create a release
corresponding to the tag. Note the inclusion of <code>id: release</code>, which will be
referenced below. You’ll want to customize the body of the release; for the <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/">pair extension</a>, I added a simple <a href="https://github.com/theory/kv-pair/blob/798cd00e76b5b029967262101b9bb2c4add0e9d2/Makefile#L28-L29">make target</a> to generate a file, then pass it
via the <code>body_path</code> config:</p>
  <code>- name: Generate Release Changes
  run: make latest-changes.md
- name: Create GitHub Release
  id: release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
    release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
    body_path: latest-changes.md
</code>   
 
<p>Step “Upload Release Asset”, on lines 36-43, adds the release file to the
GitHub release, using output of the <code>release</code> step to specify the URL to
upload to, and the output of the <code>bundle</code> step to know what file to upload.</p>
 
 
<p>Lotta steps, but works nicely. I only wish I could require that the testing
workflow finish before doing a release, but I generally tag a release once it
has been thoroughly tested in previous commits, so I think it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to add this workflow to my other PGXN
extensions.</p>

  This is a flight of fancy written a week and a half before the US election. I hope it proves to be bad speculation.

 What if? <p>Here’s a speculative fiction plot, NOT a prediction, prompted by the news frenzy of US presidential politics, influenced by my own contrarian nature. If you read history and science fiction we live in an interesting time. Whether it will be a historical turning point in US and global history is not something that we are privileged to know at the time. But if this is a historic turning point I would like to plot out a story based on where we are, not much more than a week before the US election between President Trump and former Vice-President Biden. Let’s ignore that reality strains credulity, and proceed from there. Nothing below should be read as representative of my own views or preferences.</p> Biden wins? <p>The Democrats win the House and the Senate. Joe Biden wins the popular vote but the electoral college remains unclear pending delayed counts for mail-in ballots. Election night ends with both candidates being declared the victor by different media outlets.</p> Taking it to the streets <p>On the day after the election Trump claims to be the legitimate President based on claims of a rigged election. From the White House he asks his supporters to come out to defend his victory. Activists from both sides take to the streets in every major American city. The national guard takes sides, but on different sides in different states or cities, and civic order breaks down.</p> COVID confusion <p>The electoral college convenes and declares Biden to be the winner. Trump and his staff leave the White House under political pressure. President elect Biden is then revealed to be ill with COVID, increasing uncertainty. Before the inauguration Biden dies in hospital, and Kamala Harris is sworn in as the 46th President of the United States, with Pete Buttigieg as her vice-president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are prominently on display at the inauguration even as conflict rages on the streets of America.</p> Consolidation <p>President Harris deploys the military, aided by private military contractors, to establish order on the streets. Former President Trump flees the country to Moscow, declaring a government in exile. The Harris administration declares a continuing state of military emergency with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The state of emergency delays elections until the ‘emergency is over’.</p> Epilogue <p>10 years after the start of the Harris dynasty, the United States has become the Democratic Republic of America, run by the United Democratic Party under Grand President Harris. The former Republican Party has been absorbed into the United Democratic Party. Wall Street has become a financial back-water. The US overseas military presence has been dramatically reduced because of domestic military requirements. There is an underground resistance, led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most wanted fugitive in American. Climate change is at 2.5 degrees and increasing. China has become the dominant global power, dominating the United Nation, based on its Belt and Road initiative.</p> End note <p>I hope that this will prove to be really bad speculation. The past is prologue but it is our job to create the history we want to inhabit. I wish my American friends a successful and well-run election with a successful and peaceful transition of power if the Biden-Harris ticket wins.</p>

 Filling in the&nbsp;GNAP <p>About a year ago I wrote an article <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">arguing for creating the next generation of the OAuth protocol</a>. That article, and some of the other writing around it, has been picked up recently, and so people have been asking me what’s the deal with XYZ, TxAuth, OAuth 3.0, and anything else mentioned there. As you can imagine, a lot has happened in the last year and we’re in a very different place.</p><p>The short version is that there is now a new working group in the IETF: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/about/">Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (gnap)</a>. The mailing list is still at <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/txauth/">txauth</a>, and the first WG draft is available online now as <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00</a>.</p> How Are These All&nbsp;Related? <p>OK, so there’s GNAP, but now you’re probably asking yourself what’s the difference between GNAP and XYZ, or TxAuth, or OAuth 3.0. With the alphabet soup of names, it’s certainly confusing if you haven’t been following along the story in the last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">XYZ project</a> started as a concrete proposal for how a security protocol could work post-OAuth 2.0. It was based on experience with a variety of OAuth-based and non-OAuth-based deployments, and on conversations with developers from many different backgrounds and walks. This started out as a test implementation of ideas, which was later written down into a website and even later incorporated into an IETF individual draft. The most important thing about XYZ is that it has always been implementation-driven: things almost always started with code and moved forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>This led to the project itself being called OAuth.XYZ after the website, and later just XYZ. When it came time to write the specification, this document was named after a core concept in the architecture: Transactional Authorization. The mailing list at IETF that was created for discussing this proposal was named after this draft: TxAuth. As such, the draft, project, and website were all referred to as either XYZ or TxAuth depending on who and when you&nbsp;asked.</p><p>After months of discussion and debate (because naming things is really hard), the working group settled on GNAP, and GNAP is now the official name of both the working group and the protocol the group is working on publishing.</p><p>As for OAuth 3.0? Simply put, it <a href="https://oauth.net/3/">canonically does not exist</a>. The GNAP work is being done by many members of the OAuth community, but not as part of the OAuth working group. While there may be people who refer to GNAP as OAuth 3.0, and it does represent a similar shift forward that OAuth 2.0 did, GNAP is not part of the OAuth protocol family. It’s not out of the question for the OAuth working group decides to adopt GNAP or something else in the future to create OAuth 3.0, but right now that is not on the&nbsp;table.</p> The GNAP&nbsp;Protocol <p>Not only is GNAP an official working group, but the GNAP protocol has also been <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-00.html">defined in an official working group draft document</a>. This draft represents the output of several months of concerted effort by a design team within the GNAP working group. The protocol in this document is not exactly the same as the earlier XYZ/TxAuth protocol, since it pulled from multiple sources and discussions, but there are some familiar&nbsp;pieces.</p><p>The upshot is that GNAP is now an official draft protocol.</p><p>GNAP is also not a final protocol by any stretch. If you read through the draft, you’ll notice that there are a large number of things tagged as “Editor’s Notes” and similar commentary throughout, making up a significant portion of the page count. These represent portions of the protocol or document where the design team identified some specific decisions and choices that need to be made by the working group. The goal was to present a set of initial choices along with rationale and context for&nbsp;them.</p><p>But that’s not to say that the only flexible portions are those marked in the editor’s notes. What’s important about the gnap-00 document is that it’s a starting point for the working group discussion. It gives the working group something concrete to talk about and debate instead of a blank page of unknown possibilities (and monsters). With this document in hand, the working group can and will change the protocol and how it’s presented over the specification’s lifecycle.</p> The Immediate Future <p>Now that GNAP is an active standard under development, XYZ will shift into being an open-source implementation of GNAP from here out. As of the time of publication, we are actively working to implement all of the changes that were introduced during the design team process. Other developers are gearing up to implement the gnap-00 draft as well, and it will be really interesting to try to plug these into each other to test interoperability at a first&nbsp;stage.</p><p>TxAuth and Transactional Authorization are functionally retired as names for this work, though the mailing list at IETF will remain txauth so you might still hear reference to that from time to time because of&nbsp;this.</p><p>And as stated above, OAuth 3.0 is not a real thing. Which is fine, since OAuth 2.0 isn’t going anywhere any time soon. The work on GNAP is shifting into a new phase that is really just starting. I think we’ve probably got a couple years of active work on this specification, and a few more years after that before anything we do really sees any kind of wide adoption on the internet. These things take a long time and a lot of work, and it’s my hope to see a diverse and engaged group building things&nbsp;out!</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the close of <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/transmute_closes_2m_seed_round_from_moonshots_capital_tmv_kerr_tech_investments/prweb17487962.htm">Transmute’s $2 million series seed round</a> led by Moonshots Capital, and joined by TMV, Kerr Tech Investments and several strategic angels.</p><p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> has gained momentum on our mission to be the trusted data exchange platform for global trade. As a byproduct of the pandemic, the world is collectively facing persistent supply chain disruption and unpredictability. This coupled with increasing traceability regulations is driving an urgency for importers to fortify their supply chains. COVID-19 especially has highlighted the need for preventing counterfeit goods and having certainty about your suppliers (and their suppliers).</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/"></a>Transmute Co-founders, Karyl Fowler &amp; Orie Steele @ SXSW&nbsp;2019<p>Transmute’s software is upgrading trade documentation today to give importers a competitive edge in an increasingly dynamic, global marketplace. Leveraging decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) tech with existing cloud-based systems, Transmute is able to offer digital product and supplier credentials that are traceable across an entire logistics ecosystem. From point of origin to end customer, we are unlocking unprecedented visibility into customers’ supplier networks.</p><blockquote>Disrupting a highly regulated and old-fashioned industry is complex, and an intentional first step in our go-to-market strategy has been balancing both the needs of regulators and commercial customers.</blockquote><p>This is why we’re incredibly proud to join forces with our lead investors at <a href="https://medium.com/leadership-prevails">Moonshots Capital</a>, a VC firm focused on investing in extraordinary leaders. We look forward to growing alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellyperdew/">Kelly Perdew</a> (our newest Board of Directors member) and his founding partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/unleashcraig/">Craig Cummings</a>. They’re a team of military veterans and serial entrepreneurs with extensive success selling into government agencies and enterprises.</p><p>We are equally proud to be joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-hadjipateras-64614670/">Marina Hadjipateras</a> and the team at <a href="http://www.trailmix.vc/">TMV</a>, a New York-based firm focused on funding pioneering, early-stage founders. Between their commitment to diverse teams, building sustainable futures and their deep expertise in global shipping and logistics, we feel more than ready to take on global trade with this&nbsp;firm.</p><p>The support of Kerr Tech Investments, led by Josh and Michael Kerr, further validates our company’s innovative approach to data exchange. <a href="https://joshkerr.com/">Josh</a> is a seasoned entrepreneur, an e-signature expert and has been advising us since Transmute’s inception.</p><p>Closing our seed round coincides with another exciting announcement: our recent launch of Phase II work with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Science &amp; Technology’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) to enhance “<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/08/news-release-dhs-awards-198k-raw-material-import-tracking">transparency, automation and security in processing the importation of raw materials</a>” like&nbsp;steel.</p><p>Our vision is more broad than just improving how trade gets done, and steel imports are just the beginning. We’re inserting revolutionary changes into the fabric of how enterprises manage product and supplier identity, effectively building a bridge — or a fulcrum, rather — towards new revenue streams and business models across industries.</p><p>Last — but absolutely not least — I want to give a personal shoutout to my core teammates; startups are a team sport, and our team is stacked! Tremendous congratulations as these backers will accelerate our progress in a huge way. And finally, thanks also to our stellar team of advisors who commit significant time coaching us through blind spots as we bring Transmute’s product to&nbsp;market.</p> Also, we’re&nbsp;Hiring! <p>Expanding our capacity to meet customer demand is our top nearterm priority.

 Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraud 



<p>Digital Identity in an Online WorldThe isolation of worldwide lockdowns this year have presented criminals with new opportunities for phishing, and this only adds to already existing trends in the rise of synthetic IDs, account takeover and SIM swap fraud. This panel will explore solutions which utilise digital identity to fight back against the fraudsters.</p>

<p>IIF Annual Membership Meeting – Digital Identity panel</p>



<p>In the accelerated move to a digitalized world, new technology is changing how people are identified and what we know about them, in an environment where trust has to be built differently from physical interactions. As well as presenting opportunities for efficiency and access, this also drives debate about roles, responsibilities, standards, and privacy. These issues will grow as new technologies in data, sensors, 5G connected devices, and biometrics come online with platforms of systemic scale. This session will discuss how technology and market trends are changing the costs, responsibilities, business models, and opportunities in identity and authentication, and how financial services firms can build on compliance capabilities to create new services and revenue streams.</p>



<p>Tuesday, October 13,&nbsp;from&nbsp;1:00pm London / 2:00pm Madrid / 8:00pm Singapore / 9:00pm Tokyo (55 minutes)</p>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the Python Package Index so that others can install and use your work.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

 <p>
 In this guide, I'm going to show you how can easily publish a package to the
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  
   Py
  
  thon
  
   P
  
  ackage
  
   I
  
  ndex
 </a>
 so that others can install and use your work. Once the package is available on PyPI, anyone will be able to run
 <code>
  pip install
 </code>
 to install the package on their machine. This allows people to import your code into their own modules as a library, but you can also release command-line tools via PyPI; I will show you how to do both.
</p>
<p>
 
  note
 
 : these instructions are Mac and Linux centric. I don't think they would be much different, but I don't do much development work on Windows so I don't know the nuances of that platform.
</p>
 
 The Code
 
<p>
 This first thing you need is some code to publish! I have created a minimal project that you can use as a starting point. You can find the code
 <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/python-package-boilerplate">
  here
 </a>
 . Let's take a look.
</p>
<p>
 First let's walk through the folder structure:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9 
     
   
   
     
      <code>├── README.md
├── package_boilerplate
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── importable.py
├── requirements.txt
├── scripts
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── boilerplate-cli
├── setup.py
└── version.py
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 These are all of the files inside of the python package. First, we have a directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 . This directory contains all of the code for our module. All of the files outside of this directory are metadata for the package itself and are used in the package publishing process, for installing dependencies, and stuff like that. We'll go through the other files shortly.
</p>
<p>
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 is
 <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">
  markdown
 </a>
 formatted text containing details about the package. This content is usually rendered as HTML and made visible in places like GitHub and PyPI.
</p>
<p>
 If we look inside of
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages">
  <code>
   __init__.py
  </code>
 </a>
 , we see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

def main():
        print(f"{fg('dark_orange')}{attr('bold')}You called me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 We're doing a couple of things here: &nbsp;first, we import a library called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colored/">
  colored
 </a>
 . Colored is a tool to colourize your program's terminal output. It's fun!
</p>
<p>
 So basically, this file will print some coloured text to the terminal if
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 is called. If you continue reading, you will see how we can publish this as a command-line tool through
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 !
</p>
<p>
 Next, let's look inside of
 <code>
  importable.py
 </code>
 :
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3 
     
   
   
     
      <code>from colored import fg, bg, attr

print(f"{fg('orchid')}{attr('bold')}You imported me!{attr('reset')}")
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Again, we're just print some coloured text to the terminal but this time we can import this code in an external module. The text will be printed as soon as the file is imported since the code is not contained in a function.
</p>
<p>
 Ok, so that is the logic of our program. Let's continue down the folder structure to see what else is needed to make this publishable.
</p>
<p>
 The next file is
 <a href="https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html">
  requirements.txt
 </a>
 . If you've ever written a python module that depends on other external python packages, then you may be familiar with this file. The file is used to tell
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 which versions of which modules it should install all at once if you run
 <code>
  pip install -r requirements.txt
 </code>
 . Python packages are no different; if they rely on dependencies,
 <code>
  pip
 </code>
 needs to know what to install. We'll reference this file in
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Next, we have the
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 directory. The folder name doesn't matter and isn't required, but I prefer to keep things separate and organized. Inside of this folder we have a file called
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 . Notice how we don't give the file an extension like
 <code>
  .py
 </code>
 and we used the naming convention
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 instead of
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli
 </code>
 . This is because this is the file that will be installed as a command-line program in the users
 <code>
  PATH
 </code>
 . We want the the user to be able to invoke the program by running
 <code>
  boilerplate-cli
 </code>
 and not
 <code>
  boilerplate_cli.py
 </code>
 because that is the expected convention for command-line programs.
</p>
<p>
 Inside of this file we have this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2
3
4
5 
     
   
   
     
      <code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from package_boilerplate import main

main()
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The first line is important because we have to tell the user's operating system what kind of code this it because it doesn't have a file extension. This is called a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">
  shebang
 </a>
 . Next we import the entrypoint into the program from
 <code>
  __init__.py
 </code>
 that we named
 <code>
  main
 </code>
 and we run the function.
</p>
<p>
 Calling this function kicks off our program! Right now it only prints text to the terminal, but it could be the entrypoint into a more complicated program. We will reference this file in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 section to make it available as a command-line program for the user.
</p>
<p>
 The most important part of this process is the
 <code>
  [setup.py](https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html)
 </code>
 file. This tells pip how to bundle the package and what all the settings and dependencies are.

 </code>
 needs to be installed which we will go over in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next, we get the python metadata out of the file
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 and obtain the current version number
 <code>
  VERSION
 </code>
 . This file just contains the current version number of the package you are publishing. We'll go over why it's split into its own file in the next section.
</p>
<p>
 Next,
 <code>
  long_description
 </code>
 is pulled out of the content from
 <code>
  README.md
 </code>
 . Using the content from the readme means that this description only needs to live in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Then, I've added a helper function called
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 . The python
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 format expects that
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 property contains a list of dependencies that this package relies on. Since it's burdensome to maintain a
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 file with your dependencies as well as the dependencies in a list here, this
 <code>
  parse_requirements
 </code>
 function simple imports the dependencies from
 <code>
  requirements.txt
 </code>
 so that you only need to maintain them in one place.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, we call
 <code>
  setup
 </code>
 with some values to define the package. The section that specifies
 <code>
  packages=find_packages()
 </code>
 is pointing to the directory named
 <code>
  package_boilerplate
 </code>
 and is discovered automatically by this function. Name and version are used in the PyPI directory listing and also are what people reference when they want to install the package.
 <code>
  install_requires
 </code>
 pulls in the list of requirements from the
 <code>
  requirement.txt
 </code>
 file.
 <code>
  python_requires="&gt;=3.6.3"
 </code>
 is the version of python that the user must have installed. And finally,
 <code>
  scripts
 </code>
 is where you specify the command line program that should be installed for the user.
</p>
<p>
 There are other values that you should set as well such as
 <code>
  description
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  author
 </code>
 . You can read more about the setup values available
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/distutils/setupscript.html">
  here
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The last file,
 <code>
  version.py
 </code>
 is quite small. This file is used for two things: first, it is imported in the
 <code>
  setup.py
 </code>
 module above to use as the package version; and second, the version value is stored in the
 <code>
  __version__
 </code>
 attribute.
 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0396/#specification">
  This is recommend
 </a>
 so that the package version can be discovered programatically.
</p>
<p>
 
  A tip
 
 : as you are working, you can install your package locally before you even publish it. This way, you will know that it works before submitting it to PyPI. To install the package locally, you can run
 <code>
  pip install -e .
 </code>
 in the package directory.
</p>
 
 Publishing Your Package
 
<p>
 So you've written your package and you want to publish it! We're almost there. There are just a few more steps to publish your package.
</p>
<p>
 The first thing will want to do is install a tool called
 <a href="https://pypi.org/project/twine/">
  twine
 </a>
 by running
 <code>
  pip install twine
 </code>
 . Twine is a tool for publishing Python packages on PyPI. Then, we also need to install
 <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">
  setuptools
 </a>
 since we are using it in our setup script:
 <code>
  pip install setuptools
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Now, we need to create a
 <a href="https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package">
  distribution package
 </a>
 that we will publish. To do this, run: &nbsp;
 <code>
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
 </code>
 which will create
 <code>
  build
 </code>
 and
 <code>
  dist
 </code>
 directories.
</p>
<p>
 Once the build has completed, we can check for any errors or warnings using
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 . Run
 <code>
  twine check dist/*
 </code>
 &nbsp;to check the distribution package for errors. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1
2 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Checking distribution dist/package_boilerplate-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl: Passed
Checking distribution dist/package-boilerplate-1.0.0.tar.gz: Passed
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Once this is done, we want to publish our package to the PyPI test site. We can publish to
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org">
  test.pypi.org
 </a>
 before we publish to the real index to make sure everything looks good! To do this, we can instruct
 <code>
  twine
 </code>
 to use a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
 </code>
</p>
<p>
 If we run this now, we will see the following:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>Enter your username:
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Looks like we need to create an account! So head over to the
 <a href="https://test.pypi.org/account/register/">
  registration page
 </a>
 for the PyPI test site and create an account. If you run the command again and enter your username and password hopefully you should see:
</p>

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 If you do, congratulations! You have successfully published your package!
</p>
<p>
 
  Note:
 
 make sure your package name is unique!
</p>
<p>
 All that remains is to publish your package to the official
 <a href="https://pypi.org">
  pypi.org
 </a>
 . To do this, you just need to create another account there and publish your package without specifying a different repository like so:
 <code>
  twine upload dist/*
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Installing Your Package
 
<p>
 Now that your package is installed, I bet you want to install it to see how it works! Let's install our package from the PyPI test index:
 <code>
  pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . In the future, if we don't provide the
 <code>
  --index-url
 </code>
 parameter, then we would be requesting a package from the official index. If all goes well, you should see this:
</p>

<p>
 If so, then the package is installed! So let's use it. Remember that command-line program we created? Well now we should be able to run it from anywhere by calling invoking the name of the script:
</p>

 
  
   
     
      1 
     
   
   
     
      <code>$ boilerplate-cli

 It works! And we even get the coloured text.
</p>
<p>
 Once you publish your package to the official PyPI index, you will be able to install the package by running
 <code>
  pip install package-boilerplate
 </code>
 . Of course, you would want to choose a different name for the package throughout the process and use that here.
</p>
 
<p>
 I hope this guide is helpful. If something doesn't make sense, please let me know.

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.jonudell.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

Happening in parallel, Ethereum’s decentralized financial protocols are maturing from lofty experiments, to hardened primitives. The opportunity for cross-chain collaboration is immense. As I’ve said, <a href="https://sepia.substack.com/p/on-defi-frontends">DeFi and DWeb are complementary revolutions</a>. The budding symbiosis between Handshake and Ethereum is a powerful one worth continually exploring in detail.</p><p>I’ve already touched on how Handshake namespace strengthens decentralized finance through cryptographically secure frontends. </p><blockquote><p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) movement contends to offer open and permissionless markets. But DeFi does not operate in a vacuum. In practice, frontend websites and applications remain centralized choke points to backend protocols. Decentralized finance is not truly decentralized until the whole stack is.</p><p><a href="https://sepia.substack.com/p/on-defi-frontends">On DeFi Frontends</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s now explore the flipside of this relationship — how decentralized finance enhances Handshake’s namespace economy. Decentralized exchanges unlock greater liquidity for the HNS currency. Meanwhile, smart contracts introduce openness and programmability into Handshake registrars. In both areas, efforts are underway to implement Handshake tooling on Ethereum.</p>    HNS on Ethereum <p>HNS is the currency of the Handshake blockchain. It is money for the namespace economy. And in order to scale in this role, HNS needs highly liquid markets. Liquidity begets price discovery and price discovery begets speculative investment, all of which is necessary for sustaining public blockchains.</p><p>Siloed on its own chain, the path to liquidity entails bootstrapping its own on-ramps and market makers. While Namebase is a known brand and simple interface for buying and trading HNS, all centralized exchanges suffer from the same regulatory and UX frictions; as well as the classic chicken and egg problem of also needing to grow its userbase as a new startup. Larger centralized exchanges will not even list HNS until there is sufficient liquidity to do so. Price discovery is held back by the need to roll your own exchanges.</p><p>On the other hand, Ethereum’s decentralized exchanges like Uniswap are uniquely suited to source liquidity for nascent crypto assets. Regulatory and UX burdened order books are replaced with open and incentivized liquidity pools. Ethereum assets can be traded by anyone, anywhere. Wrapped and trustless HNS are two ERC-20 implementations of Handshake. Both versions act like file formats of HNS that make the currency legible to the Ethereum network. Ethereum-legible HNS can leverage existing DeFi infrastructure to become a more liquid money. We are seeing the early stages of this as the first HNS was wrapped just this week through&nbsp;<a href="http://wrapply.io/">Wrapply</a>.</p><p>Once inside the Ethereum arena, HNS becomes a more useful asset. Earn yield on HNS by supplying it to liquidity pools. Borrow against your HNS position. Coordinate Handshake-focused DAOs around HNS treasuries. The list goes on.</p>    Namespace on Ethereum <p>The internet makes everyone a publisher. Ethereum makes everyone an investor. Now, Handshake makes everyone a name registrar as well.</p><p>For the first time, anyone can own their own top level domain and distribute subdomain space as they see fit. It is first worth considering emergent namespace patterns on Handshake. Top level domains may represent market categories, specific networks, or individual brands. Accordingly, some TLDs will open up subdomains to the public, some will allocated subdomains to users of their network, while others will reserve subdomains for themselves.</p><a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325425d2-f69a-48a5-8df3-ecb73153c919_1530x770.png"></a><p>A free market of TLDs that disrupts ICANN’s monopoly is in itself a feat of decentralization. Though, we can go further. Ethereum offers tooling that will make ‘fiat’ registrars feel antiquated in comparison. Smart contract registrars — that is, Handshake TLDs that manage subdomain markets on Ethereum — stand to be transparent, autonomous, and programmable.</p><p>The sophistication of Ethereum-based markets juxtaposed with the manual nature of simple name transfers for websites or social handles is staggering.</p><p>Consider how,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/blockchannel/on-foundation-markets-6405c30d071d">on Foundation</a>, a fraction of a tokenized t-shirt can be resold with correct profit splits distributed to the seller and creator programmatically. But I can’t even manage to contact the owner of a desired name on a top social network, let alone trust they would transfer it upon receipt of my payment.</p><p>The gap between fiat and crypto markets will only widen as the tools available to crypto-related applications make the UX increasingly more fluid and attractive for consumers.</p><p>Smart contract registrars can also trustlessly escrow payments for names. With this more secure foundation, registrars can build in added complexities. Dynamically priced registrars could sell subdomains across factors such as character length or order of name registration. Or top level domains could offer namedrops for users to claim their permanent, permissionless corner of a network.</p><p>Ethereum can not only iterate on how registrars sell subdomains, it can reshape the structure of registrars altogether.TLD ownership can be fractionalized, leaving names (and rights to subdomain renewal fees) to be owned by communities of users.&nbsp;Just as governance tokens are distributed to decentralize ownership of network backends, domain tokens can similarly be distributed to decentralize ownership of network frontends.&nbsp;<a href="http://realtydao.com/">RealtyDAO</a>&nbsp;is one project scratching the surface of what’s possible surrounding a tokenized namespace melding with the programmability of Ethereum.</p><p>We implicitly understand the value of namespace. More than mere legibility to a network, names carry a sense of social status, identity, and brand. We haven’t been able to act on this value and these ideas in meaningful ways. The interplay between Handshake and Ethereum unlocks a world of possibility.</p>    Symbiotic Protocols <p>Handshake and Ethereum are, yes, a symbiotic relationship, but more specifically a mutualistic one. Like species interactions, protocol interactions can fall into one of several symbiotic classifications — mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, or mimicry.</p><p>In&nbsp;mutualism, both species / protocols benefit. Decentralized namespace on Handshake benefits decentralized finance on Ethereum, and vice versa.</p><p>In&nbsp;commensalism, one benefits and the other is not significantly helped or harmed. Wrapped Bitcoin gains access to DeFi while Ethereum is largely unaffected.</p><p>In&nbsp;parasitism, one benefits while the other is harmed. “Ethereum-killers” accumulate liquidity (or don’t…) at the detriment of Ethereum.</p><p>In&nbsp;mimicry, one adopts distinct characteristics of the other, sometimes to provide mutual benefit and other times to exploit. ZCash and Bitcoin Cash are planned and contentious forks of Bitcoin, respectively.</p><p>I look at Handshake, Ethereum, and other public blockchains and see self-interested networks vying for survival in the cryptoverse. I may be overplaying the analogy of protocols and species. You don’t have to view liquidity as the lifeblood of cryptonetworks used to carry out their programming. Biological mental models or not, the point is we’re moving towards an interchain world. Protocol relationships are becoming increasingly intertwined. </p>

 <p>
 If you’ve ever worked on a large piece of software, I’m sure you’ve endured the pain of setting up a complex development environment. Installing and configuring a database, message broker, web server, worker processes, local smtp server, (and who knows what else!) is time consuming for every developer starting on a project. This guide will show you how to set up a docker development environment which will enable you and new developers to get up and running in minutes with even the most complex system. This will make your life much easier in the long run and get new developers up and running on the project much more quickly.
</p>
<p>
 In this guide, we’ll be using
 <a href="https://www.docker.com/community-edition">
  Docker Community Edition
 </a>
 and
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">
  Docker Compose
 </a>
 . You may want to read up on these tools a bit before proceeding.
</p>
<p>
 The code for the guide is available
 <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/docker-development-environment">

 Installing Docker
 
<p>
 Grab Docker for your operating system
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community">
  here
 </a>
 . Docker is available for all modern operating systems. For most users, this will also include Docker Compose. Once installed, keep Docker running in the background to use Docker commands!
</p>
 
 Dockerfile Example
 
<p>
 Your
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">
  Dockerfile
 </a>
 is the blueprint for your container. You’ll want to use your Dockerfile to create your desired environment. This includes installing any language runtimes you might need and installing any dependencies your project relies on. Luckily, most languages have a
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from">
  base image
 </a>
 that you can inherit. We’ll get dig into this further with the Dockerfile example below.
</p>
<p>
 Your Dockerfile doesn’t need to include any instructions for installing a database, cache server, or other tools. Each container should be built around a single process. Other processes would normally be defined in other Dockerfiles but you don’t even need to worry about that; in this example, we use 3 readymade containers for our databases and message broker.
</p>

      <code># Inherit from node base image
FROM node

# This is an alternative to mounting our source code as a volume.
# ADD . /app

# Install Yarn repository
RUN curl -sS http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | apt-key add -
RUN echo "deb http://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

# Install OS dependencies
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install yarn

# Install Node dependencies
RUN yarn install
</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 The Dockerfile above does a couple things: first, we inherit from the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/images/node">
  node
 </a>
 base image. This means that it includes the instructions from
 <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/581eebd097343c9f1c1ceb5260cd2ec770410e29/7.10/Dockerfile">
  that image’s Dockerfile
 </a>
 (including whatever base image it inherits from). Second, I install the
 <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">
  Yarn
 </a>
 package manager since I prefer it over the default NodeJs package manager. Note that while my preferred language here is NodeJs, this guide is language independent. Set up your container for whatever language runtime you prefer to work in.
</p>
<p>
 Give it a try and run
 <code>
  docker-compose build
 </code>
 and see what happens.
</p>
 
 Docker Compose Example
 
<p>
 A few sections ago, I mentioned Docker Compose which is a tool to declaratively define your container formation. This means that you can define multiple different process types which all run concurrently in different containers and communicate with one another via http. Docker makes exposing interfaces between containers easier by using what they call
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/service-links/">
  links
 </a>
 . The beauty here is that it’s as simple as working with multiple processes on single machine but you can be sure that there are no tightly coupled components that might not work in a production environment!

</code> 
     
   
  
 

<p>
 Let’s walk through this example:
</p>
<p>
 We have 7 different containers in our formation:
 
  web
 
 ,
 
  clock
 
 ,
 
  worker
 
 ,
 
  shell
 
 ,
 
  postgres
 
 ,
 
  rabbitmq
 
 , and
 
  redis
 
 . That’s a lot! In a production environment, these processes might each run on separate physical servers; or, the processes all might run on a single machine.
</p>
<p>
 Notice how the web, clock, worker, and shell containers are all built from the current directory. So each of those 4 processes all run on the container that we defined in our Dockerfile. The postgres, rabbitmq, and redis containers, on the other hand, are built from prebuilt images which are found on the
 <a href="https://store.docker.com/">
  Docker Store
 </a>
 . Building containers for these tools from images is much quicker than installing each of the tools on your local machine.
</p>
<p>
 Take a look at the
 <code>
  volumes
 </code>
 key. Here, we mounted our current directory at
 <code>
  /app
 </code>
 . Then the
 <code>
  working_dir
 </code>
 key indicates that all commands shall be run relative to this directory.
</p>
<p>
 Ok. Now, take a look at the
 <code>
  links
 </code>
 key present on the locally built containers. This exposes a network interface between this container and the containers listed. Notice how we use the name of the link as the hostname in our environment variables. In this example, we link the containers and then we expose the uri for each of our linked services as environment variables.
</p>
<p>
 Try running one of the services: run the command
 <code>
  docker-compose up web
 </code>
 .
</p>
 
 Write your application code
 
<p>
 Ok, our server architecture includes 3 process types that run your application code; we have our web process that is responsible for serving web requests and pushing work to a job queue; we have our worker process that is responsible for pulling jobs off the queue and doing the work; and we have our clock process is effectively a cron runner that pushes work onto our job queue.
</p>
<p>
 Our architecture also includes 3 other services that you commonly see in web server architecture: a Postgres database, a Redis datastore, and a RabbitMQ message broker.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s a minimal implementation of the 3 aforementioned processes that also showcase the usage of our 3 data backends:

        // Consume messages from clock queue
        var q2 = "clock";
        ch.assertQueue(q2, { durable: false });
        ch.consume(
            q2,
            msg =&gt; {
                console.info(
                    "Message received from clock process:",
                    msg.content.toString()
                );
            },
            { noAck: true }
        );
    });
});

<p>
 There are example endpoints for each of the different components of our architecture. Visiting
 <code>
  /postgres/:something
 </code>
 will insert something into the postgres database and render a view containing all of the contents. Visiting
 <code>
  /redis
 </code>
 will count the number of visits to that page and display the count. Visiting
 <code>
  /rabbit/:msg
 </code>
 will send a message to the worker process and you can check the terminal logs to see the message. The clock process will also run continuously and send a message to the worker process once every minute. Not bad for a 1 minute set up!
</p>
 
 Pull it all together with a bash script
 
<p>
 I like to write a simple script so I don’t have to memorize as many commands:
</p>
 
 manage.sh

<p>
 Done! Now, we don’t need to worry about remembering docker-compose commands. To run our entire server stack we now simply run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh start
 </code>
 . If we need to build our containers again because we changed our Dockerfile or we need to install new dependencies, we can run
 <code>
  ./manage.sh build
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Our shell container exists so that we can shell into our container or run one-off commands in the context of our container. Using the script above, you can run
 <code>
  ./manage shell
 </code>
 to start a terminal session in the container. If you want to run a single command in your container, you can use
 <code>
  ./manage run &lt;command&gt;
 </code>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If you’re familiar with the difficulty caused by complex development environments running on your local machine, then investigating a Docker powered development environment could save you time. There is a bit of set up involved but the productivity gained in the long term by using a tool like Docker pays for itself.

When decisions are guided by the values and vision of the organization, when the process is transparent, when the conflicts appear on the surface, when failure is just another chance at success, and when leadership opens up in front of those who have proven their worth: that is when institutional guilt has no purchase on the logic of your organization.

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t news, Kellyanne.</p>
<p>Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so
we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to
address the planetary crisis at our feet.</p>
<p>Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! Let’s do this thing.</p>

<p>I tried to sign up for phone banking and I just couldn’t see doing it, I don’t answer unknown calls and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to right now. I wound up with the Vote Forward letter-writing system, <a href="http://votefwd.org/?fbclid=IwAR2gJSKcIqL4prkZJPZ72oPvOxOnabufWkKxojLL0lRm2NlydSZye2ZQI_8">votefwd.org</a>, which I like for a variety of reasons. </p>



<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t this! I’ve heard that
red-tailed hawks<a>1</a> live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

			</p>
		
	

 

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>
