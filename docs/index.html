   I’ve been stuck not really reading much. Gave up on the book I was on, and bought Sue Burke’s Interference.

   I almost went to Brazil this year for the Radical Exchange conference. Instead it went virtual with 48 hours of programming. I had the pleasure of talking with Paula Berman (Democracy Earth) and Supriyo Roy (Idena). Each of us shared about different future looking identity projects/efforts we are involved in.

<p>「Identity Week Asia 2020」に出演しました。Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraudと題したパネルディスカッションのモデレータです。大変おもしろいパネルでした。そのうちビデオが公開されたらまたここでシェアさせていただきます。</p>



 Fighting Back Against Digital Identity Fraud 



<p>Digital Identity in an Online WorldThe isolation of worldwide lockdowns this year have presented criminals with new opportunities for phishing, and this only adds to already existing trends in the rise of synthetic IDs, account takeover and SIM swap fraud. This panel will explore solutions which utilise digital identity to fight back against the fraudsters.</p>

<p>The data on this site is super interesting. Whatever is running the site is not great. It’s some sort of out of the box Microsoft thing including default loading animations.</p>

<p>But! It aims to be a sort of Wikipedia. I’ve signed up to be a contributor and I hope that this can be built on and be licensed for re-use.</p>

<p>I did a search for “Vancouver” and found only one entry, so my used cookbook collection may be able to add a handful more. It does say it only wants pre-1940 cookbooks, but it’s unclear why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It provides a bird’s-eye view of long-term trends in European and American cuisines, from shifting trade routes and dining habits to culinary fads. Search “cupcakes,” for example, and you’ll find the term may have first popped up in Mrs. Putnam’s Receipt Book And Young Housekeeper’s Assistant, a guide for ladies running middle-class households in the 1850s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes! Super interesting to me. Looking forward to see how this evolves.</p>

<p>IIF Annual Membership Meeting – Digital Identity panel</p>



<p>In the accelerated move to a digitalized world, new technology is changing how people are identified and what we know about them, in an environment where trust has to be built differently from physical interactions. As well as presenting opportunities for efficiency and access, this also drives debate about roles, responsibilities, standards, and privacy. These issues will grow as new technologies in data, sensors, 5G connected devices, and biometrics come online with platforms of systemic scale. This session will discuss how technology and market trends are changing the costs, responsibilities, business models, and opportunities in identity and authentication, and how financial services firms can build on compliance capabilities to create new services and revenue streams.</p>



<p>Tuesday, October 13,&nbsp;from&nbsp;1:00pm London / 2:00pm Madrid / 8:00pm Singapore / 9:00pm Tokyo (55 minutes)</p>



  Vivienne Artz, Chief Privacy Officer, Refinitiv  Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer, Monetary Authority of Singapore  Nat Sakimura, Chairman, OpenID Foundation  Victoria Roig, Head of Transformation Office, Santander (Moderator)

Over the past few years, I've begun or contributed to a number of open source projects.&nbsp; These have mostly been centered around health technology while supporting the Unites States federal government agencies such as <a href="https://www.cms.gov/">CMS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hhs.gov/">HHS</a>, and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>.<br><br><a href="http://transparenthealth.org/">TransparentHealth.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TransparentHealth">https://github.com/TransparentHealth</a> were first created as a place to consolidate these open source projects into one place.&nbsp; Other people seemed to like the idea.&nbsp; Not only is open source software a good idea, but so is the adoption of open standards.&nbsp; We made facilitating the adoption of standards a priority as well.<br><br>To ensure the long term maintenance of these projects and goals it became increasingly apparent that software foundation was needed.<br><br><br>Hence Transparent Health was created. In April of 2018, Transparent health became a non-profit organization.&nbsp; The directors of the organization are <a href="https://twitter.com/ekivemark">Mark Scrimshire</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/aviars">myself</a>.&nbsp; Other people are helping out too. We are just getting started!<br><br>We encourage your code contribution to our current projects. We also provide a good home for select open source projects. We curate included projects based on its relevance to patient access, openness, and the maturity of the project.<br><br>There are a number of reasons why you or your organization might consider <a href="http://transparenthealth.org/#donate">contributing code</a>.<br>Here are a few of those reasons:<br><br>  You or your&nbsp; organization wants to amplify impact by making open source contributions more visible and in a shared location.  You or your organization would prefer to manage the repository outside of&nbsp; existing accounts.&nbsp; (There are a lot of situations where this makes sense, but I won't go into that here.)&nbsp;  You and your organization can still maintain and manage your repository.  Your uncertain that a useful repository will be removed from public view&nbsp; and you want to make a copy.   <br>  If you would like to discuss your project's inclusion, please send us an email.<br>  <br>  <br>  Let's all work together to improve the patient experience through sharing, openness and transparency.  <br>  <br>  Alan Viars, Director  Transparent Health <br><br>

   Ride out to our usual bench at Burnaby Lake was pretty cold. Got to get gloves and other gear sorted to keep #biking. 

 The new Rad Mini in white has slightly smaller wheels, and of course no extended rear rack.

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://i2.wp.com/blog.jonudell.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg?ssl=1"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

   I released Datasette 0.50 this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50">Datasette 0.50</a> this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.</p>
 The column actions menu 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>The key new feature in this release is the column actions menu on the table page (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/891">#891</a>). This can be used to sort a column in ascending or descending order, facet data by that column or filter the table to just rows that have a value for that column.</p></blockquote>
<p>The table page is the most important page within Datasette: it's where users interact with database tables.</p>
<p>Prior to 0.50 users could sort those tables by clicking on the column header. If they wanted to sort in descending order they had to click it, wait for the table to reload and then click it a second time.</p>
<p>In 0.50 I've introduced a new UI element which I'm calling the column actions menu. Here's an animation showing it in action on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">facetable</a> demo table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now the menu can be used to sort ascending, sort descending or add the column to the current set of select facets. If a column has any blank values on the current page a menu option to "Show not-blank rows" appears too - you can try that out on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/sortable">sortable</a> table.</p>
<p>I plan to extend this with more options in the future. I'd also like to make it a documented plugin extension point, so plugins can add their own column-specific actions. I need to figure out a JavaScript equivalent of the Python pluggy plugins mechanism first though, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983">issue 983</a>.</p>
 datasette.client 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>Plugin authors can use the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-client">datasette.client</a> object to make internal HTTP requests from their plugins, allowing them to make use of Datasette's JSON API. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/943">#943</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>In building the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin I ran into an interesting requirement. I wanted to provide efficient <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/#Keyset_pagination">keyset pagination</a> within the GraphQL schema, which is actually quite a complex things to implement.</p>
<p>Datasette already has a robust implementation of keyset pagination, but it's tangled up in the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.50/datasette/views/table.py#L742-L770">the internal TableView class</a>.</p>
<p>It's not available as a documented, stable Python API... but it IS available via the Datasette JSON API.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if Datasette plugins could make direct calls to the same externally facing, documented HTTP JSON API that Datasette itself exposes to end users?</p>
<p>That's what the new <code>datasette.client</code> object does. It's a thin wrapper around <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/async/">HTTPX AsyncClient</a> (the excellent new Python HTTP library which takes the Requests API and makes it fully asyncio compliant) which dispatches requests internally to Datasette's ASGI application, without any of the network overhead of an external HTTP request.</p>
<p>One of my goals for Datasette 1.0 is to bring the externally facing JSON API to full, documented, stable status.</p>
<p>The idea of Python plugins being able to efficiently use that same API feels really elegant to me. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of this in my own plugins.</p>

 Deploying Datasette documentation 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying">Deploying Datasette</a> documentation with guides for deploying Datasette on a Linux server <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-systemd">using systemd</a> or to hosting providers <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-buildpacks">that support buildpacks</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">#514</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/997">#997</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The buildpack documenation was inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/digitalocean_datasette-on-digitalocean-app-platform.md">my experiments</a> with the new <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/">DigitialOcean App Platform</a> this week. App Platform is a Heroku-style PaaS hosting platform that implements the <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> standard which emerged based on Heroku's architecture a few years ago.</p>

<p>I hadn't realized quite how easy it is to run a custom Python application (such as Datasette) using buildpacks - it's literally just a GitHub repository with two single-line files in it, requirements.txt and Procfile - the buildpacks mechanism detects the requirements.txt and configures a Python environment automatically.</p>

<p>I deployed my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo">simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo</a> repo on DigitalOcean, Heroku and <a href="https://scalingo.com/">Scalingo</a> to try this out. It worked on all three providers with no changes - and all three offer continuous deployment against GitHub where any changes to that repository automatically trigger a deployment (optionally guarded by a CI test suite).</p>

<p>Since I was creating a deployment documenatation page I decided to finally address <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">issue 514</a> and document how I've used systemd to deploy Datasette on some of my own projects. I'm very keen to hear from people who try out this recipe so I can continue to improve it over time.</p>
<p>This is part of a series: see also the annotated release notes for Datasette <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">0.44</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">0.45</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/">0.49</a>.</p>

  <p>Git scraping is the name I've given a scraping technique that I've been experimenting with for a few years now. It's really effective, and more people should use it.</p>
<p>The internet is full of interesting data that changes over time. These changes can sometimes be more interesting than the underlying static data - The <a href="https://twitter.com/nyt_diff">@nyt_diff Twitter account</a> tracks changes made to New York Times headlines for example, which offers a fascinating insight into that publication's editorial process.</p>
<p>We already have a great tool for efficiently tracking changes to text over time: Git. And <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> (and other CI systems) make it easy to create a scraper that runs every few minutes, records the current state of a resource and records changes to that resource over time in the commit history.</p>
<p>Here's a recent example. Fires continue to rage in California, and the <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE website</a> offers an <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">incident map</a> showing the latest fire activity around the state.</p>
<p>Firing up the Firefox Network pane, filtering to requests triggered by XHR and sorting by size, largest first reveals this endpoint:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents">https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents</a></p>
<p>That's a 241KB JSON endpoints with full details of the various fires around the state.</p>
<p>So... I started running a git scraper against it. My scraper lives in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">simonw/ca-fires-history</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Every 20 minutes it grabs the latest copy of that JSON endpoint, pretty-prints it (for diff readability) using <code>jq</code> and commits it back to the repo if it has changed.</p>
<p>This means I now have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commits/main">commit log</a> of changes to that information about fires in California. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commit/7b0f42d4bf198885ab2b41a22a8da47157572d18">example commit</a> showing that last night the Zogg Fires percentage contained increased from 90% to 92%, the number of personnel involved dropped from 968 to 798 and the number of engines responding dropped from 82 to 59.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the scraper is entirely contained in a single GitHub Actions workflow. It's in a file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">.github/workflows/scrape.yml</a> which looks like this:</p>
  name: Scrape latest data

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '6,26,46 * * * *'

jobs:
  scheduled:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out this repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Fetch latest data
      run: |-
        curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents | jq . &gt; incidents.json
    - name: Commit and push if it changed
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git push  
<p>That's not a lot of code!</p>
<p>It runs on a schedule at 6, 26 and 46 minutes past the hour - I like to offset my cron times like this since I assume that the majority of crons run exactly on the hour, so running not-on-the-hour feels polite.</p>
<p>The scraper itself works by fetching the JSON using <code>curl</code>, piping it through <code>jq .</code> to pretty-print it and saving the result to <code>incidents.json</code>.</p>
<p>The "commit and push if it changed" block uses a pattern that commits and pushes only if the file has changed. I wrote about this pattern in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/github-actions_commit-if-file-changed.md">this TIL</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of repositories running git scrapers now. I've been labeling them with the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping topic</a> so they show up in one place on GitHub (other people have started using that topic as well).</p>
<p>I've written about some of these <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gitscraping/">in the past</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Sep/10/scraping-irma/">Scraping hurricane Irma</a> back in September 2017 is when I first came up with the idea to use a Git repository in this way. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/10/fires-in-the-north-bay/">Changelogs to help understand the fires in the North Bay</a> from October 2017 describes an early attempt at scraping fire-related information. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/">Generating a commit log for San Francisco’s official list of trees</a> remains my favourite application of this technique. The City of San Francisco maintains a frequently updated CSV file of 190,000 trees in the city, and I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history/find/master">a commit log</a> of changes to it stretching back over more than a year. This example uses my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff">csv-diff</a> utility to generate human-readable commit messages. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/">Tracking PG&amp;E outages by scraping to a git repo</a> documents my attempts to track the impact of PG&amp;E's outages last year by scraping their outage map. I used the GitPython library to turn the values recorded in the commit history into a database that let me run visualizations of changes over time. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jan/21/github-actions-cloud-run/">Tracking FARA by deploying a data API using GitHub Actions and Cloud Run</a> shows how I track new registrations for the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in a repository and deploy the latest version of the data using Datasette. 
 
<p>I hope that by giving this technique a name I can encourage more people to add it to their toolbox. It's an extremely effective way of turning all sorts of interesting data sources into a changelog over time.</p>

<p></p><p>In California, anyone can put an initiative on the ballot that amends the state constitution, proposes a bond measure, or even changes legislation - as long as you <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/how-qualify-initiative">acquire the minimum number of signatures of support</a>. As a result, there are always an eclectic set of propositions on every California statewide ballot. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_2020_ballot_propositions">This year, there are twelve</a>.</p><p>Particularly because there are a few ballot initiatives this year that touch on my areas of expertise, I thought it might be useful to discuss how I'm thinking about each one in public. This is one progressive technologist's voter guide; if you have alternative opinions, I'd love to hear them.</p> Proposition 14 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote authorizes $5.5 billion in bonds earmarked for stem cell research in the state, extending previous funding that was created by an initiative in 2004.</p><p>Critics say that the original initiative was created when there was a ban on federal stem cell research, and this has now outlived its usefulness. I disagree. The existing funding was mostly used across UC campuses, including UCSF, and has funded ground-breaking research and treatments, including for spina bifida and Parkinson's disease.</p><p>UCSF is one of the most important medical research institutions in the world, and I believe we should continue to allow this funding.</p> Proposition 15 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote increases funding for schools, public colleges, and local government services by increasing taxes on certain kinds of commercial and industrial property. The taxes are limited in scope and will mostly be paid by large, wealthy corporations, while providing tax exemptions for small businesses. This seems like a broadly positive amendment.</p> Proposition 16 - Yes <p>In 1996, affirmative action when hiring for public employment, public education, and public contracting was banned through another state proposition. This ballot initiative repeals that rule and allows diversity to be considered in the hiring process.</p><p>If this proposition passes, the state will be clear to start enacting affirmative action and diversity-based hiring initiatives, helping to make public positions more representative of the population.</p> Proposition 17 - Yes <p>Currently, people on parole for felony convictions don't have the right to vote. This constitutional amendment would give them that ability by restoring the right to vote once their prison term has been completed.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States">Felony disenfranchisement</a> is one of the most shameful aspects of criminal justice in the United States, which disproportionately affects marginalized people. The right to vote is a crucial part of any democracy. 19 other states return this right once a prison sentence is completed; we should do the same.</p> Proposition 18 - Yes <p>If you're going to be 18 at the time of an election, and therefore can vote in it, but you're only 17 at the time of the primary, this amendment would let you vote in the primary.</p><p>Without this amendment, 18 year olds effectively only get to participate in half of the election. I'm in favor.</p> Proposition 19 - No <p>This amendment would allow residents over 55, with disabilities, or who had to flee natural disasters to transfer their property tax assessments to more expensive properties three times. It also prevents these beneficial tax assessments from being carried over to inherited properties (either from parents or grandparents) when the inheritor doesn't use it as their primary residence.</p><p>On one hand, I'm in favor of closing the inheritance loophole, which disproportionately benefits wealthy families. I also want to help the over 55s, people with disabilities, and victims of natural disasters.</p><p>On the other, it's sponsored by realtor associations. For them, it's a cash windfall. It has the side effect of persisting existing inequalities. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-17/vote-no-on-proposition-19">As the Los Angeles Times editorial board says</a>: "Proposition 19 would just expand the inequities in California’s property tax system. It would grossly benefit those who were lucky enough to buy a home years ago and hold onto it as values skyrocketed. It would give them a huge tax break and greater buying power in an already expensive real estate market. It would skew tax breaks further away from people who don’t own a home or who may be struggling to buy one."</p><p>On balance, I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 20 - No <p>This state statute adds crimes to the list for which early parole is restricted - and removes the incentive to join rehabilitation programs, which is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. My vote is a hard "no".</p> Proposition 21 - Yes <p>This would allow local government to impose rent control on buildings that were first occupied 15 years ago, except when it's owned by a landlord that owns no more than two buildings in total. In other words, small, independent landlords are not affected; large private sector builders are.</p><p>Contrary to a recently-popular narrative, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/rent-control-housing-crisis-affordability-supply">rent control works</a>. It doesn't constrain housing supply and it helps keep rents low, allowing a significant percentage of families to remain in their homes where it is enacted. It protects lower-income people. And it makes our cities more diverse.</p> Proposition 22 - No <p>Uber has spent $50 million to promote this statute; Lyft has spent $48 million; DoorDash $47 million; Instacart $27 million; Postmates $10 million. Allowing their gig workers to be classified as private contractors protects their businesses.</p><p>That's because their businesses heavily depend on paying gig workers poverty pay with no benefits.</p><p>Labor rights were hard-won. At a time when more people are struggling, it's absurd to allow this kind of backslide. In addition to removing protections that these workers are entitled to by law, proposition 22 would also remove their right to organize.</p><p>If a business can only succeed because it treats people badly, it's a bad business. Hard pass.</p> Proposition 23 - No <p>If this statute passes, dialysis clinics will need to have an attending physician or nurse practitioner. They will also need to report information about infections, and won't be able to turn people away based on type of insurance.</p><p>I care deeply about the state of dialysis centers. Three times a week, my mother spends half her day in one. She reports that the staff want to unionize, but are afraid to. They're underpaid and overworked. One of her dialysis technicians lives in a tent.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>I heavily support unionization of dialysis centers. I would support a statute that mandated reporting of infection data. I support not being able to turn people away because of insurance. But I can't back the physician requirement. Despite sounding good, it wouldn't actually result in a meaningful increase to the quality of care.</p><p>Worse than that, it appears to be a tactic by the healthcare workers' union to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Vote-no-on-Prop-23-a-rehash-of-ugly-15544239.php">blackmail dialysis companies into accepting unionization</a>. Unionization is important and could really help these workers! But using the state initiative system as a pressure tactic is an unfortunate tactic. I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 24 - No <p>Privacy is core to a free society. We have accidentally built a global surveillance apparatus as part of building business models that depend on building detailed profiles on each one of us. In the wake of Europe's GDPR, which forced tech companies worldwide to change their practices, California passed the CCPA. It's a great step forward that will be joined by other state laws, and ultimately form the basis of federal protections.</p><p>In contrast, this statute is fundamentally disingenuous. In the guise of increasing protections, it actually makes exemptions and cuts out requirements for companies like Facebook. <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/08/personal-information-measure-on-the-ballot-would-allow-redlining-and-hurt-small-businesses-of-color/">It creates a loophole for credit agencies.</a> It allows for digital redlining, allowing credit agencies and assessors to penalize people of color. And it allows privacy to be demoted to an add-on paid-for service tier, rather than a core right that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>For me, perhaps the most important changes are jurisdictional. Currently, the CCPA applies to any Californian resident, wherever they happen to be. Proposition 24 erodes this protection and allows privacy to be violated as soon as the resident physically leaves the state. It also removes the ability for you to tell your web browser to let every site know not to sell your data; under Prop 24, you would need to manually let every site know.</p><p>I can't endorse it or vote for it.</p> Proposition 25 - No <p>Cash bail is discriminatory. American judges are <a href="https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/08/17/the_bail_system_is_racist_and_unjust_it_needs_to_be_reformed_110764.html">set higher bail amounts for Black individuals</a>, despite their being more likely to come from lower-income backgrounds, meaning they are far more likely to serve pretrial time. Cash bail must go.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's just one symptom of a system that is, in itself, discriminatory. It's not enough to remove cash bail; we also have to make sure it's replaced by a system that also removes the underlying systemic discrimination. The cash requirement is a problem, but our racist criminal justice system is the underlying tragedy.</p><p>For people who don't understand it, software can seem like a magically unbiased system. It's a computer, after all, which doesn't hold its own opinions. How can it possibly be biased?</p><p>Of course, software is written by people, and is a reflection of their biases, beliefs, and blind spots. Additionally, machine learning as popularly implemented is an algorithm that depends on an enormous corpus of information about choices that humans have made in the past. The machine simply extrapolates and makes new decisions based on those choices. It's as biased as the data is - and if that data comes from our criminal justice system, it's very biased indeed.</p><p>So replacing cash bail with a predictive algorithm isn't just a bad idea - it's a spectacularly harmful one that entrenches racist biases in a way that makes them beyond reproach.</p><p>Software must never make judicial decisions. The truth is, it can't: the decisions are instead made with impunity by the people who write it, often unscrutinized, and by the people who are responsible for the underlying data.</p><p>Proposition 25 must not be allowed to pass, and all measures and legislation like it must be soundly defeated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tiffanytertipes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Tiffany Tertipes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/vote?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

   Are we stuck with Surveillance Capitalism?
I hope not. 
 But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and

  <p>Are we stuck with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>?
I hope not.</p>
<p>But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and
help rather than hurt our mental health?</p>
<p>Here are three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenarios</a> how we could get
out.</p>
 Scenario 1: Regulation Bites 
<p>Building on the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
and buoyed by a growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sovereignty">data sovereignty movement</a>
supported by the political right and left, the European Union intensifies regulating
cyberspace, and in short order:</p>
 
 disallows all businesses to move any personal information pertaining to its residents
to data centers outside of the European Union; 
 broadly disallows user tracking except for very narrow circumstances; in particular,
cross-site and cross-app user tracking becomes prohibited; advertising networks cannot
target audiences smaller than 100,000 members any more; 
 requires all social and communications apps to implement full data portability
(including loss-less transmission to a new provider) similar to phone number portability. 
 
<p>The dominant, American social networking giants focus their efforts in the courts to roll
back these regulations, but in the meantime, nimble European upstarts simply copy the feature
sets of the dominant platforms and implement them consistent with European regulations.
Local politicians mention these apps at every opportunity.</p>
<p>By marketing their products through schools, privacy-conscious German parents switch over
an entire new generation of users to the European apps, and when e-government initiatives
enable citizens to much more easily and securely interact with governments through the new apps,
the network effect starts hurting instead of favoring the American surveillance platforms.</p>
<p>As integration has become easy, a European startup figures out how to game-ify fact checking on this
new open platform, and on-line misinformation drops rapidly. This increases user engagement
and user confidence, and few people ever want to go back to the old apps.</p>
<p>Other countries outside the EU concerned about data sovereignty have been watching
carefully and quickly follow the European model, through regulation and targeted industrial
policy. Facebook and friends are playing catch-up and are forced to play by the new rules
to keep at least some of their user base in those countries.</p>
<p>And when they started to market their apps internationally, even large swathes of the
American population moved over, because they don’t want to be surveilled either.</p>
 Scenario 2: A Global Disinvestment Campaign Leads to a Vibrant Good Technology Market 
<p>With the slogan “Facebook is just as bad as burning oil”, digital rights activists
have partnered with veterans of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment#Divestment_for_social_goals">divestiture campaigns</a>
against South African apartheid, tobacco and fossil fuels for an international
public relations campaign targeting investment and retirement funds that invest in
companies monetizing surveillance.</p>
<p>Being reminded of the impact of previous disinvestment campaigns and sensing a business
opportunity, fund managers globally are rapidly rolling out new niche funds that promise
to only invest in companies that use personal data responsibly. Their initial target markets
are minorities and parents saving for retirement who are concerned about their kids’ safety
when using technology.</p>
<p>Upstart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VCs</a> jump on the opportunity that
this new, focused capital represents and funnel it via special-purpose “Good Tech Only” venture
funds to eager entrepreneurs world-wide to build next-generation social networking,
commerce and virtual/augmented reality companies, without fear that VCs will pressure them
to monetize customer data anyway when the company hits a difficult patch.</p>
<p>Having made a clean break from the surveillance business model, these upstarts are able
to innovate rapidly both on business model and technology. For example, enabled by new
business models, interoperability with other vendors has now become a value driver rather
than a leak in the enterprise’ <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp">moat</a>.
This completely changes the dynamics of the marketplace.</p>
<p>As a result, entirely new product categories no longer prevented by vendors’ data hoarding
strategies explode on the scene, including, for example, much better targeted advertising
because users can volunteer personal data without fear of privacy violations, proactive
maintenance of consumer products by an army of service providers no longer inhibited by
hermetically sealed
<a href="https://upon2020.com/blog/2015/03/lets-create-the-internet-of-our-own-things-indieiot/">cloud castle</a>
products, and far more reuse and upcycle of previously discarded products.</p>
<p>As the Good Tech brand rises, and unprecedented features become available, more and more
technology users are willing to make a clean break with surveillance legacy platforms,
and shame their friends to move from the legacy social networks into moving to Good Tech as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the legacy vendors practicing surveillance capital face shrinking users bases,
less access to capital, and structurally cannot compete with the new generation of
Good Tech companies.</p>
 Scenario 3: Frustrated Users and Open-Source Developers Start Cooperating for Mutual Benefit 
<p>It started small, with a few technically-competent digital rights activists pooling
their expertise and a little bit of money to operate their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> server, so they could stay
in touch just like on Twitter, but without an unaccountable third party in the loop.
(Note: this, of course, already <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">has happened</a>; there are many
Mastodon deployments like this all around the world, some of which have already progressed
further along the lines outlined below.)</p>
<p>As interest and user numbers grew, the previously informal collaborations started to be
formalized: users not contributing their labor would pay a monthly fee, from which systems
administrators would be paid to keep the deployment up and running reliably. Over time,
the initial collaborative decision making process for the project
morphed into a formal cooperative governance structure in which all stakeholders –
users and maintainers – have equal rights. They decided on all matters affecting the
project democratically, although different cooperatives employ different styles of
governance including direct, liquid and representative democracy.</p>
<p>Soon users started to ask for additional tools provided to them in a similar manner,
like document sharing, calendaring, e-mail, and more. Accountants would ask: “Microsoft
charges me $6.99 per month to access Excel. If I pay the same amount to the coop, can’t
we host something like Excel ourselves, and I can be certain that my clients’ financials
stay private instead of whatever Microsoft does?” Some other users in the coop declared
that they had similar needs, and banded together, money in hand, to fund a project.
Which attracted open-source software developers who committed to porting open-source
collaborative document editing software into the cooperative’s environment and keep it
maintained for a monthly fee paid for by its users.</p>
<p>Of course, the apps operated by the various cooperatives always interoperated, because that’s
what users want and no vendor subject to the coop’s rules has the opportunity (or desire)
to lock in anybody. So leaving one cooperative to join another became as simple as moving
banks today, with no money or data lost in the process.</p>
<p>Some projects didn’t work out. Some money was wasted. Some coops imploded. Some users left
because initially, the quality of the coops’ products was below the quality of social
networking products of today’s dominant internet platforms funded by billions of Wall Street
dollars. However, because the cooperative structure
relates the needs and wants of the users directly to the revenue opportunity of the vendors,
with no independent shareholders to satisfy, ultimately the match between needs and
features became much better than in pure capitalistic for-profit models, creating legions
of fanatically happy users and profitable vendors completely outside the need or desire
for surveillance capitalism.</p>
 Some final thoughts 
<p>Of course, there are other scenarios; elements of these scenarios could be combined in
different ways or shake out differently, and predictions are hard, particularly about
the future :-)</p>
<p>But there are people working on each of those scenarios today (myself included!), and it
is not obvious to me that those projects are doomed. In other words, they have promise!
How can we help them be more likely to succeed? Because I want out from surveillance
capitalism, and chances are, you do, too!</p>

  <p>Summary: The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>



	<a></a>

<p>
    Introductory note: I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>, that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a used model for thinking about identity online.
</p>

<p>
    John Locke was an English philosopher who thought a lot about power: who had it, how it was used, and how it impacted the structure of society. Locke’s theory of mind forms the foundation for our modern ideas about identity and independence. Locke argued that "sovereign and independent" was man’s natural state and that we gave up freedom, our sovereignty,  in exchange for something else, protection, sociality, and commerce, among others. This grand bargain forms the basis for any society. 
</p>

<p>
    This question of power and authority is vital in identity systems. We can ask "what do we give up and to whom in a given identity system?" More succinctly we ask: who controls what? In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> I made the argument that self-sovereign identity, supporting heterarchical (peer-to-peer) interaction, enables rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents. I argued that the architecture of SSI, its structure, made those relationships more authentic.
</p>

<p>
    In this post, I intend to explore the details of that architecture so we can better understand the legitimacy of SSI as an identity system for online interaction. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)">defines legitimacy</a> as 
</p>
<blockquote>the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.</blockquote>
<p>
    While the idea of legitimacy is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that function in an authoritative manner and have large impacts on people and society.  Without legitimacy, people and organizations using an identity system will be unable to act because anyone they interact with will not see that action as authorized. My thesis is that SSI provides a more legitimate basis for online identity than administrative identity systems of the past. 
</p>


 Terminology 
<p>
    While we properly talk of identity systems, identity systems do not manage identities, but rather relationships. Identity systems provide the means necessary for remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered. Identifiers are unique within some namespace. The namespace gives context to the identifiers since the same string of characters might be a phone number in one system and a product ID in another. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller who by virtue of knowing the authentication factors can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claiming it by logging in). The controller might be a person, organization, or software system. The controller might be the subject that the identifier refers to, but not necessarily. The authentication factors might be a password, key fob, cryptographic keys, or something else. The strength and nature of the bindings between the controller, authentication factors, and identifier determine the strength and nature of the relationships built on top of them. 
</p>

<p>
    To understand why that's so, we introduce the concept of a root of trust1. A root of trust is a foundational component or process in the identity system that is relied on by other components of the system and whose failure would compromise the integrity of the bindings. A root of trust might be primary or secondary depending on whether or not it is replaceable. Primary roots of trust are irreplaceable. Together, the roots of trust form the trust basis for the system.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis enabled by the identity system underlies a particular trust domain. The trust domain is the set of digital activities that depend on the binding of the controller to the identifier. For example, binding a customer to an identifier allows Amazon to trust that the actions linked to the identifier are authorized by the controller. Another way to look at this is that the strength of the binding between the identifier and customer (controller) determines the risk that Amazon assumes in honoring those actions.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of the controller-identifier binding depends on the strength of the binding between the controller and the authentication factors and between the authentication factors and the identifier. Attacking either of those bindings reduces the trust we have in the controller-identifier binding and increases the risk that actions taken through a particular identifier are unauthorized.
</p>


 Identity Architectures 

<p>
    We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust: 
</p>
 
     Administrative
     
     Algorithmic
     
     Autonomic
     
 

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic are SSI systems. They are distinguished by their trust bases. Some SSI systems use one or the other and some (like Sovrin) are hybrid, employing each for different purposes. We'll discuss the properties of the trust basis for each of these in an effort to understand the comparative legitimacy of SSI solutions to traditional administrative ones. 
</p>

<p>
    These systems differ in who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. We call this control authority. The entity with control authority takes action through operations that affect the creation (inception), updating, rotation, revocation, deletion, and delegation of the authentication factors and their relation to the identifier. How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system. 
</p>


 Administrative Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an administrative architecture rely on an administrator to bind the the identifier to the authentication factors. The administrator is the primary root of trust for any domain with an administrative architecture. Almost every identity system in use today has an administrative architecture and their trust basis is founded on the administrator.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: The trust basis in administrative identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the interactions between the controller, identifier and authentication factors in an administrative identity system, the role of the administrator, and the impact these have on the strength of the bindings. The controller usually generates the authentication factors by choosing a password, linking a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism, or generating keys.
</p>

<p>
    Even though the identifier might be the controller's email address, phone number, public key, or other ID, the administrator "assigns" the identifier to the controller because it is their policy that determines which identifiers are allowed, whether they can be updated, and their legitimacy within the identity system's domain. The administrator "owns" the identifier within the domain. The administrator also asserts the binding between the identifier and the authentication factors. An employee's mistake, a policy change, or a hack could affect the binding between the identifier and authentication factors or the identifier and the controller. Consequently these bindings are relatively weak. Only the binding between the controller and authentication factors is strong because the controller generates them.
</p>

<p>
    The administrator's primary duty is to authoritatively assert the controller-identifier binding. Authoritative control statements about the identifier are recorded in the administrator's database, the source of truth in the system, subject to change by employees and hackers. The administrator might be an ecommerce site that maintains an identity system as the basis for its customer's account. In this case the binding is private, and its integrity is of interest only to the web site and the customer. Alternatively, the administrator might provide federated login services. In this case the administrator is asserting the controller-identifier binding in a semi-public manner to anyone who relies on the federated login. A certificate authority is an example of an administrator who publicly asserts the controller-identifier binding, signing a certificate to that effect.
</p>

<p>
    Because the administrator is responsible for binding the identifier to both the authentication factors and the controller, the  administrator is the primary root of trust and thus the basis for trust in the overall system. Regardless of whether the binding is private, semi-public, or public, the integrity of the binding is entirely dependent on the administrator and the strength of their infrastructure, policies, employees, and continued existence. The failure of any of those can jeopardize the binding, rendering the identity system unusable by those who rely on it.
</p>

 Algorithmic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems that rely on a ledger have an algorithmic architecture. I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others. Of course, it's not just algorithms. Algorithms are embodied in code, written by people, running on servers. How the code is written, its availability to scrutiny, and the means by which it is executed all impact the trust basis for the system. "Algorithmic" is just shorthand for all of this. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: The trust basis in algorithmic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 3 shows how the controller, authentication factors, identifier, and ledger are bound in an identity system with an algorithmic architecture. As in the administrative identity system, the controller generates the authentication factors, albeit in the form of a public-private key pair. The controller keeps and does not share the private key. The public key, on the other hand, is used to derive an identifier (at least in well-designed SSI systems) and both are registered on the ledger. This registration is the inception of the controller-identifier binding since the controller can use the private key to assert her control over the identifier as registered on the ledger. Anyone with access to the ledger can determine algorithmically that the controller-identifier binding is valid.
</p>

<p>
    The controller makes authoritative control statements about the identifier. The events marking these operations are recorded on the ledger which becomes the source of truth for anyone interested in the binding between the identifier and authentication factors.
</p>

<p>
    In an identity system with an algorithmic trust basis, computer algorithms create a ledger that records the key events. The point of the ledger is that no party has the power to unilaterally decide whether these records are made, modified, or deleted and how they're ordered. Instead, the system relies on code executed in a decentralized manner to make these decisions. The nature of the algorithm, the manner in which the code is written, and the methods and rules for its execution all impact the integrity of the algorithmic identity system and consequently any bindings that it records.
</p>


 Autonomic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an autonomic architecture function similarly to those with an algorithmic architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the controller generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with anyone.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 4: Trust basis in autonomic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The controller uses her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log2. One of the important realizations that make autonomic identity systems possible is that the key event log must only be ordered in the context of a single identifier, not globally. So, a ledger is not needed for recording operations on identifiers that are not public. The key event log can be shared with and verified by anyone who cares to see it.
</p>

<p>
    The controller also uses the private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means of cryptographically responding to challenges to prove her control of the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for the controller to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier. Thus anyone (any entity) can create and establish control over an identifier namespace in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority. 
</p>

<p>
    Autonomic identifiers have a number of advantages: 
</p>
 
     Self-Certification—autonomic identifiers are self-certifying so there is no reliance on a third party.
     
     Self-Administration—autonomic identifiers can be idependently administered by the controller.  
      Cost—autonomic identifiers are virtually free to create and manage. 
     
     Security—because the keys are decentralized, there is no trove of secrets that can be stolen. 
     
     Regulatory—since autonomic identifiers need not be publicly shared or stored in an organization’s database, regulatory concern over personal data can be reduced.
     
     Scale—autonomic identifiers scale with the combined computing capacity of all participants, not some central system. 
     
     Independent—autonomic identifiers are not dependent on any specific technology or even being online. 
     
 

 Algorithmic and Autonomic Identity In Practice 

<p>
    We are all familiar with administrative identity systems. We use them all the time. Less familiar are algorithmic and autonomic identity systems. Their use is emerging under the title of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There are several parallel development efforts supporting algorithmic and autonomic identifiers. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier specification</a> is the primary guide to algorithmic identifiers that live on a ledger. The DID specification provides for many DID methods that allow DIDs to live on a variety of data stores. There's nothing in the DID specification itself that requires that the data store be a blockchain or ledger, but that is the primary use case.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">written about the details of decentralized identifiers</a> before. DIDs have a number of important properties that make them ideal as algorithmic identifiers. Specifically, they are non-reassignable, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized.
</p>

<p>
    As algorithmic identifiers, DIDs allow the controller to cryptographically make authoritative statements about the identifier and the keys it is bound to. Those statements are recorded on a ledger or blockchain to provide a record of the key events that anyone with access to the ledger can evaluate. The record is usually public since the purpose of putting them on a ledger is to allow parties who don't have an existing relationship to evaluate the identifier and its linkage to the controller and public keys. 
</p>

<p>
    There are two related efforts for autonomic identifiers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> is a general-purpose self-certifying system for autonomic identifiers. KERI identifiers are strongly bound at inception to a public-private key pair. All operations on the identifier are recorded in a cryptographic key event log. KERI has strong security and accountability properties. Drummond Reed has made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_564J1B3LfBHc_FQnO8jUMiYEx084LVUsHsY1mYPa6U/edit#slide=id.g9398465ffb_33_0">proposal that would allow KERI autonomic identifiers to be used with any DID method</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The second option is <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">Peer DIDs</a>. The vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things need not be public and thus have no need for the ability to publicly resolve the DID. Peer DIDs fill this need with the benefits of autonomic identifiers listed above. 
</p>

<p>
    Like KERI, Peer DIDs maintain a key event log (called "deltas") that records the relevant operations on the keys in a cryptographic manner. The Peer DID key event log can be shared with other parties in the relationship over <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a>, a protocol that allows parties to a relationship to securely and privately share authenticated messages. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">security and authority of a DIDComm channel</a> are rooted in DIDs and their associated authentication factors. DIDComm can be used over a wide variety of transports.
</p>

<p>
    The vast majority of digital relationships are peer to peer and should use autonomic identifiers. Algorithmic identifiers allow for public discovery of identifier properties when relationships are not peer to peer. In the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>3, the ledger records public DIDs for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential</a> issuers. But people, organizations, and things form relationships using peer DIDs without need for the ledger. This hybrid use of both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems was designed so that credential exchange would be practical, secure, and private while reducing the correlation that might occur if individuals used a few DIDs on a ledger.
</p>


 Comparing Identity Architectures 
<p>
    Table 1 summarizes the architectural properties of identity systems with administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic bases of trust. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Table 1: Architectural properties of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The table shows how the locus of control, source of truth, root of trust, and trust basis differ for each of our three architectures. For Administrative systems, the administrator is directly in control of all four of these. In an algorithmic architecture, the controller is the locus of control because the ledger is set up to allow the controller to be in charge of all key operations. Sometimes this is done using special administrative keys instead of the keys associated with the identifier. The organizations or people operating nodes on the ledger <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">never have access to the keys necessary to unilaterally change the record of operations</a>. No third party is involved in autonomic identity systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Table 2 summarizes the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems4.
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Table 2: Summarizing the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We can see from the evaluation that algorithmic and autonomic architectures are decentralized while the administrative system has a single point of failure—the third party administrator. As a result administrative systems are less secure since an attack on one party can yield a trove of valuable information. Administrative systems also rely on privacy by policy rather than having privacy preserving features built into the architecture. And, as we've seen, all too often privacy is in direct conflict with the administrator's profit motive leading to weak privacy policies. 
</p>

 Power and Legitimacy 

<p>
    I started this post by talking about power and legitimacy. From our discussion and the summary tables above, we know that power is held very differently in these three systems. In an administrative system, the administrator holds all the power. I argued in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> that the architecture of our identity systems directly impacts the quality and utility of the digital relationships they support. Specifically, the power imbalance inherent in administrative identity systems yields anemic relationships. In contrast, the balance of power engendered by SSI systems (both algorithmic and autonomic) yields richer relationships since all parties can contribute to it.  
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, administrative identity systems have legitimacy—if they didn't, no one would use or trust them.  As new architectures, algorithmic and autonomic systems have yet to prove themselves through usage. But we can evaluate each architecture in terms of the promises it makes and how well it does in the purposes of an identity system: recognizing, remembering, and relying on other parties in the relationship. These are largely a function of the trust basis for the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems promise an account for taking actions that the administrator allows. They also promise these accounts will be secure and private. But people and organizations are increasingly concerned with privacy and seemingly non-stop security breaches are chipping away at that legitimacy. As noted above, the privacy promise is often quite limited. Since the administrator is the basis for trust, administrative systems allow the administrator to recognize, remember, and rely on the identifier depending on their security. But the account holder does not get any support from the administrative system in recognizing, remembering, or relying on the administrator. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship is strictly one-way and anemic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    SSI systems promise to give anyone the means to securely and privately create online relationships and trustworthily share self-asserted and third-party-attested attributes with whoever they chose. These promises are embodied in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">property I call fidelity</a>. To the extent that algorithmic and autonomic identity systems deliver on these promises, they will be seen as legitimate. 
</p>

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems provide strong means for recognizing, remembering, and relying on the identifiers in the relationship. For an algorithmic system, we must trust the ledger as the primary root of trust and the trust basis. Clearly our trust in the ledger will depend on many factors, including the code and the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">governance that controls its operation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis for an autonomic identity system is cryptography. This implies that digital key management will become an important factor in its legitimacy. If people and organizations cannot easily manage the keys in such a system, then it will not be trusted. There is hope that key management can be solved since the primary artifacts that people using an SSI system manipulate are relationships and credentials, not keys and secrets. By supporting a consistent user experience rooted in familiar artifacts from the physical world, SSI promises to make cryptography a usable technology by the majority of people on the Internet.
</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>
    In this article, we've explored the high-level architectures for the identity systems in use today as well as new designs that promise richer, more authentic online relationships, better security, and more privacy. By exploring the trust bases that arise from these architectures we've been able to explore the legitimacy of these architectures as a basis for online identity. My belief is that a hybrid system that combines algorithmic public identifiers with autonomic private identifiers can provide a universal identity layer for the Internet, increasing security and privacy, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">reducing friction</a>, and providing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">new</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">better</a> online experiences.

 Notes 
 
     Often the term root of trust is used to a hardware device or some trusted hardware component in the computer. The usage here is broader and refers to anything that is relied on for trust in the identity system. Trust anchor is a term that has sometimes been used in the cryptography community to refer to this same concept.   
     A number of cryptographic systems are trivially self-certifying (e.g. PGP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). What sets the autonomic identity systems described here apart is the key event log. Sam Smith calls these identifiers “autonomic identifiers” to set them apart from their less capable counterparts and emphasize their ability to self-manage keys without recourse to a third party system.

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t this! I’ve heard that
red-tailed hawks<a>1</a> live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

			</p>
		
	

 

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t news, Kellyanne.</p>
<p>Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so
we could set aside our differences &amp; figure out an aggressive climate plan to
address the planetary crisis at our feet.</p>
<p>Trump doesn’t even believe climate change is real.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic! Let’s do this thing.</p>

We have two great updates from Kim Hamilton Duffy (Architect Digital Credentials Consortium, Chair of the W3C CCG and Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force) and Lluis Arińo (convenor of Diplomas Use Case at European Blockchain Service Infrastructure and CIO Rovira i Virgili University, Spain).<br><br>Kim gave a great update on the W3C Verifiable Credentials in Education Task Force is working on, what educational institutions are currently participating on the Task Force and it objectives.  The presentation included some great questions from the event participants, as well as highlighting that the Task Force is interested in participation of institutions, organizations or individuals from Asia Region.  <br><br>Lluis  provided an overview of the goals and current projects (Notarisation of Documents, ESSIF, Diplomas management and Trusted Sharing Data) of EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure).  Lluis then gave a detailed overview of the Diploma Use Case covering, architectural elements, the centrality of verifiable credentials to the Use Case and the paradigm shift from institution centric to user centricity, making EBSI the common underlying building block for lifecycle management of diplomas.  <br><br>Recording of the Event: <a href="https://vimeo.com/464715275">https://vimeo.com/464715275</a></p><p>0:00:00 - Introductions<br>0:06:00 - Kim Hamilton Duffy - Verifiable Education Task Force<br>0:48:31 - Lluis Ariño - EBSI Diploma Use Case<br>1:32:21 - Upcoming schedule</p><p>For more information on Education Task Force: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/</a></p><p>For more information on EBSI: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained</a></p><p><br>Finally we covered the upcoming Vienna Digital identity Events:<br><br>	- October 26 - Bridging to SSI<br>	- November 9 - High Assurance Digital Identity (HADI) and Pharma<br>	- November 23 - Guardianship<br>	- December 14 - GADI</p><p><br>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

<p>I was starting to write this post when we were evacuated from the fire. Miraculously, after a really rough week, we were able to move back in on Friday. The house is still intact, the electricity is back on, and although the air is toxic, air purifiers allow the inside to be comfortable. I feel awful for the thousands of families who were not so lucky.</p><p>I'm now finishing and publishing this post as a way of adding some final punctuation to this terrible week. <a href="http://www.vaguelyinteresting.co.uk/as-i-was-saying-before-i-was-so-rudely-interrupted/">As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted ...</a></p><p>In the spirit of <a href="https://nownownow.com/">Derek Sivers</a>, I thought I'd write a quick update about what I'm doing these days. It's not quite a "now" page in the Sivers model, but it'll do .. for now.</p><p>Where I work:</p><p>I'm Head of Engineering and Sponsor Product at <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a>. Understanding what ForUsAll does, and therefore what I do, requires a little bit of explanation: in the US, rather than traditional pensions, workers tend to get something called a 401(k) plan (memorably named after its tax code). A part of your pre-tax pay is sent to a fund that invests on your behalf; many employers match your contribution up to a certain level. At retirement you get to withdraw those funds; the hope is that your investments have grown in value in the interim.</p><p>They tend to be jargon-laden, badly-run, and offer web interfaces that look like they were built in Microsoft Frontpage in 1998. And that's if you even have access to one: most American workers at smaller businesses don't, and therefore have limited access to decent ways to save for retirement. ForUsAll's web platform makes it cheaper and less time-consuming for employers to run (or "sponsor") a plan. And we're working on other ways for regular people to build financial stability for themselves, even before retirement. It's not about employees at well-funded startups or Fortune 500 companies; it's everyone else.</p><p>So my role is to run the engineering team, as well as product for the employer side of the experience. It's my first fintech company, but that's not why I'm doing it - my personal mission statement continues to be to work on projects that make the world more equal, informed, and inclusive, and this fits the bill.</p><p>I'm bringing a few things to the table here: my experience building products from both an engineering and product strategy perspective, but also my design thinking and cultural development background. I'm finding that those instincts are coming in very useful, and my big self-development project is to second-guess myself less than I often have in the past. I've been given a large role in determining the future strategy of the company, and I'm trying to bring my all to it.</p><p>By the way, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/forusall/3ae887ce-c793-42a6-bf93-4c14f12fb224">I'm hiring front-end engineers</a>.</p><p>Also:</p><p>I continue to sit on the board at <a href="https://latakoo.com">Latakoo</a>, the media startup where I was the CTO and first employee. Its technology - which I helped design and build - allows networks like NBC News to easily plan stories and transmit video from the field using commodity internet connections.</p><p>Latakoo is profitable. Its cloud service is used by many of the news organizations you can think of, and its on-premise servers have found homes in their editing suites. I'm really proud to have been a part of it, and to still be able to help where I can.</p><p>I believe deeply in the importance of media in our democracy, and I'm always excited to find opportunities to help support its future. In February I helped run (with my ex-<a href="https://matter.vc">Matter</a> colleague <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/profile/roxann-stafford/">Roxann Stafford</a>) a session on <a href="https://werd.io/2020/designing-for-equity">designing for equity</a> as part of a <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/training/product-immersion">Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms bootcamp</a> organized by <a href="https://newscatalyst.org/">NewsCatalyst</a> and the <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/">Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism</a> with <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">the Google News Initiative</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, I'm hoping to wind up <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a>'s incorporated corporate entity - and its hosted service, which is still online - this tax year. This doesn't mean Known itself is winding down: the open source community continues apace, and has been <a href="https://opencollective.com/known">funding future development through Open Collective</a>. The Known copyrights and assets will revert to me once the closure is complete.</p><p>Beyond work:</p><p>More of my time has been spent helping to care for my mother. It's been a decade since her diagnosis, and my life has been turned completely upside down in the years since (including some time where I thought I probably had the terminal, genetic condition too). Being able to spend time with both my parents is a privilege. But it's also been very easy to put my personal life on pause. I started this year with a determination to unpause - although 2020 has sometimes had other ideas.</p><p>I'm about to start a <a href="https://www.writingclasses.com/classes/description/zoetrope-fiction-writing">Gotham Writers Workshop course on writing fiction</a>. Writing has always been my first love, and I'm determined to take it more seriously. I took some Stanford writing courses over the summer and found them to be both incredibly useful and motivating. I'd been waitlisted for a two year part-time novel writing certificate, but sadly didn't make the cut. (Who can blame them - who is this tech bro anyway?) No matter; I'm finding other ways to improve my skills and get closer to my goal of actually publishing a long-form fiction book.</p><p>I came first in my group in the NYC Midnight flash fiction competition this summer; I'm waiting to see if I got into the third round.</p><p>I read a lot more than I write, and I've been trying my best to keep off the social networks. They don't, as a whole, improve my life. But the addiction is strong. I just wholesale quit Facebook and Instagram as a protest against that company's actions, and it felt pretty good.</p><p>When I thought I also probably had my mother's dyskeratosis congenita, I gained a lot of weight. I've been trying my best to lose it, through only eating during an eight hour window, improving my diet, and increasing the amount of exercise I do. We bought a treadmill so my mother could walk without having to leave the house (my dad also has mobility issues); I've been using it to regularly run 5Ks. It's nowhere near as impressive as my runner friends, but it's a world away from my last few years. I used to walk 7-8 miles a day in the course of my life in the UK, and my life in California has never worked the same way. I've lost some weight but I've got a very long way to go.</p><p>I've been thinking about how I can help mission-driven founders. I was pretty naive when I founded Known, and more so Elgg; I'd love to help people who are genuinely trying to make the world a better place to avoid some of those same mistakes. Time is limited, though. So maybe an online book and/or community is the way to go.</p><p>What's next:</p><p>In 2021 I want to ...</p><p>... finish a fiction book. Whether it gets published or not is out of my hands, but I want to do the best job I can. And then prepare to do it again.</p><p>... lose that weight and continue to get healthier.</p><p>... re-find the joy in life. It's been a tough year, and I want to find a way to have more time and space that's really mine. Between work and caring it's been hard to carve out room for my own life. I wouldn't change those things for the world, but I'd like to be able to find a healthier balance.</p>

   A renewed emphasis on building out Datasette Cloud has produced three new plugins this week: datasette-dateutil, datasette-import-table and datasette-edit-schema, plus a major improvement to Datasette's default interface for browsing tables.

  <p>A renewed emphasis on building out <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasettecloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> has produced three new plugins this week: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil">datasette-dateutil</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-import-table">datasette-import-table</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a>, plus a major improvement to Datasette's default interface for browsing tables.</p>
 Datasette column actions 
<p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">latest.datasette.io demo</a> (continuously deployed with the latest Datasette main branch) you'll see a new UI element: cog icons on each table column, which reveal a drop-down menu.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm calling these "column actions", and they're an improvement I've been planning for a long time.</p>
<p>So far these solve two problems:</p>
 
 Sorting a column in descending order previously required two full page load clicks - one to sort ascending, and another to reverse that order. You can now sort descending directly from the menu. 
 Datasette lets you facet by any column by appending <code>?_facet=column-name</code> to the URL, but this is not a very discoverable feature! It suggests facets for columns that have less than 30 unique values, but sometimes you want to facet by something else - US states for example. You can now facet any column using the cog menu, with the exception of single unique primary key columns since faceting by those is guaranteed to only return one result per value. 
 
<p>Additionally, if a column has visible blank values on the page a "Show not-blank rows" option will be displayed, for quickly seeing rows that have something interesting in that column.</p>
<p>I'm planning to make these available for extension by plugins - I'm sure there are all sorts of other potentially useful per-column actions.</p>
<p>One concern I had in building these was accessibility: I was particularly worried that adding the markup for a dropdown menu to a <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element would interfere with screenreaders when they were using those headers to describe the contents of a cell.</p>
<p>In the end I solved this by creating the menu as a separate absolutely positioned element, which appears in the correct place when the cog icon is clicked.</p>
<p>This still needs more work - I need to learn how to use ARIA to make the menus fully accesible - but I'm optimistic in the approach so far. If you use a screen reader I would deeply value your feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/984">column action accessibility issue</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to try out column actions they're available in the latest alpha release, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.50a0">Datasette 0.50a0</a>.</p>
 datasette-dateutil 
<p>I'm working with students in the Stanford Big Local Journalism course this term, and it's really helping me figure out the gaps in Datasette and my forthcoming Datasette Cloud hosted offering.</p>
<p>I want Datasette to be as useful to journalists as possible. This means handling messy data from all manner of sources (many of them government).</p>
<p>One missing feature has been flexible date handling. I've been succesfully using the excellent <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil">python-dateutil library</a> for this for fifteen years now, so I decided to expose its functionality within Datasette as the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil">datasette-dateutil</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The plugin adds several new custom SQL functions. Here's an example query:</p>
  select
  dateutil_parse("10 october 2020 3pm"),
  dateutil_parse_fuzzy("This is due 10 september"),
  dateutil_parse("1/2/2020"),
  dateutil_parse("2020-03-04"),
  dateutil_parse_dayfirst("2020-03-04"),
  dateutil_easter(2020);  
<p><a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%2210+october+2020+3pm%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse_fuzzy%28%22This+is+due+10+september%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%221%2F2%2F2020%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%222020-03-04%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse_dayfirst%28%222020-03-04%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_easter%282020%29%3B">Try that query here</a>. It outputs the following:</p>
 <code>2020-10-10T15:00:00
2020-09-10T00:00:00
2020-01-02T00:00:00
2020-03-04T00:00:00
2020-04-03T00:00:00
2020-04-12
</code> 
<p>I've also exposed the <code>rrule</code> module, which implements recurring date rules as described in the iCalendar specification. The <code>dateutil_rrule()</code> and <code>dateutil_rrule_date()</code> functions return JSON arrays of dates matching the rule, for example:</p>
  select
  dateutil_rrule('FREQ=HOURLY;COUNT=5'),
  dateutil_rrule_date(
    'FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3',
    '1st jan 2020'
  );  
<p><a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++dateutil_rrule(%27FREQ%3DHOURLY%3BCOUNT%3D5%27)%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_rrule_date(%0D%0A++++%27FREQ%3DDAILY%3BCOUNT%3D3%27%2C%0D%0A++++%271st+jan+2020%27%0D%0A++)%3B">Try it</a> - here are the results:</p>
 <code>[
    "2020-10-02T23:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T00:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T01:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T02:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T03:12:55"
]

[
    "2020-01-01",
    "2020-01-02",
    "2020-01-03"
]
</code> 
<p>These are SQLite strings containing JSON arrays - but you can use SQLite's <code>json_each()</code> function to expand them out into tables that can then be joined against other tables! The README <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil#joining-data-using-json_each">goes into more details</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for solving problems like generating the number-of-items per day for a given time period while still returning a 0 for dates that do not have any corresponding items.</p>
 datasette-edit-schema 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/26/weeknotes-software-carpentry-sqlite/#weeknotes-sqlite-utils">previewed this last week</a>, when it was called <code>datasette-edit-table</code>. I realized that <code>datasette-edit-schema</code> is a better name as it doesn't imply that you can edit the rows within the table - just the schema of the table itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema/releases/tag/0.3">Release 0.3</a> is the first non-alpha release, and provides the following capabilities:</p>
 
 Rename a table 
 Add new columns to a table 
 Rename columns in a table 
 Modify the type of columns in a table 
 Re-order the columns in a table 
 Delete a table 
 
<p>This is particularly useful should you import a messy CSV file (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a>) and then need to rename some columns, change their types (so that you can sort by integers and floats instead of everything being text), then re-order them to make more sense.</p>
<p>It also means you can rename <code>LAT</code> and <code>LON</code> columns to <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> so that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> knows that it can render them on a map.</p>
 datasette-import-table 
<p>If you're going to modify and clean data, it can be helpful to start with an existing table. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-import-table">datasette-import-table</a> lets you provide the URL to an existing Datasette table hosted anywhere on the internet - it will then create a local copy of that table by paginating through the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/json_api.html#table-arguments">JSON API</a> for that table and importing all of the rows.</p>

<p>I tried to sign up for phone banking and I just couldn’t see doing it, I don’t answer unknown calls and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to right now. I wound up with the Vote Forward letter-writing system, <a href="http://votefwd.org/?fbclid=IwAR2gJSKcIqL4prkZJPZ72oPvOxOnabufWkKxojLL0lRm2NlydSZye2ZQI_8">votefwd.org</a>, which I like for a variety of reasons. </p>



<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">Social networking</a> websites
categorize the people I might be related to into:</p>
 
 those I am (bi-directional) “friends” with; 
 those that I follow (but they don’t follow me back), and vice versa; 
 those that are related to my friends, but not me directly; 
 those whose stuff the social network overlords think you should know about it
(that includes advertisers) 
 everybody else. 
 
<p>This categorizing seems contrary to the way non-dysfunctional human relationships work.
What is a better categorization? Here is my version:</p>
 
 
<p>My close family and friends. These are the people have the key to my house; they
live in my house or are welcome all the time, and will help out no matter what the time
of night it might be. I’ll call them Family, whether we have common genes or not.</p>
 
 
<p>Next are the people that I know well, but who I wouldn’t normally give a key to my
house. I know them well because I have worked with them, I have had fun with them, I
know a bit about their life history, I have some idea about their families
and what they worry about. Traditionally, that would be an actual village but in
times of the internet, people may live far away. It may include my neighborhood, my
congregation, my political faction, or people I have done projects with. I call
them my Village.</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond that is my Tribe. That’s people with whom I share a clear interest, although
I may know many members of my tribe only by name, or not at all. This would include
people of the same faith or Weltanschauung as I have, people in the same town, of the
same profession or political persuasion with a similar value system.</p>
 
 
<p>And there is everybody else, the World.</p>
 
 
<p>There may be one more tier between tribe and world, sort of on a country level. Other than
by allegiance to the same government (or grudging acceptance of the same government?),
I’m having some difficulties to define this tier, so I’m leaving it out of this post.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that I can be member of several of those groupings. For example, I can be
member of several Villages (my home town vs my college town) or Tribes (say, my
politics and my passion for electronics). Or maybe the better way of looking at it
would be to use this categorization only from my point of view; what is a single Village
to me may not be a single Village to anybody else.</p>
<p>I’m sure social science has lots of categorizations like that. Not being a social
scientist, what am I missing in this home-grown version?</p>

 Lists can help solve some of Twitter’s major pain&nbsp;points <p>“Unfollowing everyone on Twitter and switching to lists for better control of my feed. Nothing personal, love you all! “ — Github CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=03">Nat Friedman&nbsp;9/19/20</a></p><p>Twitter is my favorite social&nbsp;network.</p><p>It is a treasure trove of enlightening blog posts, news articles, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmorieBeck/status/1303800700829392902">research papers</a>, and video content that I would never see in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2795110">the stagnant echo chamber</a> that is my Facebook news feed; a place filled with content posted primarily by former classmates who seem to have frighteningly homogenous political opinions and little apparent interest in seriously engaging with opposing viewpoints.</p><p>On Twitter, I have the freedom to engage with a heterogeneous network of thinkers from diverse geographical and ideological backgrounds. The platform has vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current events and trends. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/">A 2018 study</a> found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf">compelling evidence</a> that Twitter isn’t very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209">the abundance</a> of content comes at a high psychological cost:</p>  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9">Information overload</a> makes me feel like I’m drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds. Finding the signal that I’m searching for in a sea of noise takes&nbsp;work.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922">Fear</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629">missing out</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html">fear of not knowing</a> compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may have missed. “Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling…”  <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a> are an under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform’s potential to facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues&nbsp;by:</p>  Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to manage lists provides a much smoother Twitter user experience.  Providing raw data, via the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list">Twitter API</a>, that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling.  <p>Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic discourse that transcends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">left/right paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en">focuses</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728">addressing</a> systemic <a href="https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995">issues</a> rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.</p><p>Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help citizens fulfill their obligation to be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html">well informed</a> and perhaps even allow us to escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us&nbsp;in.</p><p>Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum">recently announced</a> plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists and drastically increase Twitter’s potential to serve the common&nbsp;good.</p><p>You can get started with exploring lists by checking out a few that I’ve&nbsp;made:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086059106874474496">AI</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/197289909">Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153">Blockchain Gaming</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1202739597286854656">Cryptofunds</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576">Cryptogurus</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276220409445101568">Decentralized Finance</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1054920788019572736">Ethereum</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1306382711196590081">Gen Z&nbsp;Mafia</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584">Systems Thinkers</a>  <p>And some great public lists that others have&nbsp;created:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460429">Astronomers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/967118678205505536">Bitcoin Developers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/875371355570487296">Crypto</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295245028386918402">Cryptoart</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/93883642">Congress</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/128331">Digital and Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/5158212">Economics</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/55356059">Financial News</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/84693025">Futurists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/73010929">Health Innovators</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/7450">Investors/VC/Angel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1023884">Machine Learning</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226161844793966593">Media \\&nbsp;Content</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/222800557">Neuroscience</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215437668">Philosophers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460480">Physicists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/68365941">Wall Street Influencers</a>  <p>Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/shingaithornton">@shingaithornton</a> with any thoughts on lists or suggestions for how to improve the ones I’m working&nbsp;on.</p><p>This piece was originally posted <a href="https://blog.shingaithornton.com/twitter-lists-are-underrated/">on my personal&nbsp;blog</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Not bad, eh?  Also with plenty of cute characters on the Spritely site
(thank you to <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/">David Revoy</a> for taking
my loose character sketches and making them into such beautiful
paintings!)</p>
<p>But those cute characters are there for a reason!  Spritely is quite
ambitious and has quite a few subprojects.  Here's a
<a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/18aa2f92-36cc-4424-9a4f-6f2de946fbd2">video that explains how they all fit together</a>.
Hopefully that makes things more clear!</p>
<p>Actually that video is from <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub Conference 2020</a>,
the <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#talks">talks</a> of which have now
<a href="https://conf.tube/video-channels/apconf_channel/videos">all have their videos live</a>!
I also moderated the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/6289920f-4e35-4141-ab6f-379b357849ec">intro keynote panel about ActivityPub authors/editors</a>.
Plus there's an easter egg, the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">ActivityPub Conference Opening Song</a>! :)</p>
<p>But I can't take credit for APConf 2020... organization and support are thanks to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Sebastian Lasse, and <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">FOSSHost</a> for hosting the website and BigBlueButton instance and <a href="https://conf.tube/">conf.tube</a> for generously hosting all the videos.  There's a <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/87bc99dd-b1b8-4fc3-b034-dca805388179">panel about the organization of APConf</a> you can watch if you're interested in more of that!  (And of course, all the other great videos too!)</p>
<p>So... what about that week I was going to work on Terminal Phase?
Well... I'm still planning on doing it but admittedly it hasn't
happened yet.  All of the above took more time than expected.
However, today I am working on my talk about Spritely Goblins for
RacketCon, and as it turns out, extending Terminal Phase is a big part
of that talk.  But I'll announce more soon when the Terminal Phase
stuff happens.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards!</p>

<p></p><p>I'm sleep-deprived because I had to evacuate my parents from their home last night, but adrenaline is keeping me awake. We drove away as the fiery glow appeared over the hill, and a stream of fire engines, sirens blazing, sped in the other direction. The Safeway at the corner where I sometimes sneak off and buy deli counter chicken tenders is now the fire staging area. The street where I go for walks to hit my daily active calorie count has been bulldozed to try and make a barrier to stop the spread.</p><p>The ash on my car this morning was like a layer of sand; each grain, a fragment of something destroyed. The smoke hangs in the air and turns everything red. It falls in chunks, like snow.</p><p>"Fire season" is a phrase we say now. I guess there was always a prime season for wildfires, which ran from May to October, roughly, but it's only really been a part of the lexicon since the Tubbs fire tore through Santa Rosa in 2017. The air was thick with smoke then, too. We used to worry about earthquakes - "the big one" - and now we worry about heat and wind.</p><p>My mother is sitting in a chair at a chain dialysis center, receiving treatment for the side effects of drugs she takes to manage a double lung transplant she received seven years ago. She never drank or smoked; always ate right; always exercised. Genetics got her in the end, as it did my grandmother and my aunt. She listens to books and browses the web on the iPad I bought her while a refrigerator-sized machine cleans her blood. The patients sit in rows while the machines churn blood around their coils. It looks like a gothic datacenter. She sits through it with surprisingly good humor, just as she sits through her hospital visits. Last week, she was in the ER. This week, she needed a blood transfusion. Whenever some politician talks about removing protections for pre-existing conditions, dropping it into a speech because it tests well with a certain kind of conservative, I wonder how I'm supposed to keep my mother alive.</p><p>When we knew we had to get out, I booked a hotel near the dialysis center. I feel privileged to have both the means and ability to do this; it meant we could pack up, drive out, and know where we were going. The evacuation site at the Sonoma County fairgrounds, and a few others, filled up and stopped taking people late in the night. The hotel lobby began to fill with people who hadn't booked, and hoped there would be a vacancy. Elderly people in masks, often holding dogs or cats under their arms, milled about in the lobby hoping a no-show would free up a room.</p><p>The style motif of the hotel is brown. The furniture is brown; the walls are brown; the curtains are brown; the light from outside is brown. The upholstery has been designed to hide spills and dirt. Irregular brown patterns draw your eye away from what you're not supposed to see.</p><p>I spent my morning frantically trying to find food that my mother could eat before dialysis. She can't tolerate much, but her feeding tube doesn't provide enough nutrition to last through a day. Ordinarily, we find ways to cook for her, but that requires a kitchen. Takeout food, which would be my first choice in this situation, is too salty for her, or has ingredients she can't digest. The WalMart next door had been ransacked by fire evacuees; the only edible food items left were PopTarts, which aren't on my mother's menu. At Raley's, further away, we found microwaveable oatmeal and some strawberries. As I loaded the car with food, I tried my best to prevent the ash from sliding through the open doors.</p><p>We packed my mother off to dialysis, rearranging the back of my car so that her wheelchair would fit without removing the foot pedals. I bought a coffee from the Starbucks in the hotel parking lot (brown) and sat in my room, finally immersed in peaceful silence except for the 1970s hum of the air conditioner. Finally, for the first time since we rushed out of the house, I took a shower.</p><p>Logging into social media again felt as if I had peeled open a wormhole into an alternate reality. "Blockchain is what happens after Silicon Valley," read one tweet. It turns out what will really happen after Silicon Valley is scorched earth and ash from the sky. The importance of politics has escalated from differences of opinions about how we organize the economy into something closer to life and death. The tendrils of the climate emergency are snaking closer and closer to our homes. There is an out-of-control pandemic taking our loved ones. There are concentration camps on the borders and immigration raids in our communities. And there is undisguised authoritarian racism coming from the White House.</p><p>While I was offline, a company called Coinbase, where I have spent a fair amount of money over the years, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">made a statement about its "mission focus"</a>. It is the worst kind of bullshit. It's a disingenuous, hollow statement against placing inclusion and morality at the heart of business. It's an argument not just for the status quo, but for going backwards in time to find the old status quo. It paints Coinbase, and companies that support a similar stance, as safe places for the broey, exclusionary, overwhelmingly white masculinity that still permeates any space with money and power. It would be a hard pill to swallow at any time. It just so happens that right now, the sky is on fire and the world is succumbing to fascism. The timing is, in itself, a tell.</p><p>We learned that the 2016 Trump campaign used Facebook to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/28/trump-2016-campaign-targeted-35m-black-americans-to-deter-them-from-voting">actively attempt to deter 3.5 million Black Americans from voting</a>. It doesn't matter if the ads were effective, although I would be surprised if they weren't; what matters is that the campaign had the intention, and the Facebook platform presented itself as a way to get it down. There is no way to work at Facebook without being complicit. Nor for Trump: perhaps coincidentally, Brad Parscale, the digital advisor for the 2016 campaign, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/28/917697120/brad-parscale-senior-advisor-to-trump-campaign-is-hospitalized-after-call-to-pol">was taken into custody after threatening to take his own life</a>.</p><p>As always, there are tweets and hot takes and memes. Irregular patterns draw your eye away from what you're not supposed to see. But we can choose to focus.</p><p>The surrealism of this year invites us to not take it seriously. The horror is dream-like in its absurdity. The facts and implications are so outside the parameters of ordinary life that they seem outlandish. But the sky really is red with flame, over two hundred thousand Americans alone really are dead from the pandemic, there really are unmarked federal soldiers in our cities, people really are being swept up by ICE in the dead of night and kept in concentration camps, and the worst really may be yet to come.</p><p>We can choose to look away. That option is always available to us. But to do so is to accept our fate, and to acquiesce to those who would harm us to make a profit. Today, watching the ash continue to fall and wondering if my mother will make it through another dialysis, I'm not at all prepared to do that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/WqkSoAkKh2I">James Todd on Unsplash</a>.</p>

<p>Joseph Gentle has been working on collaborative editors since being a developer on Google Wave back in 2010, later building ShareJS. He's used Operational Transforms throughout, due to their performance and memory benefits over CRDTs (Conflict-free replicated data types) - but the latest work in that space from  Martin Kleppmann and other researchers has seen him finally switch allegiance to these newer algorithms. As a long-time fan of collaborative editing (ever since the Hydra/SubEthaEdit days) I thoroughly enjoyed this as an update on how things have evolved over the past decade.</p>

<p>We evacuated on Sunday night.</p><p>I had a whole other blog post drafted, about what I've been doing lately. Perhaps I should have known it was tempting fate, because just as I was getting it ready to publish, we realized the fire was going to come over the hill and into the neighborhood.</p><p>I've been spending most of my quarantine with my parents in Santa Rosa. My mother's health has been failing badly, and I want to help; more than that, I want to be there with my parents. The pandemic's silver lining has been that I can work remotely and therefore spend more time with them. I've sat on my mother's bed while we've sung lullabies; I've stroked her head while she suffered through stomach pains; I've flushed her feeding tubes; I've listened to podcasts and watched TV with her.</p><p>The fire got incredibly close, and at the time of writing has taken quite a few homes in the neighborhood. I took this photo from the back door just as we were about to leave:</p><p></p><p>I'm glad everyone is safe, but I'm worried about the irreplaceable things. We have so many photographs, books, objects with sentimental value. I deeply hope the fire spares them.</p><p>This year has been a shock. I also don't think it'll be the last year like it. The climate emergency is here for all of us; it's just not evenly distributed yet. Wherever you are, please consider voting in a candidate that will help reverse the damage.</p>

  It bums me out that Gail Sheehy passed without much notice—meaning I only heard about it in passing.

<p><a href="https://www.bibliotica.com/2014/09/review-daring-my-passages-by-gail-sheehy-gail_sheehy/"></a>It bums me out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Sheehy">Gail Sheehy</a> passed without much notice—meaning I only heard about it in passing. And I didn’t hear about it, actually; I saw it on <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sunday-morning/">CBS’ Sunday Morning</a>, where her face passed somewhere between Tom Seaver’s and John Thompson’s in the September 6 show’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/passage-in-memoriam-9-6-2020/">roster of the freshly dead</a>. I was shocked: She was older than both those guys and far less done. Or done at all, except technically. Death seems especially out of character for her, of all people.</p>
<p>Credit where due: The New York Times did post <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/books/gail-sheehy-dead.html">a fine obituary</a>, and&nbsp;New York, for which she wrote much, has&nbsp;<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/08/gail-sheehy-never-stopped-reporting-a-tribute-from-new-york-magazine.html">an excellent remembrance</a>&nbsp;in the magazine by&nbsp;Christopher Bonanos (<a href="https://twitter.com/heybonanos">@heybonanos</a>). Writes Bonanos,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sheehy had an 18th book in the works, and it would have been — or will be, if someone else takes to the finish line — a fascinating one. Instead of reporting amid her peers (she was a few years older than the boomers, but roughly in their cohort), she set out to write a kind of echo of Passages, but this time about the millennial generation. And I can tell you that she was reveling in the immersion among people 50 and 60 years younger than she. She went to clubs with college guys and got out on the dance floor, and (by her account, at least) they were disarmed and amused by her — which is to say that she’d found every journalist’s sweet spot, where people get loose and comfortable enough to reveal themselves. She was constantly offering bits and pieces of her findings as magazine stories and columns. Some would work as stand-alone pieces and others wouldn’t, but all were tesserae in what was clearly going to be a big ambitious swoop of sociology. At New York, we were so taken with this project that we had also begun work on a profile of her…</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gail_sheehy">@Gail_Sheehy</a> is chronologically uncorrected. Her website, <a href="https://gailsheehy.com/">GailSheehy.com</a>, also still speaks of her in the present tense: “For her new book-in-progress, she’s a woman on a mission to redefine the most misunderstood generation: millennials. They are struggling with the rupture in gender roles and a crisis in mental health. But this generation of 20- and 30-somethings is also inventing radically new passages.”</p>
<p>Gail Sheehy’s writing isn’t just solid; it is enviably good. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/gail-sheehy-quotes">BrainyQuotes has 71 samples</a>, which is&nbsp;far short of sufficient. One goes,&nbsp;It is a paradox that as we reach our prime, we also see there is a place where it finishes. (Tell me about it. I’m only ten years younger than she was.)</p>
<p>As it happens, I’m writing this in the home library of a friend. On its many shelves a single spine stands out:&nbsp;<a href="https://gailsheehy.com/pathfinders">Pathfinders</a>, published in 1981. I pull it down and open it at random, knowing I’ll find something worth sharing from a page there. Here ya go, under the subhead&nbsp;Secrets of Well-being:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like the dance of brilliant reflections on a clear pond, well-being is a shimmer that accumulates from many important life choices, mad over the years by a mind that is not often muddied by pretense or ignorance and a heart that is open enough to sense people in their depths and to intuit the meaning of most situations.</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is an afterlife, I am sure Gail Sheehy is already reporting on it.</p>

    Inevitably we got round to talking about async.

As much of an unneeded complication as it is for so many day-to-day use-cases, it’s important for Python because, if and when you do need the high throughput handling of these io-bound use-cases, you don’t want to have to switch language.

The same for Django: most of what you’re doing has no need of async but you don’t want to have to change web f

  <blockquote cite="https://noumenal.es/posts/weeknotes-wk-39/rX/"><p>Inevitably we got round to talking about async.

As much of an unneeded complication as it is for so many day-to-day use-cases, it’s important for Python because, if and when you do need the high throughput handling of these io-bound use-cases, you don’t want to have to switch language.

The same for Django: most of what you’re doing has no need of async but you don’t want to have to change web framework just because you need a sprinkling of non-blocking IO.</p></blockquote><p>— <a href="https://noumenal.es/posts/weeknotes-wk-39/rX/">Carlton Gibson</a></p>

<p>Bits don’t leave a fossil record.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. They do persist on magnetic, optical and other media, all easily degraded or erased. But how long will those last?</p>
<p>Since I’ve <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/05/15/fossil/">already asked that question</a>, I’ll set it aside and ask the one in the headline.</p>
<p>Some perspective: depending on when you date its origins, digital life—the one we live <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Living_in_a_Connected_World/Technology_as_an_Extension_of_Self">by extension</a> through our digital devices, and on the Internet (which, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force">The Force</a>, connects nearly all digital things)—is decades old.</p>
<p>It’s an open question how long it will last. But I’m guessing it will be more than a few more decades. More likely we will remain partly digital for centuries or millennia.</p>
<p>So I’m looking for guesses more educated than mine.</p>
<p>Since this blog no longer takes comments from outside of Harvard (and I do want to fix that), please tag your responses, wherever they may be on the Internet with #DigitalLife. Thanks.</p>

  <p>This week I completed the Software Carpentry instructor training course, added two foundational features to <code>sqlite-utils</code> and learned how to compile modules for SQLite.</p>
 Software Carpentry 
<p>This week I took the two day <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">instructor training course</a> put on by Software Carpentry. I've been wanting to do this for over a year now, so I'm excited to have finally found the time to attend the workshop.</p>
<p><a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> is a really interesting non-profit organization. Their mission is to "teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide" - but I've always thought of them as teaching software engineering fundamentals to scientists - things like version control!</p>
<p>It turns out I've been <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=carpentry">following the carpentries project</a> for fifteen years now, ever since their founder Greg Wilson started writing about his efforts to bring software engineering to scientists <a href="https://third-bit.com/archive/">on his blog</a>.</p>
<p>As you would expect from an organization that specializes in workshop education, the workshop they put on teaching you how to run workshops is top notch. Their <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/">curriculum materials</a>, forged by a process of continuing tweaks over hundreds if not thousands of presentations, are superb. I aspire to produce educational documentation this good some day.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of Carpentries is that every workshop is presented using live coding - no slides! The instructor works through the same material as the learners, talking through each line of code as they run it. The kind of thing you would normally use slides for (diagrams etc) instead lives in the workshop handouts. Take a look through their <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/">Databases and SQL</a> course to get an idea of how that works.</p>
<p>I have to complete a couple more steps, but once I've done that I'll be a certified instructor for the program - which means I can volunteer to help run their workshops in the future.</p>
 SQLite3 modules 
<p>I had two encounters with compiled SQLite modules this week.</p>
<p>One of my favourite lesser-known features of PostgreSQL is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/18/fast-search-using-postgresql-trigram-indexes/">trigram indexes</a>. The short version is: they make <code>where text like '%something%'</code> queries run crazy-fast. Normal indexes just speed up <code>prefix%</code> like searches, but trigrams work for strings in the middle of other strings as well.</p>
<p>I started a thread on the official SQLite forum <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/c230760fdf?t=h">asking about trigram index support</a>, and proposed that maybe it could be achieveable using a custom SQLite FTS tokenizer. Core SQLite maintainer Dan Kennedy replied with <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/ca90da691a?t=h">a complete, working implementation of exactly that</a>, written in C!</p>
<p>With Dan's permission I've published his code in a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts5-trigram/">sqlite-fts5-trigram</a> GitHub repository. In doing so I figured out <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts5-trigram/blob/main/build-macos.sh">how to build it</a> for macOS, and then hooked that build script up to <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-fts5-trigram/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-macos.yml">a GitHub Actions workflow</a> that produces a compiled <code>ftstri.so</code> module ready for anyone on macOS to run themselves.</p>
<p>Just one problem: it turns out binary modules like that need to be signed for macOS before anyone can run them. That's a step beyond me at the moment, but I may revisit that in the future.</p>
<p>The other complied module I learned to use this week is <code>spellfix.c</code>, see my TIL <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/sqlite_compile-spellfix-osx.md">Compiling the SQLite spellfix.c module on macOS</a>. I needed these because I've started expereminting with <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a> as a home media server, and it turns out Plex runs on SQLite! The catch is that it uses the <code>spellfix</code> module, which means you can't open the Plex database in Datasette without first compiling that module for use with <code>--load-extension</code> - see the TIL for details.</p>
 sqlite-utils 
<p>I shipped <code>sqlite-utils</code> 2.20 and 2.21, and wrote about the big new features in two blog entries here:</p>
 
 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/">Refactoring databases with sqlite-utils extract</a> 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-advanced-alter-table/">Executing advanced ALTER TABLE operations in SQLite</a> using <code>sqlite-utils transform</code>. 
 
<p>The extract operation in sqlite-utils 2.20 was taking 12 minutes to execute against a table with 680,000 rows. I had <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/172">a rethink of how it worked</a> and got that down to just 4 seconds in sqlite-utils 2.21!</p>
<p>I worked on these as part of my ongoing exploration of Datasette and <code>sqlite-utils</code> as tools for cleaning up and refactoring data. They fill some key holes in the tooling I've built so far.</p>
<p>I'm already using transform to build out the next phase of my <code>datasette-edit-tables</code> plugin. See <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-tables/issues/11">issue #11</a> for notes on work-in-progress support for editing table schemas directly in Datasette.</p>

<p>I appreciated <a href="https://avc.com/2020/09/universal-access-and-choice/">Fred Wilson's post today about USV's thesis on expanding access to knowledge, wellness, and capital</a>. He also talks about universal basic income as a way to get there. It's a useful lens to think about the future, although perhaps inevitably, I see it a slightly different way.</p><p>Despite being a natural born American citizen, I grew up in a European context, went to state schools, and went to university for free. (I was actually part of the last cohort of university students to do so; the year afterwards, universities started to charge a whopping £1300 per year, except in Scotland.) I understand that free college does not entrench existing income disparities; my fellow students came from a very broad range of backgrounds and contexts.</p><p>Coming from that context, I don't see government services as monopolies in the business sense. They're services in the civil sense: social infrastructure for all. For example, I'm not sure we would want to have multiple police forces competing for business in a capitalist market (however we feel about our current ones). Or take healthcare: every time I walk into a doctor's office in the US I miss the simplicity and safety of the NHS.</p><p>So I go the other way. I strongly believe that private schools shouldn't exist, which is an alien idea to some. Every child should have the same opportunities. Every college should be free. Private schools, and private colleges, entrench existing power networks. Why shouldn't a kid who happened to be born poor, or in the wrong neighborhood, have access to them? It's not like rich people don't have a thousand other ways to convey privilege to their offspring - but at least access to the same institutions would give everyone else a fighting chance.</p><p><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/reports/2017/07/12/435629/racist-origins-private-school-vouchers/">"School choice" has a racist history</a>, and <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/reformers-must-stop-whitewashing-choice/">a racist present</a>. It's not something we should knowingly advocate for without understanding and actively fighting to undermine its foundation in segregation.</p><p>Similarly, universal basic income that doesn't sit alongside other mechanisms for economic justice and support is just a way to undermine those kinds of programs. It's not either/or: all schools should be free and everyone should have access to a basic income. College should be available to all and a monthly stipend would have great ROI for the economy. We don't get to absolve ourselves of providing opportunities throughout society by simply cutting a check. In a vacuum, UBI is that most American idea: discrimination in the guise of equity.</p><p>With state support, we will still have a great market economy: one where everyone can start a business or participate in one. In fact, it'll be better, because more people will have access to networks and training. Providing social infrastructure isn't an anti-capitalist idea; it's an anti-racist, anti-discrimination one. It allows more people to access the resources they need to participate, rather than disproportionately shutting out people of color and people from poorer backgrounds. And if you don't think that's where we should be heading, I'm not sure we have much to say to each other.</p>

<p>Email newsletters are only succeeding because RSS failed.</p><p>I just subscribed to Casey Newton's new tech journalism newsletter, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/welcome-to-platformer">Platformer</a>. I appreciate his journalism, and I'm sure it'll become a regular must-read for me in the same way that <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson's Stratechery</a> is. The tech industry needs more analytical journalism, and I'm pleased to support it.</p><p>There's an interesting platform difference between the two. When you sign up and pay for Stratechery, you can certainly opt in to receiving daily emails - and I'm sure this is how most of his subscribers read his work. But you can also get access to a private RSS feed that you can plug into your reader.</p><p>My feed reader is an important part of my morning routine, but it also serves another purpose: to keep regular subscription content out of my inbox. I have enough trouble keeping on top of my email; I'm terrible at it. Adding more messages will not help me. But I also really want to subscribe! So having all my regular subscription content in one place, away from the desolation of my inbox, is useful. (Hundreds of you are reading this post in your inbox. I'm assuming you're all better at email than me! If not, you can always subscribe to my blog via a feed reader.)</p><p>In contrast to Stratechery, Platformer uses <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, which has made starting and subscribing to paid newsletters incredibly easy. As a subscriber, I plug in my email, hit the Apple Pay button, and I'm subscribed. It's kind of a brilliant way to support independent writers. Like RSS feeds, authors don't need to rely on social media for distribution; they have a more direct relationship with the reader. Unlike RSS feeds, it all piles into my horror show inbox.</p><p>My feed reader of choice is <a href="https://newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> (together with the beautiful <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> apps), in part because it allows me to forward email newsletters to an address it provides. <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a> and a few others do this too. I have a blanket filter that removes every Substack newsletter from my inbox and sends the messages to my feed reader, where they show up alongside the blogs I subscribe to. It works for me: I get to read all of my subscriptions in one place, and leave my inbox for all of those other messages that I'll get to eventually.</p><p>It's worth imagining another world, where the string and blu tack solution I made for myself is easy for everyone. What if everyone had an easy-to-use place to read their subscription content, away from the hustle and bustle of their regular emails? What if feed subscriptions had become mainstream, and payments had become an integral part of the specification? What if every author had the ability to use the platform that Ben Thompson had to build for himself, allowing each of them to make a living from their work as easily as publishing to the web?</p><p>The technology isn't there right now, but could it be?</p><p>Every journalist, artist, app builder, musician, author, podcaster, etc, should be able to make money independently on the web. And the web should help them do that.</p><p>Of course, RSS feeds haven't failed. The entire podcasting ecosystem heavily depends on them - <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/podcast-market">an $11 billion market</a>, all depending on open feeds. Even for written content, there are millions of people like me who use them every day. People in tech love to talk about <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">the death of Google Reader</a>, but nobody killed RSS.</p><p>For a year, I worked with Julien Genestoux, who had previously built the <a href="https://superfeedr.com/">Superfeedr</a> feed subscription and distribution engine, on <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">Unlock</a>, a protocol for independent, decentralized payments on the web. The startup didn't quite work out, but the open source protocol continues to find use. Most importantly, I think the idea (anyone should be able to take payments from their own website without a middleman) is very strong, even if the Ethereum blockchain it depended on turned out to not quite be ready for primetime. Not to mention the ability for payments to supplant <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">harmful targeted advertising</a>.</p><p>I believe that Substack, the Stratechery platform, and Patreon's subscription model are all evidence of a need for a decentralized marketplace of content, monetized through easy, recurring payments that don't require a content silo. By using the same feed ecosystem that powers the whole podcasting ecosystem (and my morning content routine), adding a payments layer on top of the RSS specification itself, and then making it insanely easy to read and subscribe, we could empower a new generation of creators, readers, and reader apps.</p><p>Some technical work has been done. <a href="https://about.radiopublic.com/2019/08/09/podpass-proposal-for-an-open-protocol-to-enable-direct-listener-relationships/">PodPass</a> is a proposal for an identity layer on top of RSS for podcasts. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Work is being done at the W3C on web payments</a>. Identity and payment mechanisms are both crucial parts of providing subscriptions as a first-class layer on the web. But there's a great deal more to do technically - and a huge amount more in terms of building a coherent user experience, particularly around payments.</p><p>Here's my final "what if". What if subscription payments were built into the browser or reader, with the vendor itself taking a small cut (in the same way that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/09/12/more-apple-pay-details/">Apple takes 0.15% of Apple Pay purchases</a>)?</p><p>For example: let's say I browse to a website using Mozilla Firefox. That website has some metadata in its HTML which indicates that (1) a feed is available, and (2) there are payment tiers.</p><p>Firefox lets me know that I can subscribe to that website's content with an unobtrusive icon or notification. When I click, it shows me the tiers available. When I hit subscribe, Firefox starts to pull feed content in a built-in reader. When it pulls feeds, it identifies me in the HTTP header with a pseudonymous hash code. For the purposes of this conversation, I'm user <code>123456</code> (the same combination I have on my luggage).</p><p>When I pay, funds are sent directly to the website owner, with a small cut going to Mozilla itself, and another small cut going to WordPress, which powers the site. Funds are transferred behind the scenes in stablecoins (probably), with Mozilla providing a credit card interface to me so I don't have to know or care about crypto. It tells the website owner that I'm user <code>123456</code>, and that I've paid. The website verifies the payment, and next time a feed is requested for user <code>123456</code>, it adds in any paid content. Unlock did this provably, using the blockchain: anyone can build an API which verifies independently that user A has access to paid content from user B.</p><p>From the user's perspective it looks like this: they can see that a website they're on has content that can be subscribed to. When they hit "subscribe" in the browser, they're prompted to choose a tier if paid tiers exist. And then they can read content and manage their subscriptions in a built-in reader.</p><p>For users like me, my existing feed reader can do the same thing: detect paid options, and pay for them if I want. The feed reader vendor gets the cut of the funds.</p><p>Cross-device syncing is taken care of by the browser vendor: my Firefox account already keeps my bookmarks and history up to date everywhere I have Firefox installed. Chrome and Safari users have a similar mechanism. Subscriptions would piggyback on these existing accounts.</p><p>The end result is a web where any creator can make money from their content and any reader can subscribe to it, without having it further clutter an email inbox that they already resent. Because browsers, feed readers, and content management platforms take a small cut of payments, they're incentivized to innovate around the model and build new products. Browser vendors like Mozilla can stop <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/sources-mozilla-extends-its-google-search-deal/">making most of their money from search engine deals</a>. Nobody is forced to rely on Facebook or Twitter for distribution. Targeted ads die. And the internet is more decentralized and healthier for everyone.</p>

  <p>Yesterday <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-advanced-alter-table/">I described</a> the new <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#transforming-tables">sqlite-utils transform</a> mechanism for applying SQLite table transformations that go beyond those supported by <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.

 The problem 
<p>Much of the data I work with in Datasette starts off as a CSV file published by an organization or government. Since CSV files aren’t relational databases, they are often denormalized. It’s particularly common to see something like this:</p>

<p>This is an extract from the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Employee-Compensation/88g8-5mnd">San Francisco Employee Compensation</a> dataset from DataSF.</p>
<p>The <code>sqlite-utils extract</code> command-line tool, and the <code>table.extract()</code> Python method that underlies it, can be used to extract these duplicated column pairs out into separate tables with foreign key relationships from the main table.</p>
 How to refactor that data 
<p>Here's how to use <code>sqlite-utils</code> to clean up and refactor that compensation data.</p>
<p>First, grab the data. It's a 150M CSV file containing over 600,000 rows:</p>
 <code>curl -o salaries.csv 'https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/88g8-5mnd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD'
</code> 
<p>Use <code>sqlite-utils insert</code> to load that into a SQLite database:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils insert salaries.db salaries salaries.csv --csv
</code> 
<p>Fire up Datasette to check that the data looks right:</p>
 <code>datasette salaries.db
</code> 
<p>There's a catch here: the schema for the generated table (shown at the bottom of <code>http://localhost:8001/salaries/salaries</code>) reveals that because we imported from CSV every column is a text column. Since some of this data is numeric we should convert to numbers, so we can do things like sort the table by the highest salary.</p>
<p>We can do that using <code>sqlite-transform</code>:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils transform salaries.db salaries \
  --type 'Employee Identifier' integer \
  --type Salaries float \
  --type Overtime float \
  --type 'Other Salaries' float \
  --type 'Total Salary' float \
  --type 'Retirement' float \
  --type 'Health and Dental' float \
  --type 'Other Benefits' float \
  --type 'Total Benefits' float \
  --type 'Total Compensation' float
</code> 
<p>Having run that command, here's the new database schema:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db '.schema salaries'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "salaries" (
   [rowid] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [Year Type] TEXT,
   [Year] TEXT,
   [Organization Group Code] TEXT,
   [Organization Group] TEXT,
   [Department Code] TEXT,
   [Department] TEXT,
   [Union Code] TEXT,
   [Union] TEXT,
   [Job Family Code] TEXT,
   [Job Family] TEXT,
   [Job Code] TEXT,
   [Job] TEXT,
   [Employee Identifier] INTEGER,
   [Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Overtime] FLOAT,
   [Other Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Total Salary] FLOAT,
   [Retirement] FLOAT,
   [Health and Dental] FLOAT,
   [Other Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Compensation] FLOAT
);
</code> 
<p>Now we can start extracting those columns. We do this using several rounds of the <code>sqlite-utils extract</code> command, one for each duplicated pairs.</p>
<p>For <code>Organization Group Code</code> and <code>Organization Group</code>:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Organization Group Code' 'Organization Group' \
  --table 'organization_groups' \
  --fk-column 'organization_group_id' \
  --rename 'Organization Group Code' code \
  --rename 'Organization Group' name
</code> 
<p>This took about 12 minutes on my laptop, and displayed a progress bar as it runs. (UPDATE: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils/issues/172">in issue #172</a> I improved the performance and knocked it down to just 4 seconds. I also removed the progress bar).</p>
<p>Here's the refactored database schema:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [organization_groups] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "salaries" (
   [rowid] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [Year Type] TEXT,
   [Year] TEXT,
   [organization_group_id] INTEGER,
   [Department Code] TEXT,
   [Department] TEXT,
   [Union Code] TEXT,
   [Union] TEXT,
   [Job Family Code] TEXT,
   [Job Family] TEXT,
   [Job Code] TEXT,
   [Job] TEXT,
   [Employee Identifier] INTEGER,
   [Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Overtime] FLOAT,
   [Other Salaries] FLOAT,
   [Total Salary] FLOAT,
   [Retirement] FLOAT,
   [Health and Dental] FLOAT,
   [Other Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Benefits] FLOAT,
   [Total Compensation] FLOAT,
   FOREIGN KEY(organization_group_id) REFERENCES organization_groups(id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX [idx_organization_groups_code_name]
    ON [organization_groups] ([code], [name]);
</code> 
<p>Now fire up Datasette to confirm it had the desired effect:</p>
 <code>datasette salaries.db
</code> 
<p>Here's what that looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that the new <code>organization_group_id</code> column still shows the name of the organization group, because Datasette automatically de-references foreign key relationships when it displays a table and uses any column called <code>name</code> (or <code>title</code> or <code>value</code>) as the label for a link to the record.</p>
<p>Let's extract the other columns. This will take a while:</p>
 <code>sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Department Code' 'Department' \
  --table 'departments' \
  --fk-column 'department_id' \
  --rename 'Department Code' code \
  --rename 'Department' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Union Code' 'Union' \
  --table 'unions' \
  --fk-column 'union_id' \
  --rename 'Union Code' code \
  --rename 'Union' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Job Family Code' 'Job Family' \
  --table 'job_families' \
  --fk-column 'job_family_id' \
  --rename 'Job Family Code' code \
  --rename 'Job Family' name

sqlite-utils extract salaries.db salaries \
   'Job Code' 'Job' \
  --table 'jobs' \
  --fk-column 'job_id' \
  --rename 'Job Code' code \
  --rename 'Job' name
</code> 
<p>Our finished schema looks like this:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 salaries.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [organization_groups] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [departments] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [unions] (

);
CREATE TABLE [job_families] (

   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE [jobs] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [code] TEXT,
   [name] TEXT
);

<p>We've also shrunk our database file quite a bit. Before the transformations <code>salaries.db</code> was 159MB. It's now just 70MB - that's less than half the size!</p>
<p>I used <code>datasette publish cloudrun</code> to publish a copy of my final database here:</p>
<p><a href="https://sf-employee-compensation.datasettes.com/salaries/salaries">https://sf-employee-compensation.datasettes.com/salaries/salaries</a></p>
<p>Here's the command I used to publish it:</p>
 <code>datasette publish cloudrun salaries.db \
  --service sf-employee-compensation \
  --title "San Francisco Employee Compensation (as-of 21 Sep 2020)" \
  --source "DataSF" \
  --source_url "https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Employee-Compensation/88g8-5mnd" \
  --about "About this project" \
  --about_url "https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/23/sqlite-utils-extract/" \
  --install datasette-block-robots \
  --install datasette-vega \
  --install datasette-copyable \
  --install datasette-graphql
</code> 
 Bonus: explore salaries with GraphQL 
<p>You may have noticed my <code>datasette publish</code> line above finished with the line <code>--install datasette-graphql</code>. This installs the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin as part of the deployment to Cloud Run. Which means we can query the salary data using GraphQL as an alternative to SQL!</p>
<p>Here's a GraphQL query that shows the ten highest paid employees, including their various expanded foreign key references:</p>
  {
  salaries(sort_desc: Total_Compensation, first: 10) {

   SQLite's ALTER TABLE has some significant limitations: it can't drop columns, it can't alter NOT NULL status, it can't change column types. Since I spend a lot of time with SQLite these days I've written some code to fix this - both from Python and as a command-line utility. 
 To SQLite's credit, not only are these limitations well explained in the documentation but the explanation is accompanied

  <p>SQLite's ALTER TABLE has some significant limitations: it can't drop columns, it can't alter NOT NULL status, it can't change column types. Since I spend a lot of time with SQLite these days I've written some code to fix this - both from Python and as a command-line utility.</p>
<p>To SQLite's credit, not only are these limitations <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html">well explained</a> in the documentation but the explanation is accompanied by <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html#making_other_kinds_of_table_schema_changes">a detailed description</a> of the recommended workaround. The short version looks something like this:</p>
 
 Start a transaction 
 Create a new temporary table with the exact shape you would like 
 Copy all of your old data across using INSERT INTO temp_table SELECT FROM old_table 
 Drop the old table 
 Rename the temp table to the old table 
 Commit the transaction 
 
<p>My <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/">sqlite-utils</a> tool and Python library aims to make working with SQLite as convenient as possible. So I set out to build a utility method for performing this kind of large scale table transformation. I've called it <code>table.transform(...)</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some simple examples of what it can do, lifted from <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html#python-api-transform">the documentation</a>:</p>
 # Convert the 'age' column to an integer, and 'weight' to a float
table.transform(types={"age": int, "weight": float})

# Rename the 'age' column to 'initial_age':
table.transform(rename={"age": "initial_age"})

# Drop the 'age' column:
table.transform(drop={"age"})

# Make `user_id` the new primary key
table.transform(pk="user_id")

# Make the 'age' and 'weight' columns NOT NULL
table.transform(not_null={"age", "weight"})

# Make age allow NULL and switch weight to being NOT NULL:
table.transform(not_null={"age": False, "weight": True})

# Set default age to 1:
table.transform(defaults={"age": 1})

# Now remove the default from that column:
table.transform(defaults={"age": None}) 
<p>Each time the <code>table.transform(...)</code> method runs it will create a brand new table, copy the data across and then drop the old table. You can combine multiple operations together in a single call, avoiding copying the table multiple times.</p>
<p>The <code>table.transform_sql(...)</code> method returns the SQL that would be executed instead of executing it directly, useful if you want to handle even more complex requirements.</p>
 The "sqlite-utils transform" command-line tool 
<p>Almost every feature in <code>sqlite-utils</code> is available in both the Python library and as a command-line utility, and <code>.transform()</code> is no exception. The <code>sqlite-utils transform</code> command can be used to apply complex table transformations directly from the command-line.</p>
<p>Here's an example, starting with the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures">fixtures.db</a> database that powers Datasette's unit tests:</p>
 <code>$ wget https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db
$ sqlite3 fixtures.db '.schema facetable'
CREATE TABLE facetable (
    pk integer primary key,
    created text,
    planet_int integer,
    on_earth integer,
    state text,
    city_id integer,
    neighborhood text,
    tags text,
    complex_array text,
    distinct_some_null,
    FOREIGN KEY ("city_id") REFERENCES [facet_cities](id)
);
$ sqlite-utils transform fixtures.db facetable \
  --type on_earth text \
  --drop complex_array \
  --drop state \
  --rename tags the_tags
$ sqlite3 fixtures.db '.schema facetable'       
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "facetable" (
   [pk] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [created] TEXT,
   [planet_int] INTEGER,
   [on_earth] TEXT,
   [city_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [facet_cities]([id]),
   [neighborhood] TEXT,
   [the_tags] TEXT,
   [distinct_some_null] TEXT
);
</code> 
<p>You can use the <code>--sql</code> option to see the SQL that would be executed without actually running it:</p>
 <code>$ wget https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db
$ sqlite-utils transform fixtures.db facetable \
  --type on_earth text \
  --drop complex_array \
  --drop state \
  --rename tags the_tags \
  --sql
CREATE TABLE [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] (
   [pk] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [created] TEXT,
   [planet_int] INTEGER,
   [on_earth] TEXT,
   [city_id] INTEGER REFERENCES [facet_cities]([id]),
   [neighborhood] TEXT,
   [the_tags] TEXT,
   [distinct_some_null] TEXT
);
INSERT INTO [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] ([pk], [created], [planet_int], [on_earth], [city_id], [neighborhood], [the_tags], [distinct_some_null])
   SELECT [pk], [created], [planet_int], [on_earth], [city_id], [neighborhood], [tags], [distinct_some_null] FROM [facetable];
DROP TABLE [facetable];
ALTER TABLE [facetable_new_442f07e26eef] RENAME TO [facetable];
</code> 
 Plenty more tricks 
<p><code>sqlite-utils</code> has plenty more tricks up its sleeve. I suggest spending some time browsing the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python-api.html">Python library reference</a> and the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html">sqlite-utils CLI documentation</a>, or taking a look through through the <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html">release notes</a>.</p>

<p>Katherine Eban, in a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">deeply reported piece</a>, for Vanity Faire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
government’s strategy?</p>
<p>According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
“Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
states to figure out what they want to do.”</p>
<p>One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
leadership and direction.</p>
<p>“Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
role of government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
about New York governor Andrew Cuomo and his desperate call for supplies.</p>
<p>“That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”</p>
<p>“That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told Vanity
Fair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed we sure have been. Nearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-latest-news-09-19-2020-11600512793" title="Wall Street Journal: “U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Near 200,000”">200,000 have died</a> from Covid-19 in the
United States to date, with close to 400,000 deaths <a href="http://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/Projects/COVID/briefing_US_091820.pdf" title="Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Pandemic Forecast for September 17">forecast by January 1</a>.</p>
<p>I’m restraining myself from quoting more; the reporting is impeccable, and the
truth of the situation deeply alarming. Read <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/jared-kushner-let-the-markets-decide-covid-19-fate" title="“That’s Their Problem”: How Jared Kushner Let the Markets Decide America’s COVID-19 Fate">the whole thing</a>, then
maybe go for a long walk and practice deep breathing.</p>
<p>And then <a href="https://vote.org/">Vote</a>. And make sure everyone you know is registered and ready to
vote.</p>

<p>This is a really interesting, relatively new database. It's kind of a weird hybrid between SQLite and PostgreSQL: it uses the PostgreSQL parser but models itself after SQLite in that databases are a single file and the code is designed for use as an embedded library, distributed in a single amalgamation C++ file (SQLite uses a C amalgamation). It features a "columnar-vectorized query execution engine" inspired by MonetDB (also by the DuckDB authors) and is hence designed to run analytical queries really quickly. You can install it using "pip install duckdb" - the resulting module feels similar to Python's sqlite3, and follows roughly the same DBAPI pattern.</p>

<p>I'm pretty conflicted about <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a>.</p><p>On one hand, anything that contributes to the discourse around the harms knowingly committed in the name of engagement should be applauded. My friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jay">David Jay</a> works at the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology</a> as their Head of Mobilization, and was involved in this film; I know the people who work there are coming from a genuine place. I think that is admirable.</p><p>On the other hand, I'll confess to some pretty hard reservations about <a href="https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/05/the-prodigal-techbro/">tech bros who make their fortune at companies like Facebook and then issue mea culpas</a>. The harmful impact of platforms like Facebook were knowable; I know because I, and people like me, knew them well. In 2004, when Facebook was just graduating from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/channeling-the-social-network-lawmaker-grills-zuckerberg-on-his-notorious-beginnings/">being a way to rate the relative attractiveness of women on campus</a>, I was building decentralized social platforms with community health in mind. There were many people like me who understood that creating a centralized place controlled by a single corporate entity for most of the world would get their information was incredibly problematic. It was and is antithetical to both the web and democracy itself.</p><p>So coders have been working on these problems, but this isn't really about software. Crucially, the people who have been at the receiving end of these harms have not been silent. Women - <a href="https://time.com/5482390/twitter-online-abuse-women-amnesty-international-study/">particularly women of color</a> - have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/15/opinion/gamergate-twitter.html">been sounding the alarm about these harms</a> for years. That we're listening to men who worked to build these systems of abuse, rather than the people who have been calling out the problems this whole time, says a lot about who and what we value. It's not a problem we can code our way out of.</p><p>These conversations are vital. But let's be clear: they have been happening this whole time. If they're new to you, you've been listening to the wrong people. And we should consider whether we want to allow the tech bros who created this problem to whitewash their past.</p>

They will remain to make sure nothing gets by as the fires tend to linger in the canyons below. They are our heroes and we owe them our existence.

  <p>This week I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/">released Datasette 0.49</a> and tinkered with datasette-seaborn, dogsheep-beta and polling data from FiveThirtyEight.</p>
 datasette-seaborn 
<p>Datasette currently has two key plugins for data visualization: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-vega">datasette-vega</a> for line, bar and scatter charts (powered by <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datsette-cluster-map</a> for creating clustered marker maps.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for other interesting visualization opportunities. Seaborn 0.11 <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/whatsnew.html">came out last week</a> and is a very exciting piece of software.</p>
<p>Seaborn focuses on statistical visualization tools - histograms, boxplots and the like - and represents 8 years of development lead by Michael Waskom. It's built on top of <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> and exhibits meticulously good taste.</p>
<p>So I've started building <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn">datasette-seaborn</a>, a plugin which provides an HTTP interface for generating Seaborn charts using data stored in Datasette.</p>
<p>It's still very alpha but early results are promising. I've chosen to implement it as a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">custom output renderer</a> - so adding <code>.seaborn</code> to any Datasette table (plus some querystring parameters) will output a rendered PNG chart of that data, just like how <code>.json</code> or <code>csv</code> give you that data in different export formats.</p>
<p>Here's an example chart generated by the plugin using the fabulous <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/">palmerpenguins</a> dataset (intended as a new alternative to <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris">Iris</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>I generated this image from the following URL:</p>
<p><code>https://datasette-seaborn-demo.datasette.io/penguins/penguins.seaborn?_size=1000&amp;_seaborn=kdeplot&amp;_seaborn_x=flipper_length_mm&amp;_seaborn_hue=species&amp;_seaborn_multiple=stack</code></p>
<p>This interface should be considered unstable and likely to change, but it illustrates the key idea behind the plugin: use <code>?_seaborn_x</code> parameters to feed in options for the chart that you want to render.</p>
<p>The two biggest issues with the plugin right now are that it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn/issues/4">renders images on the main thread</a>, potentially blocking the event loop, and it passes querystring arguments directly to seaborn <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-seaborn/issues/3">without first validating them</a> which is almost certainly a security problem.</p>
<p>So very much an alpha, but it's a promising start!</p>
 dogsheep-beta 
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta">Dogsheep Beta</a> provides faceted search across my personal data from a whole variety of different sources.</p>
<p>I demo'd it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQCD3Qxxik">at PyCon AU</a> a few weeks ago, and promised that a full write-up would follow. I still need to honour that promise! I'm figuring out how to provide a good interactive demo at the moment that doesn't expose my personal data.</p>
<p>I added sort by date in addition to sort by relevance in <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-beta/releases/tag/0.7">version 0.7</a> this week.</p>
 fivethirtyeight-polls 
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtEight</a> have long published the data behind their stories in their <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data">fivethirtyeight/data</a> GitHub repository, and I've been using that data to power <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/">a Datasette demo</a> ever since I first released the project.</p>
<p>They run an index of their data projects at <a href="https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/">data.fivethirtyeight.com</a>, and this week I noticed that they list US election polling data there that wasn't being picked up by my <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/">fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com</a> site.</p>
<p>It turns out this is listed in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls">as a README.md file</a> but without the actual CSV data. Instead, the README links to external CSV files with URLs like <code>https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls-page/president_primary_polls.csv</code></p>
<p>It looks to me like they're running their own custom web application which provides the CSV data as an export format, rather than keeping that CSV data directly in their GitHub repository.</p>
<p>This makes sense - I imagine they run a lot of custom code to help them manage their data - but does mean that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-datasette">my Datasette publishing scripts</a> weren't catching their polling data.</p>
<p>Since they release their data as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International I decided to start archiving it on GitHub, where it would be easier to automate.</p>
<p>I set up <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls">simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls</a> to do just that. It's a classic implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping pattern</a>: it runs <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml">a workflow script</a> four times a day which fetches their latest CSV files and commits them to a repo. This means I now have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/fivethirtyeight-polls/commits/main">commit history</a> of changes they have made to their polling data!</p>
<p>I updated my FiveThirtyEight Datasette script to publish that data as a new <code>polls.db</code> database, which is now being served at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/polls">fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/polls</a>.</p>
<p>And since that Datasette instance runs the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin, you can now use GraphQL to explore FiveThirtyEight's most recent polling data at <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls">https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls</a> - here's an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.datasettes.com/graphql/polls?query=%7B%0A%20%20generic_ballot_polls(filter%3A%7Bpollster_rating_name%3A%7Beq%3A%22YouGov%22%7D%7D)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20totalCount%0A%20%20%20%20nodes%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsor_ids%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsors%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20partisan%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20display_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_rating_name%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20fte_grade%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20population%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20population_full%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20methodology%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20office_type%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20start_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20end_date%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20tracking%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20created_at%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20notes%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20url%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20stage%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20dem%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20rep%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20ind%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20question_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20poll_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20cycle%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20state%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20pollster_rating_id%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sample_size%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20seat_number%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20sponsor_candidate%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20nationwide_batch%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20rowid%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D%0A">example query</a>.</p>
 github-to-sqlite get 
<p><a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite">github-to-sqlite</a> lets you fetch data from the GitHub API and write it into a SQLite database.</p>
<p>This week I <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite/issues/50">added a sub-command</a> for hitting the API directly and getting back data on the console, inspired by the <code>fetch</code> subcommand in <code>twitter-to-sqlite</code>. This is useful for trying out new APIs, since it both takes into account your GitHub authentication credentials (from an environment variable or an <code>auth.json</code> file) and can handle <code>Link</code> header pagination.</p>
<p>This example fetches all of my repos, paginating across multiple API requests:</p>
 <code>github-to-sqlite get /users/simonw/repos --paginate
</code> 
<p>You can use the <code>--nl</code> option to get back the results as newline-delimited JSON. This makes it easy to pipe them directly into <code>sqlite-utils</code> like this:</p>
 <code>github-to-sqlite get /users/simonw/repos --paginate --nl \
  | sqlite-utils insert simonw.db repos - --nl
</code> 
<p>See <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli.html#inserting-json-data">Inserting JSON data</a> in the <code>sqlite-utils</code> documentation for an explanation of what this is doing.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>In my never-ending quest to come up with super-simple models I came up with this diagram. This post is a slight editorial refactoring of my recent Twitter thread found&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trbouma/status/1305852608087756802?s=20">here</a>.</p>A simple ecosystem model<p>The above illustration is not intended to be an architectural diagram — rather, it helps to 1) clarify conflations, 2) help define scope (the dotted box) and 3) understand motivations — of the parties that exist ‘outside of the&nbsp;system’</p><p>For example, ‘Issuer” usually gets conflated with ‘Authority’ — an authority merely ‘Attests’ — if you recognize it, then you can assume it is authoritative.</p><p>Anyone can attest to anything and issue something. The point of this model is that everything inside the box is neutral to that and solely focused on specific properties everyone needs regardless of intent or&nbsp;role.</p><p>The “Verifier” usually gets conflated with Relying Party. But a Verifier could be an off-the-shelf black box with the firmware baked in to verify against the right DIDs, challenging the holder with Bluetooth or NFC. The “Acceptor” could be logic that simply throws a switch to open a secure door. All done on behalf of a Relying&nbsp;Party.</p><p>The Holder can be anyone outside the system. An individual, organization or device, that is the ultimate ‘holder’ of secrets or cryptographic keys that is the basis of their power to convey intention.</p><p>Finally, the Registrar, is anyone or anything that is responsible for integrity of the ledger (doesn’t have to be blockchain). This ledger is responsible for two fundamental interactions: validation and transfer. In the case of a permissionless system, the ‘Registrar’ is actually an agreed-on set of rules, and proven (or not yet disproven) cryptographic primitives. For permissioned, or centralized systems, it could be a group of people, or even a single person in the back room with an Excel spreadsheet (not blockchain).</p><p>As for the dotted box — you need to determine who/what sits inside or outside of the box. For many outside the box, they may only care about a black box that they trust. This dotted box is also useful when you start thinking about the non-functional properties of the system — black or grey, should it be permissioned, permissionless, restricted access, globally available?</p><p>In the end, what I am trying to achieve is the expression of a simple conceptual model to help me express what could serve the wide range of use cases e.g.: opening a door, applying for university, letting someone across the border, etc. The model could also be used to express simply what we need to start building as a new digital infrastructure.</p><p>As always, this is a work-in-progress. Constructive comments&nbsp;welcome.</p>

   Array programming with NumPy - the NumPy paper 
 The NumPy paper is out, published in Nature.

  <p><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49">Datasette 0.49</a> is out. Some notes on what's new.</p>
 API for writable canned queries 
<blockquote>
<p>Writable canned queries now expose a JSON API, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/sql_queries.html#canned-queries-json-api">JSON API for writable canned queries</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/880">#880</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">about writable canned queries</a> when they were introduced in Datasette 0.44 back in June. They provide a mechanism for defining a canned SQL query which can make writes (inserts, updates or deletes) to the underlying SQLite database. They can be protected by <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/authentication.html">Datasette authentication</a> or you can leave them open - for example if you want unauthenticated users to be able to post comments or leave feedback messages.</p>
<p>The missing feature was API support. Datasette 0.49 adds that, so now you can define a canned query that writes to the database and then call it as a JSON API - either without authentication or protected by a mechanism such as that provided by the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-auth-tokens">datasette-auth-tokens</a> plugin.</p>
<p>This feature works with <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">magic parameters</a>, so you can define an API that accepts API traffic and automatically logs things like the incoming IP address. Here's a canned query defined in a <code>metadata.yml</code> file that logs user agent and IP addresses:</p>
  databases:
  logs:
    queries:
      log:
        sql: |-
          INSERT INTO logs (
            user_agent, datetime
          ) VALUES (
            :_header_user_agent, :_now_datetime_utc
          )
        write: true  
<p>Create a SQLite database file called <code>logs.db</code> with the correct table like this:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite-utils create-table logs.db logs id integer user_agent text datetime text --pk=id
</code> 
<p>Confirm the created schema with:</p>
 <code>$ sqlite3 logs.db .schema
CREATE TABLE [logs] (
   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   [user_agent] TEXT,
   [datetime] TEXT
);
</code> 
<p>Now start Datasette like so:</p>
 <code>$ datasette logs.db -m metadata.yml
</code> 
<p>And visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log</code>. You can click the "Run SQL" button there to insert a new log row, which you can then view at <code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/logs</code>.</p>
<p>Next, the API. You can request a JSON response by adding <code>?_json=1</code> to the URL, so try this with <code>curl</code>:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log?_json=1'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}
</code> 
<p>You can also set the <code>Accept: application/json</code> header on your request, like so:</p>
 <code>$ curl -XPOST 'http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log' -H 'Accept: application/json'
{"ok": true, "message": "Query executed, 1 row affected", "redirect": null}                                                             ~ % 
</code> 
<p>Or by passing <code>_json=1</code> as part of a POST submission. Let's try that using <code>requests</code>:</p>
 <code>$ ipython
In [1]: import requests
In [2]: requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8001/logs/log", data={"_json": "1"}).json()
Out[2]: {'ok': True, 'message': 'Query executed, 1 row affected', 'redirect': None}
</code> 
 Path parameters for custom page templates 
<blockquote>
<p>New mechanism for defining page templates with custom path parameters - a template file called <code>pages/about/{slug}.html</code> will be used to render any requests to <code>/about/something</code>. See <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-parameters">Path parameters for pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/944">#944</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added custom page support in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html?highlight=pages#v0-41">Datasette 0.41</a> back in May, based on the needs of my <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/">Niche Museums</a> site. I wanted an easy way to create things like an <code>/about</code> page that returned content from a custom template.</p>
<p>Custom page templates work as a fallback for Datasette 404s. If <code>/about</code> fails to resolve and Datasette was provided a <code>--template-dir</code> on startup, Datasette will check to see if a template exists called <code>templates/pages/about.html</code>.</p>
<p>Datasette 0.49 adds support for <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#path-parameters-for-pages">path parameters</a>, partially inspired by cookiecutter (which showed me that it's OK to create files with curly braces in their name). You can now create templates with <code>{slug}</code> style wildcards as part of their filenames, and Datasette will route matching requests to that template.</p>
<p>I shipped a new release of Niche Museums today that takes advantage of that feature. I wanted neater URLs for museum pages - to shift from <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/browse/museums/101</a> to <a href="https://www.niche-museums.com/101">https://www.niche-museums.com/101</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how it works. I have a template file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/museums/blob/master/templates/pages/%7Bid%7D.html">templates/pages/{id}.html</a>. That template takes advantage of the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-template-sql">datasette-template-sql</a> plugin, which adds a <code>sql()</code> function that can be called within the template. It starts like this:</p>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
{% set rows = sql("select * from museums where id = :id", {"id": id}) %}
{% if not rows %}
    {{ raise_404("Museum not found") }}
{% endif %}
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    {% set museum = rows[0] %}
    ... rest of the template here ...  
<p>Datasette made the variable <code>id</code> available to the context having captured it from the <code>{id}.html</code> template matching the incoming URL.</p>
<p>I then use the <code>sql()</code> function to execute a query, passing in <code>id</code> as a query parameter.</p>
<p>If there are no matches, I call the brand new <code>raise_404()</code> template function which cancels the rendering of this template and falls back to Datasette's default 404 handling.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I set the <code>museum</code> variable to <code>rows[0]</code> and continue rendering the page.</p>
<p>I've basically reinvented PHP and ColdFusion in my custom 404 handler. Hooray!</p>
 A few other notable changes 
<blockquote>
<p><code>register_output_renderer()</code> render functions can now return a <code>Response</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/953">#953</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/plugin_hooks.html#register-output-renderer-datasette">register_output_renderer() plugin hook</a> was designed before Datasette had a <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#response-class">documented Response class</a>. It asked your plugin to return a custom <code>{"content_type": "...", "body": "...", "status_code": 200, "headers": {}}</code> dictionary.</p>
<p>You can now return a <code>Response</code> instead, and I plan to remove the dictionary version before Datasette 1.0. I released new versions of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-ics">datasette-ics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-atom">datasette-atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-copyable">datasette-copyable</a> and the new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-yaml">datasette-yaml</a> that use the new return format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>--upgrade</code> option for <code>datasette install</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/945">#945</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the <code>datasette install datasette-cluster-map</code> command as a thin wrapper around <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<p>This means you can install new plugins without first figuring out which virtual environment your Datasette is running out - particularly useful if you install Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/installation.html#using-homebrew">using Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>I then realized that this could be used to upgrade Datasette itself - but only if you could run <code>pip install -U</code>. So now <code>datasette install -U datasette</code> will upgrade Datasette in place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>datasette --pdb</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/962">#962</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is useful if you are working on Datasette itself, or a Datasette plugin. Pass the <code>--pdb</code> option and Datasette will start an interactive Python debugger session any time it hits an exception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datasette --get</code> exit code now reflects the internal HTTP status code. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/947">#947</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm excited about the pattern of using <code>datasette --get</code> for running simple soundness checks, e.g. as part of a CI suite. Now that the exit code reflects the status code for the page you can write test scripts that look like this:</p>
 <code># Fail if homepage returns 404 or 500
datasette . --get /
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>New <code>raise_404()</code> template function for returning 404 errors. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/964">#964</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demonstrated in the Niche Museums example above.</p>
<p>And the rest:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 
<code>datasette publish heroku</code> now deploys using Python 3.8.5 
 Upgraded <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> to 5.57.0. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/948">#948</a>) 
 Upgraded code style to Black 20.8b1. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/958">#958</a>) 
 Fixed bug where selected facets were not correctly persisted in hidden form fields on the table page. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/963">#963</a>) 
 Renamed the default error template from <code>500.html</code> to <code>error.html</code>. 
 Custom error pages are now documented, see <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/custom_templates.html#custom-pages-errors">Custom error pages</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/965">#965</a>) 
 
</blockquote>
<p>In writing up these annotated release notes I spotted <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/967">a bug</a> with writable canned queries, which I have now fixed in <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-49-1">Datasette 0.49.1</a>.</p>

<p>Sophie Zhang worked as the data scientist for the Facebook Site Integrity fake engagement team. She gave up her severance package in order to speak out internally about what she saw there, and someone leaked her memo to BuzzFeed News. It's a hell of a story: she saw bots and coordinated manual accounts used to influence politics in countries all around the world, and found herself constantly making moderation decisions that had lasting political impact. “With no oversight whatsoever, I was left in a situation where I was trusted with immense influence in my spare time". This sounds like a nightmare - imagine taking on responsibility for protecting democracy in so many different places.</p>

Adding an ecosystem of badges (to show off skills and accomplishments) to the recognition landscape helps to replace prizes as a central feature of open science. Since prizes celebrate brilliant work, and as celebrations as a whole add positive affect to your culture, let the prizes continue. But give them some new thought. What is your idea for Nobel 2.0?

   I'm delighted to say that
Spritely Goblins
v0.7
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
CapTP support
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),

<p>I'm delighted to say that
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/">Spritely Goblins</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins/-/tree/v0.7">v0.7</a>
has been released!
This is the first release featuring
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/captp.html">CapTP support</a>
(ie, "capability-secure distributed/networked programming support"),
which is a huge milestone for the project!</p>
<p>Okay, caveat... there are still some things missing from the CapTP
stuff so far; you can only set up a bidirectional connection between
two machines, and can't "introduce" capabilities to other machines
on the network.
Also setting up connections is an extremely manual process.
Both of those should be improved in the next release.</p>
<p>But still!
Goblins can now be used to easily write distributed programs!
And Goblins' CapTP code even includes such wild features as
distributed garbage collection!</p>
<p>As an example
(also mentioned in a <a>recent blogpost</a>),
I recently wrote a short
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat">chat program demo</a>.
Both the client and server "protocol" code were
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/chat-backend.rkt">less than 250 lines of code</a>,
despite having such features as authenticating users during
subscription to the chatroom and verifying that messages claimed by
the chatroom came from the users it said it did.
(The <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">GUI code</a>,
by contrast, was a little less than 300 lines.)
I wrote this up without writing any network code at all and then
tested hooking together two clients over Tor Onion Services using
Goblins' CapTP support, and it Just Worked (TM):</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's interesting here is that
not a single line of code was added to the backend or GUI to accomodate networking;
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-server.rkt">host</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/master/onion-gui-client.rkt">guest</a>
modules merely imported the backend and GUI files completely unchanged and
did the network wiring there.
Yes, that's what it sounds like: in Goblins you can write distributed
asynchronous programs </p>
<p>This is the really significant part of Goblins that's starting to
become apparent, and it's all thanks to the brilliant design of
<a href="http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html">CapTP</a>.
Goblins continues to stand on the shoulders of giants; thank you to
everyone in the ocap community, but especially in this case
Michael FIG, Mark S. Miller, Kevin Reid, and Baldur Jóhannsson, all of
whom answered an enormous amount of questions (some of them very
silly) about CapTP.</p>
<p>There are more people to thank too (too many to list here), and you
can see some of them in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I">monster thread on the captp mailing list</a>
which started on May 18th (!!!) as I went through my journey of trying
to understand and eventually implement CapTP.
I actually started preparing a few weeks before which really means that
this journey took me about four and a half months to understand and
implement.
As it turns out, CapTP is a surprisingly simple protocol protocol
in its coneptualization once you understand what it's doing (though
implementing it is a bit more complex).
I do hope to try to build a guide for others to understand and
implement on their own systems... but that will probably wait until
Goblins is ported to another language (due to the realative simplicity
of the task due to the language similarities, the current plan is to
port to Guile next).</p>
<p>Anyway.
This is a big deal, a truly exciting moment for goblinkind.
If you're excited yourself, maybe join the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#spritely channel on irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>
<p>OH!
And also, I can't believe I nearly forgot to say this, but if you want
to hear more about Spritely in general (not just Goblins), we just
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/episodes/9-what-is-spritely.html">released a Spritely-centric episode of FOSS and Crafts</a>.
Maybe take a listen!</p>

  <p>I spent some time this week digging into Python's sqlite3 internals. I also gave two talks and recorded a third, due to air at PyGotham in October.</p>
 sqlite-dump and datasette-backup 
<p>I'm running an increasing number of Datasette instances with mutable database files - databases that are updated through a variety of different mechanisms. So I need to start thinking about backups.</p>
<p>Prior to this most of my database files had been relatively disposable: they're built from other sources of data (often by scheduled GitHub Actions) so backups weren't necessary since I could always rebuild them from their point of truth.</p>
<p>Creating a straight copy of a SQLite database file isn't enough for robust backups, because the file may be accepting writes while you are creating the copy.</p>
<p>SQLite has various mechanisms for backups. There's an <a href="https://sqlite.org/backup.html">online backup API</a> and more recent SQLite versions support a <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html#vacuuminto">VACUUM INTO</a> command which also optimizes the backed up database.</p>
<p>I figured it would be useful to expose this functionality by a Datasette plugin - one that could allow automated backups to be directly fetched from Datasette over HTTPS. So I started work on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a>.</p>
<p>For the first backup mode, I decided to take advantage of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.iterdump">connection.iterdump()</a> method that's built into Python's sqlite3 module. This method is an iterator that outputs plain text SQL that can recreate a database. Crucially it's a streaming-compatible mechanism - unlike <code>VACUUM INTO</code> which would require me to create a temporary file the same as the database I was backing up.</p>
<p>I started experimenting with it, and ran into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup/issues/5">a big problem</a>. I make extensive use of SQLite full-text search, but the <code>.sql</code> dumps generated by <code>.iterdump()</code> break with constraint errors if they include any FTS tables.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging I came across <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blame/v3.8.5/Lib/sqlite3/dump.py#L38-L45">a 13 year old comment about this</a> in the cPython source code itself!</p>
<p>The implementation for <code>.iterdump()</code> turns out to be entirely in Python, and way less complicated than I had expected. So I decided to see if I could get FTS table exports working.</p>
<p>In a classic case of yak shaving, I decided to create a Python library called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-dump">sqlite-dump</a> to solve this problem. And since my existing cookiecutter templates only cover <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-plugin">Datasette Plugins</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simonw/click-app">Click apps</a> I first needed to create a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/python-lib">python-lib</a> template in order to create the library I needed for my plugin.</p>
<p>I got it working! Install the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-backup">datasette-backup</a> plugin on any Datasette instance to get a <code>/-/backup/name-of-database.sql</code> URL that will produce a streaming SQL dump of any attached database.</p>
 A weird bug with SQLite FTS and triggers 
<p>While working on <code>datasette-backup</code> I noticed a weird issue with some of my SQLite full-text search enabled databases: they kept getting bigger. Way bigger than I would expect them to.</p>
<p>I eventually noticed that the <code>licenses_fts</code> table in my <a href="https://github-to-sqlite.dogsheep.net/">github-to-sqlite demo database</a> had 7 rows in it, but the accompanying <code>licenses_fts_docsize</code> table had 9,141. I would expect it to only have 7 as well.</p>
<p>I was stumped as to what was going on, so I <a href="https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/e05a261524">turned to the official SQLite forum</a>. I only recently discovered how useful this is as a resource. Dan Kennedy, one of the three core SQLite maintainers, replied within an hour and gave me some useful hints. The root cause turned out to be the way SQLite triggers work: by default, SQLite runs in <code>recursive_triggers=off</code> mode (for backwards compatibility with older databases). This means that an <code>INSERT OR REPLACE</code> update to a table that is backed by full-text search may not correctly trigger the updates needed on the FTS table itself.</p>
<p>Since there doesn't appear to be any disadvantage to running with <code>recursive_triggers=on</code> I've now set that as the default for <code>sqlite-utils</code>, as-of <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-17">version 2.17</a>.</p>
<p>I then added a <code>sqlite-utils rebuild-fts data.db</code> command in <a href="https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-18">version 2.18</a> which can rebuild the FTS tables in a database and fix the <code>_fts_docsize</code> problem.</p>
 Talks 
<p>I presented Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette at PyCon AU last week. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQCD3Qxxik">video is here</a> and includes my first public demo of <a href="https://github.com/dogsheep/beta">Dogsheep Beta</a>, my new combined search engine for personal analytics data imported using my <a href="https://dogsheep.github.io/">Dogsheep</a> family of tools. I took questions in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0sH954Iv83sctmB_sfHJg2zZMYZGhY_n2s38yOCpOU/edit#heading=h.b1b8d2228j9">this Google Doc</a>, and filled out more detailed answers after the talk.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at PyRVA a couple of days called Rapid data analysis with SQLite and Datasette. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U3RyzxTKtQ">the video</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1clxqE0xCqPw5baFLGKOr29iur1sV9ruMj8MNW-Xlzpo/edit">Google Doc</a> for that one.</p>
<p>I also pre-recorded my talk for PyGotham: <a href="https://2020.pygotham.tv/talks/datasette-an-ecosystem-of-tools-for-working-with-small-data/">Datasette - an ecosystem of tools for working with Small Data</a>. The conference is in the first week of October and I'll be hanging out there during the talk answering questions and chatting about the project, safe from the stress of also having to present it live!</p>

<p>The white mess in the image above is the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7152/">Bobcat Fire</a>, spreading now in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, against which Los Angeles’ suburban sprawl (that’s it, on the right) reaches its limits of advance to the north. It makes no sense to build very far up or into these mountains, for two good reasons. One is fire, which happens often and awfully. The other is that the mountains are geologically new, and falling down almost as fast as they are rising up. At the mouths of valleys emptying into the sprawl are vast empty reservoirs—catch basins—ready to be filled with rocks, soil and mud “downwasting,” as geologists say, from a range as big as the Smokies, twice as high, ready to burn and shed.</p>
<p>Outside of its northern rain forests and snow-capped mountains, California has just two seasons: fire and rain. Right now we’re in the midst of fire season. Rain is called Winter, and it has been dry since the last one. If the Bobcat fire burns down to the edge of Monrovia, or Altadena, or any of the towns at the base of the mountains, heavy winter rains will cause downwasting in a form&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee">John McPhee</a> describes in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i">Los Angeles Against the Mountains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The water was now spreading over the street. It descended in heavy sheets. As the young Genofiles and their mother glimpsed it in the all but total darkness, the scene was suddenly illuminated by a blue electrical flash. In the blue light they saw a massive blackness, moving. It was not a landslide, not a mudslide, not a rock avalanche; nor by any means was it the front of a conventional flood. In Jackie’s words, “It was just one big black thing coming at us, rolling, rolling with a lot of water in front of it, pushing the water, this big black thing. It was just one big black hill coming toward us.</p>
<p>In geology, it would be known as a debris flow. Debris flows amass in stream valleys and more or less resemble fresh concrete. They consist of water mixed with a good deal of solid material, most of which is above sand size. Some of it is Chevrolet size. Boulders bigger than cars ride long distances in debris flows. Boulders grouped like fish eggs pour downhill in debris flows. The dark material coming toward the Genofiles was not only full of boulders; it was so full of automobiles it was like bread dough mixed with raisins. On its way down Pine Cone Road, it plucked up cars from driveways and the street. When it crashed into the Genofiles’ house, the shattering of safety glass made terrific explosive sounds. A door burst open. Mud and boulders poured into the hall. We’re going to go, Jackie thought. Oh, my God, what a hell of a way for the four of us to die together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three rains ago we had debris flows in Montecito, the next zip code over from our home in Santa Barbara. I wrote about it in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/01/15/montecito/">Making sense of what happened to Montecito</a>. The flows, which destroyed much of the town and killed about two dozen people, were caused by heavy rains following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fire">Thomas Fire</a>, which at 281,893 acres was biggest fire in California history at the time. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_(2018)">Camp Fire</a>, a few months later, burned a bit less land but killed 85 people and destroyed more than 18,000 buildings, including whole towns. This year we already have two fires bigger than the Thomas, and at least three more growing fast enough to take the lead. You can see the whole updated list on the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/wildfires-map/">Los Angeles Times California Wildfires Map</a>.</p>
<p>For a good high-altitude picture of what’s going on, I recommend NASA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/">FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)</a>. It’s a highly interactive map that lets you mix input from satellite photographs and fire detection by orbiting&nbsp;<a href="https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/">MODIS</a> and <a href="https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/">VIIRS</a>&nbsp;systems. MODIS is onboard the <a href="https://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra</a> and <a href="https://aqua.nasa.gov/">Aqua</a> satellites; and VIIRS is onboard the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html">Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)</a> spacecraft. (It’s actually more complicated than that. If you’re interested, dig into those links.) Here’s how the FIRMS map shows the active West Coast fires and the smoke they’re producing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s a lot of cremated forest and wildlife right there.</p>
<p>I just put those two images and a bunch of others up on Flickr,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/albums/72157715920586418">here</a>. Most are of MODIS fire detections superimposed on 3-D Google Earth maps. The main thing I want to get across with these is how large and anomalous these fires are.</p>
<p>True: fire is essential to many of the West’s wild ecosystems. It’s no accident that the California state tree, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coast Redwood</a>, grows so tall and lives so long: it’s&nbsp;adapted to fire. (One can also make a case that the state flower, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia_californica">California Poppy</a>, which thrives amidst fresh rocks and soil, is adapted to earthquakes.) But what’s going on here is something much bigger. Explain it any way you like, including strange luck.</p>
<p>Whatever you conclude, it’s a hell of a show. And vice versa.</p>

   It is 11am and so dark that you cannot do anything without the lights on. The sky is
a color that is hard to describe. The photo does not do it justice. Perhaps the color
you would expect in a sci-fi movie on a doomed, collapsed, evil planet.o 
 And that is how it is in Sunnyvale, California, and probably many other places on

  <p>It is 11am and so dark that you cannot do anything without the lights on. The sky is
a color that is hard to describe. The photo does not do it justice. Perhaps the color
you would expect in a sci-fi movie on a doomed, collapsed, evil planet.o</p>
<p>And that is how it is in Sunnyvale, California, and probably many other places on

<p>I just got this email today:<br>
</p>
<p>Which tells me, from a sample of one (after another, after another) that Zoom is to video conferencing in 2020 what Microsoft Windows was to personal computing in 1999. Back then one business after another said they would only work with Windows and what was left of DOS: Microsoft’s two operating systems for PCs.</p>
<p>What saved the personal computing world from being absorbed into Microsoft was the Internet—and the Web, running on the Internet. The Internet, based on a profoundly generative protocol, supported all kinds of hardware and software at an infinitude of end points. And the Web, based on an equally generative protocol, manifested on browsers that ran on Mac and Linux computers, as well as Windows ones.</p>
<p>But video conferencing is different. Yes, all the popular video conferencing systems run in apps that work on multiple operating systems, and on the two main mobile device OSes as well. And yes, they are substitutable. You don’t have to use Zoom (unless, in cases like mine, where talking to my doctors requires it). There’s still Skype, Webex, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and the rest.</p>
<p>But all of them have a critical dependency through their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codecs</a>. Those are the ways they code and decode audio and video.&nbsp;While there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_codecs">some open source codecs</a>, all the systems I just named use&nbsp;proprietary (patent-based) codecs. The big winner among those is&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">H.264, aka AVC-1</a>, which Wikipedia says “is by far the most commonly used format for the recording, compression, and distribution of video content, used by 91% of video industry developers as of September 2019.” Also,</p>
<blockquote><p>H.264 is perhaps best known as being the most commonly used video encoding format on&nbsp;<a title="Blu-ray Disc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc">Blu-ray Discs</a>. It is also widely used by streaming Internet sources, such as videos from&nbsp;<a title="Netflix" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix">Netflix</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Hulu" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Prime Video" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Video">Prime Video</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Vimeo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo">Vimeo</a>,&nbsp;<a title="YouTube" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</a>, and the&nbsp;<a title="ITunes Store" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Store">iTunes Store</a>, Web software such as the&nbsp;<a title="Adobe Flash Player" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player">Adobe Flash Player</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Microsoft Silverlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Microsoft Silverlight</a>, and also various&nbsp;<a title="HDTV" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV">HDTV</a>&nbsp;broadcasts over terrestrial (<a title="Advanced Television Systems Committee standards" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Television_Systems_Committee_standards">ATSC</a>,&nbsp;<a title="ISDB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDB-T">ISDB-T</a>,&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a title="DVB-T2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T2">DVB-T2</a>), cable (<a title="DVB-C" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-C">DVB-C</a>), and satellite (<a title="DVB-S" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S">DVB-S</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="DVB-S2" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-S2">DVB-S2</a>) systems.</p>
<p>H.264 is protected by&nbsp;<a title="Patent" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent">patents</a>&nbsp;owned by various parties.

<p>The commercial use of patented H.264 technologies requires the payment of royalties to MPEG LA and other patent owners.

<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generativity">generative</a>, clearly, but <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/9385626/Zittrain_Generative%20Internet.pdf?sequence=1">not as generative</a> as the Internet and the Web, which are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end</a>&nbsp;by design. .</p>
<p>More importantly, AVC-1 in effect slides the Internet and the Web into the orbit of companies that have taken over what used to be telephony and television, which are now mooshed together. In the Columbia Doctors example, Zoom the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_telephone_system">PBX</a>. The new classroom is every teacher and kid on her or his own rectangle, “zooming” with each other through the new telephony. The new TV is Netflix, Disney, Comcast, Spectrum, Apple, Amazon and many others, all competing for wedges our Internet access and entertainment budgets.</p>
<p>In this new ecosystem, you are less the producer than you were, or would have been, in the early days of the Net and the Web. You are the end user, the consumer, the audience, the customer. Not the producer, the performer. Sure, you can audition for those roles, and play them on YouTube and TikTok, but those are somebody else’s walled gardens. You operate within them at their grace. You are not truly free.</p>
<p>And maybe none of us ever were, in those early days of the Net and the Web. But it sure seemed that way. And it&nbsp;does seem that we have lost something.</p>
<p>Or maybe just that we are slowly losing it, in the manner of boiling frogs.</p>
<p>Do we have to? I mean, it’s still early.</p>
<p>The digital world is how old? Decades, at most.</p>
<p>And how long will it last? At the very least, more than that. Centuries or millennia, probably.</p>
<p>So there’s hope.</p>

<p>This past July, we replaced our roof and at the same time updated our <a href="https://altmode.org/2009/06/14/photovoltaic-part-3-results/">solar panels and inverter</a> (I’ll write about the new solar equipment in the near future). I was monitoring the new equipment somewhat more closely than usual, and noticed on one warm August day that the inverter had shut down due to low line voltage. Having home solar generation shut down on a warm day with a high air conditioning load is the opposite of what the utility, <a href="https://www.pge.com">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</a> (PG&amp;E), should want to happen. In addition to shutting down solar power inverters, low line voltage can be hard on power equipment, such as motors.</p>



<p>At a time when our voltage was particularly low, I opened a low line voltage case with PG&amp;E. This resulted in a call from a field technician that told me several things:</p>



  PG&amp;E has been aware of the voltage regulation problem in my neighborhood for some time  The problem is likely to be due to the older 4-kilovolt service in my part of town. Newer areas have 12-kilovolt service that would be expected to have about 1/9 the voltage drop with an equivalent load.  Another possible cause is the pole transformer that feeds our house and nearby neighbors that the technician told me is overloaded. [Other neighbors that aren’t as close are reporting these problems as well, so they would have to have similarly overloaded transformers.]  Line voltage at my home is supposed to be between 114 and 126 VAC.  



<p>Another technician from PG&amp;E came out a couple of days later to install a voltage monitor on the line. But it occurred to me that I have been collecting data since 2007 from my solar inverter that includes voltage data. A total of about 3.2 million data points. So I thought I’d check to see what I can find out from that.</p>



<p>My data are in a MySQL database that I can query easily. So asked it how many days there have been where the line voltage went below 110 VAC (giving PG&amp;E some margin here) and the solar inverter was fully operating. There were 37 such days, including very brief voltage dips (&lt;10 minutes) up to over 5 hours undervoltage on September 2, 2017. The line voltage that day looked like this:</p>







<p>A more recent representative sample is this:</p>







<p>Part of my concern is that this problem seems to be getting worse. Here is a table of the number days where &lt;110 VAC lasted for more than 10 minutes:</p>



YearDays with<br>UndervoltageUndervoltage<br>Minutes2007002008002009114201000201100201200201300201400201511920161102017141386201800201975612020 (to June 30)2160



<p>And as I mentioned above, the problem seems to occur on particularly hot days (which is when others run their air conditioners; we don’t have air conditioning). Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/">NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information</a> provide good historical data on high and low temperatures. I was able to download the data for Los Altos and relate it to the days with the outages. Indeed, the days with the most serious voltage problems are very warm (high of 110 on 9/2/2017 and 100 degrees on 6/3/2020 shown above).</p>



<p>Does that mean we’re seeing purely a temperature effect that is happening more often due to global warming? It doesn’t seem likely because there have been very warm days in past years with little voltage drop. Here’s a day with a recorded high temperature of 108 in 2009:</p>







<p>My street, and the <a href="https://losaltosca.gov">City of Los Altos</a> more generally, has seen a lot of extensive home renovations and tear-down/rebuilds the past few years. The section of the street I live on, which has about 50 homes, currently has three homes being completely rebuilt and currently unoccupied. So this is only going to get worse.</p>



<p>The ongoing renovations and rebuilds in Los Altos are all considerably larger than the homes (built in the 1950s) that they replace, and I expect nearly all have air conditioning while the original homes didn’t. This is resulting in a considerably higher electrical load on infrastructure that wasn’t designed for this. While this is mitigated somewhat by the prevalence of solar panels in our area, the City needs to require that PG&amp;E upgrade its infrastructure before issuing new building permits that will exacerbate this problem.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we'll use a Raspberry Pi to build an RTMP server that plays out any video stream it receives over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port automatically. This effectively turns a Raspberry Pi into a Blackmagic Streaming Bridge.</p>

<p>You can use this to stream from OBS or an ATEM Mini across your local network or the internet, and convert that to an HDMI signal in your studio to mix with other HDMI sources locally.</p>



 Parts 

<p>Here's a list of all the parts you'll need for this.</p>

<p>Of course, you'll need a <a href="https://geni.us/APX4YZa">Raspberry Pi</a>. It doesn't need a ton of RAM, I got one with 4GB but it would probably work fine with 2GB as well. I prefer to buy the parts individually rather than the full kits, but either way is fine. If you get the bare Raspberry Pi you'll need to make sure to get a good quality power supply like <a href="https://geni.us/qDB8E">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I have tested this on a Raspberry Pi 3, and it does work, but there's much more of a delay, so I definitely recommend doing this with a Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p>

<p>Get a good quality SD card for the Pi. We won't be doing anything super disk intensive, but it will generally perform a lot better with an SD Card with an "A1" or "A2" rating. You don't need much disk space, 16gb, 32gb or 64gb cards are all good options. The "A1" or "A2" ratings mean the card is optimized for running applications rather than storing photos or videos. I like the Sandisk cards, either the <a href="https://geni.us/d3F5G4n">32gb A1</a> or the slightly faster <a href="https://geni.us/LOabG">64gb A2</a>.</p>

<p>You'll need a case for the Pi as well. I like <a href="https://geni.us/yu4Y">this one</a> which is also a giant heat sink so that it's completely silent.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 has a Micro HDMI port rather than a full size, so you'll need a cable to plug that in to a regular size HDMI port like <a href="https://geni.us/s3rIb2">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your Raspberry Pi and whatever device you're streaming from connected via a wired network. While this will probably work over wifi, I wouldn't count on wifi to be reliable or fast for this.</p>

 Prepare the Raspberry Pi SD Card 

<p>First, head over to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">raspberrypi.org/downloads</a> to download the Raspberry Pi Imager app. This app makes it super easy to create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When you choose the operating system to install, select "Other"</p>

<p></p>

<p>then choose "Lite"</p>

<p></p>

<p>We don't need a desktop environment for this so it will be easier to use the command line.</p>

<p>Go ahead and write this to the SD card, then take out the SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

 Configure the OS 

<p>The first time you boot it up it will take a few seconds and then it will prompt you to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in using the default username and password. Enter the username "pi", and then type the password "raspberry". You won't see the password as you're typing it.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to change the password to something else, so go ahead and do that now. Type:</p>

 <code>sudo raspi-config
</code> 

<p>and choose the first option in the menu by pressing "Enter". When you type the new password, you won't see it on the screen, but it will ask you to type it twice to confirm. Press "tab" twice to select "Finish" to close out of this menu.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next we need to configure the video mode so we know what kind of signal the Raspberry Pi will be sending on the HDMI port. You'll need to edit a text file to make these changes.</p>

 <code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code> 

<p>This will launch a text editor to edit this file. We need to change the following things in the file. These may be commented out with a <code>#</code> so you can delete that character to uncomment the line and make the necessary changes. These options are documented <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/video.md">here</a>.</p>

 <code># Make sure the image fits the whole screen
disable_overscan=1

# Set HDMI output mode to Consumer Electronics Association mode
hdmi_group=1

# Enable audio over HDMI
hdmi_drive=2

# Set the output resolution and frame rate to your desired option

# 1920x1080 60fps
hdmi_mode=16 

# 1920x1080 25fps
hdmi_mode=33

# 1920x1080 30fps
hdmi_mode=34
</code> 

<p>To save your changes, press Ctrl+X and then "Y" to confirm, then "Enter". At this point we need to reboot to make the changes take effect, so type:</p>

 <code>sudo reboot
</code> 

<p>and wait a few seconds for it to reboot.</p>

 Install and Configure Software 

<p>We'll be using nginx with the RTMP module as the RTMP server, and then connect omxplayer to play out the stream over the HDMI port.</p>

<p>Install the necessary software by typing:</p>

 <code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install omxplayer nginx libnginx-mod-rtmp
</code> 

<p>We need to give nginx permission to use the video port, so do that with the following command:</p>

 <code>sudo usermod -aG video www-data
</code> 

<p>Now we need to set up an RTMP server in nginx. Edit the main nginx config file:</p>

 <code>sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code> 

<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and copy the below text into the config file:</p>

 <code>rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;

    application live {
      # Enable livestreaming
      live on;

      # Disable recording
      record off;

      # Allow only this machine to play back the stream
      allow play 127.0.0.1;
      deny play all;

      # Start omxplayer and play the stream out over HDMI
      exec omxplayer -o hdmi rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/$name;
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>The magic sauce here is the <code>exec</code> line that starts omxplayer. omxplayer is an application that can play an RTMP stream out over the Raspberry Pi's HDMI port. The <code>exec</code> line will run this command whenever a new RTMP stream is received. The stream key will be set to the <code>$name</code> variable. Note that this means any stream key will work, there is no access control the way we have it configured here. You can read up on the <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives">RTMP module</a> if you'd like to learn how to lock down access to only specific stream keys or if you want to enable recording the stream.</p>

<p>Save this file by pressing ctrl+X, then Y, then enter.</p>

<p>To test the config file for errors, type:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -t
</code> 

<p>If that worked, you can reload nginx to make your changes take effect:</p>

 <code>sudo nginx -s reload
</code> 

<p>At this point the Raspberry Pi is ready! You can now stream to this box and it will output the received stream over HDMI! Any stream key will work, and you can stream using any sort of device or software like OBS. You'll need to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi which you can do by typing</p>

 <code>hostname -I
</code> 

<p>To stream to the Raspberry Pi, use the RTMP URL: <code>rtmp://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/live</code> and anything as the stream key.</p>

 Setting up the ATEM Mini 

<p>We'll now walk through setting up an ATEM Mini Pro to stream to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>If you're familiar with customizing your ATEM Software's <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, you can add a new entry with the Raspberry Pi's IP address. But there is another way which I like better, which is to create a custom streaming file that you can send to a remote guest and they can add it in their Software Control app without needing to edit any XML.</p>

<p>Create a new XML file with the following contents. This is the contents of one of the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> blocks from the <code>Streaming.xml</code> file, wrapped with a <code>&lt;streaming&gt;</code> element.</p>

 <code>&lt;streaming&gt;
    &lt;service&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;servers&gt;
            &lt;server&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Primary&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;url&gt;rtmp://RASPBERRY_PI_IP/live&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;/server&gt;
        &lt;/servers&gt;
        &lt;profiles&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming High&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;9000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;6000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;
                &lt;name&gt;Streaming Low&lt;/name&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="60"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;4500000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
                &lt;config resolution="1080p" fps="30"&gt;
                    &lt;bitrate&gt;3000000&lt;/bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;audio-bitrate&gt;128000&lt;/audio-bitrate&gt;
                    &lt;keyframe-interval&gt;2&lt;/keyframe-interval&gt;
                &lt;/config&gt;
            &lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;/profiles&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;      
&lt;/streaming&gt;
</code> 

<p>Replace the IP address with your own, and you can customize the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> as well which will show up in the ATEM Software Control. Save this file with an <code>.xml</code> extension.</p>

<p>In the ATEM Software Control app, click "Stream" from the menu bar, choose "Load Streaming Settings", and select the XML file you created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will create a new option in the "Live Stream" section where you can stream to the Raspberry Pi instead of YouTube!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a streaming key now, it doesn't matter what you enter since there is no access control on the Raspberry Pi. Click "On Air" and in a few seconds you should see the image pop up on the Raspberry Pi!</p>

<p>Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) over the time has become a bit of an overloaded term. There are multiple articles, blogs, analyst reports explaining what CIAM is and defining it in different ways. The objective of this blog is to provide my perspective of CIAM in one-line definition.</p><p>Before defining what it is, let’s be clear on why we need to worry about&nbsp;CIAM.</p> Why CIAM? <p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. CIAM is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>The rest of the blog is based on the above statement. I believe that’s fair enough, and haven’t seen that been questioned much. We can safely assume that’s a well-accepted definition of the objective of CIAM. It might not be in the same words, but still, many who talk about CIAM, share a similar/closer view.</p> Gartner Definition <p>In one of it’s reports Gartner defines CIAM in a lighter way&nbsp;as,</p><p>In my view it’s not strong enough and does not carry enough depth to reach the objective of CIAM. CIAM is more than managing customer identities in a traditional way. It needs to be the facilitator to leverage identity data to catalyze business&nbsp;growth.</p> More CIAM Definitions <p>If you Google, you can find more definitions of CIAM. Not that all of them are wrong, but none of them IMO put enough weight on the objective of CIAM. Here I list few of them. Then again, these are different view points, and none of them are wrong or&nbsp;bad.</p> Customer-focused IAM <p>Rather calling CIAM, managing customer identities, I would like to call it customer-focused IAM. IAM is a well-defined term. As per&nbsp;Gartner,</p><p>The customer-focused IAM adds a lot of depth into the definition of IAM. For example, unlike traditional IAM, when you focus on customers, you probably start working with millions of impatient users, who get annoyed by filling lengthy forms, and cannot wait at least 2 seconds to log into a system. Even a small glitch in your system, they will take it to the social media and will make a big buzz. The slightest of leaked customer information could take a big slice of your share price&nbsp;down.</p><p>Yahoo!, for example, was in the middle of a series of data breaches a few years back, that exposed the PII data of more than 1 billion users. That did cost the company $350 million. They had to lower the sales price of its email and other digital services, which they sold to Verizon from $4.83 billion to $4.48 billion to account for the potential backlash from the data breaches.</p> Beyond Customer-focused IAM <p>Calling CIAM, the customer-focused IAM, still does not add enough weight on the emphasis that it should catalyze business growth. Unlike traditional IAM, a CIAM system should have the capability to integrate with customer relationship management (CRM) systems, marketing platforms, e-commerce platforms, content management systems (CMS), data management platforms and many more. A customer-focused IAM system, with no business integrations adds little value in terms of the business growth that we expect from having a CIAM solution.</p> What CIAM&nbsp;is? <p>Customer-focused IAM does not necessarily mean you only manage customer identities. That’s why I preferred customer-focused IAM instead of managing customer identities. In a typical CIAM solution in addition to direct customers, you also need to manage identities of employees who have direct access to the CIAM solution, or should integrate with an IAM system that manages employee identities. The latter is the preferred option. Also, not all the CIAM solutions are just B2C (business-to-consumer), it can also be B2B (business-to-business) or B2B2C (business-to-business-consumer) as&nbsp;well.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/what-is-customer-iam-ciam-9f3d74c9632a">What is Customer IAM (CIAM)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Just like the product, all these connectors too, are released under the open source Apache 2.0&nbsp;license.</p><p>Identity Server supports passwordless authentication with FIDO 2.0 — and mobile push based authentication with Duo and mePin. Also, we have partnered with Veridium and Aware biometrics to support biometric authentication. In addition to that Identity Server also supports RSA SecurID, TOTP, which you can use with the Google Authenticator mobile app, and then OTP over SMS and&nbsp;Email.</p><p>During a login flow, you can orchestrate between these authenticators by writing an adaptive authentication script in JavaScript. With that you can define how you want to authenticate a user based on environmental attributes (e.g: any HTTP header, geo-location), user attributes / roles (e.g: admins always log with MFA), user behaviors (e.g.: number of failed login attempts, geo-velocity), a risk score and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In the above video, I discuss a set of use cases and show you how you can apply adaptive authentication policies to address advanced authentication requirements.

<p>Transforming the customer experience is at the heart of digital transformation. Digital technologies are changing the game of customer interactions, with new rules and possibilities that were unimaginable only a few years back. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a whole emerging area in the IAM, which is essentially an ingredient for digital customer experience.</p><p>Today’s increasingly sophisticated consumers now view digital interactions as the primary mechanism for interacting with brands and, consequently, expect deeper online relationships delivered simply and unobtrusively. CIAM turns customer data into Gold! Scalability, Security &amp; Privacy, Usability, Extensibility, and APIs &amp; Integration are the five pillars of CIAM. The following video talks about these five pillars in&nbsp;detail.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/five-pillars-of-ciam-d5657a9e375b">Five Pillars of CIAM</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com">FACILELOGIN</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The other day I made a
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/104746037303599668">sadpost on the fediverse</a>
that said: "simultaneously regularly feel like people don't take the
directions I'm trying to push seriously enough and that I'm not worth
taking seriously".
(Similarly, I've also joked that "imposter syndrome and a Cassandra
complex are a hell of a combo" before.)
I got a number of replies from people, both publicly and privately, and
the general summary of most of them are, "We do care!  The stuff you're
working on seems really cool and valuable!  I'll admit that I don't
really know what it is you're talking about but it sounds important!"
(Okay, and I just re-read, and it was only a portion of it that even said
the latter part, but of course, what do I emphasize in my brain?)
That was nice to hear that people care and are enthusiastic, and I did
feel much better, but it did also kind of feel like confirmation that
I'm not getting through to people completely either.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred">jfred</a> made an
<a href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@jfred/104747234928467298">interesting reply</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that feels familiar. Impostor syndrome hits hard. You're
definitely worth taking seriously though, and the projects you're
working on are the most exciting ones I've been following.</p>
<p>As for people not taking the directions you're pushing
seriously... I've felt the same at work, and I think part of it is
that there's only so much one person can do. But also part of it is:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/</a></p>
<p>...it's hard to get ideas across to someone until they can interact
with it themselves</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So first of all, what a nice post!
Second of all, it's kind of funny that jfred replied with this because
out of everyone, jfred is one of the people who's picked up and
understood what's happening in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a>
in particular the most, often running or creating demos of things on
top of it using things I haven't even documented yet (so definitely
not a person I would say isn't taking me seriously or getting what the
work is doing).</p>
<p>But third, that link to <a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/">Habitat Chronicles</a>
is right on point for a few reasons: first of all, Spritely is hugely
influenced by the various generations of Habitat, from the original
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVpulhO3jyc">first-ever-graphical-virtual-worlds Habitat</a>
(premiering on the Commodore 64 in the mid 1980s, of all things!)
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNiePoNiyvE">Electric Communities Habitat</a>,
especially because that's where the <a href="http://erights.org/">E programming language</a>
came from, which I think it's safe to say has had a bigger influence on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblins">Spritely Goblins</a> than anything
(except maybe
<a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">this paper by Jonathan Rees</a>,
which is the first time I realized that "oh, object capability security
is just normal programming flow").
But also, that blogpost in particular was so perfect about this subject:
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a>...!</p>
<p>In summary, the blogpost isn't saying that people aren't foolishly
incapable of understanding things, but that people in general don't
understand well by "being explained to".
What helps people understand is experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually people can be educated, but what you have to do is find a
way give them the experience, to put them in the
situation. Sometimes this can only happen by making real the thing
you are describing, but sometimes by dint of clever artifice you can
simulate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really congealed for me and helped me feel justified in an
approach I've been taking in the Spritely project.
In general, up until now I've spent most of my time between two
states: coding the backend super-engineering stuff, and coding
demos on top of it.
You might in the meanwhile see me post technobabble onto
<a href="https://octodon.social/@cwebber/">my fediverse</a> or
<a href="https://twitter.com/dustyweb">birdsite</a> accounts, but I'm not in
general trying too hard to write about the structurally interesting
things going on until it comes time to write documentation
(whether it be for <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins</a>,
or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/magenc/blob/master/magenc/scribblings/intro.org">immutable storage</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/crystal/blob/master/crystal/scribblings/intro.org">mutable storage</a> writeups).
But in general, the way that I'm convinced people will get it is not
by talk but by first, demonstration, and second, use.</p>
<p>Aside from the few people that have picked up and played with Goblins
yet, I don't think I've hit a sufficient amount of "use" yet in Spritely.
That's ok, I'm not at that stage yet, and when I am, it'll be fairly clear.
(ETA: one year from now.)
So let's talk about demonstration.</p>
<p>The first demo I wrote was the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/golem/blob/master/README.org">Golem demo</a>,
that showed roughly that distributed but encrypted storage could be
applied to the fediverse.
Cute and cool, and that turned the heads of a few fediverse
implementers.</p>
<p>But let's face it, the best demo I've done yet was the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">Terminal Phase time travel demo</a>.
And it didn't hurt that it had a cool looking animated GIF to go
with it:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to this demo, people would ask me, "What's this Goblins thing?"
And I'd try to say a number of things to them... "oh, its a
distributed, transactional, quasi-functional distributed programming
system safe to run in mutually suspicious networks that follows object
capability security and the classic actor model in the style of the E
programming language but written in Scheme!"
And I'd watch as their eyes glaze over because
why wouldn't their eyes glaze over after a statement like that, and
then I'd try to explain the individual pieces but I could tell
that the person would be losing interest by then and
why wouldn't they lose interest but even realizing that I'd kind of
feel despair settling in... </p>
<p>But when you show them a pew pew space lasers game and oh wow why
is there time travel, how did you add time travel, is it using
functional reactive programming or something?
(Usually FRP systems are the only other ones where people have
seen these kinds of time travel demos.)
And I'd say nope!
It doesn't require that.
Mostly it looks like writing just straightahead code but you get
this kind of thing for free.
And the person would say, wow!
Sounds really cool!  How much work does it take to add the time
travel into the game?
And I just say: no extra work at all.
I wrote the whole game without testing anything about time travel or
even thinking about it, then later I just threw a few extra lines to
write the UI to expose the time travel part and it just worked.  And
that's when I see peoples' heads explode with wonder and the
connections start to be made about what Goblins might be able to do.</p>
<p>But of course, that's only a partial connection for two reasons.
One is that the time travel demo above only shows off a small,
minute part of the features of Goblins.
And actually, the least interesting of them!
It doesn't show off the distributed programming or asynchronous
programming parts, it doesn't show off the cool object capability
security that's safe to run in mutually suspicious networks.
But still: it gave a taste that something cool is happening here.
Maybe Chris hasn't just been blowing a bunch of time since
finishing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
standardization process
<a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785">about two and a half years ago</a>.
(Yikes, two and a half years ago!?!)</p>
<p>To complete the rest of that demonstration of the other things
in the system requires a different kind of demo.
Terminal Phase was a demo to show off the synchronous half of Goblins,
but where Goblins really shines is in the asynchronous, distributed
programming stuff.
That's not ready to show off yet, but I'll give you the first taste
of what's in progress:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Actually a bit more has progressed since I've recorded that GIF,
multiple chatrooms and etc, but not really worth bothering to show
off quite yet.)</p>
<p>Hmm, that's not really all that thrilling.  A chatroom that looks about
the same level of featureful, maybe less, than IRC?
Well, it could be more exciting if you hear that the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/chat-backend.rkt">full chat protocol implementation</a>
is only about 250 lines of code, including authenticating users and
posts by users.
That's smaller even than its
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/goblin-chat/-/blob/94207fd0f3290f8ec6b087cde167bc78a6329560/goblin-chat-gui.rkt">corresponding GUI code</a>,
which is less than 300 lines of code.
So the exciting thing there is how much heavy lifting Goblins takes
care of for you.</p>
<p>But that's hardly razzle-dazzle exciting.
In order for me to hint at the rest of what's happening here, we need
to put out an asynchronous programming demo that's as or more
interesting than the time travel demo.
And I expect to do that.
I hope soon enough to show off stuff that will make people go,
"Oh, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>But even that doesn't complete the connection for people,
because showing is one thing but to complete the loop, we need
people to use things.
We need to get this stuff in the hands of users to play with and
experiment themselves.
I have plans to do that... and not only that, make this stuff
not intimidating for newcomers.
When Spritely guides everyday people towards extending Spritely from
inside of Spritely as it runs, that's when it'll really click.</p>
<p>And once it clicks sufficiently, it'll no longer become exciting,
because people will just come to expect it.
A good example of that comes from the aforementioned
<a href="http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/">You can't tell people anything</a> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Years ago, before Lucasfilm, I worked for <a href="http://xanadu.com/">Project Xanadu</a>
(the original hypertext project, way before this newfangled World
Wide Web thing). One of the things I did was travel around the
country trying to evangelize the idea of hypertext. People loved it,
but nobody got it. Nobody. We provided lots of explanation. We had
pictures. We had scenarios, little stories that told what it would
be like. People would ask astonishing questions, like “who’s going
to pay to make all those links?” or “why would anyone want to put
documents online?” Alas, many things really must be experienced to
be understood. We didn’t have much of an experience to deliver to
them though — after all, the whole point of all this evangelizing
was to get people to give us money to pay for developing the
software in the first place! But someone who’s spent even 10 minutes
using the Web would never think to ask some of the questions we got
asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, if we succeed, the ideas in Spritely will no longer seem
exciting... because people will have internalized and come to expect
them.
Just like hyperlinks on the web today.</p>
<p>But to get there, in the meanwhile, we have to get people interested.
To become so successful as to be mundane, we have to first be
razzle-dazzle exciting.
And to that end, that's why I take the demo approach to Spritely.
Because it's hard to tell someone something... but showing them,
that's another matter.</p>
<p>PS: It's also not true that people don't get what I'm doing, and
that's even been reflected materially.
I've been lucky to be supported over the last few years from a
combination of
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/samsung-stack-zero-grant/">a grant from Samsung's Stack Zero</a>
and
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/spritely-nlnet-grant/">one from NLNet</a>,
not to mention quite a few <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">donors on Patreon</a>.
I do recognize and appreciate that people are supporting me.
In some ways receiving this support makes me feel more seriously about the
need to demonstrate and prove that what I'm doing is real.
I hope I am doing and will continue to do a sufficient job, and hope that
the upcoming demos contribute to that more materially!</p>
<p>PPS: If, in the meanwhile, you're already excited, check out
the <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html">Goblins documentation</a>.
The most exciting stuff is coming in the next major release
(which will be out soon), which is when the distributed programming
tools will be made available to users of the system for the first time.
But if you want to get a head start, the code you'll be writing will
mostly work the same between the distributed and non-distributed
(as in, distributed across computers/processes) asynchronous stuff,
so if you start reading the docs today, most of your code will already
just work on the new stuff once released.
And if you do start playing around, maybe drop by the
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=spritely">#spritely channel on freenode</a>
and say hello!</p>

  <p>Summary:      If your identity system doesn't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then it's not SSI.</p>


<a></a>
 

A few days ago I was in a conversation with a couple of my <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/who-are-the-identerati">identerati</a> friends. When one used the term "SSI", the other asked him to define it since there were so many systems that were claiming to be SSI and yet were seemingly different. That's a fair question. So I thought I'd write down my definition in hopes of stimulating some conversation around the topic. 
<p></p>

<p>
    I think we've arrived at a place where it's possible to define SSI and get broad consensus about it. SSI stands for self-sovereign identity, but that's not really helpful since people have different ideas about what "sovereign" means and what "identity" means. So, rather than try to go down those rabbit holes, let's just stick with "SSI."1
</p>

<p>
    SSI has the following properties:
</p>
 
     SSI systems use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) to identify people, organizations, and things. Decentralized identifiers provide a cryptograhic basis for the system and can be employed so that they don't require a central administrative system to manage and control the identifiers. Exchanging DIDs is how participants in SSI create <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationships</a>, a critical feature. 
     

     SSI participants use <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credentials exchange</a> to share information (attributes) with each other to strengthen or enrich relationships. The system provides the means of establishing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">credential fidelity</a>. 
     

     SSI supports <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">autonomy for participants</a>. The real value proposition of SSI is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy implies that participants interact as peers in the system. You can build systems that use DIDs and verifiable credentials without giving participants autonomy. 
     
 

<p>
    Beyond these there are lots of choices system architects are making. Debates rage about how specifically credential exchange should work, whether distributed ledgers are necessary, and, if so, how should they be employed. But if you don't use DIDs and verifiable credentials in a way that gives participants autonomy and freedom from intervening administrative authorities, then you're not doing SSI.
</p>

<p>
    As a consequence of these properties, participants in SSI systems use some kind of software agent (typically called a wallet for individuals) to create relationships and exchange credentials. They don't typically see or manage keys or passwords. And there's no artifact called an "identity." The primary artifacts are relationships and credentials. The user experience involves managing these artifacts to share attributes within relationships via credential exchange. This user experience should be common to all SSI systems, although the user interface and what happens under the covers might be different between SSI systems or vendors on those systems.
</p>

<p>
    I'm hopeful that, as we work more on interoperability, the implementation differences will fade away so that we have a single identity metasystem where participants have <a>choice about tools and vendors</a>. An identity metasystem is <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios that the world presents us</a> and will support <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">digital interactions that are life-like</a>. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     This is not to say I don't have opinions on what those words mean in this context. I've written about "sovereign" in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">Cogito, Ergo Sum</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">On Sovereignty</a>, and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">Self Sovereign is Not Self Asserted</a>.

<p>事後報告ですが、金融庁と日本経済新聞の共催の『Fin/Sum | BG2C 2020』に出演しました。本来は3月に行う予定だったものですが、新型コロナ禍により延期になっていたものです。</p>



<p>会場は東京は日本橋のコレド室町テラス３階の「室町三井ホール＆カンファレンス」で、座席はありましたが、ソーシャルディスタンスを撮っておりましたし、参加人数的にはちょっと寂しい感じで、麻生大臣はビデオメッセージ、その他の登壇者も多くはリモートという形でした。</p>



    ビデオ出演の麻生大臣  キーノートのメインホールの様子  モデレータの佐古早稲田大学教授j以外はリモート参加  松尾ジョージタウン大学教授はこのために来日、２週間の隔離生活  ルーム２はこんな感じ  珍しく日本のパネリストのみのパネル  <a></a><a></a><a></a>   



<p>わたしのセッションは、11:20からのBG2Cの一環としての「ブロックチェーンとアイデンティティ」というパネルディスカッションでした。モデレータのわたしだけが部屋にいて、登壇者の</p>



  <a>アイリーン・ヘルナンデス</a><br>GATACA<br>創業者 兼 CEO  <a>マリア・ヴァッチーノ</a><br>Easy Dynamics Corp.<br>ディレクター  <a>キム・キャメロン</a><br>Convergence Tech<br>チーフアイデンティティオフィサー<br>www.identityblog.comモデレーター  



<p>は、当然のことながら、それぞれ、スペイン、アメリカ、カナダからのリモート参加です。アイリーンは午前３時２０分からというすごい時間帯でしたが、ビシッと服装も整えておしゃれして出てくれました。もちろん、マリアもです。総じて海外パネリストは男性陣は髪ボサボサに対して女性陣はビシッとしてた感じがします。</p>



<p>しかし、こういうリモートのパネルはやっぱり心臓に悪いですね。リモート側の音が会場ではリバーブがかかりすぎてよく聞こえなかったりなど、コンディションが良くないですし、それ以前に、ちゃんとコールインしてくれるか、その時の回線は大丈夫か、などいろいろ不安要素があります。</p>



<p>そんなこんなで、自分のセッションのスクショとか取るの忘れてしまいました。主催者からそのうち写真や録音が出てくるのではないかと期待して…。</p>



<p>なお、Fin/Sum | BG2C では、他に２つのアンカンファレンスセッションにも出て、そのうち一つではファシリテーターをやらせていただきました。リモートのアンカンファレンスもなかなかおもしろい経験でした。</p>

<p>I host a <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">weekly call on distributed governance</a>. This blog provides my personal opinions but by all means view the <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">entire discussion here</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>One of the big debates in the Genesis DAO started by DAOstack was the question of anonymity. Should people be able to make proposals and ask for budgets without providing a real identity?</p><p>Part of the problem was a structural problem with DAOstack at the time: there was no escrow system. You could allocate funds to a project, but you could not hold the funds until the project was complete. In other words, everyone was paid up front for their project as soon as the group approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another aspect of the problem was human: we all feel a little weird chatting with someone faceless. On the discussion boards, one person could potentially have multiple pseudonyms. If we were discussing something controversial, it would be fairly easy for someone to pretend to be multiple people arguing for or against the proposal. It was also fairly easy to troll the system anonymously. It wasn’t as easy to game the voting, though it was certainly possible.</p> It Ain’t&nbsp;Real <p>The example of the Genesis DAO was somewhat trivial, because it was a small number of people who actually did know one another. None of the anonymous people seriously asked for budget (though there was an anonymous troll), the amounts of money in question weren’t huge, and it was a small enough community that everyone pretty much knew one&nbsp;another.</p><p>In real life, identity is fundamental to democracy. It amazes me how many people cherish their anonymity so much that this is under debate. <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">Our weekly chat</a> about anonymity was wide-ranging, and as usual, we came to the conclusion that “it depends.”</p> Does It Really&nbsp;Depend? <p>Personally, I think it doesn’t depend on the situation at all. At almost all stages of governance, you need to know some information about the person. You almost never need to know their actual name, but you almost always need to know, at a minimum, whether they have the right to influence a particular situation.</p><p>My minimum viable values statement about governance is: If the decision will impact you, you should have the ability to influence the decision. How much influence you should have is a different question. For example, if you are not an expert on hydroelectric dams, maybe you don’t get to decide where to build the dam, but if you live near the river, your perspective should be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>This isn’t the way democracy runs today. Corporations make decisions that impact their workers, customers and the environment with no regard for their opinions. Governments determine foreign policy without having any responsibility for the citizens of foreign countries who will be impacted by those policies. Lawmakers in one state make laws that influence neighboring states. We call that democracy. I digress but it’s important. We are completely normalized to a situation in which, as long as we feel fairly treated inside our organization, the external people’s feelings are irrelevant to what we call fair&nbsp;process.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;Name? <p>Throughout most of the decision-making process, therefore, full anonymity is not appropriate. Knowing people’s name isn’t particularly important, but in each stage of the process, some identifying information is helpful to democracy.</p>  In discussions and sentiment signalling, you need to know a person’s affiliation and expertise. Are they a resident? Do they work for the solar panel company? Are they an expert in urban planning? Is the electric company going to make a bid to buy up their land if this project is approved? Did they educate themselves and read multiple perspectives on the issue at hand? In the best of cases, you would also show an indicator of their reputation in the domains being discussed.  In problem definition, you need to know the person’s sentiment and perspective on the issue as well as something about their cognitive abilities. Are they good at detail or systems-wide analysis? Can they integrate multiple perspectives and listen well to others? Does the makeup of the problem-definition team appropriately represent enough different perspectives on the problem? Are they good at asking deeper questions, or do you use a highly-facilitated problem-definition process?  For proposal-making, while it is often optimal to let everyone propose ideas, it’s equally important to have the right experts in the room. Is this person an electrician or architect? Have they done other successful projects in this specific area? Again, the best ideas might come from someone who doesn’t have the proper background, but the process of solidifying the proposal needs to be grounded in&nbsp;reality.  For voting you need to know that this is the individual they said they were, and that they are voting in accordance with the rules of the voting&nbsp;system.  For execution of the decision, you need to know the qualifications of the people carrying out the&nbsp;work.  For accountability, oversight and assessment of the process, you need to know the qualifications and the vested interests of the&nbsp;people.  Finally, for whistle-blowing, you need some level of anonymity but you may also need verifiable evidence. Throughout the entire process, there needs to be some mechanism for people to give feedback safely when their own self-interest might be endangered. Scientists at a chemical company are the best qualified to expose if there might be unpublished side-effects to some new product. If there are good enough privacy and anonymity controls, such information could be leaked more transparently while verifying the reliability of the&nbsp;sources.   Collapsing reality and&nbsp;desire <p>One of the reasons people clamor for anonymity is that the tech collapses our identity and name and private data. Identity isn’t just your name. All of your data doesn’t have to be identified in every transaction — collapsing these concepts is sloppy and leads people to think there are only two possibilities: complete anonymity and complete exposure.</p><p>Identifying yourself by your name is the easiest way for people to eliminate anonymity, but it exposes more information than is necessary. I think that most of the debate over anonymity is due to the fact that we haven’t found creative ways to de-couple someone’s actual name from other attributes about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Technically, it would be possible to create a system where someone has a different name to different people. I would look at all of Alice’s posts and develop an opinion of her. You might be looking at Andrea’s posts — not knowing that Andrea and Alice were actually the same person, but anonymized so that when we met this person in real life, let’s say it’s really Alexa, we wouldn’t be able to attribute that information to her unless she wanted us to. She might appear differently on different forums, because she’s more of an expert in oceanography than in architecture. That’s an extreme implementation, but it’s just one example of how technology can be used to provide us the information we need to form opinions online without compromising someone’s identity.</p><p>As soon as we recognize that we can develop solutions for allowing different levels of participation and providing the data we need without exposing something sensitive, we can start to have a conversation about the need for anonymity in specific situations.</p><p>Enjoy our <a href="https://youtu.be/Rb_HzFjBj4A">talk about anonymity and democracy</a>. Most people don’t agree with me on the call! Feel free to join us. We have new topics every week, and <a href="https://forum.dgov.foundation/c/weekly-dgov-calls">the call is open to&nbsp;all</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud security is about much more than security functionality. The top cloud providers all seem to have a capable suite of security features and most surveyed organizations report that they see all the top cloud platforms as generally secure. So, why do 92% of surveyed organizations still <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/cloud-threat-report/">report</a> a cloud security readiness gap? They’re not comfortable with the security implications of moving workloads to cloud even if they believe it’s a secure environment and even if the platform offers a robust set of security features.&nbsp;</p><p>Two contributing factors to that gap include:</p>  78% reported that cloud requires different security than on-prem. With security skills at a shortage, the ability to quickly ramp up on a new architecture and a new set of security capabilities can certainly slow progress.<br>  Only 8% of respondents claimed to fully understand the cloud security shared responsibilities model; they don’t even know what they’re responsible for; never mind how to implement the right policies and procedures, hire the right people, or find the right security technologies.  <p>I recently posted about how Oracle is addressing the gap  on the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Oracle Cloud Security blog</a>. There's a link in the post to a new whitepaper from Dao Research that evaluates the cloud security capabilities offered by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p><p>Oracle took some criticism for arriving late to the game with our cloud infrastructure offering. But, several years of significant investments are paying off. Dao's research concludes that “Oracle has an edge over Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, as it provides a more centralized security configuration and posture management, as well as more automated enforcement of security practices at no additional cost. This allows OCI customers to enhance overall security without requiring additional manual effort, as is the case with AWS, Azure, and GCP.”<br></p><p>A key take-away for me is that sometimes, the competitive edge in security in delivered through simplicity and ease of use. We've <a href="https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2012/12/complexity_the_worst.html">heard</a> over and over for several years that complexity is the enemy of security. If we can remove human error, bake-in security by default, and automate security wherever possible, then the system will be more secure than if we're relying on human effort to properly configure and maintain the system and its security.<br></p><p><a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/dao-research-examines-how-oracle-is-addressing-the-cloud-security-readiness-gap">Click here to check out the post and the Dao Research whitepaper</a>.<br></p>

<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/new-digital-realities/">New Digital Realities; New Oversight Solutions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wheeler">Tom Wheeler</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=Phil+Verveer">Phil Verveer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kimmelman">Gene Kimmelman</a>&nbsp;suggest that “the problems in dealing with digital platform companies” strip the gears of antitrust and other industrial era regulatory machines, and that what we need instead is “a new approach to regulation that replaces industrial era regulation with a new more agile regulatory model better suited for the dynamism of the digital era.” For that they suggest “a new Digital Platform Agency should be created with a new, agile approach to oversight built on risk management rather than micromanagement.” They provide lots of good reasons for this, which you can read in depth <a href="https://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-Digital-Realities_Aug-2020.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m on a list where this is being argued. One of those participating is Richard Shockey, who often cites his eponymous law, which says, “The answer is money. What is the question?” I bring that up as background for my own post on the list, which I’ll share here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Digital Platform Agency proposal seems to obey a law like Shockey’s that instead says, “The answer is policy. What is the question?”</p>
<p>I think it will help, before we apply that law, to look at modern platforms as something newer than new. Nascent. Larval. Embryonic. Primitive. Epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to think of them that way if we take a long view on digital life.</p>
<p>Start with this question: is digital tech ever going away?</p>
<p>Whether yes or no, how long will digital tech be with us, mothering boundless inventions and necessities? Centuries? Millenia?</p>
<p>And how long have we had it so far? A few decades? Hell, Facebook and Twitter have only been with us since the late ’00s.</p>
<p>So why start to regulate what can be done with those companies from now on, right now?</p>
<p>I mean, what if platforms are just castles—headquarters of modern duchies and principalities?</p>
<p>Remember when we thought IBM, AT&amp;T and the PTTs in Europe would own and run the world forever?</p>
<p>Remember when the BUNCH was around, and we called IBM “the environment?” Remember EBCDIC?</p>
<p>Remember when Microsoft ruled the world, and we thought they had to be broken up?</p>
<p>Remember when Kodak owned photography, and thought their enemy was Fuji?</p>
<p>Remember when recorded music had to be played by rolls of paper, lengths of tape, or on spinning discs and disks?</p>
<p>Remember when “social media” was a thing, and all the world’s gossip happened on Facebook and Twitter?</p>
<p>Then consider the possibility that all the dominant platforms of today are mortally vulnerable to obsolescence, to collapse under their own weight, or both.</p>
<p>Nay, the certainty.</p>
<p>Every now is a future then, every is a was. And trees don’t grow to the sky.</p>
<p>It’s an easy bet that every platform today is as sure to be succeeded as were stone tablets by paper, scribes by movable type, letterpress by offset, and all of it by xerography, ink jet, laser printing and whatever comes next.</p>
<p>Sure, we do need regulation. But we also need faith in the mortality of every technology that dominates the world at any moment in history, and in the march of progress and obsolescence.</p>
<p>Another thought: if the only answer is policy, the problem is the question.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests yet another another law (really an aphorism, but whatever): “The answer is obsolescence. What is the question?”</p>
<p>As it happens, I wrote about Facebook’s odds for obsolescence two years ago <a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/the-human-solution-to-facebooks-machine-produced-problems-also-won-t-work-3364656bc257">here</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>How easy do you think it is for Facebook to change: to respond positively to market and regulatory pressures?</p>
<p>Consider this possibility:&nbsp;it can’t.</p>
<p>One reason is structural. Facebook is comprised of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-data-centers-does-Facebook-have-and-where-are-they-located">many data centers</a>, each the size of a Walmart or few, scattered around the world and costing many $billions to build and maintain. Those data centers maintain a vast and closed habitat where more than two billion human beings share all kinds of revealing personal shit about themselves and each other, while providing countless ways for anybody on Earth, at any budget level, to micro-target ads at highly characterized human targets, using up to millions of different combinations of targeting characteristics (including ones provided by parties outside Facebook, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>, which have deep psychological profiles of millions of Facebook members). Hey, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>In three words,&nbsp;the whole thing.</p>
<p>The other reason is operational. We can see that in how Facebook has handed fixing what’s wrong with it over to thousands of human beings, all hired to do&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-job-in-technology-staring-at-human-depravity-to-keep-it-off-facebook-1514398398">what&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;calls</a>&nbsp;“The Worst Job in Technology: Staring at Human Depravity to Keep It Off Facebook.” Note that this is not the job of robots, AI, ML or any of the other forms of computing magic you’d like to think Facebook would be good at. Alas, even Facebook is still a long way from teaching machines to know what’s unconscionable. And can’t in the long run, because machines don’t have a conscience, much less an able one.</p>
<p>You know Goethe’s (or hell, Disney’s) story of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice">The Sorceror’s Apprentice</a>? Look it up. It’ll help. Because Mark Zuckerberg is both the the sorcerer&nbsp;and&nbsp;the apprentice in the Facebook version of the story. Worse, Zuck doesn’t have the mastery level of either one.</p>
<p>Nobody,&nbsp;not even Zuck, has enough power to control the evil spirits released by giant machines designed to violate personal privacy, produce echo chambers beyond counting, amplify tribal prejudices (including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/world/asia/myanmar-government-facebook-rohingya.html">genocidal ones</a>) and produce many $billions for itself in an advertising business that depends on all of that—while also trying to correct, while they are doing what they were designed to do, the massively complex and settled infrastructural systems that make all if it work.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying regulators should do nothing. I am saying that gravity still works, the mighty still fall, and these are facts of nature it will help regulators to take into account.</p>

<p>What you see there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammagenitus_(cloud)">flammagenitus cloud</a> rising to the north above <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6961/">Ranch 2</a>, a wildfire about fifteen miles east of here in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Mountains">San Gabriel Mountains</a>, just north of Asuza (one of too many towns to remember, in greater Los Angeles). If the video works, you’ll see how how the clouds give shape to the heat from the fire, even as smoke (darker and with a gray/magenta color) stopping at a lower elevation, spreads northward in the same direction.</p>
<p>The fire was caused by arson, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/person-of-interest-possibly-connected-to-1500-acre-blaze-in-azusa/2413265/">says the guy</a> who confessed to starting it.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to see how much reporting on fires has changed in the time I’ve been <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doc+searls+%23fire+inciweb&amp;ia=web">following stories like this</a> in Southern California. <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/">Inciweb</a>, the canonical close-to-live running catalog of wildfires in the U.S. has moved from the .org where it started to <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/">NCWG.gov</a>, the National Coordinating Wildfire Group. When I <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/lets-do-news-what-we-did-software">first wrote about</a> Inciweb, back in ’06, I didn’t mention that it was entirely the heroic work of one Linux hacker at the Forest Service who didn’t wish to be identified.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to catch up on the Ranch2, one of <a href="https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/afm/data/activefiremaps/cgb2020230_1700.jpg">too many wildfires</a> clouding the western skies right now, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ranch2&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">here’s the Twitter search for the latest</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 2 of 2: ID Is Only the Beginning.</blockquote> Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies <p>For many working with SSI and VCs, exchanging achievements is the top-of-mind use case. By achievements, I mean any kind: diplomas, degrees, certificates, skills, <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/report/the-new-geography-of-skills/">skill shapes</a>, competencies, badges, milestones, grades, awards, commendations, micro-credentials, incremental achievements, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Students will eventually share their achievements in pursuit of a job, but they also may want to transfer between schools, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2019/02/19/reverse-transfer-a-second-chance-at-a-first-degree/#3ecc67bc7bea">reverse transfer</a> credits from their current school to a former one. SSI and VCs are the ideal means of receiving achievements in a form where they can be readily shared again, and instantly trustable without a manual verification process.</p><p>But unlike student ID, broadly useful achievements exchange among schools and employers not only requires them to become capable of issuing, holding, and verifying VCs, it also requires them to come to agreement about how the data payload should be arranged. This will happen, but it’s gonna take awhile. Thankfully, there is significant and growing momentum toward precisely that.</p><p>For example, serious efforts are underway at the <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation">T3 Innovation Network</a>, within the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in developing <a href="https://lerhub.org/g/bqCgme2fQxDbgJ6D7">Learning and Employment Records</a>, or LERs. LERs are powered by the same VC standards and technologies that enable self-sovereign student ID, with the same issue, hold, verify model to/from an SSI wallet, which they call a “<a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/FeqEJI3S5KelmLv8XJss">learner wallet</a>” for simplicity. A learner wallet is the same as an SSI wallet, with one important addition: a learner wallet includes in its scope the capability for a student to store some VCs in a cloud-based container with a custodian, in place of or in addition to a personally held wallet, and retain self-sovereign control over them. This is useful with large data sets, infrequently used credentials, and as a backup, and is offered by the likes of ASU’s <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a> and the <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>.</p><p>An impressive piece was recently released that everyone interested in interoperable achievements should read, whether in the U.S. or abroad: <a href="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/preview/9g21loK6RriHFkPRE4zJ">Applying Self-sovereign Identity Principles To Interoperable Learning Records</a>. The lead author of that piece, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdhamilton">Kim Hamilton Duffy</a>, also leads a group called the <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/university-led-digital-credentials-consortium-explores-technology-digital-academic-credentials">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). DCC includes 14 intrepid schools, including the likes of MIT and Harvard, developing interoperability of achievements that are literally carried by the achievers. They also <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-paper-building-digital-credential-infrastructure-future.pdf">see VCs</a> as the basis for this interoperability, and are making exciting progress.</p><p>My conclusion: VCs are where “the puck is headed” for broad, even global academic interoperability, they are the containers referred to in these documents that can securely transport the achievement or LER “payload” between issuers and verifiers, via the achiever&nbsp;herself.</p><p>By using this same VC technology for student ID, a school does three critical things to lay the foundation for later exchanging achievements:</p>  It puts the tools necessary for exchanging achievements into schools’ and students’ hands.  It gets schools familiar with working with VCs: issuing, verifying, and managing.  It gets students familiar with using an SSI wallet: making connections, receiving VCs, sharing VCs, communicating, giving consent,&nbsp;etc.  <p>After self-sovereign student ID is in place, issuing an achievement or LER to a student means simply clicking a different button (or&nbsp;two).</p> The “Digital Experience” <p>Education is increasingly engaged in digital transformation, from enrollment to instruction to achievement and employment. Through all the schools, programs and other experiences you might have, there is one thing that’s constant: you. You are the ideal courier of your own data whenever it’s useful to prove or qualify for something, if only you could receive your data, have a way to hold it and present it, and it was verifiable when presented. That is precisely what this technology does.</p><p>When you realize that self-sovereign student ID is simply a school-issued digital VC held inside a secure wallet capable of also storing verifiable achievements, and that wallet ideally belongs to the student and not the school, it becomes clear how it can become foundational to a lifetime digital learning experience for that learner. In this context, the “Digital Student ID” becomes a part of the digital experience rather than the whole of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This also ties into the <a href="https://www.stradaeducation.org/network/institute-for-the-future-of-work/">future of work</a>, where lifelong achievements can be accumulated by the student and later used to prove skills and competencies to prospective employers at a granular level, with the power of selective disclosure enabling strong privacy to avoid oversharing.</p><p>Taken together, this is direct application of the “Internet of Education” from the <a href="https://www.learningeconomy.io/">Learning Economy Foundation</a>, a vision that is now feasible and with which self-sovereign student ID is&nbsp;aligned.</p> Privileges, Perks, &amp;&nbsp;Freebies <p>Unlike typical digital credentials or even digital student ID, with self-sovereign student ID students can prove their ID and status anywhere, not just in school-approved or school-connected systems. This independence opens up the entire internet and the world itself, to embrace your school’s students as verifiably what they claim to be, and give them whatever benefits and privileges that status might conceivably afford. This could mean, at any non-school organization, online or&nbsp;off:</p>  Formless onboarding &amp; passwordless authentication at&nbsp;websites  Freebies, discounts and special deals&nbsp;anywhere  Access to students-only facilities and events from multiple&nbsp;schools  Access to special loans, grants, scholarships and&nbsp;more  <p>Intuitively, the more benefits you can arrange for your students, the more they will want to become your students; with self-sovereign student ID, you can unlock more benefits than ever&nbsp;before.</p> Communication &amp; Interaction <p>This category of capabilities is often overlooked in SSI, but I believe it could become the most used and beneficial class of capabilities that self-sovereign student ID enables. If you think about how much time we spend communicating versus how much time we spend authenticating, you’ll get where I’m coming&nbsp;from.</p><p>Before issuing a VC to a student, a direct connection must be established between the student’s chosen wallet and the school. This connection is unlike other connections the school may have with the student, and unlike the connections people have with each other; it is peer-to-peer, private, and encrypted end-to-end.</p><p>This connection between school and student isn’t ephemeral; it persists until either side breaks it, even for alumni who’ve long since left the school (useful for helping keep track of grads for annual IPEDS and other accreditation reporting), It is a new, private, digital relationship between school and student that enables interactions of many forms: messages, phone calls, video calls, file exchange, playing games, taking polls, voting, gathering permission or consent (digitally signed by the student), granting the school’s consent (digitally signed by the school), and&nbsp;more.</p><p>A bit like email, both your school and the student can use different services to help with your/their end of the connection. And these services are substitutable; there is no single vendor in the middle that is connecting both sides, as there is with popular messaging services today. If there were, then self-sovereign independence is lost and most of the benefits listed in this article along with it, replaced with dependence on that intermediary.</p><p>Using this capability, schools could do away with proprietary messaging systems they’ve installed to ensure <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">FERPA</a>-protected data, for example, is not shared incorrectly, and instead use a standards-based system that comes for free with self-sovereign student&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This communication channel must be respected and not overused, because either side can choose to break it; it’s not like email or a phone number where the other party can simply resume sending messages from another address or device. Reconnection can happen at any time, but both parties must opt in. I particularly love this aspect of SSI, because it is the beginning of the end to spam and phishing, and encourages considerate communications behavior on all&nbsp;sides.</p> Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing <p>Once issued to the student by the school, self-sovereign student ID helps prevent <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/college-identity-theft-a-growing-problem-1947515">student-related fraud</a>, including with student AID programs the student may apply for with outside organizations, such as government, scholarship programs, and others. Once these organizations realize they can receive cryptographic proof directly from the student, they can lessen their reliance on passwords, social security numbers, and other personal information, bringing us closer to a world devoid of identity theft, where having someone’s personal information — even their passwords — is no longer sufficient to impersonate them.</p><p>When a student applies and presents their VCs for verification, the benefits offeror, such as FAFSA in the U.S., can instantly and digitally verify, either remotely or in person, the student’s ID and status as a student, even when the organization isn’t connected to the school’s systems. Eventually, as VCs become more prevalent and the student acquires more VCs as they progress in their learner journey, they’ll be able to prove things like their citizenship or visitor status, high school diploma, GED, academic progress, and more, further preventing fraud and accelerating the process of applying for student&nbsp;aid.</p><p>Of course this use case requires the benefits offeror to gain the ability to verify VCs, which they could do tomorrow, but in reality may take&nbsp;awhile.</p><p>Phishing attempts to impersonate the school in communications with the student can also be detected and prevented, by sending school communications through the private SSI connection or by using it to validate communications sent via other means. And the school isn’t the only one fraudsters may try to impersonate: faculty, staff, tutors, proctors, authorized partners, service providers and more can be strongly and mutually authenticated by using this same capability.</p> Why Not Embed An SSI Wallet Into Your School’s Existing&nbsp;App? <p>We hear questions about “embedded wallets” a lot, and for good reason: your school has worked hard to get your official app into as many hands as possible, so adding functionality to it makes sense, whereas asking students to get another ‘app’ — even though an SSI wallet isn’t really an app — seems almost a non-starter.</p><p>Well, if a self-sovereign ‘wallet’ were just another app, and intended solely for interacting with your school, this sentiment would make perfect sense. But it isn’t, so it doesn’t, at least in the longer term. But it might in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>We should unpack that a&nbsp;bit.</p><p>‘Wallet’ is a woefully inadequate term for what SSI is and does for a person; it is useful because it is an <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">easy to understand</a> metaphor for the most basic building blocks of SSI, but it is ultimately misleading, like mistaking the trunk of an elephant <a href="http://www.simoncamilleri.com/the_truth_of_the_elephant/">for a snake</a>. SSI is more like a self-sovereign cockpit for consolidating all your relationships, not just your academic ones, and certainly not just one school. SSI consolidates, under your ultimate control, your connections, communications, interactions, agreements, preferences and data, even data not in your physical possession like medical data, which might be best physically stored with a healthcare provider or other custodian. Leaving all that in bespoke, embedded wallets from each provider brings you right back to the status quo, with your relationships, interactions, and data spread out and under the ultimate control of third parties, with all that entails: vendor lock-in; privacy, security, and compliance issues; ID theft; surveillance capitalism; duplicate relationships and data;&nbsp;etc.</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/own-your-identity">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/12/03/mastercard-microsoft-join-forces-to-advance-digital-identity-innovations/">Mastercard</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity/networks">IBM</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-telcos-banks-to-collaborate-on-blockchain-mobile-authentication/">Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.culedger.com/">US Credit Union industry</a> and hundreds of others globally are now developing SSI/VC tech for use in many industries, so your school will soon not be the only entity offering SSI-powered benefits to your students, faculty and staff. Imagine if every organization embedded wallets into their own apps rather than working with an external one, or if every payment, ID, and loyalty card you carried required its own separate physical wallet… people would begin to get annoyed, to say the least, and prefer schools and organizations that made life easier, not&nbsp;harder.</p><p>All that said, an embedded wallet could be a reasonable tradeoff early on, when SSI is new and its first uses for your students may be limited to your school. So if you jump on self-sovereign student ID quickly as an early adopter, you could embed SSI/VC/wallet tech into your existing app, foregoing self-sovereignty for now without too much of a tradeoff, and still gain several of the key benefits mentioned. Then, as students, faculty, and staff begin to receive SSI connection requests and VC offers from their other relationships in life, and they start wanting to consolidate things, you can make moves toward greater self-sovereignty with less of a dilemma, counting on SSI’s standards-enabled portability.</p> What’s Ready&nbsp;Now?  What’s Ready   Code, Products, &amp; Services — Open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">code</a>; VC-oriented products from <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/ion-booting-up-the-network/ba-p/1441552">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://credentials.workday.com/docs/overview/">Workday</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM</a>, and dozens of startups.  Compatibility With Existing Federated ID — CAS, Okta, Ping, ForgeRock, etc. for connecting with SAML, OAuth, OIDC and other federation protocols for passwordless login, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/01/22/everybody-knows-how-knowledge-based-authentication-died/">KBA</a>-free call-in, and cardless walk-in authentication.  Standards Work — <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/participants">W3C</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>  Custodial Solutions — <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">Trusted Learner Network</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">Velocity Network Foundation</a>  Broad Consensus About VCs — The Verifiable Credential is the only <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">container</a> I’m consistently seeing under consideration for <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">transporting verifiable data between trust domains</a>, which self-sovereign control and trust require, from academia to healthcare to finance and&nbsp;beyond.  Broad Consensus About Individual Control of Data — From academia to healthcare to Europe’s GDPR and the current disdain for big tech and surveillance capitalism, I see broad consensus that control over data must move more and more into the hands of individuals, even data not in their physical possession.  Momentum — Years of global open-source development and standards work for SSI; orgs large and small in many industries are actively participating in developing VC code, standards, use cases and business models; strong support from the T3 Innovation Network in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   What’s Not Ready&nbsp;(Yet)   User Experience — The SSI space knows the basics — issue, hold, and verify VCs — but does not yet have the UX figured out. Honestly, the existing SSI wallets I’ve seen are all still a bit clunky and confusing (even though it’s still a much better experience than passwords or answering personal questions), but they do work. Usability must be smoothed and complexity hidden, and access for the disabled, older devices, and more, has yet to be addressed.  Interoperability — Today, standards are ahead of implementations. All the players know the importance of interop but haven’t gotten there yet, though there are serious multi-org testing and development efforts underway to get it resolved. I like the alignment of incentives here: any vendor not interoperable with others will be left on its own technology island.  Communications — While these private, peer-to-peer connections can support any kind of communication, so far I’ve not seen anything other than simple messaging.  Passive Authentication — I look forward to the day when I can be authenticated by those I know and trust passively, by policy, by automatically sharing the appropriate proofs when prompted, without touching my device. As far as I know, only active authentication is now&nbsp;offered.  Embedded Agents in Door Access Readers — Another missing element is embedded SSI agents into NFC (or other tap technology) readers, to make door access compatible and performant.  Ancillary &amp; Rainy Day Use Cases — Most new tech must first nail sunny day scenarios before tackling the rainy day ones. For example, VCs could be used for guardian relationships, children, pets, things, and complex organizational hierarchies, but those haven’t been done anywhere that I’m aware of. VCs could work off-line or from a QR code on a card or piece of paper, but no one has gone there yet either, to my knowledge.  <p>Considering what’s ready today, what’s not ready, the long list of benefits for both schools and students, the fraud with existing credentials, and the possibility of eliminating existing costs (see next section), I think it adds up to a compelling case that self-sovereign student ID is ready for piloting.</p><p>That said, the pieces that enable self-sovereign student ID are nascent and only recently available; it is a new application of SSI that itself has only been around for about four years, and mostly in the lab and not much in production, though that is changing. Schools considering this in 2020 would be the first, which for those that prefer to lead rather than follow makes for a wonderful opportunity, especially during a pandemic.</p><p>Cue the <a href="https://ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/">Technology Adoption Lifecycle</a>… welcome, Innovators!</p> Where to&nbsp;Begin <p>To get started with self-sovereign student ID, a school needs capabilities to issue and verify VCs, and students need wallets to hold&nbsp;them.</p><p>Code for simple issuance tools is available open source, more advanced tools are offered by various SSI service providers, and standards-compliant SSI wallets are available for free in both Apple and Google app stores. Verification is the tricky part, as it requires existing school systems to be adapted to accept VCs for authentication, and later for other purposes¹. Thankfully, some IAM systems commonly found in higher ed are adaptable now:</p><p>For schools running <a href="https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas">CAS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, or any IAM system that facilitates an external Identity Provider, self-sovereign student ID can be integrated relatively painlessly, enabling students to immediately use it in place of passwords, and potentially eliminating the need for a dedicated 2FA provider. For contact centers running Salesforce Service Cloud, the StudentPass product that <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a> is developing will integrate natively, enabling students to use their VCs to authenticate when calling in, without answering personal questions.</p><p>Of course, integrations can be made with any existing system. Better to start a new identity project with self-sovereign student ID, which can begin to consolidate systems and reduce complexity, than build another layer that may well add to&nbsp;it.</p> In Conclusion <p>For those interested primarily in achievements, ID is an “and” and not an “or,” and it should come first, as it lays a technical and familiarity foundation for achievements to be issued and quickly useful. Communications could come soon after ID, because it becomes available as soon as the first connection with a student is&nbsp;created.</p><p>Achievements will come later, after the necessary consensus among schools and employers has been sorted to establish semantic meaning and interoperability for exchanged data payloads. Then this model — of people receiving, controlling, and sharing their achievements in a digital, verifiable form — will become the norm, and the future of work will become the&nbsp;present.</p><p>Until that day, schools can leap right past proprietary digital ID solutions and go straight to self-sovereign, and reap all its benefits without having to wait for anyone else to agree to anything, giving students a modern digital experience they’ll&nbsp;love.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-1-of-2-d3104ab0f8f2">Part 1: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</a></blockquote><p>¹ Down the road, VCs could also be used for authorization, where granular-level permissions and entitlements are carried and presented by individuals, simplifying the administration of centralized policy-based access control and moving enforcement to the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>Special thanks to several helpful reviewers, editors, and contributors: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnphillips11kps/">John Phillips</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Dr. Phil Windley</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/longpd/">Phil Long</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-perry-1b7a254/">Scott Perry</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-m-smith/">Dr. Samuel Smith</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinkelk/">Alan Davies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taykendesign/">Taylor Kendal</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-hailstone-92a1a51/">Matthew Hailstone</a>.</p>

 Introducing Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <blockquote>Part 1 of <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">2</a>: Strong, flexible, digital student ID that’s not bound to your campus, network, or&nbsp;vendor.</blockquote><p>Full Disclosure: The benefits discussed here apply to self-sovereign student ID generally and are not specific to any vendor or product, and do not result in vendor lock-in; any standards-compliant SSI tools for issuance, holding, and verification could deliver these results. As a partner of venture studio <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>, I am a co-founder of <a href="https://www.credentialmaster.com/">Credential Master</a>, a startup now developing a self-sovereign student ID&nbsp;product.</p> TL;DR:   Digital student ID: doesn’t exist yet for most students.  Self-sovereign student ID: students independently store verifiable data, and strongly prove things about themselves anywhere, online or&nbsp;off.  Many uses: strong, passwordless login, KBA-free call in, &amp; cardless walk in; secure, keyless facility and systems access; prove skills, competencies and achievements; secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction; breakthrough fraud prevention; student-controlled privacy; digitally signed consent; and&nbsp;more.  Open standards: not tied to a specific vendor, usable outside the school’s&nbsp;network.  Schools can start with self-sovereign student ID today, without waiting for collaboration with or agreement from other institutions.  <a href="https://link.medium.com/W3o6duQc19">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a>  <p>Note: This article assumes a basic understanding of the concepts of <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, especially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs). The technical specifics of how VCs are issued, revoked, held, verified, and trustworthy are covered extensively across the SSI industry. Basic VC mechanics can be found in my other post: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a>.</p> Digital Student&nbsp;ID <p>For most students, digital student ID still doesn’t&nbsp;exist.</p><p>I’ve been asking experts in academia what comes to mind when I say “digital student ID,” and here is what I learned: other than login credentials for a student portal — which don’t count — a digital student ID still doesn’t exist, at least not for most students in most&nbsp;schools.</p><p>The first, still obscure attempts at what I would call real digital student ID have cropped up fairly recently, enabling students to prove their identity in multiple environments and granting them access to electronic systems, software, and even physical facilities. Apple has introduced <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-brings-contactless-student-ids-on-iphone-and-apple-watch-to-more-universities/">their version</a> of digital student ID that works exclusively with Apple software and devices, and various smaller companies have launched similarly proprietary software platforms with corresponding apps. Search “student ID” in the Apple or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=%22student%20ID%22&amp;c=apps">Google app stores</a> and you’ll find dozens of similar offerings.</p><p>So why hasn’t digital student ID caught on? I think it’s because available offerings are tied to a single vendor, usable only in systems and facilities where that vendor is installed, and verifiable only by that vendor’s app. In Apple’s case it’s tied to their hardware, too. Even a homegrown digital student ID solution can be verified only by an associated homegrown app. It is vendor lock-in to the extreme, even if that ‘vendor’ is the school&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For a school to confidently roll out a more broadly useful digital student ID, it must be with technology that can traverse boundaries between vendors, both within the school’s network and external to it, such as when a student applies for aid. Such technology now exists, and it can do a heckuva lot more than&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Introducing a powerful new model for student ID: “self-sovereign” student&nbsp;ID.</p> Self-Sovereign Student&nbsp;ID <p>You may have heard of self-sovereign identity, or SSI¹. In this article I’ll explore how self-sovereign student ID can apply SSI capabilities and principles for students, faculty, and staff in an educational environment, primarily higher education.</p><p>I recognize that the term “self-sovereign” may not resonate as well with some in academia, which is often dominated by institutions preferring to expand their scope of control and influence, and perceiving self-sovereignty as a threat. However, it is the very act of giving greater control and independence to students that yields most of the benefits listed in this article, and counter intuitively, a closer, richer relationship with those students.</p><p>I’ll discuss this more in “Why Self-Sovereign” below.</p> What Is&nbsp;It? <p>The term “self-sovereign” is unfortunately not self-explanatory, but when properly understood should feel like a familiar analog to physical identity and credentials, which we already use in a self-sovereign manner well beyond the physical and digital bounds of the organization that issued them to&nbsp;us.</p><p>In short, self-sovereign student ID gives students the ability to independently and securely store tamper-resistant, verifiable data related to themselves, and to prove things wherever they want by privately sharing cryptographic (mathematical) proofs from that data, online or off. Importantly, it also enables students to securely, directly, and privately communicate and interact with the&nbsp;school.</p><p>Technically, the student has self-sovereign control over three²&nbsp;things:</p>  A standardized digital container, for holding verifiable data;  Peer-to-peer connections between their container and the containers of other people, organizations, and&nbsp;things³;  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that the student accepts into their wallet, and shares proofs of with others when&nbsp;desired.  <p>Today, that self-sovereign container is typically a standardized digital SSI “wallet”⁴ within a compliant app that the student can see and interact with on a smart device; eventually, wallets will be found anywhere digital things are stored and become part of the everyday life of people, organizations, and things, hidden and integrated into our devices and experiences in a way where we no longer notice or think of&nbsp;them.</p><p>One important point that will help readers better understand VCs, both in this document and generally: I believe VCs are misnamed, they are not credentials, they are verifiable containers capable of transporting any data payload, which may or may not be typically considered a “credential.” This means that VCs held in a wallet are containers within a larger container, but this is a feature, not a bug; it is how physical goods are transported in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace">meatspace</a> and is very useful. I’ve written about these points in greater detail&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">here</a>.</p> Why Self-Sovereign? <p>Self-sovereignty implies giving students control over their data and how it’s shared. That may seem counter intuitive to the traditional academic notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis">in loco parentis</a>, but the truth is that it not only mirrors how physical student IDs work, it simplifies the IT integration work while expanding the possible use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Importantly, an SSI-based student ID binds the school-issued (and verifiable) information in the ID to a student’s right to use it. Through this binding, students can prove, at their own discretion, that they are enrolled, taking classes, receiving or received grades (and what they are), received a degree, and so on. Giving these facts to students in digital form can make their lives easier, reducing friction and fraud for both students and the school. ID is only one of many VCs that will be issued to the student by the school for various&nbsp;uses.</p><p>And once the student has an SSI wallet, it’s not just the school that can now exchange VCs with them. The student might want to connect and exchange VCs with multiple schools, their church, their gym club, their favorite sandwich shop or other entities they interact with. You might think that sounds like an Apple or Samsung wallet, and it kinda does,&nbsp;except:</p>  SSI wallets are portable between vendors, devices, and device types (ie, move from iPhone to Samsung and back&nbsp;again)  VCs are portable between&nbsp;wallets  VCs can hold any kind of data (ie, identity, location, degree, favorite&nbsp;pizza)  VCs are cryptographically verifiable  Holders can share only part of a VC, metadata about a VC, or just proof that they have one, without revealing anything&nbsp;else  The protocols that make wallets and VCs portable and interoperable are open and standardized  <p>And of course, Apple and Android wallets don’t enable persistent, encrypted connections with other people, organizations and things for secure peer-to-peer communication and interaction, but I’m getting ahead of&nbsp;myself…</p> A Thousand&nbsp;Uses <p>By “useful” I mean it can be used for many important, new, relevant purposes and also make expected and ordinary uses&nbsp;better.</p><p>I’ll organize the usefulness of self-sovereign student ID into six categories:</p>  Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access  Achievements, Skills, &amp; Competencies  The “Digital Experience”  Privileges, Perks &amp;&nbsp;Freebies  Communication &amp; Interaction  Preventing Fraud &amp;&nbsp;Phishing  <p>The first category, Identity &amp; Access, will be covered within this Part 1 and is where I’ll delve the most deeply. I’ll touch on the remaining categories in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part&nbsp;2</a>.</p><p>Note: As mentioned above, it is outside the scope of this article to explain the basic mechanics of SSI and VC exchange, such as how the initial encrypted connections are offered and accepted, how VCs are offered and accepted using those connections, how VC presentation and verification occurs, or how those verifications can be trustworthy. Those subjects are covered amply by many other documents, papers, and websites throughout the SSI industry, and are the reason for the industry’s abundant standards activity. Refer to links at the beginning of this article for more information.</p> Identity &amp;&nbsp;Access <p>The primary use of self-sovereign student ID — and the gateway to limitless other uses — is as a digital, and therefore more powerful, version of a student ID card, enabling students to instantly and strongly prove their identity and status as a student, online or off, without passwords.</p> Password Replacement <p>Perhaps the simplest starting point for self-sovereign student ID is to replace passwords. Passwords have many known problems with both security and UX, and can be replaced with a quick ping to a student’s smartphone. The student responds with a tap, which cryptographically shares their school-issued ID, which is instantly verifiable by the&nbsp;school.</p><p>This is a big step-up in both security and user experience over passwords, and social login, and can be used in conjunction with or as a substitute for&nbsp;2FA.</p><p>For schools running CAS, Okta, or any ID system supportive of a “custom IDP” or “external authentication handler,” password replacement can be implemented quickly.</p> Identity+ <p>Self-sovereign student ID starts with a student-controlled wallet into which the school can issue VCs containing any kind of data, identity or otherwise. So typical student ID data — name, photo, ID number, etc. — can be supplemented with any other desired information: classes registered for or taken, status and authority as a student leader, entitlements, permissions, preferences, allergies, relationships to other students, contact information, family information, achievements (more on that below), and on and&nbsp;on.</p> Multi-Factor Authentication+ (MFA+) <p>The plus in MFA+ means the ability to exchange more factors than is feasible with current tech, while not impairing the user experience, and likely improving it.</p><p>Because shared secrets (something the student knows, like a username or password) are replaced with cryptographically secure, digitally signed VCs (something the student has, like a unique key), you can exchange much stronger credentials than passwords. Because they’re digital and easily shared, you can exchange more of them, even dozens. Biometrics, location and more can also be incorporated, either as payloads within VCs or in conjunction with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Because VCs can be exchanged actively or passively behind the scenes, they are useful within <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Zero Trust Architecture</a> (ZTA). For higher-risk applications, multiple signatures can be required from multiple devices and/or multiple individuals. Combining MFA+, ZTA, and multi-device and multi-signature capabilities results in a formidable approach to protecting sensitive systems and facilities.</p> Vendor Independence <p>SSI is based on standards, so tools from different vendors can be interoperable. This means that your school isn’t locked into a single vendor and can replace a vendor without reissuing IDs (try that with a traditional ID system). Students, faculty, and staff can choose from multiple wallets to store their credentials, which are portable if they later decide to switch. You might use one vendor to help issue student IDs, another to integrate with the student information system for registration and transcript data, and a third to verify student or staff status at the campus bookstore POS. You don’t have to worry that any vendor selected for digital student IDs can’t support your diverse campus needs, or that you’re stuck with lousy quality or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Use of student ID becomes no longer constrained digitally or physically by the boundaries of the school’s trust domain, or the presence of any particular vendor, removing what I believe is the #1 barrier for digital student ID adoption&nbsp;today.</p> Digital First, Then&nbsp;Physical <p>Self-sovereign student ID is digital first, but not digital only. With self-sovereign student ID you can have both digital and physical forms in several varieties.</p><p>A ‘smart’/chipped student ID card could hold an SSI wallet (note the irony) with some of a student’s VCs, greatly expanding the types of credentials, entitlements, tickets or other items the student can carry and benefit from, and making it much harder for a fraudster to get away with swapping out the name, photo, ID number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>A student could also present a card or a paper with a QR code on it. Scanning the QR code could pull up a verified student ID, including a photo, either from a school-controlled database or from student-controlled storage. QR code-based verification could be restricted to authorized personnel, who could also be required to digitally prove their ID before gaining&nbsp;access.</p><p>Combining these capabilities, a school could issue a physical ID card with only three elements: a photo, a QR code, and an embedded chip— no name, no ID number, nothing else. If the chip and QR code worked as described above, even this extreme approach could be more useful than existing student ID cards while being more private for students and more difficult to hack for fraudsters.</p> Access+ <p>Whether for accessing digital systems, physical facilities or events, self-sovereign student ID can begin to support digital versions of key cards, vouchers, receipts and more, all uniquely associated with the student. A VC can also be issued as a bearer instrument not associated with any individual, like a movie ticket or a coupon. Using geofencing, students could be passively authenticated when entering a secure area, of course subject to their consent to the practice.</p> Mutual Authentication <p>Because it enables a bi-directional exchange of VCs, self-sovereign student ID may be the first technology that enables students to authenticate schools as strongly as schools authenticate students, preventing impersonation and phishing.</p> User Experience <p>Who doesn’t want fewer usernames and passwords to deal with? With self-sovereign student ID, the student can digitally present their ID and other entitlements and be authenticated more strongly, safely, and quickly than with usernames and passwords. This reduces the incidence of fraud, account take-over, and password reset requests.</p><p>Because the school maintains a secure, peer-to-peer connection with the student, it can use this connection to prompt the student for ID when the student calls in or walks in⁵. When calling in, this eliminates the need for knowledge-based authentication questions (birthday, mother’s maiden name, etc.) and speeds up the call; when walking in, this eliminates the need to pull out a physical student ID (useful during a pandemic).</p><p>Whether calling in, walking in, or logging in, a student can feel recognized by the school rather than repeatedly treated as a stranger.</p> Privacy &amp; Compliance <p>Today, when presenting a physical student ID card, the student divulges everything on it; there’s no way to present only part of it. With <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">selective disclosure</a> enabled by self-sovereign student ID, a student can share only the data required and nothing more, or prove something about their credentials without disclosing any of the data, or just prove that they have it. Some examples are&nbsp;helpful:</p>  Prove status as a currently enrolled student, without revealing name, ID number, or other personal&nbsp;info  Prove age is over a threshold, without revealing actual age or&nbsp;birthday  Prove address on file is within a certain area, city, or building, without revealing the exact&nbsp;location  <p>Selective disclosure is useful for many things, including voting, and can be used online or off. It affords whatever level of privacy the student desires, and satisfies both the spirit and the letter of aggressive privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, while remaining auditable for all interactions between students and the school. And by minimizing the presentation of identity to only the attributes needed, selective disclosure curtails the unchecked growth in the ‘grey market’ of personal data, worth billions of dollars and&nbsp;growing.</p><p>And when data is shared, it is shared directly by the student with digitally signed evidence that they did so, a veritable get-out-of-jail free card in today’s PII-sensitive privacy&nbsp;climate.</p> Consolidation &amp; Simplification <p>As it scales, federated ID has a tendency to grow into a complex, tangled web of identities, identifiers, vendors, integrations, synchronizations, and registries. Self-sovereign student ID can begin a process of consolidation around a coherent identity meta system, with a reduction in vendors, a reduction in identifiers, and an overall reduction in complexity, without consolidating around a single&nbsp;vendor.</p><p>And that’s not a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>That said, I’m taking the advice of my business partner, SSI pioneer <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/team-and-contact/">Dr. Sam Smith</a>, and avoiding diving into how this can occur within this piece. He is the better author for it anyway, as it quickly gets into a technical discussion about self-certifying identifiers, which SSI uses, versus administrative identifiers, which federated ID uses, which is his area of study and expertise. So, Sam can write a separate piece if there is sufficient interest. For readers having a pressing need related to this topic, please get in&nbsp;touch.</p> ID Is the Low-Hanging Fruit <p>For most, ID may be the best place to start with VCs. There’s far less complexity than something like achievements, and no other entities need to be consulted before adopting a particular approach; a school catches what it pitches. Plus, the benefits can be broadly and immediately felt, and readily integrated into most IAM systems. And of course, ID is a prerequisite for most other use cases; even if those feel more important or urgent, you usually need to begin by verifying who you’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>If you read no further, this should already be apparent: though ID and Access may be a fraction of what self-sovereign student ID can do, it is more than enough to justify serious consideration. The uses discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> are cool and exciting, but just icing on the&nbsp;cake.</p><p>If you’re not planning to read Part 2 and are wondering how to operationalize self-sovereign student ID, open <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2</a> and skip down to “Where to&nbsp;Begin.”</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/introducing-self-sovereign-student-id-part-2-of-2-a566ed414d75">Part 2: ID is Only the Beginning</a></blockquote><p>¹ One of the earliest/best pieces about SSI, from Christopher Allen: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html</a></p><p>² Technically there is a fourth thing a student controls: self-certifying identifiers provide the root of trust, the crypto magic that makes it possible to traverse trust domain boundaries, but they’re “deeper under the hood” and out of scope for this piece.

  Sqitch v0.9998: Now with Snowflake support, an improved Homebrew tap, and the quickest way to get started: the new [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/).

<p>I released <a href="https://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a> v<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998" title="App-Sqitch v0.9998">0.9998</a> this week. Despite the <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/DWHEELER/App-Sqitch-0.9998/Changes" title="Sqitch v0.9998 Changes">long list of changes</a>,
only one new feature stands out: support for the <a href="https://www.snowflake.net/">Snowflake Data Warehouse</a>
platform. A major <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a> project aims to move all of our reporting data from
Postgres to Snowflake. I asked the team lead if they needed Sqitch support, and
they said something like, “Oh hell yes, that would save us months of
work!” Fortunately I had time to make it happen.</p>
<p>Snowflake’s SQL interface ably supports all the functionality required for
Sqitch; indeed, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/sqitch/blob/master/lib/App/Sqitch/Engine/snowflake.pm" title="App::Sqitch::Engine::snowflake">implementation</a> required fairly little customization. And
while I did report a number of issues and shortcomings to the Snowflake support
team, they always responded quickly and helpfully — sometimes revealing
undocumented workarounds to solve my problems. I requested that they be
documented.</p>
<p>The work turned out well. If you use Snowflake, consider managing your databases
with Sqitch. Start with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitchtutorial-snowflake" title="A tutorial introduction to Sqitch change management on Snowflake">the tutorial</a> to get a feel for it.</p>
 Bundle Up 
<p>Of course, you might find it a little tricky to get started. In addition to long
list of Perl dependencies, each database engines requires two external
resources: a command-line client and a driver library. For Snowflake, that means
the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/snowsql.html" title="SnowSQL Client for Snowflake">SnowSQL</a> client and the <a href="https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/odbc.html" title="ODBC Driver for Snowflake">ODBC driver</a>. The PostgreSQL engine requires
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::Pg">DBD::Pg</a> compiled with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq.html">libpq</a>. MySQL calls for the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql.html">mysql client</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBD::mysql">DBD::mysql</a> compiled with the MySQL connection library. And so on. You
likely don’t care what needs to be built and installed; you just want it to
work. Ideally install a binary and go.</p>
<p>I do, too. So I spent the a month or so building Sqitch bundling support, to
easily install all its Perl dependencies into a single directory for
distribution as a single package. It took a while because, sadly, Perl provides
no straightforward method to build such a feature without also bundling unneeded
libraries. I plan to write up the technical details soon; for now, just know
that I made it work. If you <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, you’ll reap the benefits in your next
<code>brew install sqitch</code>.</p>
 Pour One Out 
<p>In fact, the bundling feature enabled a complete rewrite of the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch">Sqitch Homebrew
tap</a>. Previously, Sqitch’s Homebrew formula installed the required modules in
Perl’s global include path. This pattern violated Homebrew best practices, which
prefer that all the dependencies for an app, aside from configuration, reside in
a single directory, or “cellar.”</p>
<p>The new formula follows this dictum, bundling Sqitch and its CPAN dependencies
into a nice, neat package. Moreover, it enables engine dependency selection at
build time. Gone are the separate <code>sqitch_$engine</code> formulas. Just pass the
requisite options when you build Sqitch:</p>
  <code>brew install sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-sqlite-support
</code>  <p>Include as many engines as you need (<a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch#supported-database-engines" title="Sqitch Homebrew: Supported Database Engines">here’s the list</a>). Find yourself with only
Postgres support but now need Oracle, too? Just reinstall:</p>
  <code>export HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_HOME
brew reinstall sqitch --with-postgres-support --with-oracle-support
</code>  <p>In fact, the old <code>sqitch_oracle</code> formula hasn’t worked in quite some time, but
the new <code>$HOMEBREW_ORACLE_HOME</code> environment variable does the trick (provided
you <a href="https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos">disable SIP</a>; see <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/homebrew-sqitch/#--with-oracle-support" title="Sqitch Homebrew Oracle support">the instructions</a> for details).</p>
<p>I recently became a Homebrew user myself, and felt it important to make Sqitch
build “the right way”. I expect this formula to be more reliable and better
maintained going forward.</p>
<p>Still, despite its utility, Homebrew Sqitch lives up to its name: It downloads
and builds Sqitch from source. To attract newbies with a quick and easy method
to get started, we need something even simpler.</p>
 Dock of the Bae 
<p>Which brings me to the installer that excites me most: The new <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sqitch/sqitch/" title="Sqitch on Docker Hub">Docker image</a>.
Curious about Sqitch and want to download and go? Use Docker? Try this:</p>
 <code>curl -L https://git.io/JJKCn -o sqitch &amp;&amp; chmod +x sqitch
./sqitch help
</code> <p>That’s it. On first run, <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">the script</a> pulls down the Docker image, which
includes full support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite, and weighs in
at just 164 MB (54 MB compressed). Thereafter, it works just as if Sqitch was
locally-installed. It uses a few tricks to achieve this bit of magic:</p>
 
 It mounts the current directory, so it acts on the Sqitch project you
intend it to 
 It mounts your home directory, so it can read the usual configuration files 
 It syncs the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-environment" title="Environment variables recognized by Sqitch">environment variables</a> that Sqitch cares about 
 
<p>The script even syncs your username, full name, and host name, in case you
haven’t configured your name and email address with <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/sqitch-config"><code>sqitch config</code></a>. The only
outwardly obvious difference is the editor:<a>1</a> If you add
a change and let the editor open, it launches <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org" title="Nano Text Editor">nano</a> rather than your preferred
editor. This limitation allows the image ot remain as small as possible.</p>
<p>I invested quite a lot of effort into the Docker image, to make it as small as
possible while maximizing out-of-the-box database engine support — without
foreclosing support for proprietary databases. To that end, the <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch" title="Sqitch Docker Packaging on GitHub">repository</a>
already contains <code>Dockerfile</code>s to support <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/oracle/" title="Sqitch Oracle Docker instructions">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/tree/master/snowflake/" title="Sqitch Snowflake Docker instructions">Snowflake</a>: simply
download the required binary files, built the image, and push it to your private
registry. Then set <code>$SQITCH_IMAGE</code> to the image name to transparently run it
with the magic <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>.</p>
 Docker Docket 
<p>I plan to put more work into the Sqitch Docker repository over the next few
months. <a href="https://www.exasol.com/">Exasol</a> and <a href="https://my.vertica.com/">Vertica</a> <code>Dockerfile</code>s come next. Beyond that, I envision
matrix of different images, one for each database engine, to minimize download
and runtime size for folx who need only one engine — especially for production
deployments. Adding <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" title="Alpine Linux">Alpine</a>-based images also tempts me; they’d be even
smaller, though unable to support most (all?) of the commercial database
engines. Still: tiny!</p>
<p>Container size obsession is a thing, right?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://iovation.com/" title="iovation, Inc.">work</a>, we believe the future of app deployment and execution belongs to
containerization, particularly on Docker and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>. I presume that
conviction will grant me time to work on these improvements.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Well, that and connecting to a service on your
host machine is a little fussy. For example, to use Postgres on your local
host, you can’t connect to Unix sockets. The <a href="https://github.com/sqitchers/docker-sqitch/blob/master/docker-sqitch.sh" title="Sqitch Docker Shell Script">shell script</a>

  <p>Summary: Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    An earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a> proposed that we build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities—and discussed the nature of digital relationships in terms of their integrity, lifespan, and utility. You should read that post before this one. 
</p>

<p>
    In his article <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/architecture-eats-culture-eats-strategy-925c7f3fb74b">Architecture Eats Culture Eats Strategy</a>, Tim Bouma makes the point that the old management chestnut <a href="https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/">Culture Eats Strategy</a> leaves open the question: how do we change the culture. Tim's point is that architecture (in the general sense) is the upstream predator to culture. Architecture is a powerful force that drives culture and therefore determines what strategies will succeed—or, more generally, what use cases are possible. 
</p>

<p>
    Following on Tim's insight, my thesis is that identity systems are the foundational layer of our digital ecosystem and therefore the architecture of digital identity systems drives online culture and ultimately what we can do and what we can't. Specifically, since <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">identity systems are built to create and manage relationships</a>, their architecture deeply impacts the kinds of relationships they support. And the quality of those relationships determines whether or not we live effective lives in the digital sphere. 
</p>

 Administrative Identity Systems Create Anemic Relationships 

<p>
    I was the founder and CTO of iMall, an early, pioneering ecommerce tools vendor. As early as 1996 we determined that we not only needed a shopping cart that kept track of a shopper's purchases in a single session, but one that knew who the shopper was from visit to visit so we could keep the shopping cart and pre-fill forms with shipping and billing addresses. Consequently, we built an identity system. In the spirit of the early web, it was a one-off, written in Perl and storing personal data in Berkeley DB. We did hash the passwords—we weren't idiots1. 
</p>

<p>
    Early Web companies had a problem: we needed to know things about people and there was no reliable way for them to tell us who they were. So everyone built an identity system and thus began my and your journey to collecting thousands of identifiers as the Web expanded and every single site needed it's own way to know things about us.
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems, as these kinds of identity systems are called, create a relationship between the organization operating the identity system and the people who are their customers, citizens, partners, and so on. They are, federation notwithstanding, largely self contained and put the administrator at the center as shown in Figure 1. This is their fundamental architecture. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 1: Administrative identity systems put the administrator at the center.   (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Administrative identity systems are owned. They are closed. They are run for the purposes of their owners, not the purposes of the people or things being administered. They provision and permission. They are bureaucracies for governing something. They rely on rules, procedures, and formal interaction patterns. Need a new password? Be sure to follow the password rules of what ever administrative system you're in. Fail to follow the company's terms of service? You could lose your account without recourse. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems use a simple schema, containing just the attributes that the administrator needs to serve their purposes and reduce risk. The problem I and others were solving back in the 90's was legibility2. Legibility is a term used to describe how administrative systems make things governable by simplifying, inventorying, and rationalizing things around them. Identity systems make people legible in order to offer them continuity and convenience while reducing risk for the administrator. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative identity systems give rise to a systematic inequality in the relationships they manage. Administrative identity systems create bureaucratic cultures. Every interaction you have online happens under the watchful eye of a bureaucracy built to govern the system and the people using it. The bureaucracy may be benevolent, benign, or malevolent but it controls the interaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Designers of administrative identity systems do the imaginative work of assigning identifiers, defining the administrative schemas and processes, and setting the purpose of the identity system and the relationships it engenders. Because of the systematic imbalance of power that administrative identity systems create, administrators can afford to be lazy. To the administrator, everyone is structurally the same, being fit into the same schema. This is efficient because they can afford to ignore all the qualities that make people unique and concentrate on just their business. Meanwhile subjects are left to perform the "interpretive labor" as <a href="https://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau2.2.007%22">David Graeber calls it</a> of understanding the system, what it allows or doesn't, and how it can be bent to accomplish their goals.  Subjects have few tools for managing these relationship because each one is a little different, not only technically, but procedurally as well. There is no common protocol or user experience. Consequently, subjects have no way to operationalize the relationship except in whatever manner the administrator allows. 
</p>

<p>
    Given that the architecture of administrative identity systems gives rise to a bureaucratic culture, what kinds of strategies or capabilities does that culture engender? Quoting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy-ebook/dp/B00MKZ0QZ2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=utopia+of+rules&amp;qid=1596487542&amp;sr=8-1">David Graeber from The Utopia of Rules (pg 152)</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>Cold, impersonal, bureaucratic relations are much like cash transactions, and both offer similar advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand they are soulless. On the other, they are simple, predictable, and—within certain parameters, at least—treat everyone more or less the same.
</blockquote>

<p>
    I argue that this is the kind of thing the internet is best at. Our online relationships with ecommerce companies, social media providers, banks, and others are cold and impersonal, but also relatively efficient. In that sense, the web has kept its promise. But the institutionalized frame of action that has come to define it alienates its subjects in two ways:
</p>
 
     They are isolated and estranged from each other. 
     They surrender control over their online activity and the associated data within a given domain to the administrator of that domain.  
 

<p>
    The administrative architecture and the bureaucratic culture it creates has several unavoidable, regrettable outcomes:
</p>
 
     Anemic relationships that limit the capabilities of the systems they support. For example, social media platforms are designed to allow people to form a link (symmetrical or asymmetrical) to others online. But it is all done within the sphere of the administrative domain of the system provider. The relationships in these systems are like two-dimensional cardboard cutouts of the real relationships they mirror. We inhabit multiple walled gardens that no more reflect real life than do the walled gardens of amusement parks.
     
     A surveillance economy that relies on the weak privacy provisions that administrative systems create to exploit our online behavior as the raw material for products that not only predict, but attempt to manipulate, our future behaviors.3 Many administrative relationships are set up to harvest data about our online behavior. The administrator controls the nature of these relationships, what is allowed, and what is behavior is rewarded.
     
     Single points of failure where key parts of our lives are contained within the systems of companies that will inevitably cease to exist someday.  In the words of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">Craig Burton</a>: "It's about choice: freedom of choice vs. prescribed options. Leadership shifts. Policies expire. Companies fail. Systems decay. Give me the freedom of choice to minimize these hazards." 
 

 The Self-Sovereign Alternative 

<p>
    <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-sovereign identity (SSI) systems</a> offers an alternative model that supports richer relationships. Rather than provisioning identifiers and accounts in an administrative system where the power imbalance assures that one party to the relationship can dictate the terms of the interaction, SSI is founded on peer relationships that are co-provisioned by the exchange of decentralized identifiers. This architecture implies that both parties will have tools that speak a common protocol. 
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Figure 2: Self-Sovereign Identity Stack (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the self-sovereign identity stack. The bottom two layers, the Verifiable Data Repositories and the Peer-to-Peer Agents make up what we refer to as the Identity Metasystem. The features of the metasystem architecture are our primary interest. I have written extensively about the details of the architecture of the metasystem in other posts (see <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/03/the_sovrin_ssi_stack.shtml">The Sovrin SSI Stack</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Decentralized Identifiers</a>). 
</p>

<p>
    The architecture of the metasystem has several important features:
</p>
 
     
        Mediated by protocol—Instead of being intermediated by an intervening administrative authority, activities in the metasystem are mediated through peer-to-peer protocol. Protocols are the foundation of interoperability and allow for scale. Protocols describe the rules for a set of interactions, specifying the kinds of interactions that can happen without being overly prescriptive about their nature or content. Consequently, the metasystem supports a flexible set of interactions that can be adapted for many different contexts and needs.
     
     Heterarchical—Interactions in the metasystem are peer-to-peer rather than hierarchical. The are <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2015/01/re-imagining_decentralized_and_distributed.shtml">not just distributed, but decentralized</a>. Decentralization <a>enables autonomy and flexibility</a> and to assure its independence from the influence of any single actor. No centralized system can anticipate all the various use cases. And no single actor should be allowed to determine who uses the system or for what purposes.
     
     
        Consistent user experience—A consistent user experience doesn’t mean a single user interface. Rather the focus is on the experience. As an example, consider an automobile. My grandfather, who died in 1955, could get in a modern car and, with only a little instruction, successfully drive it. Consistent user experiences let people know what to expect so they can intuitively understand how to interact in any given situation regardless of context.
     
     
        Polymorphic—The information we need in any given relationship varies widely with context. The content that an identity metasystem carries must be flexible enough to support many different situations. 
     
 

<p>
    These architectural features give rise to a culture that I describe as protocological. The protocological culture of the identity metasystem has the following properties:
</p>
 
     Open and permissionless—The metasystem has the same three virtues of the Internet that <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/">Dave Weinberger</a>  <a href="http://www.worldofends.com/#BM_8">enumerated</a>: No one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Special care is taken to ensure that the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/05/the_impact_of_a_network_of_networks_on_censorship.shtml">metasystem is censorship resistant</a> so that everyone has access. The protocols and code that enable the metasystem are open source and available for review and improvement. 
     
     <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agentic">Agentic</a>—The metasystem allows allows people to act as autonomous agents, under their <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/cogito_ergo_sum.shtml">self-sovereign authority</a>. The most vital value proposition of self-sovereign identity is autonomy—not being inside someone else's administrative system where they make the rules in a one sided way. Autonomy requires that participants interact as peers in the system, which the architecture of the metasystem supports.
     
     Inclusive—Inclusivity is more than being open and permissionless. Inclusivity requires design that ensures people are not left behind. For example, some people cannot act for themselves for legal (e.g. minors) or other (e.g. refugees) reasons. Support for <a href="https://sovrin.org/guardianship/">digital guardianship</a> ensures that those who cannot act for themselves can still participate. 
     
     Flexible—The metasystem allows people to select appropriate service providers and features. No single system can anticipate all the scenarios that will be required for billions of individuals to live their own effective lives. A metasystem allows for context-specific scenarios.
     
     Modular—An identity metasystem can’t be a single, centralized system from a single vendor with limited pieces and parts. Rather, the metasystem will have interchangeable parts, built and operated by various parties. Protocols and standards enable this. Modularity supports substitutability, a key factor in autonomy and flexibility.
     
     Universal—Successful protocols eat other protocols until only one survives. An identity metasystem based on protocol will have network effects that drive interoperability leading to universality. This doesn't mean that one organization will have control, it means that one protocol will mediate all interaction and everyone in the ecosystem will conform to it. 
     
 

 Supporting Authentic Relationships 
<p>
    Self-sovereign identity envisions digital life that cannot be supported with traditional identity architectures. The architecture of self-sovereign identity and the culture that springs from it support richer, more authentic relationships:
</p>

 
     Self-sovereign identity provides people with the means of operationalizing their online relationships by providing them the tools for acting online as peers and managing the relationships they enter into.  
     Self-sovereign identity, through protocol, allows ad hoc interactions that were not or cannot be imagined a priori. 
 
<p>
    The following subsections give examples for each of these.
</p>


 Disintermediating Platforms 
<p>
    Many real-world experiences have been successfully digitized, but the resulting intermediation opens us to exploitation despite the conveniences. We need digitized experiences that respect human dignity and don't leave us open to being exploited for some company's advantage.  As an example consider how the identity metasystem could be the foundation for a system that <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">disintermediates the food delivery platforms</a>. Platform companies have been very successful in intermediating these exchanges and charging exorbitant rents for what ought to be a natural interaction among peers. 
</p>

<p>
    That's not to say platforms provide no value. The problem isn't that they charge for services, but that their intervening position gives them too much power to make markets and set prices. Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to participants: a means of discovering relevant service providers, a system to facilitate the transaction, and a trust framework to help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman puts it</a>. An identity metasystem supporting self-sovereign identity provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. Such a system with support for a token can even facilitate the transaction without anyone having an intervening position. 
</p>
<p>
    Disintermediating platforms requires creating a peer-to-peer marketplace on top of the metasystem. While the metasystem provides the means of creating and managing the peer-to-peer relationship, defining this marketplace requires determining the messages to be exchanged between participants and creating the means of discovery. These messages might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">exchanged using DIDComm</a>, or even ride on top of a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential exchange</a>. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, such a business might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define its menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but the merchant could replace it with a similar service, providing competition, because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>
<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. Because these results are achieved through protocol, we do not need to create new regulations that stifle innovation and lock in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. And these systems preserve human dignity and autonomy by removing administrative authorities.
</p>


 Digitizing Auto Accidents 

<p>
    As an example of the the kinds of interactions that people have every day that are difficult to bring into the administrative sphere, consider the interactions that occur between various participants and their representatives following an auto accident. Because these interactions are ad hoc, large parts of our lives have yet to enjoy the convenience of being digitized. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">You've Had an Automobile Accident</a>, I imagine a digital identity system that enables the kinds of ad hoc, messy, and unpredictable interactions that happen all the time in the physical world. 
</p>

<p>In this scenario, two drivers, Alice and Bob, have had an accident. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but the highway patrol has come to the scene to make an accident report. Both Alice and Bob have a number of credentials that will be necessary to create the report:</p>

 
     Proof of insurance issued by their respective insurance companies 
     Vehicle title from the state 
     Vehicle registration issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in different states (potentially) 
     Driver's license, potentially from a different agencies than the one who registers cars and potentially in different states 
 

<p>In addition, the police officer has a credentials from the Highway Patrol, Alice and Bob will make and sign statements, and the police officer will create an accident report. What's more, the owners of the vehicles may not be the drivers. </p>

<p>
    Now imagine you're building a startup to solve the "car accident use case." You imagine a platform to relate to all these participants and intermediate the exchange of all this information. To have value, it has to do more than provide a way to exchange PDFs and most if not all of the participants have to be on it. The system has to make the information usable. How do you get all the various insurance companies, state agencies, to say nothing of the many body shops and hospitals, fire departments, and ambulance companies on board? And yet, these kinds of ad hoc interactions confront us daily.
</p>


 Taking our Rightful Place in the Digital Sphere 

<p>
    Devon Leffreto <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2020/07/relationship-structures-matter.html">said something recently</a> that made me think:
</p>
<blockquote>
    You do not have an accurate operational relationship with your Government.
</blockquote>
<p>
    My thought was "not just government". The key word is "operational". People don't have operational relationships anywhere online.4  We have plenty of online relationships, but they are not operational because we are prevented from acting by their anemic natures. Our helplessness is the result of the power imbalance that is inherent in bureaucratic relationships. The solution to the anemic relationships created by administrative identity systems is to provide people with the tools they need to operationalize their self-sovereign authority and act as peers with others online. Scenarios like the ones envisioned in the preceding section happen all the time in the physical world—in fact they're the norm. When we dine at a restaurant or shop at a store in the physical world, we do not do so under some administrative system. Rather, as embodied agents, we operationalize our relationships, whether they be long-lived or nascent, by acting for ourselves. An identity metasystem provides people with the tools they need to be "embodied" in the digital world and act autonomously.
</p>

<p>
    Time and again, various people have tried to create decentralized marketplaces or social networks only to fail to gain traction. These systems fail because they are not based on a firm foundation that allows people to act in relationships with sovereign authority in systems mediated through protocol rather than companies. We have a fine example of a protocol mediated system in the internet, but we've failed to take up the daunting task of building the same kind of system for identity. Consequently, when we act, we do so without firm footing or sufficient leverage. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, the internet broke down the walled gardens of CompuServe and Prodigy with a protocol-mediated metasystem, but surveillance capitalism has rebuilt them on the web. No one could live an effective life in an amusement park. Similarly, we cannot function as fully embodied agents in the digital sphere within the administrative systems of surveillance capitalists, despite their attractions. The emergence of self-sovereign identity, agreements on protocols, and the creation of a metasystem to operationalize them promises a digital world where decentralized interactions create life-like online experiences. The identity metasystem and the richer relationships that result from it promise an online future that gives people the opportunity to act for themselves as autonomous human beings and supports their dignity so that they can live an effective online life.
</p>

 

 End Notes 
 
     Two of my friends at the time, Eric Thompson and Stacey Son were playing with FPGAs that could crack hashed passwords, so we were aware of the problems and did our best to mitigate them.  
     See Venkatesh Rao's <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">nice summary</a> of James C. Scott's seminal book on legibility and its unintended consequences, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8JJYWA/windleyofente-20">Seeing Like a State</a> for more on this idea.
      See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a> by Shoshana Zuboff for a detailed (705 page) exploration of this idea.  
     The one exception I can think of to this is email.  People act through email all the time in ways that aren't intermediated by their email provider. Again, it's a result of the architecture of email, set up over four decades ago and the culture that architecture supports.

author got it running too... I hope they had fun!</p>
<p>Apparently it appeared in the June 2020 edition:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I guess because print media coverage is smaller, it feels cooler to
get covered these days in it in some way?</p>
<p>I wonder if I can find a copy somewhere!</p>

  <p>Summary: Sovereign is the right word for describing the essential distinction between our inalienable self and the administrative identifiers and attributes others assign to us online.</p>


<a></a>


<p>
    Descartes didn't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum">say</a> "I have a birth certificate, therefore I am." We do not spring into existence because some administrative system provisions an identifer for us. No single administrative regime, or even a collection of them, defines us. <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> said this to me recently:
</p>
<blockquote>We are, within ourselves, what <a href="https://poets.org/poem/invictus">William Ernest Henley calls</a> “the captain” of “my unconquerable soul”, and what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7200015-i-know-i-am-deathless-i-know-this-orbit-of">Walt Whitman meant</a> when he said “I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,” and “I know that I am august. I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood.” Each of us has an inner essence that is who we are.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Even in the digital realm, and limiting ourselves to what <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu calls</a> "functional identity", we are more than any single <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">relationship</a>. Our identity is something we are, not something we have. And it's certainly not what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider">someone else provides</a> to us. We are self-sovereign. 
</p>

<p>
    Some shrink from the self-sovereign label. There are some good reasons for their reluctance. Self-sovereignty requires some explanation. And it has political overtones that make some uncomfortable. But I've decided to embrace it. Self-sovereign identity is more than decentralized identity. Self-sovereign identity implies autonomy and inalienability. 
</p>

<p>
    If our identity is inalienable, then it's <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/inalienable">not transferable to another and not capable of being taken away or denied</a>. To be inalienable is to be sovereign: to exercise supreme authority over one’s personal sphere—Whitman’s “orbit of mine.” Administrative identifiers, what others choose to call us, are alienable. Relationships are alienable. Most attributes are alienable1. Who we are, and our right to choose how we present ourselves to the world, is not alienable.  The distinction between the inalienable and the alienable, the self-sovereign and the administrative, is essential. Without this distinction, we are constantly at the mercy of the various administrative regimes we interact with. 
</p>

<p>
    Self-sovereignty is concerned with relationships and boundaries. When we say a nation is sovereign, we mean that it can act as a peer to other sovereign states, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/self_sovereign_is_not_self_asserted.shtml">not that it can do whatever it wants</a>. Sovereignty defines the source of our authority to act. Sovereignty defines a boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms. Self-sovereign identity defines the boundary in the digital space, gives tools to people and organizations so they can assert control—their autonomy, and defines the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">rules for how relationships are formed, authenticated, and used</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the opening chapter of her groundbreaking book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7UERGX/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, Shoshana Zuboff asks the question "Can the digital future be our home?" Not if it's based on administrative identity systems and the anemic, ofttimes dangerous, relationships they create. By starting with self-sovereignty, we found our digital relationships on principles that support and preserve human freedom, privacy, and dignity. So, while talking about trust, decentralization, credentials, wallets, and DIDs might help explain how self-sovereign identity works, sovereignty explains why we do it. If self-sovereignty requires explanation, maybe that's a feature, not a bug. 
</p>

 
 End Notes 
 
     I'm distinguishing attributes from traits without going too deep into that idea for now.

<p>I’ve been systematically working through all the open issues filed about the OpenID Connect Logout specs in preparation for advancing them to Final Specification status.  I’m pleased to report that I’ve released drafts that address all these issues.  The new drafts are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0-01.html">OpenID Connect RP-Initiated Logout 1.0 – draft 01</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0-30.html">OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0 – draft 30</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-04.html">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 04</a> 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0-06.html">OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0 – draft 06</a> 
 
<p>The OpenID Connect working group waited to make these Final Specifications until we received feedback resulting from certification of logout deployments.  Indeed, this feedback identified a few ambiguities and deficiencies in the specifications, which have been addressed in the latest edits.  You can see the certified logout implementations at <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">https://openid.net/certification/</a>.  We encourage you to likewise certify your implementations now.</p>
<p>Please see the latest History entries in the specifications for descriptions of the normative changes made.  The history entries list the issue numbers addressed.  The issues can be viewed in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">OpenID Connect issue tracker</a>, including links to the commits containing the changes that resolved them.</p>
<p>All are encouraged to review these drafts in advance of the formal OpenID Foundation review period for them, which should commence in a few weeks.  If you believe that changes are needed before they become Final Specifications, please file issues describing the proposed changes.  Discussion on the <a href="mailto:openid-specs-ab@lists.openid.net">OpenID Connect mailing list</a> is also encouraged.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for writing the initial logout certification tests.  And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_panva">Filip Skokan</a> for providing resolutions to two of the thornier Session Management issues.</p>

 <p>Is this the way you want your brand to look?</p> 
<p>Digital advertising needs to sniff its own stench, instead of everybody’s digital butts.</p>
<p>A sample of that stench is wafting through the interwebs from&nbsp; the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>, an ad industry bullphemism for yet another way to excuse the urge to keep tracking people against their wishes (and simple good manners) all over the digital world.</p>
<p>This new thing is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granfalloon">granfalloon</a> conjured by the <a href="https://www.ana.net/about">Association of National Advertisers</a>&nbsp;(aka the <a href="https://www.ana.net/">ANA</a>) and announced today in the faux-news style of the press release (which it no doubt also is) at the first link above. It begins,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AD INDUSTRY LAUNCHES “PARTNERSHIP FOR RESPONSIBLE ADDRESSABLE MEDIA” TO ENSURE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESSES &amp; CONSUMERS<br>
Governing Group of Industry Leaders Includes 4A’s, ANA, IAB, IAB Tech Lab, NAI, WFA, P&amp;G, Unilever, Ford, GM, IBM, NBCUniversal, IPG, Publicis, Adobe, LiveRamp, MediaMath, The Trade Desk</p>
<p>NEW YORK (August 4, 2020) — Leading trade associations and companies representing every sector of the global advertising industry today joined together to launch the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, an initiative to advance and protect critical functionalities like customization and analytics for digital media and advertising, while safeguarding privacy and improving the consumer experience. The governing group of the Partnership will include the most influential organizations in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned about this from&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/wendyndavis">@WendyDavis</a>, who wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/354347/ad-industry-launches-new-organization-will-push-g.html">this piece</a> in <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/">MediaPost</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/">NiemanLab</a> summarizes what she reports with a <a href="https://twitter.com/NiemanLab/status/1290690368573526016">tweet</a> that reads, “A new ad-industry group will lobby Google and Apple to let them track users just a wee bit more, please and thank you.”</p>
<p>Writes Wendy,</p>
<blockquote><p>The group will soon reach out to browser developers and platforms, in hopes of convincing them to rethink recent decisions that will limit tracking, according to Venable attorney Stu Ingis, who will head the legal and policy working group.</p>
<p>“These companies are taking huge positions that impact the entire economy — the entire media ecosystem — with no real input from the media ecosystem,” Ingis says.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if the “entire media ecosystem” doesn’t contain the billions of humans being tracked.</p>
<p>Well, here’s a fact: ad blocking, which was already the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/">biggest boycott in world history</a>&nbsp;five years ago, didn’t happen in a vacuum. Even though ad blockers had been available since 2004, use of them didn’t hockey-stick until 2012-13, exactly when adtech and its dependents in publishing gave the middle finger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a>, which was nothing more than a polite request, expressed by a browser, for some damn privacy while we go about our lives online. See <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/11/ad-blockers-and-the-next-chapter-of-the-internet">this</a> in Harvard Business Review:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s another fact: the browser makers actually care about their users, some of whom are paying customers (for example with Apple and Microsoft). They know what we want and need, and are giving it to us. Demand and supply at work.</p>
<p>The GDPR and the CCPA also didn’t happen in a vacuum. Both laws were made to protect citizens from exactly what adtech (tracking based advertising) does. And, naturally, the ad biz has been working mightily to obey the letter of those laws while violating their spirit. Why else would we be urged by cookie notices everywhere to “accept” exactly what we’ve made very clear that we don’t want?</p>
<p>So here are some helpful questions from the world’s billions to the brands now paying to have us followed like marked animals:</p>
<p>Have you noticed that not a single brand known to the world has been created by tracking people and aiming ads at them—even after spending a $trillion or two on doing that?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nearly all the world’s major brands became known through advertising that not only didn’t track people, but <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advertising-30">sponsored</a> <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/09/01/journalism-2/">journalism</a> as well?</p>
<p>Have you noticed that tracking people and directing personalized messages at them—through “addressable media”—is in fact direct marketing, which we used to call junk mail?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Time to get the clues, ad biz. Brands too.</p>
<p>Start with&nbsp;<a href="http://cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>, which says, if you only have time for one clue this year, this is the one to get…</p>
<p>we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers.<br>
we are human beings — and our reach exceeds your grasp.<br>
deal with it.</p>
<p>That year was 1999.</p>
<p>If advertising and marketing had bothered to listen back then, they might not be dealing today with the GDPR, the CCPA, and the <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war/">earned dislike</a> of billions.</p>
<p>Next, please learn (or re-learn) the difference between real advertising and the junk message business. Find that lesson in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.i6msx57rv">Separating Advertising’s Wheat and Chaff</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>See, adtech did not spring from the loins of Madison Avenue. Instead its direct ancestor is what’s called&nbsp;direct response marketing. Before that, it was called&nbsp;direct mail, or&nbsp;junk mail. In metrics, methods and manners, it is little different from its closest relative, spam.</p>
<p>Direct response marketing has always wanted to get personal, has always been data-driven, has never attracted the creative talent for which Madison Avenue has been rightly famous.&nbsp;<a>Look up&nbsp;best ads of all time</a>&nbsp;and you’ll find nothing but wheat. No direct response or adtech postings, mailings or ad placements on phones or websites.</p>
<p>Yes, brand advertising has always been data-driven too, but the data that mattered was how many people were exposed to an ad, not how many clicked on one — or whether you, personally, did anything.</p>
<p>And yes, a lot of brand advertising is annoying. But at least we know it pays for the TV programs we watch and the publications we read. Wheat-producing advertisers are called “sponsors” for a reason.</p>
<p>So how did direct response marketing get to be called advertising ? By looking the same. Online it’s hard to tell the difference between a wheat ad and a chaff one.</p>
<p>Remember the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>?” (Or the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers_%281978_film%29">remake by the same name</a>?) Same thing here. Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what had happened to the ANA in 2018, when it <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/display-and-native-advertising/ana-association-of-national-advertisers-to-acquire-data-and-marketing-association/">acquired</a>&nbsp;what had been the Direct Marketing Association (aka DMA) and which by then called itself the&nbsp;Data &amp; Marketing Association.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/ResponsibleAddressableMedia">Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media</a>&nbsp;speaks in the voice of advertising’s alien replica. It does not “safeguard essential values in advertising as a positive economic force.” Instead it wants to keep using “addressable” advertising as the primary instrument of surveillance capitalism.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/theagency/what-if-we-don-t-need-advertising-at-all-cf8ae123f2d3#.r2dr769a8">Maybe it’s too late</a>&nbsp;to save advertising from its alien self. But perhaps not, if what’s left of advertising’s soul takes the writings of&nbsp;<a href="https://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/">Bob Hoffman</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/adcontrarian">@AdContrarian</a>) to heart. That’s the only way I know for advertising to clean up its act.</p>

<p>This post is just a record of the key insights I took away from Sam Harris’ enlightening <a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/211-the-nature-of-human-nature/">talk with Robert Plomin</a>.</p>
<p>I sure wish it were easier to capture and embed these kinds of audio segments, and to do so more effectively — ideally with transcription. It was way too much work to construct the URLs that deliver these segments into the embedded players I’ve included here, even with the <a href="http://jonudell.net/av/audio.html?url=https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/wakingup/Making_Sense_211_Plomin2028Paywall29.mp3&amp;startmin=58&amp;startsec=52&amp;endmin=62&amp;endsec=0">tool I made</a> for that purpose. It’s nice to have a standard embedded player, finally, but since it doesn’t show the endpoints of the segments you can’t tell they’re each just a few minutes. It looks like they all run to the end.</p>
<p>I wound up going to more trouble than it’s probably worth to convey the most memorable parts of that excellent podcast, and I don’t have time to transcribe more fully, but for what it’s worth, here are the segments that I’ll be remembering.</p>
<p>1. “The most important thing we’ve learned from the DNA revolution in the last 10 years is that genetic influences on complex traits are due to thousands of tiny DNA differences.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. “These polygenic scores are perfectly normally distributed.”<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. “I’m saying there are no disorders, there are just quantitative dimensions.”</p>

<p>Zeynep Tufekci, in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/why-arent-we-talking-more-about-airborne-transmission/614737/" title="We Need to Talk About Ventilation">a piece</a> for The Atlantic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jimenez also wondered why the National Guard hadn’t been deployed to set up
tent schools (not sealed, but letting air in like an outdoor wedding canopy)
around the country, and why the U.S. hadn’t set up the mass production of HEPA
filters for every classroom and essential indoor space. Instead, one
air-quality expert reported, teachers who wanted to buy portable HEPA filters
were being told that <a href="https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1286300608836907009">they weren’t allowed</a> to, because the CDC wasn’t
recommending them. It is still difficult to get Clorox wipes in my
supermarket, but I went online to check, and there is no shortage of portable
HEPA filters. There is no run on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/scourge-hygiene-theater/614599/" title="Hygiene Theater Is a Huge Waste of Time">hygiene theater</a> to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.<a>1</a> It simply won’t
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.</p>
<p>And it’s not like there aren’t ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Japan masked up early, focused on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32611985/" title="Cluster-based approach to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response in Japan-February-April 2020">super-spreader events</a> (a strategy
it calls “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-japan-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-11594163172" title="How Japan Beat Coronavirus Without Lockdowns">cluster busting</a>”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-japan-has-long-accepted-covids-airborne-spread-and-scientists-say-ventilation-is-key/" title="Japan has long accepted COVID's airborne spread, and scientists say ventilation is key">where
windows were kept open</a>. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In fairness, the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020/health-and-safety">Health and Safety</a> section the New York
City DOE’s <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-year-20-21/return-to-school-2020">Return to School 2020-2021</a> plan says that the “DOE will make
improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to improve
air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with higher
efficiency types.” Still, there’s a social failing here, national leaders
ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the highest
standards in every school and classroom in the United States. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  <p>Summary:      We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    The most problematic word in the term <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> isn't "sovereign" but "identity" because whenever you start discussing identity, the conversation is rife with unspoken assumptions. Identity usually conjures thoughts of authentication and various federation schemes that purport to make authentication easier. I frequently point out that even though SSI has "identity" in it's name, there's no artifact in SSI called an "identity." Instead the user experience in an SSI system is based on forming relationships and using credentials.
</p>

<p>
    I've been thinking a lot lately about the role of relationships in digital identity systems and have come to the conclusion that we've been working on building building systems that support digital relationships without acknowledging the importance of relationships or using them in our designs and architectures.  The reason we build identity systems isn't to manage identities, it's to support digital relationships. 
</p>
<p>
    I recently read and then reread a 2011 paper called <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2163241">Identities Evolve: Why Federated Identity is Easier Said than Done</a> from <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>. Despite being almost ten years old, the paper is still relevant, full of good analysis and interesting ideas. Among those is the idea that the the goal of using federation schemes to create a few identities that serve all purposes is deeply flawed. Steve's point is that we have so many identities because we have have lots of relationships. The identity data for a given relationship is contextual and highly evolved to fit its specific niche. 
</p>

<p>
    Steve's discussion reminded me of a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/samramji/darwins-finches-20th-century-business-and-apis/119">talk Sam Ramji used to give about speciation of APIs</a>. Sam illustrated his talk with a picture from <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/evolution-scientific-theory/Adaptive-radiation">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> to show adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches in response to evolutionary pressure. These 14 different finches all share a common ancestor, but ended up with quite different features because of specialization for a particular niche.
</p>

	<a></a>
	Adaptive radiation in Galapagos finches (click to enlarge)

<p>
    In the same way, each of us have hundreds, even thousands, of online relationships. They each have a common root but are highly contextualized. Some are long-lived, some are ephemeral. Some are personal, some are commercial. Some are important, some are trivial. Still, we have them. The information about ourselves, what many refer to as identity data, that we share with each is just as adapted to the specific niche that the relationship represents as the Galapagos finches are to their niches. Once you realize this, the idea of creating a few online identities to serve all needs becomes preposterous. 
</p>

<p>
    Not only is each relationship evolved for a particular niche, but it is also constantly changing. Often those changes are just more of what's already there. For example, my Netflix account represents a relationship between me and Netflix. It's constantly being updated with my viewing data but not changing dramatically in structure. But some changes are larger. For example, it also allows me to create additional profiles which makes the relationship specialized for the specific members of my household. And when Netflix moved from DVDs only to streaming, the nature of my relationship with Netflix changed significantly.
</p>

<p>
    I'm convinced that identity systems would be better architected if we were more intentional about their need to support specialized relationships spanning millions of potential relationship types. This article is aimed at better understanding the nature of digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationships 

<p>
    One of the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/10/fixing_the_five_problems_of_internet_identity.shtml">fundamental problems of internet identity</a> is proximity. Because we're not interacting with people physically, our natural means of knowing who we're dealing with are useless. <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu defines identity</a> as "how we recognize, remember, and respond" to another entity. These three activities correspond to three properties digital relationships must have to overcome the proximity problem: 
</p>
 
     Integrity—we want to know that, from interaction to interaction, we're dealing with the same entity we were before. In other words, we want to identify them. 
     Lifespan—normally we want relationships to be long-lived, although we also create ephemeral relationships for short-lived interactions.  
     Utility—we create online relationships in order to use them within a specific context. 
 

<p>
    We'll discuss each of these in detail below, followed by a discussion of risk in digital relationships.
</p>

 Relationship Integrity 

<p>
    Without integrity, we cannot recognize the other party to the relationship. Consequently, all identity systems manage relationship integrity as a foundational capability. Federated identity systems improve on one-off, often custom identity systems by providing integrity in a way that reduces user management overhead for the organization, increases convenience for the user, and increases security by eliminating the need to create one-off, proprietary solutions. SSI aims to establish integrity with the convenience of the federated model but without relying on an intervening IdP in order to provide autonomy and privacy. 
</p>

<p>
    A relationship has two parties, let's call them P1 and P2.1 P1 is connecting with P2 and, as a result, P1 and P2 will have a relationship. P1 and P2 could be people, organizations, or things represented by a website, app, or service. Recognizing the other party in an online relationship relies on being able to know that you're dealing with the same entity each time you encounter them. 
</p>

<p>
    In a typical administrative identity system, when P1 initiates a relationship with P2, P2 typically uses usernames and passwords to ensure the integrity of the relationship. By asking for a username to identify P1 and a password to ensure that it's the same P1 as before, P2 has some assurance that they are interacting with P1. In this model, P1 and P2 are not peers. Rather P2 controls the system and determines how and for what it is used. 
</p>

<p>
    In a federated flow, P1 is usually called the subject or consumer and P2 is called the relying party (RP). When the consumer visits the RP's site or opens their app, they are offered the opportunity to establish a relationship through an identity provider (IdP) whom the RP trusts. The consumer may or may not have a relationship with an IdP the RP trusts. RPs pick well-known IdPs with large numbers of users to reduce friction in signing up. The consumer chooses which IdP they want to use from the relying party's menu and is redirected to the IdP's identity service where they present a username and password to the IdP, are authenticated, and redirected back to the RP. As part of this flow, the RP gets some kind of token from the IdP that signifies that the IdP will vouch for this person. They may also get attributes that the IdP has stored for the consumer.2  
</p>

<p>
    In the federated model, the IdP is identifying the person and attesting the integrity of the relationship to the RP. The IdP is a third party, P3, who acts as an intervening administrative authority. Without their service, the RP may not have an alternative means of assuring themselves that the relationship has integrity over time. On the other hand, the person gets no assurance from the identity system about relationship integrity in this model. For that they must rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which is visible in a web interaction, but largely hidden inside an app on a mobile device.  P1 and P2 are not peers in the federated model. Instead, P1 is subject to the administrative control of both the IdP and the RP. Further, the RP us subject to the administrative control of the IdP. 
</p>

<p>
    In SSI, a relationship is initiated when P1 and P2 exchange <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">decentralized identifiers</a> (DID). For example, when a person visits a web site or app, they are presented with a connection invitation. When they accept the invitation, they use a software agent to share a DID that they created. In turn, they receive a DID from the web site, app, or service.  We call this a "connection" since DIDs are cryptographically based and thus provide a means of both parties mutually authenticating. The user experience does not necessarily surface all this activity to the user. To get a feel for the user experience, run through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a>3.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast to the federated model, the participants in SSI mutually authenticate and the relationship has integrity without the intervention of a third party. By exchanging DIDs both parties have also exchanged public keys. They can consequently use cryptographic means to ensure they are interacting with the party who controls the DID they received when the relationship was initiated. Mutual authentication, based on self-initiated DIDs provides SSI relationships with inherent integrity. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2016/10/on_sovereignty.shtml">P1 and P2 are peers in SSI</a> since they both have equal control over the relationship. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to removing the need for intermediaries to vouch for the integrity of the relationship, the peer nature of relationships in SSI also means that neither party has access to the authentication credentials of the other. Mutual authentication means that each party manages their own keys and never shares the private key with another party. Consequently, attacks, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised">recent attack on Twitter accounts</a> can't happen in SSI because there's no administrator who has access to the credentials of everyone using the system. 
</p>

 Relationship Lifespan 

<p>
    Whether in the physical world or digital, relationships have lifespans. Some relationships are long-lived, some are short-term, and others are ephemeral, existing only for the duration of a single interaction. We typically don't think of it this way, but every interaction we have in the physical world, no matter for what purpose or how short, sets up a relationship. So too in the digital world, although our tools, especially as people online, have been sorely lacking. 
</p>

<p>
    I believe one of the biggest failings of modern digital identity systems is our failure to recognize that people often want, even need, short-lived relationships. Think about your day for a minute. How many people and organizations did you interact with in the physical world4 where you established a permanent relationship? What if whenever you stopped in the convenience store for a cup of coffee, you had to create a permanent relationship with the coffee machine, the cashier, the point of sale terminal, and the customers in line ahead and behind you? Sounds ridiculous. But that's what most digital interactions require. At every turn we're asked to establish permanent accounts to transact and interact online. 
</p>

<p>
    There are several reasons for this. The biggest one is that every Web site, app, or service wants to send you ads, at best, or track you on other sites, at worst. Unneeded, long-lived relationships are the foundation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance economy</a> that has come to define the modern online experience. 
</p>

<p>
    There are a number of services I want a long-lived relationship with. I value my relationships with Amazon and Netflix, for example. But there are many things I just need to remember for the length of the interaction. I ordered some bolts for a car top carrier from a specialty place a few weeks ago. I don't order bolts all the time, so I just want to place my order and be done. I want an ephemeral relationship. The Internet of Things will increase the need for ephemeral relationships. When I open a door with my digital credential, I don't want the hassle of creating a long-term relationship with it; I just want to open the door and then forget about it. 
</p>

<p>
    Digital relationships should be easy to set up and tear down. They should allow for the relationship to grow over time, if both parties desire. While they exist, they should be easily managable while providing all the tools for the needed utility. Unless there's long term benefit to me, I shouldn't need to create a long term relationship. And when a digital relationship ends, it should really be over. 
</p>



 Relationship Utility 

<p>
    Obviously, we don't create digital relationships just so we can authenticate the other party. Integrity is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for an identity system.  This is where most identity models fall short. We can understand why this is so given the evolution of the modern Web. For the most part, user-centric identity really took off when the web gave people reasons to visit places they didn't have a physical relationship with, like an ecommerce web site. Once the identity system had established the integrity of the relationship, at least from the web site's perspective, we expected HTTP would provide the rest.
</p>

<p>
    Most Identity and Access Management systems don't provide much beyond integrity except possibly access control. Once Facebook has established who you are, it knows just what resources to let you see or change.  But as more and more of our lives are intermediated by digital services, we need more utility from the identity system than simple access control. The most that an IdP can provide in the federated model is integrity and, perhaps, a handful of  almost-always-self-asserted attributes in a static, uncustomizable schema. But rich relationships require much more than that.
</p>

<p>
    Relationships are established to provide utility. An ecommerce site wants to sell you things. A social media site wants to show you ads. Thus, their identity systems, built around the IAM system, are designed to do far more than just establish the integrity of the relationship. They want to store data about you and your activities. For the most part this is welcome. I love that Amazon shows me my past orders, Netflix remembers where I was in a series, and Twitter keeps track of my followers and past tweets. 
</p>

<p>
    The true identity system is much, much larger and specialized than the IAM portion. All of the account or profile data these companies use is properly thought of as part of the identity system that they build and run. Returning to <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/five-mental-models-of-identity.md">Joe Andrieu</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>Identity systems acquire, correlate, apply, reason over, and govern [the] information assets of subjects, identifiers, attributes, raw data, and context.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Regardless of whether or not they outsource the integrity of their relationships (and notice that none of the companies I list above do), companies still have to keep track of the relationships they have with customers or users in order to provide the service they promise. They can't outsource this to a third party because the data in their identity system has evolved to suit the needs of the specific relationship. We'll never have a single identity that serves all relationships because they are unique contexts that demand their own identity data. Rip out the identity system from a Netflix or Amazon and it won't be the same company anymore.
</p>

<p>
    This leads us to a simple, but important conclusion: You can't outsource a relationship. Online apps and services decorate the relationship with information they observe, and use that information to provide utility to the relationships they administer. Doing this, and doing it well is the foundation of the modern web. 
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, the bad news is that SSI is not going to reduce the need for companies to <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">build, manage, and use identity systems</a>. Their identity systems are what make them what they are—there is no "one size fits all" model. The good news is that SSI makes online relationships richer. Relationships are easier and less expensive to manage, not just for companies, but for people too. Here's some of the ways SSI will enhance the utility of digital relationships:
</p>

 
     Richer, more trustworthy data—Relationships change over time because the parties change. We want to reliably ascertain facts about the other party in a relationship, not just from direct observation, but also from third parties in a trustworthy manner to build confidence in the actions of the other party within a specific context. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">Verifiable credentials</a>, self-issued or from others, allow relationships to be enhanced incrementally as the relationships matures or changes. 
     
     Autonomy and choice through peer relationships—Peer relationship give each party more autonomy than traditional administrative identity systems have provided. And, through standardization and substitutability, SSI gives participants choice in what vendors and agents they employ to manage their relationships. The current state of digital identity is asymmetric, providing companies with tools that are difficult or unwieldy for people to use. People like <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> and organizations like <a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2019/05/13/me2b-2/">Project VRM</a> and the <a href="https://www.me2b.us">Me2B Alliance</a> argue that people need tools for managing online relationships too. SSI provides people with tools and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy</a> to manage their online relationships with companies and each other. 
     
     Better, more secure communications—DID exchange provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">private, secure messaging channel</a> using the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm protocol</a>. This messaging channel is mutually recognized, authenticated, and encrypted. 
     Unifying, interoperable protocol for data transmission—DIDs and Verifiable Credentials, and DIDComm provides a standardized, secure means of interaction. Just like URLs, HTML, and HTTP provided for an interoperable web that led to an explosion of uses, the common protocol of SSI will ensure everyone benefits from the network effects. 
     
     Consistent user experience—Similarly, SSI provides a consistent user experience, regardless of what digital wallet people use. SSI's user experience is centered on relationships and credentials, not arcane addresses and keys. The user experience mirrors the experience people have of managing credentials in the physical world. 
     
     Support for ad hoc digital interactions—The real world is messy and unpredictable. <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">SSI is flexible enough to support the various ad hoc scenarios</a> that the world presents us and supports sharing multiple credentials from various authorities in the ways the scenario demands.
     
 

<p>
    These benefits are delivered using an architecture that provides a common, interoperable layer, called the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a>, upon with <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">anyone can build the identity systems they need</a>. A ubiquitous identity layer for the internet must be a metasystem that provides the building blocks and protocols necessary for others to build identity systems that meet the needs of any specific context or domain. An identity metasystem is a prerequisite for an online world where identity is as natural as it is in the physical world. An identity metasystem can remove friction, decrease cognitive overload, and make online interactions more private and secure.
</p>

 Relationships, Risk, and Trust 

<p>
    Trust is a popular term in the SSI community. People like Steve Wilson and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/about-kaliya/bio/">Kaliya Young</a> rightly ask about risk whenever someone in the identity community talks about trust. Because of the proximity problem, digital relationships are potentially risky. One of the goals of an identity system is to provide evidence that can be used in the risk calculation. 
</p>

<p>
    In their excellent paper, <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/NICTAR-2">Risk and Trust</a>, Nickel and Vaesen define trust as the "disposition to willingly rely on another person or entity to perform actions that benefit or protect oneself or one’s interests in a given domain." From this definition, we see why crypto-proponents often say "To trust is good, but to not trust is better." The point being that not having to rely on some other human, or human-mediated process is more likely to result in a beneficial outcome because it reduces the risk of non-performance. 
</p>

<p>
    Relationships imply a shared domain, context, and set of activities. We often rely on third parties to tell us things relevant to the relationship. Our vulnerability, and therefore our risk, depends on the degree of reliance we have on another party's performance.  Relationships can never be "no trust" because of the very reasons we create relationships. Bitcoin, and similar systems, can be low or no trust precisely because the point of the system is to reduce the reliance on any relationship at all. The good news, is the architecture of the SSI stack significantly limits the ways we must rely on external parties for the exchange of information via verifiable credentials and thus reduces the vulnerability of parties inside and outside of the relationship. The SSI identity metasystem clearly delineates the parts of the system that are low trust and those where human processes are still necessary. 
</p>

<p>
    The exchange of verifiable credentials can be split into two distinct parts as shown in the following diagram. SSI reduces risk in remote relationships using the properties of these two layers to combine cryptographic processes with human processes. 
</p>

	<a></a>
	SSI Stack (click to enlarge)



<p>
    The bottom layer, labeled Identity Metasystem, comprises two components: a set of verifiable data repositories for storing metadata about credentials and a processing layer supported by protocols and practices for the transport and validation of credentials. Timothy Ruff <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0">uses the analogy of shipping containers</a> to describe the identity metasystem. Verifiable credentials are analogous to shipping containers and the metasystem is analogous to the shipping infrastructure that makes intermodal shipping so efficient and secure. The Identity Metasystem provides a standardized infrastructure that similarly increases the efficiency and security of data interchange via credentials. 
</p>

<p>
    The top layer, labeled Identity Systems, is where people and organizations determine what credentials to issue, determine what credentials to seek and hold, and determine which credentials to accept. This layer comprises the individual credential exchange ecosystems that spring up and the governance processes for managing those credential ecosystems. In Timothy's analogy to shipping containers, this layer is about the data—the cargo—that the credential is carrying.
</p>

<p>
    The Identity Metasystem allows verifiable credentials can be cryptographically checked to ensure four key properties that relate to the risk profile. 
</p>
 
     Who issued the credential? 
     Was the credential issued to the party presenting it? 
     Has the credential been tampered with? 
     Has the credential been revoked? 
 
<p>
    These checks show the fidelity of the credential and are done without the verifier needing a relationship with the issuer. And because they're automatically performed by the Identity Metasystem, they significantly reduce the risk related to using data transferred using verifiable credentials. This is the portion of credential exchange that could be properly labeled "low or no trust" since the metasystem is built on standards that ensure the cryptographic verifiability of fidelity without reliance on humans and human-mediated processes. 
</p>

<p>
    The upper, Identity Systems, layer is different. Here we are very much relying on the credential issuer. Some of the questions we might ask include:
</p>
 
     Is the credential issuer, as shown by the identifier in the credential, the organization we think they are? 
     Is the organization properly accredited in whatever domain they're operating in?  
     What data did the issuer include in the credential? 
     What is the source of that data? 
     How has that data been processed and protected?  
 

<p>
    These questions are not automatically verifiable in the way we can verify the fidelity of a credential. They are different for each domain and perhaps different for each type of relationship based on the vulnerability of the parties to the data in the credential and their appetite for risk. Their answers depend on the provenance of the data in the credential. We would expect to see credential verifier's perform provenance checks by answering these and other questions during the process they use to establish trust in the issuer. Once the verifier has established this trust, the effort needed to evaluate the provenance of the data in a credential should cease or be greatly reduced.  
</p>

<p>
    As parties in a relationship share data with each other, the credential verifier will spend effort evaluating the provenance of issuers of credentials they have not previously evaluated. Once that is done, the metasystem will provide fidelity checks on each transaction. For the most part, SSI does not impose new ways of making these risk evaluations. Rather, most domains already have processes for establishing the provenance of data. For example, we know how to determine if a bank is a bank, the accreditation status of a university, and the legitimacy of a business. Companies with heavy reliance on properties of their supply chain, like pharmaceuticals, already have processes for establishing the provenance of the supply chain. For the most part, verifiable credential exchange will faithfully present digital representations of the kinds of physical world processes, credentials, and data we already know how to evaluate.  Consequently, SSI promises to significantly reduce the cost of reducing risk in remote relationships without requiring wholesale changes to existing business practices. 
</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>
    Relationships have always been the reason we created digital identity systems. Our historic focus on relationship integrity and IAM made modern Web 2.0 platforms and services possible, but has limited use cases, reduced interoperability, and left people open to privacy and security breaches. By focusing on peer relationships supported by an Identity Metasystem, SSI not only improves relationships integrity but also better supports flexible relationship lifecycles, more functional, trustworthy relationship utility, and provides tools for participants to correctly gauge, respond to, and reduce risks inherent in remote relationships. 
</p>


 

 Notes 
 
     For simplicity, I'm going to limit this discussion to two-party relationships, not groups. 
     I've described federation initialization very generally here and left out a number of details that distinguish various federation architectures.  
     Connect.me is just one of a handful of digital wallets that support the same SSI user experience. Others vendors include <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a>, <a href="https://idramp.com/">ID Ramp</a>, and <a href="https://self-ssi.com/en/">eSatus AG</a>. 
      Actually, imagine a day before Covid-19 lockdown.

 <p>Radio is moving from these to servers of streams and podcasts.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Public-Radio-What-is-the-best-NPR-station-in-the-country">Public Radio: What is the best NPR station in the country</a>? That’s a question on Quora I thought needed answering. So I did, with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s a quantitative answer to your qualitative question:&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WVPS">WVPS</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a title="www.vpr.org" href="https://www.vpr.org/#stream%2F0">Vermont Public Radio</a>. Because, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb_menu_rank">Nielsen’s Audio Ratings</a>, it scores a 12.6 in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb505">its home market of Burlington</a>, and a 16.2 in its neighbor market of<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb432">&nbsp;Montpelier-Waterbury</a>. Far as I know, those are tops among all the country’s NPR-affiliated stations.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions go to WUOM&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb581">in Ann Arbor</a>&nbsp;with a 13.0, KCLU&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/cgi-bin/rol.exe/arb591">in Santa Barbara</a>&nbsp;with a 10.2—plus others you’ll find if you follow the links in&nbsp;<a title="blogs.harvard.edu" href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2019/04/04/public/">Where Public Radio Rocks</a>, which I published in April of last year. All the numbers I sourced have changed since then, but they’re easy to find at the links I provided.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, “best” will come to mean&nbsp;which stations, producers and distributors are best at streaming and podcasting. Because that’s where listening is headed. Vermont Public Radio makes that clear on their own website, which appends “#stream/0” to its URL when you go there—and does its best, on the site, to encourage listening over-the-net rather than just over-the-air.</p>
<p>At this point in history, nearly all radio stations already stream, for a good reason: in the digital world, where every one of us with a smartphone and a data plan has the best radio ever made, antique broadcast virtues such as “range” and “coverage” have become bugs. This is why, when my family drove around Spain in a rental car last summer, we listened to KCLU from our home town of Santa Barbara, piped from one of our phones through the car’s entertainment system (which is no longer called a “radio”). It’s also why, when I’m up early on the West Coast, I often listen to WBUR from Boston or WNYC from New York, my other home towns. (I get around—or at least I did before the plague.)</p>
<p>The streaming numbers in Nielsen’s ratings are still low, but they are growing, and in many markets exceed the numbers for nearly all the remaining AM stations. For example, in&nbsp;<a title="ratings.radio-online.com" href="https://ratings.radio-online.com/content/arb015">the latest ratings for Washington, DC,</a>&nbsp;36 stations are listed: 33 FM, 2 streams and 2 AM. Those are drawn from a roster of 52 FM and 35 AM stations with listenable signals in Washington (according to&nbsp;<a title="radio-locator.com" href="http://radio-locator.com/">radio-locator.com</a>)—and 6 of those FM signals are translators for AM stations, including the two AMs that show in the ratings (which means that even the ratings for AM stations were likely for those stations’ FM signals).</p>
<p>Also, while&nbsp;streaming&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;stations,&nbsp;podcasting&nbsp;is the big trend for&nbsp;programming, aka “content.” Podcasting is exploding now, and earning ever-larger slices of the listening pie, which is a finite sum of people’s time. Podcasting wins at this because it has far more optionality than live over-the-air radio. You can listen when you like, slide forward and backward through a show, jump past ads or skip over topics you’d rather miss, and listen at 1.5x or 2x the normal speed. Those are huge advantages.</p>
<p>It’s also not for nothing that SiriusXM just paid $325 for Stitcher (<a title="variety.com" href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-325-million-1234704617/#!">says Variety)</a>, and not long before that Spotify&nbsp;<a title="www.msn.com" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/joe-rogan-signs-exclusive-100-million-podcast-deal-with-spotify/ar-BB14jDHC">paid $100 million</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan">Joe Rogan</a>’s podcast and (<a title="www.businessinsider.com" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-ringer-deal-price-250-million-podcasting-bill-simmons-report-2020-2">according to Business Inside</a>r) nearly $200 million for&nbsp;<a title="www.theringer.com" href="https://www.theringer.com/">The Ringer</a>&nbsp;and “nearly $400 million in recent purchases of Gimlet Media, Anchor, and Parcast.”</p>
<p>For that kind of money you could buy every AM and FM station in New York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Noncommercial players are also looking pretty good in the podcasting world as well.&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">According to Podtrac</a>, NPR is the #1 podcast publisher and PRX is #5. Also showing well are WNYC Studios, This American Life/Serial and American Public Media. NPR also has 9 of&nbsp;<a title="analytics.podtrac.com" href="http://analytics.podtrac.com/industry-rankings/">the top 20 podcasts</a>. In fact the majority (11) of those top 20 are from public radio sources.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the public stations with head starts in podcast production are WBEZ in Chicago, WBUR in Boston, WNYC in New York, KQED in San Francisco, KPCC and KCRW in Los Angeles and others you’ll hear credited when they open or close a show.</p>
<p>But it’s early. Expect lots of change in the coming months and years as many podcast creators, producers and distributors jockey for positions in two races. One is the free public one, syndicated by&nbsp;<a title="en.wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>&nbsp;on the open Internet and ready to hear on any browser, app or device. The other is the private subscription one, available only through the owner’s services. This is clearly where SiriusXM and Spotify are both going. SiriusXM is audible only by subscription, while Spotify remains $free (for now) but exclusive. (For example, Michelle Obama’s&nbsp;<a title="open.spotify.com" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/71mvGXupfKcmO6jlmOJQTP">new podcast</a>&nbsp;is available only on Spotify.) This split, between free/open and paid/closed, will be a big story over the coming years.</p>
<p>So, in the meantime, hats off to Vermont Public Radio for being the top public radio operation in the country—at least in its markets’ ratings. And stay tuned for the fights among players in streaming and podcasting.</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect VPR will continue being the alpha broadcasting, streaming and podcasting service in its home state, both because it does a great job and because Vermont is very much a collection of communities that have come to depend on it.</p>

<p>This should have been a tweet. But the format was not&nbsp;fitting.</p><p>The promise of a personal decentralized identity is that the trust component involved in your use of credentials in the real world can be replicated online. In the real world, when you present your driving license to a law enforcement officer during a periodical check, the officer checks its validity and legitimacy by looking at specific features on your driving license. Since they are a trained eye, the error rate in verifying your document is lower than what a layman would have and the accuracy even better when the officer is aided by tools such as UV light to check for holograms and other security features. Once they are satisfied with your document, you can proceed with your business or transaction at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>It may seem straightforward that the scenario described is replicable digitally. If the interaction between you and an academic officer or a law enforcement officer was digital, you would send a scanned copy of your driving license or school leaving certificate over email or through an online portal. Once submitted, they verify security features on the documents and either involve a senior officer or send them to a verifying body to ascertain authenticity. This takes time and before you get a confirmation that your document was approved, and that you can proceed with your intended activity, days are gone not to mention the opportunity cost involved.</p><p>While that has been largely the case in our regular interactions involving using our identifying documents and issued credentials, the bottlenecks can be minimized to make processes smoother. We should note that the document, the primary actor in the entire interaction/exchange is not truly digital. It is a scan, an image or a photograph of your certificate or license. You and I (the humans) can read and make out the information contained there. Computers cannot. We are in 2020. Computers should. If your documents were machine readable, computer systems that handle them would be able to process the information, and heck, even verify the information by themselves. Some documents today are machine readable and make information systems very efficient. But there should be a way to make this the new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Enter Verifiable Credentials (VCs). An open standard that forward thinking technologists and organizations, after facing the frustrations described and seeing the potential value being locked up in non-machine-verifiable documents, came up with under the World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>). Verifiable Credentials support machine-to-machine communication and their proofs (security features) can be verified cryptographically using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Issuing and Verifying authorities have their work made easier as they can independently check a common registry for proofs regarding the individual and the credential presented. There is no need for a third party to countercheck where the Mathematical proofs are well implemented and the registry, once written on is tamper proof. Such a database could be a blockchain or a sufficiently consensus driven distributed ledger.</p>Figure 1: Exchange of Verifiable Credentials between Issuer, Holder, and Verifier.<p>Why should you care? Well, in this COVID-19 era, we are all trying to avoid unnecessary human contact. Because of Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt, even documents are being quarantined if physical copies are exchanged and more services now insist on digital forms of documents. That’s where Verifiable Credentials come in. It should be possible, once available, that a certificate proving you have been vaccinated against corona virus or that you graduated from university remotely, is shared as a Verifiable Credential. One noteworthy forward thinking initiative that is working on making this a reality is the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). Vibranium ID is a part of it. The work of the initiative is not restricted to the pandemic as a reactive response but is a basis as to how we can unlock the promise of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Fun fact: After the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L7V2mXWUO5fjiwJODyq_wMvkL9EDSf3m7emLxLpvzTk/edit#">Governance Framework (GF) of the CCI</a> approved the CCI GF, three Kenyan software developers (Mbora Maina, Amos Kibet, Chris Achinga) and I translated the document into <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejnylgHi-A_nZeZrnwBjaWzhjPIDq8ETMMJiiwKZbm0/edit?usp=sharing">Kiswahili</a>. The translation gives context as to the practicability of VCs in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Innovation waits for no man. The pandemic has proved so. The adjustment brought by this disease has surely made some processes redundant and will bring gamechanging technologies to the foreground. As Peter Drucker famously said, “Innovate or&nbsp;die”.</p><p>References</p><p>Figure 1: A Verifiable Credentials Primer, by Manu Sporny, Digital&nbsp;Bazaar</p><p>W3C Verifiable Credentials - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/digital-credentials-for-a-safer-world-37a2e1694791">Digital Credentials for a Safer World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>来る日本時間7月28日午前3:30から、「So You Want to Base on Consent?」というタイトルでIdentiverseで講演します。</p>



<p>このタイトルは、グレン・グールドの「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲から着想を得たもので、ある意味無謀なことを、といいながら、じゃぁどうしたらよいのかということをISO/IEC 29184 から抽出してお話します。</p>



<p>この「So You Want to Write a Fugue?」という曲の出だしの歌詞、こうなんです。</p>



<blockquote><p>So you want to write a fugue?<br>You’ve got the Urge to write a fugue, <br>You’ve got the nerve to write a fugue, <br>So go ahead. </p>Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue (1963)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、フーガが書きたいとな？<br>フーガを書きたいという衝動があり、<br>フーガを書くという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p>上記：私訳</blockquote>



<p>出だしでそう歌って、フーガの様々な技法をこの曲の中で紹介していきます。</p>



 

 Glenn Gould: So you want to write a fugue? (1963)



<p>「フーガを書きたいを」、「同意で取り扱いたい」で置き換えたのがこの講演です。いわば、</p>



<blockquote><p>ほほう、同意でやりたいとな？<br>同意でやりたいという衝動があり、<br>同意でやりきるという根性があると<br>いうならやってみなさい。</p></blockquote>



<p>内容は…7月21日にPWSでやったのとほぼ同じことの英語版です。もしご興味があればどうぞ。</p>

<p>So You Want to Base on Consent?</p>



<p>Many people seem to believe that having their customers pressing “Agree” button is good enough to collect their “consent”. That’s actually not the case. Obtaining privacy consent has very high bar partly because that is the exception mechanism that you can resort to only when other lawful bases for the processing of personal data does not work.</p>



<p>This session will briefly touch on other lawful bases and what is needed for potentially valid consent, then goes on to explain the requirements for privacy notice and consent process set out in “ISO/IEC 29184 Online privacy notices and consent”.</p>



<p>ISO/IEC 29184 is an international standard that has been in making for the last 5 years. Stakeholders involved in the discussion included data protection authorities around the globe, technical community, lawyers, and businesses. It sets out the requirements for 1) What are needed to be in a privacy notice, 2) What are needed to be done in obtaining the consent, 3) What are needed to be done in the maintenance of privacy notices. For any business that wants to respect customer privacy, this document provides excellent guidance on what needs to be followed.<br>Speaker/s: Nat Sakimura<br>Topic: Privacy</p>

My first attempt at the <a href="https://ondemand.thestand.co.uk/Video/EGMEGL/the_cabaret_of_dangerous_ideas">Cabaret of Dangerous Ideas</a>. Scary…</p>
<p>I was nervous and I know I could have conveyed my thoughts with more clarity and coherence. I virtually missed out my section on trust - our way of navigating the uncertainties of our environment. Still, I am grateful for the opportunity and everyone who helped make it happen. I largely enjoyed myself. And I learnt a lot. I look forward to hopefully attempting a full show next year!</p>
<p>My show, <a href="https://wip-abramson.dev/in-control">#AreYouInControl?</a>, was an attempt to condense and convey a period of reflection into the role and impact identity technology in the complex system that is human society. A web of relationships and influence that limit and expand the possibilities of individuals as they navigate uncertainty and seek to optimise some values perceived to be important in a given context at a given moment in time and space. </p>
<p>My background is not in social science, I research digital identity, privacy and to lesser extent cryptography. The digital world represents this fascinatingly tangled mesh of human social and economic interaction. It has infinitely expanded the set of possible possibilities. The fact that we could run a virtual show is a testament to the expansion of capabilities to interact. It has also created new risks - privacy, security, surveillance, manipulation. And new constraints on interaction, the set of characters and emojis we can use to communicate with, the mechanisms we use to identify and authenticate others, the set of possible actions a platform supports.</p>
<p>These new environments that we exist within are no longer inanimate, they are designed, developed and populated by human beings. The environment has become a source of data, a digital representation of collective memory. Whether intentionally or not, the constraints, risks and possibilities emergent in these virtual spaces are perceived subjectively by each of us. There can be little doubt that these systems present powerful mechanisms for influence at the individual, group and societal level.</p>
<p>The challenge that we must all grapple with, is power to who? For what purpose? Who decides?</p>
<p>Digital technology is neither good nor bad. It is up to us to decide the values these virtual spaces incentivise, what rules they enforce, who they benefit and how they can be changed.</p>
<p>So are you in control?</p>
<p>No, but is control something we should aspire for?. Uncertainty and independent thought is <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo3620295.html">the difference that makes a difference</a> in our complex human system. We should embrace it and protect it.</p>
<p>Instead of control, we should strive for influence and agency driven through intention and the freedom from the intrusive influence of others intentionally kept beyond our awareness. I am interested in technology that can foster cooperation, participation and democratic governance among individuals so they can become empowered agents for change in our society.</p>
<p>I am not sure how much of the above I managed to convey. What can I say, I certainly was not in control despite the influence I attempted to exert through practice and preparation.</p>

CREDIT: © DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY / ALAMY/DAVID NOTON PHOTOGRAPHY /&nbsp;ALAMY This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</p> TL;DR:   Most organizations aren’t digitally connected to one another, creating “trust domain” barriers that are slow, manual, and expensive to traverse.  Similar to shipping containers, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can bridge trust domains between and within organizations, by using you as their&nbsp;courier.  The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains from many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear.   The Barriers VCs Can Bridge: Trust&nbsp;Domains <a href="https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region">https://www.coloradoinfo.com/royal-gorge-region</a><p>Today, if you’re applying for a loan at your financial institution (FI) and need to prove your employment, how can you do so digitally, instantly? You can’t, in most cases. Why? Because it’s not feasible for every FI to have a direct, digital connection to every possible employer they may need data from. The same boundaries exist between schools, when a student transfers and desires to receive credit for classes taken: it’s untenable for every school to have a direct connection to every other&nbsp;school.</p><p>This leaves FI’s, employers, schools and other organizations in separate, unconnected trust domains, unable to directly exchange trusted data and reliant on manual processes, often through third-party data brokers acting as intermediaries. Exchanging data between trust domains today is analogous to the manual, labor-intensive “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_bulk_cargo">break-bulk</a>” process used for millennia for all global trade prior to shipping containers, and is similarly slow, complicated, and expensive.</p><p>This is also why VC adoption may be resisted by incumbent data intermediaries as vigorously as <a href="https://www.discovercontainers.com/a-complete-history-of-the-shipping-container/">labor unions protested shipping containers</a>.</p><p>And this is the same reason we have so many usernames and passwords in the first place: there is no universal way to traverse trust domains in the digital realm. Identity federations within a single trust domain, like what’s offered by the current IAM industry to large organizations, solve this problem elegantly. But cross-domain identity federations, however, have repeatedly attempted to address this and <a href="http://lockstep.com.au/library/identity_authentication/the-false-allure-of-federated.html">failed for various reasons</a>, leaving the problem unresolved and ballooning.</p><p>The boundaries between digital trust domains are understandably high, as the stakes can be high, the risk of fraud ever-present, and fraudsters can comfortably apply their trade from anywhere. We know these boundaries well:</p>  Having many usernames and passwords  Cumbersome forms and onboarding processes  Verbally authenticating when calling a service center, and re-authenticating when being transferred  Waiting for agreements to be signed or consent to be&nbsp;given  Waiting for any kind of application to be&nbsp;approved  Slow verifications of any kind of documents, records  Many slow and/or tedious processes that rely on verifications  <p>Any time you are slowed down or prevented from doing something because you can’t quickly prove something, it’s a manifestation of boundaries between trust domains, much like the bygone situation in shipping that necessitated “break-bulk.” If gatekeepers, human or automated, could quickly verify everything they needed to verify, they could quickly open their&nbsp;gates.</p><p>With VCs, they now&nbsp;can.</p> How VCs Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains <p>This post already assumes a basic understanding of how VCs work, but at the risk of being redundant, I want readers to understand, mechanically, how VCs bridge trust&nbsp;domains.</p><a href="https://despair.com/products/dysfunction">https://despair.com/products/dysfunction</a><p>I think this ^^ is one of the funnier “demotivators” at despair.com, a site everyone should check out for a good laugh. As with most humor, what makes a demotivator funny is the thread of truth that runs through&nbsp;it.</p><p>The relevant truth in this poster is this: the only consistent feature in ALL of your relationships — not just your dissatisfying ones — is you. You are the common factor between all your employers, your FIs, your schools, and every other organization you deal with, and that makes you the ideal courier of data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>If only you had the data… and if only it could be trusted when you delivered it…</p><p>Well, this is where our super duper data shipping container comes in, the VC. Here’s how it all comes together:</p>  You start with an empty digital SSI wallet. Not the Apple kind or Android kind or anything else similarly proprietary and non-portable, but a standardized self-sovereign digital wallet that’s all yours, where you literally hold the digital keys to&nbsp;it.  You offer/accept connections to/from other people, organizations, or things using QR codes or other means of bootstrapping. These are peer-to-peer relationships that you now own and control, and not through some platform or company where they could be seen, controlled, or taken away from&nbsp;you.  When VCs are offered to you by your connections, you choose whether to accept them into your wallet. When you do, you’re now a “holder.” An entity who gives you a VC, whether person, organization, or thing, is called an “issuer.”  When you want to prove something to someone, or share verifiable data, you must first connect with them (#2) then you can share one or more of your VCs. You can also share a subset of data from a VC and not the whole thing, or just proof that you have a VC, or a compound proof from multiple&nbsp;VCs.  In seconds, verifiers can verify four things about what you’ve&nbsp;shared:    Who (or what) issued it to&nbsp;you  It was issued to you and not someone&nbsp;else  It hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  It hasn’t been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer  <p>Voila! Data has just left one trust domain and been accepted into another, without any direct connections between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Most important: verifiers can confirm these four things cryptographically, without having to contact the original issuer. If verifiers had to contact the original issuer to confirm things, that defeats the whole purpose and we’d be back to square one. But they don’t, so we’re not, and that changes everything.</p><p>By using you as the courier of verifiable data between organizations you deal with, unrelated trust domains now have a bridge, and without requiring direct connections to one another. The key to making this all work is that issuers, holders, and verifiers all use the same interoperable protocols. This is why cooperation among competitors and the VC standards work¹ is critical, and exciting that it has made so much progress over the last several&nbsp;years.</p> The Vast Potential of Verifiable Credentials CREDIT: Evernym,&nbsp;Inc.<p>The potential ramifications of transitive trust with rapid verifiability are endless, when boundaries between trust domains for many of today’s friction-filled interactions all but disappear:</p>  No more usernames or passwords, replaced by trusted&nbsp;VCs  No more forms, quick and easy onboarding everywhere  No more verbal authentication, you’re recognized everywhere you choose to&nbsp;be  Instant, digital, multi-party consent (after waiting for slow humans to decide something)  Instant application approvals  Instant verifications of documents, records  The efficient exchange of any trusted information  <p>The effects for user experience would be wonderful. Friction from trying new vendors, products, and services would reduce to almost nothing. Customers can be instantly recognized as valued guests rather than treated as strangers at each new interaction. Processes and workflows can be simplified, automated, and accelerated, and new, nearly seamless experiences offered.</p> In Conclusion <p>The current inability for data to efficiently traverse trust domains bears a striking resemblance to global trade complexities prior to 1956; Verifiable Credentials bear a striking resemblance to its revolutionary solution, the shipping container.</p><p>Due to the enormous physical, logistical and even political obstacles to adoption, it took shipping containers more than a decade to hit their stride, for everyone to realize their potential. With VCs it will happen much more quickly, as much of our world is already digital, and connected.</p><p>I have often said during my five years in SSI that the tech titans of tomorrow are being created today, and I believe that now more than ever. If there’s a sweet spot for when to jump on the SSI bandwagon, we may still be a tad early, but not much, and I don’t think it will last as long as comparable opportunity sweet spots may have in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>VCs are the shipping containers of our lifetime, with all that&nbsp;entails.</p><p>This is part 3 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials.

<a href="https://www.atclogistic.net/service/">https://www.atclogistic.net/service/</a> This is part 2 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: <a href="https://medium.com/p/fab5b3ae5c0/edit">Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials. They’re Containers.</a></p><p>Part 2: Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p> TL;DR:   Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t just functionally similar to shipping containers, they are economically similar as well, and will bring an explosion in global digital trade like shipping containers brought for global physical trade. The right container at the right time can change the world, dramatically.  Shipping containers caused a precipitous drop in shipping costs (over 95%) by bridging the physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks; VCs can deliver a similar cost reduction in the digital realm, by bridging the contexts between organizations.  The transitive trust enabled by VCs enables cooperative network effects, which are even bigger than regular network&nbsp;effects.   If VCs Are Economically Similar to Shipping Containers, It’s a Big&nbsp;Deal <p>The comparison of VCs to shipping containers is much more than a passing one. This analogy, which I’ve been using in presentations and conversations for the last couple of months, has been a big improvement when teaching the basic concept of VCs from a functional standpoint. It is simple, clear, and everyone seems to quickly understand it, a rare breath of messaging fresh air in a world of confusing SSI&nbsp;lingo.</p><p>But more important than messaging clarity, if VCs are economically similar to shipping containers, the ramifications to the digital economy are hard to overstate; everyone in SSI will be in for one heckuva&nbsp;ride.</p><p>In fact, I believe this possibility — that Verifiable Credentials are economically similar to shipping containers — could be the most impactful business realization of my lifetime.</p> The Right Container = Economic Explosion <p>From a humble beginning in 1956, “containerization” brought an explosion in global trade and became “more of a driver of globalisation than all trade agreements in the past 50 years taken together,” according to <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2013/05/18/the-humble-hero">The Economist</a>.</p><p>But how?</p><p>Before 1956, when shipping containers were invented by trucking entrepreneur Malcolm McLean, the world already had containers of many kinds — barrels, bags, boxes and crates — that needed to be painstakingly emptied when a ship arrived at port, and contents moved into other containers on trucks and trains. This manual “break-bulk” process, unchanged for millennia, was slow, complicated, dangerous, and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Instead, Mr. McLean envisioned a container that was sturdy, stackable, secure, and most important: moved intact from a truck onto a train or a ship, and then back again when a ship reached its destination, without being re-packed along the way. It took a few years to really take off, but when shipping containers proved their immense usefulness in the Vietnam war it became clear they were the future, and the ISO then introduced the first shipping container standards that the industries of ships, trains, and trucks would begin to adhere&nbsp;to.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is&nbsp;history.</p><p>The efficiency gains were so dramatic that producers of raw materials and small manufacturers in every corner of the world could now market their products to every other corner of the world, changing global trade forever. “Made in China” wouldn’t be a thing today without “containerization.”</p> From $5.86 to&nbsp;$.16 <p>There were many other containers in existence prior to 1956; why did this particular container make such a disproportionate difference?</p><p>“<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Trans-contextual value transfer</a>,” is the answer, in economic terms, my colleague Dr. Sam Smith would use, the ability to efficiently move value between the very different contexts of ships, trucks, and trains. By moving the entire container, and not emptying it until it has reached its final destination, the break-bulk process was eliminated entirely, causing a precipitous drop in shipping times and overall transaction costs. Stunningly, the price to unload one ton of goods fell from <a href="https://traderiskguaranty.com/trgpeak/history-shipping-containers/">$5.86 in 1956 to only $.16&nbsp;today</a>.</p><p>Whenever transaction costs are reduced there is an increase in transactions proportional to the reduction¹, and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>Bridging contexts in any arena is hard, and expensive, but the gains from discovering how to do it efficiently can be enormous. Standardized shipping containers bridged physical contexts between ships, trains, and trucks and changed the world forever; VCs will do a similar thing for data, lowering transaction costs by efficiently bridging contexts between trust&nbsp;domains.</p> VCs Do for Data What Shipping Containers Did for Physical&nbsp;Goods <a href="http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/">http://www.exlindia.com/train-cargo-3/</a><p>Trust domains and how VCs bridge them, mechanically, is the subject of Part 3 of this series, “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How VCs Bridge Trust Domains</a>,” and so will not be treated fully here, but a quick summary seems appropriate.</p><p>The current process of moving trusted data between unconnected organizations is uncannily similar to the break-bulk shipping process prior to 1956: data must be carefully removed from the data containers of the sending organization and re-packaged into the data containers of the receiving organization. As an example, just ask anyone in the know how academic transcripts in the U.S. are really exchanged between schools today: it is manual, slow, complicated, expensive, and often requires the paid help of 3rd-party intermediaries. Again, this is strikingly similar to break-bulk.</p><p>VCs address this chasm how shipping containers did. Data senders (“issuers”) and data receivers (“verifiers”) first agree on a standardized container². Issuers pack VCs with a desired payload and then issue it, either to the wallet of an individual “holder” or into storage in a database or blockchain. When verified, the verifier can rely on the fidelity of the data payload because they can <a href="https://link.medium.com/Jj8ynRY0e8">verify the provenance and fidelity of the container it came in</a>, and critically, perform that verification cryptographically without contacting the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>We don’t yet know to what degree VCs will reduce costs. Earlier I cited the more than 95% drop in costs shipping containers delivered; that level of efficiency wasn’t fully realized until most ships, trains, and trucks had made modifications to adhere to the standards and were in full production. The same thing will happen with VCs. While it will take some time, with the complete elimination of “break-bulk”-style data exchange, and of the then-obsolete data middlemen and their associated time, cost, and manual processes, the cost reduction will be&nbsp;massive.</p><p>When comparing VCs and shipping containers, you discover the nature of the problem they address is similar, the way they address it is similar, and the size of the markets — global physical trade and global e-commerce — is arguably similar. It follows that the reduction in transactions costs, proportional increase in transactions, and overall economic impact would be similar,&nbsp;too.</p> VCs Unlock Global Network&nbsp;Effects <p>Another, related dimension of the economic impact VCs will have on the digital economy, and one that’s more familiar than shipping containers but potentially just as impactful, is network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>VCs enable a powerful kind of network effect, a cooperative network-of-networks effect. Deeper research into how SSI and VCs enable cooperative network effects has been done by Dr. Samuel Smith, my partner at Digital Trust Ventures, in his seminal paper, <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Meta-Platforms and Cooperative Network-of-Networks Effects</a>, so I will only summarize Sam’s findings&nbsp;here.</p><p>When networks “cooperate,” some value from one network is transferable to another. Cooperative network effects are inter-network and exponentially greater than intra-network effects, like comparing the internet to AOL. To understand cooperative network effects it’s helpful to first understand its cousin: competitive network effects³.</p><p>The ride sharing industry offers an excellent example of competitive network effects. When Uber acquires a new driver, that driver becomes more likely to also drive for Lyft, Uber’s direct competitor. Though Uber and Lyft may wish it were not so, every driver and rider gained by one network is just clicks away from being gained by the other, which is unfortunate for whoever spent large sums to first gain them. This effect accelerates competition, adds price pressure, and sows the seeds of mass defection if it ever becomes advisable. Of course there is a selfishly beneficial tradeoff too, when your network gains from another’s expansion.</p><p>In contrast, cooperative network-of-network effects occur when growth in one network benefits other, non-competitive networks. Literally, customers gained in one network or industry are accretive to other, non-competitive and even completely unrelated networks or industries.</p><p>For example, several credit unions (CUs) in the U.S. are now issuing VCs to members to enable a secure, streamlined experience when they call in, walk in, or log in; they call it <a href="https://www.memberpass.com">MemberPass</a>. While the first use cases are limited to within the issuing CU, any entity in any industry could also choose to accept MemberPass and offer a sleek onboarding and login experience that eliminates forms and passwords for anyone presenting one. What website wouldn’t prefer instant onboarding and authentication of new customers presenting cryptographically verifiable credentials issued by regulated U.S. financial institutions, instead of the friction of forms, usernames, and breachable passwords they’re forced to offer&nbsp;today?</p><p>Every new MemberPass issued becomes a new, easily onboardable prospective customer for any entity anywhere that accepts VCs, online or off. And value flows both ways, as CUs benefit from increased satisfaction whenever members successfully use MemberPass, from increased value provided to members and the loyalty that engenders, and from increased demand for MemberPass from both existing and prospective CU&nbsp;members.</p><p>These are cooperative network effects indeed, as they foster cross-industry collaboration. The only obstacle is awareness.</p><p>This kind of cooperation between unrelated networks, both intentional and unintentional, has rarely been observed or achievable, but with VCs becomes predictable. The resulting ‘meta’ network effects — <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/NonconformistKeynoteWeb20200702.pdf">Smith’s Law</a> — are exponential compared to intra-network effects, and also beyond <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29066/metcalfes-law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>. If you’re a student of the science of network effects, be sure to check out <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">Sam’s paper</a>. You’re in for a treat; the math for this is incredible.</p> In Conclusion <p>Shipping containers were a once-in-a-lifetime improvement in global trade, forever bridging the physical barriers between ships, trains, and trucks. VCs are the shipping containers of the digital realm, bridging trust domain barriers between organizations, departments, and even internal&nbsp;silos.</p><p>Shipping containers brought an unprecedented multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar global economic expansion by dramatically reducing transaction costs for physical goods; VCs will do the same for digital goods, and economically change the world to a similar magnitude.</p><p>If that were VCs only economic value, it would be more than enough. VCs also enable cooperative network-of-network effects, where issuances in one industry can benefit other, non-competitive industries, potentially many of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Excited yet?

 This is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series: <p>Part 1: Verifiable Credentials Aren’t Credentials.

Having containers inside of containers is a feature, not a&nbsp;bug.  Like physical credentials, the VC container is always verifiable, not its data&nbsp;payload.   The Credential That&nbsp;Isn’t <p>Despite their name, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) aren’t really credentials; they are containers, much like shipping containers for data, which actually makes them more useful and powerful than if they were credentials.</p><p>NOTE: The comparison to shipping containers is more than a passing one, as shipping containers are the most impactful containers ever devised and VCs are strikingly similar to them, both functionally and economically. Details of these similarities and their potential ramifications are covered in parts <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">2</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">3</a> of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>Like a shipping container, there’s a sender, called the “issuer”, who packs a VC’s data contents. The receiver of the VC container, called the “verifier”, unpacks and verifies its payload (or a subset proof thereof). Between issuers and verifiers there is typically a human carrying the VC in a standardized SSI digital wallet, but VCs can also be transported in other ways, or stored in a relational database¹ or a distributed ledger².</p><p>The payload of a VC can be any kind of data and is not limited to what might normally be considered a credential.</p><p>In fact, the word “credential” is a holdover from the worlds of identity and academia, where VCs began their standardization journey and have many important use cases. But recently I’ve seen people in academia get confused when the payload inside a VC is what the academic world calls a credential — like a diploma or a transcript — resulting in a credential within a (verifiable) credential. Others get confused when the VC payload isn’t a credential, in either academic or identity parlance, but we still call the VC a credential.</p><p>Now that VCs have the global momentum they do, I feel we need to “open the aperture” beyond identity and credentials. Here are some example VC payloads not typically considered credentials, all of which become cryptographically verifiable when delivered as a payload within a&nbsp;VC:</p>  Consent, permissions, votes,&nbsp;opinions  Balances, totals, deficits, ranges, statistics, source&nbsp;data  Statements, agreements, contracts, invoices, sources  Confirmations, acknowledgements, attestations, assertions, affidavits  The speed, trajectory, weight, temperature or location of&nbsp;anything  Laws, regulations, statutes, rules, orders, decrees, declarations  Photos, videos, music,&nbsp;messages  Software code, hashes, files, the state of a database at a given point in&nbsp;time  Tests, procedures, prescriptions, diagnoses  <p>Of course, objects typically considered credentials make ideal VC payloads:</p>  Identities, names, addresses, usernames, titles, attributes, profiles, bios  Licenses, passports, visas, permits, tickets, coupons, vouchers, receipts  Skills, competencies, certificates, badges, diplomas, degrees, achievements, awards  Identifiers, codes, account numbers, ticket&nbsp;numbers  <p>It is true that the identity- and achievement-related use cases in this second list are those most actively being pursued in the VC space right now, and many in the first list cannot be realized until there’s broader adoption by issuers and verifiers. Still, the word “credential” has a specific meaning in several industries, and it is consistently confusing to VC noobs for one simple reason: it is an inaccurate term for what a VC really is and&nbsp;does.</p><p>Truly, “Verifiable Credentials” should be renamed to “Verifiable Containers.” I can’t think of anything important we lose by doing so, and can think of much clarity and other benefits (detailed in this series) that we would gain. Of all the gnarly terminology challenges we face in the SSI space, this one seems like a slam dunk to&nbsp;me.</p> Containers Inside of Containers Is a Feature, Not a&nbsp;Bug <a href="http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls">http://www.rubylane.com/item/712219-T118-121814-3/Russian-Matryoshka-Dolls-Nesting-Dolls</a><p>On several occasions I’ve been asked something like: “We already have containers for learning achievements with <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a>; why do we need another container?”</p><p>A fair question, but it presumes containers inside of containers aren’t useful or necessary for data, which isn’t necessarily the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Life is full of containers inside of containers. Products at the store come in boxes that arrived in larger boxes, stacked with other boxes onto a crate, which itself is another container, often shipped inside shipping containers, which are carried in/on the containers of ships, trains, and trucks. Data is stored inside files within folders, within other folders, inside of directories, inside of virtual machines, inside of partitions, inside a hard drive, within an enclosure, inside a computer, often on a shelf within a rack within a room inside a building.</p><p>You get the&nbsp;point.</p><p>Each level of container has a purpose and adds value and efficiency to the whole chain; try taking one away and it gets messy. Sub-specialties and entire industries are built up around the containers at each level, and they often don’t know much about the containers at the other levels. The people operating giant cranes at a port don’t know or care much about what’s inside the containers they’re moving, and they don’t need&nbsp;to.</p>CREDIT: Cam&nbsp;Geer<p>Even though it is a container itself, like any file a VC must be held in another container: a database, blockchain, or preferably a standardized SSI wallet. If a wallet, that wallet must be held in another container that makes it usable, like a smartphone, a USB stick or even a chipped&nbsp;card.</p><p>A VC can hold any sort of data payload, even as simple as a clear-text “Yes” or “No” when granting or refusing consent. If the payload is more advanced, like an academic achievement, it should be encoded in a way that provides semantic meaning to a verifier, such as an <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/comprehensive-learner-record">IMS Comprehensive Learner Record</a> (CLR). When a CLR is a VC’s payload, it’s an achievement inside of a CLR container inside of a VC container likely inside of a wallet. Take away the CLR container and you lose some semantic meaning for verifiers; take away the VC container and you lose the ability for CLRs to become portable alongside other, non-CLR payloads, forcing CLR users to adopt special capabilities unique to CLRs. If you repeat that specialized thinking for every kind of payload, from academia to healthcare to government, you quickly get back to a world full of bespoke containers and troublesome trust domains, right back where we&nbsp;started.</p><p>This is why a standardized shipping container for data is needed, and just as useful as its physical analog. Whether physical or digital, it’s Russian dolls everywhere you look, and that’s a good&nbsp;thing.</p> VC Containers Are Always Verifiable; Payloads Are&nbsp;Not <p>As with any container, with VCs it’s GIGO: garbage in, garbage out. The only thing that’s always verifiable with a VC is the container itself, where a verifier can cryptographically verify its fidelity, but not always the veracity of the&nbsp;payload.</p><p>For example, ABC University could issue to you a VC with this statement: “blue is green.” Clearly blue is not green and someone was messing around, but we can still verify four elements of the VC’s fidelity:</p>  ABCU issued&nbsp;it;  They issued it to&nbsp;you;  It has/hasn’t been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued;  ABCU has/hasn’t revoked&nbsp;it.  <p>Knowing who packed the container establishes the VC’s provenance to a specific issuer and directly influences a verifier’s willingness to rely on its payload, which is why many conflate this issue and believe that payloads are verifiable. But it is a significant distinction; a verifier can confirm that a VC container is authentic and from a trustworthy source, but still decide not to rely on its payload. (A payload can often be separately verifiable in some way, such as an Open Badge or even another VC, but that is beside the point&nbsp;here.)</p><p>This is how physical credentials work, too. A physical passport is a container that holds data (though only one type of highly regulated data); it is the physical container the airport verifies when you present it to them. Then, upon concluding the container is authentic, the airport usually proceeds to rely upon the data within the presented container. VCs function in the same manner but in the digital realm and capable of carrying any data payload, which makes them far more flexible, useful, and powerful overall than physical credentials.</p><p>Of course, you don’t need a battery to share your driver’s license, so there’s that. But then again your passport and driver’s license can — and I believe will — become chipped³ and carry VCs just as chipped EMV payment cards carry other bits of data, no batteries required, so there’s that,&nbsp;too.</p> In Conclusion <p>If it’s true that VCs aren’t really credentials, and that calling them credentials often confuses people coming into the space, then we should seriously consider not calling them credentials.</p><p>The fact that VCs are containers capable of carrying any sort of verifiable data payload isn’t just a good thing, it’s a great one. And as you’ll read in parts 2 and <a href="https://medium.com/p/97155d0f3c17/edit">3</a> of this series, it has the potential to change the world as much as the shipping container did, and that’s a big deal. A huge&nbsp;one.</p><p>Finally, it is useful to put other data containers inside of VCs, and maybe even containers inside of those containers, all riding along and benefiting from the portability between trust domains enabled by a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>Or should we say, “Verifiable Container”?</p><p>This article is part 1 of a 3-part&nbsp;series:</p><p>Part 2: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">Like Shipping Containers, Verifiable Credentials Will Economically Transform the&nbsp;World</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/how-verifiable-credentials-bridge-trust-domains-97155d0f3c17">How Verifiable Credentials Bridge Trust&nbsp;Domains</a></p><p>¹ Example: BC Gov (British Columbia) Verifiable Organization Network: <a href="https://vonx.io/">https://vonx.io/</a><br>² Examples: <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/">https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://trust.asu.edu/">https://trust.asu.edu/</a><br>³ German ID cards (“Personalausweis”) are chipped and NFC-accessible through a corresponding app. See <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ausweisapp.bund.de%2Fausweisapp2%2F">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bmi.bund.de%2FDE%2Fthemen%2Fmoderne-verwaltung%2Fausweise-und-paesse%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion%2Fonline-ausweisfunktion-node.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Well!  Morgan and I have co-launched a new podcast called
<a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">FOSS and Crafts</a>!
As the title implies, it's going to be a fairly interdisciplinary
podcast... the title says it all fairly nicely I think: "A podcast
about free software, free culture, and making things together."</p>
<p>We already have the <a href="https://fossandcrafts.org/">intro episode</a> out!
It's fairly intro-episode'y... meet the hosts, hear about what to expect
from the show, etc etc... but we do talk a bit about some background
of the name!</p>
<p>But more substantial episodes will be out soon.
We have a lot of plans and ideas for the show, and I've got a pretty
good setup for editing/publishing now.
So if that sounds fun, subscribe, and more stuff should be hitting
your ears soon!</p>
<p>(PS: we have a nice little community growing in
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=fossandcrafts">#fossandcrafts on irc.freenode.net</a>
if you're into that kind of thing!)</p>

			<p>#BlackLivesMatter #NewYorkCity
				©&nbsp;2020 David E. Wheeler
			</p>
		
	

         
<p>I took advantage of the new City Bike dock in front of our flat to ride 80
blocks south through Central Park today to see the new <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/black-lives-matter-painted-on-street-outside-trump-tower.html" title="‘Black Lives Matter’ Painted on Fifth Avenue Outside Trump Tower">#BlackLivesMatter mural</a>
outside Trump Tower. Not too many people around, perhaps a dozen taking photos
and selfies. I joined them, then took a photo for a couple and their toddler in
front of the mural. I couldn’t stop grinning under my mask. The mural may be
symbolic, but holy cats do symbols matter.</p>
<p>More photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCjMEw-ptAg/">on Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Also, what a great ride this was. Thinking about quitting my job just to wander
around New York and take it all in. Love this city.</p>

is soo great. In a few cogent, direct, clear paragraphs, she covers her views on
quarantine, Covid, reading, pregnancy, capitalism, Black Lives Matter, policy
changes, protest, climate change, and more. An example, on white discomfort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m also suspicious of the way that Not Being Racist is a project that people
seem to be approaching like boot camp. To deepen your understanding of race,
of this country, should make you feel like the world is opening up, like
you’re dissolving into the immensity of history and the present rather than
being more uncomfortably visible to yourself. Reading more Black writers isn’t
like taking medicine. People ought to seek out the genuine pleasure of
decentering themselves, and read fiction and history alongside these popular
anti-racist manuals, and not feel like they need to calibrate their precise
degree of guilt and goodness all the time.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse</a> 2020 talk Enabling Scalable Multi-lateral Federations with OpenID Connect was just broadcast and is <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event/ShowKey=96621">available for viewing</a>.  The talk abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Numerous large-scale multi-lateral identity federations are in production use today, primarily in the Research and Education sector.  These include national federations, such as SWAMID in Sweden and InCommon in the US, some with thousands of sites, and inter-federations among dozens of federations, such as eduGAIN.  Yet these existing federations are based on SAML 2 and require the federation operator to poll the participants for their metadata, concatenating it into a huge file that is distributed to all federation participants nightly – a brittle process with significant scalability problems.</p>
<p>Responding to demand from the Research and Education community to migrate from SAML 2 to the simpler OpenID Connect protocol, the OpenID Connect working group has created the OpenID Connect Federation specification to enable this.  The new approach incorporates lessons learned from existing SAML 2 federations – especially using a new, scalable approach to federation metadata, in which organizations host their own signed metadata and federation operators in turn sign statements about the organizations that are participants in the federation.  As Shibboleth author Scott Cantor publicly said at a federation conference, “Given all my experience, if I were to redo the metadata handling today, I would do it along the lines in the OpenID Connect Federation specification”.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe progress implementing and deploying OpenID Connect Federation, upcoming interop events and results, and next steps to complete the specification and foster production deployments.  The resulting feedback from Identiverse participants on the approach will be highly valuable.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a late-breaking addition, data from the June 2020 Federation interop event organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> was included in the presentation.</p>

  Do you serve a problem or do you solve a problem?<br><br>Serving problems is lucrative work.<br><br>Solving problems is valuable work.<br><br>Extracting the value from your service of problems is done in completely different ways than from solving problems. People who solve problems are the innovators, the entrepreneurs, the social-benefactors that move our species forward. People who serve problems benefit from the existence of problems to serve.<br><br>This is a profoundly important distinction to understand in the constitution of any Society. People do the work they are enticed to do. Work is valued in any number of ways, and markets form systems based on the repeatability of a task, or behavior, or contract model.<br><br>Contracts define the repeatability of actions. Solving problems ends the service loop provided by those people that benefit from the existence of problems to serve. All around the industrialized world, people are serving problems. Little problems that are solved with button pushes, and big problems that require emotional investment.. both are being solved by people. Solving those problems in a different manner than they are being served creates a new problem:<br><br>What will people who serve problems do if someone solves the problem that they serve?<br><br>The extinction of problems is a HUGE problem for people that are dependent on the existence of problems to serve for their own well-being. Do you see the loop? Do you sense the problem?<br><br>Meta-thinkers that can escape this loop and apply their attention to the solving of problems are the greatest agents of change possible in the Human species. All over the world, the fear of the future is taking over immature psychologies. People who fear their own ability to take care of their needs, to have enough to get by, or to prosper with adequate health, wealth and wisdom through life's required challenges, are falling victim to a very predictable mental deficiency.<br><br>The unpredictability of life is not unique, it is the status quo. Change is constant, and people are here to solve the problems that life is composed of. Serving problems is an industrial era monetization of the permanence of problems. Government think tanks of eras gone by persist this logic pattern and operational mandate in order to extract rent from the existence of problems they, and their cronies, service.<br><br>Service models that help problems persist exist definitively in 2020 as political platforms. Creating problems from the raw material of modern life, recycling problems that are rehashed from dead history, joining problems in endless propaganda cycles that induce fear, compliance, and predictable work-patterns is how problem-servers maintain their authority in Society.<br><br>People are manipulated into believing, into accepting the idea that the servants of persistent problems, and problem-cycles that never end, are here to help them. People buy into these ideas in good faith, because they think that these "good people" serving their problems are their friends helping them overcome, when in fact they are the barnacles riding shotgun on the energy of the problem that is being served for the benefit of the party being directly affected by the problem, as well as the party earning a paycheck via their service of the problem.<br><br>Never-ending cycles of oppression are the result when the servants of problems show up on the scene. In the name of social justice, of workers rights, or child welfare, of education, of health care, of drug enforcement, and many other problems, servants of problems loot the world of value in a never-ending cycle of servitude. Problems persist indefinitely, incremental improvements ebb and flow, and people believe in servants that become parties with platforms.. servants of problems.. VOTE DEMOCRAT!<br><br>Problem solvers are different.<br><br>Problem solvers are disruptors.<br><br>Problem solvers end service cycles, and give new capabilities to Individual people. ALWAYS to Individual people, empowerment solutions are delivered directly to the experience where people have problems. This is the critical distinction, as Individuals we begin, as Individuals we remain.. for our entire life, one person will travel with you for the duration. One.<br><br>One among many other ones, this is our species Humanity.<br><br>Solving human problems is the highest order work there is. People solving problems is as close as we will ever come to the purpose of human life. People helping people solve problems, everyday.. constantly, new problems is the raw material of enlightenment, and equality for enlightened people.<br><br>There is no other condition that intercedes as more important than being human, and solving problems.<br><br>Mob rulers need mob thinkers, to enforce their service model to problems. People will never solve a problem so long as they are held captive to the servants of problems. When you vote, vote not for the servants of Society's problems, but for the people that solve problems.<br><br>Vote for the actual, functional leader. Vote for your operational existence, vote for the solution to real problems, and look for the distinction between problems that can be solved, and problems that exist so that they can be serviced.<br><br>This will help you immensely in your life, and it will solve a major problem for all of Humanity.<br><br><br><br><br>

  In 2008, my new family had a 3 year old child, a young international toy design and distribution company, and a newly emerging indie educational technology non-profit to take care of and grow with all the daily intensities you can imagine. Money? Yeah, we were working our butts off to survive and prosper with ideas and implementations that had very little support to fall back on if something went wrong. Health care? Yeah, we paid for it ourselves.<br><br>Then came ObamaCare. You might of heard about it. I watched the news, wondering if our Government would do something right for a change. Then reality started to sink in. The "Individual Mandate" was a perversion of the system I knew, and was an ugly administrative overreach that looked desperate in its attempt to force participation. Every part of that program was devised to support the non-working class, or the employed-class of people. As an entrepreneur funding my own survival, and any hope of quality of care or prosperity, I was not a consideration. Months later, after its passage, this reality become solidified. My family lost the health care it was paying for independently.<br><br>I was a casualty of progress, right? A method of socialized health care was being promoted as a savior for the people of my country, when in fact, it was being experienced in just the opposite way by an actual American family. It took me many years to solve this problem, but eventually I did so. It is called DevCare... and I provide it to 9 people who work for me plus their families. I spend $60,000+ per year providing health care to the people I employ. It works, and it works really well.<br><br>ObamaCare? Yeah.. that was pure socialist BS. That was never a solution to a problem, it was a redesign of dependency, forced upon Americans by a President and Congress hell-bent on changing America from a place where an "American Dream" of self-possession, private ownership, free-enterprise and hard work paid off. Instead, we all got equalized.. as Medicare dependents.<br><br>So along the way, after years doing private toy development, and licensing under brands as well known as "Imaginarium" from Toys R Us, we folded shop. It was time to move on. Doing business in China was not going to go well for anyone anymore. The writing was on the wall. "Move along"....<br><br>My kid, in the meantime, had entered the public school system, specifically because I wanted him to have an experience of learning with the public in my country. We lived in an extremely rural location, and 60%+ of the students attending our school received federally subsidized lunches. So in order to make sure the school produced at the level I hoped, my wife and I volunteered. She became the President of the PTA, and I donated my time and resources to introduce kids to robotics, programming, and art/math/logic that can move while you learn about it. Along the way, some local-yocal parents complained that our activities were going to steal jobs from the local contractor-economy, and should be shut-down. I shit you not. The school Principal was smarter than that, and we continued volunteering.. at least until 2nd grade.<br><br>That was the end of my public school experience. In 2nd grade, we exceeded the capacity of the public school system in the United States of America. There was no other choice... move, pay for private school that "might" be better, or do it yourself... home school... or leave the religious stuff out and just "indie school". So we did so... we built a company that supports multiple families while educating our own child indie school style.<br><br>And we moved... to New York.. to Long Island, where accessing independent learning was much easier than in Virginia. Where economics was something that had velocity, and all sectors were present in everyday life... not separated by scores of miles, stored on Dulles Toll Road, or in communities trying to overcome their racist past like Charlottesville.<br><br>And along the way, we had an experience that was completely unexpected; others saw the world and the problems being created at the hands of socialist Governors as we did. Individual mandates were seen as communist over-reaches, regardless of media propaganda controlling the masses of dependents. And being an entrepreneur, building and teaching, and leading the world towards "functional literacy" and "functional identity" by sourcing everyone with the ideas behind self-Sovereign identity, starting in President Obama's own $10million effort called NSTC, started picking up steam.<br><br>But socialists do one thing well... they clone value so they can deplete it. They loot, to be more precise. And by becoming visible, and sharing problem:solution outcomes, I was exposing myself to a ravenous community of socialist looters, both in Washington DC and Silicon Valley. No one survives that onslaught, right? With a social graph documenting all the relationships and hidden beliefs of Americans, and Government making dependency the law of the land, producing functional literacy on the part of American's was becoming increasingly challenging.<br><br>"If you are not a socialist in your 20's, you have no heart. If you are not a capitalist by your 30's, you have no brain".. not sure that is an actual quote anybody ever said, but it makes sense in observable reality.<br><br>I was raised by a Teacher, a social worker who believed she could solve the worlds problems by caring enough, even if practicable financial literacy was a mystery concept. I come from a family of educators, economists, a learned people.. and I respect all their ideas and practices to help the world be a better place, and people be better citizens.<br><br>But I am not one to swallow conformity, and I am not one to wait for my dependencies to be served by a Governing system that can not accurately define them, let along respect the life, liberty or pursuit of happiness that Individuals create in my country.<br><br>So with all the "Hope" in the world for "Change I could Believe in" I decided to go a different route. I decided to solve my own problems. To stand up my own Rights. To demonstrate what a functional American is, and to mentor others to overcome the false education system based on "Credentials of Exclusion" that exists to provide employment first, and education next. Jobs, Jobs Jobs!<br><br>Sure, a "Union of Workers" seems like a decent concept within a "More Perfect Union".. but is it? The USSR (Russia) was formed for just that purpose...&nbsp; a "Union of Workers". More importantly, how is a "More Perfect Union" made possible by sub-Unions, or operational cults in most cases, that demand loyalty from their participants and black-ball any and all non-believers who step out of line?<br><br>America in 2020 has a thinking problem to overcome. It has induced an operational problem wherein data slaves functioning on a data plantation believe they are "FREE", when in fact they are anything but. Labor is owned by the State, Identity is provisioned by the State, and compliance is not optional.<br><br>Is that even Constitutionally accurate? No, but then again, the Constitution does not compute in 2020. How can it ever hope to be accurate in rendering the operational format of participation for citizens when it can not even be designed effectively at root participation for American babies with any sense of accuracy? American babies with a Social Security number, after all, are the most at risk population for identity theft that there is. Sound like a good system?<br><br>Depends who you ask.<br><br>You see, the Government loves stability. Nothing propels a war machine like the stable revenue derived from employees. W2/W4 employees after all, pay the Government first, before they ever receive any money in their pay checks, having it auto-debited from their salaries. Of course, owners do it completely different, having a system designed to support them because well.. "Ownership Supremacy" on planet Earth is easily experienced. Owners pay the Government last, after all expenses have been deducted against revenue.<br><br>A Society of Owners is the only structural equality that will ever be possible. In 2020, the concept of "White Supremacy" dominates the perception of operationally illiterate people. In our country, a socio-economic war was fought, and owners were the winners on both sides of the transition from enslavement to employment, because structure yields results. It was never about black/white... it has always been about the ownership contract. Native Americans did not experience genocide, they experienced the incremental defeat of living on a planet that you do not own. Owners own the world that everyone else is living on.<br><br>Equality begins when you own yourself, and you own root participation in civil Society. That begins at identity formation. American Sovereignty was demonstrated by the founding fathers. They had no permission to dissolve their Sovereign allegiance to the King of England, and they did not have any permission to "Declare Independence" as a Sovereign Nation. But these people understood something far more basic and true. Human authority on planet Earth, and in this Universe, is self-Sovereign, or it does not exist. You may need to fight for your Human Rights, but they will never come from anyone but yourself.<br><br>No Institution, no man-made organization will ever give Humanity the direct experience that the Creator of existence has given to Humanity. Self-Sovereign Human Authority is the only authority that exists in Civil Society, or your Society is not civil.<br><br>Look around 2020 people... your Society is not civil. Fixing that starts with identity, for owners.<br><br>Own Root. It is not optional.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<blockquote>This article is part of a series about XYZ and how it works, also including articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-why-b855970fdd89">Why?</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">Handles</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-interaction-a84091d2a8c8">Interaction</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-compatibility-with-oauth-2-f7b490be536d">Compatibility</a>.</blockquote><p>OAuth 2 loves its bearer tokens. They’re a really useful construct because they are simple: if you have the token, you can do whatever the token is good for. It’s all the proof that you need: you can present it in exactly the format that you received it in, no cryptography involved.</p><p>This simplicity makes it easy for client developers to get it right, most of the time. You give them a magic value, they put the magic value into the right header, and suddenly the API works and they can stop thinking about this security&nbsp;thing.</p> Sender Constraints <p>The downside to bearer tokens, and it is a big downside, is that anyone who has a copy of the token can use it. TLS protects the token in transit over a direct hop, but it doesn’t fix the fact that the people who are allowed to see the token aren’t the same as the people who are allowed to use the token. This means that if a client sends its token to a rogue resource server, or even the wrong resource server, then that resource server can replay the token somewhere else.</p><p>To address this in the OAuth 2 world, there is active work to define how to do sender constrained access tokens. These tokens would move beyond a bearer token by requiring the client to present some type of verifiable keying material, like a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">mutual TLS certificate</a> or an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop">ephemeral key generated by the client</a>. There was previously work of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding">using TLS token binding</a> as well, but that has sadly gone by the wayside as TLS token binding <a href="https://identiverse.com/2018/10/31/chrome-puts-token-binding-in-a-bind/">failed to take off</a>. These work pretty well, but there is an overwhelming prevalence of OAuth 2 code that looks for the Bearer keyword for the token type and breaks if you show it anything else. Because of this, the MTLS spec requires that you continue to use the Bearer token type, and there has even been pushback for DPoP to use Bearer as an option as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And on top of all of this, the token presentation is tangled up with the OAuth2 client authentication, which could be based on a secret, a key, or nothing at all (in the case of public clients).</p><p>With XYZ, we don’t have this legacy of bearer tokens and client authentication, and we were able to build a system that was more consistent from the&nbsp;start.</p> Presenting Keys <p>In XYZ, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/keys/">key presentation is at the core of all client interactions.</a> When a client calls the AS, it identifies itself by its key. The key formats in XYZ are flexible. A client can present its key as a JWK, an X509 certificate, or potentially any number of other formats through extensions. The key can be RSA, or elliptic curve, or potentially some other exotic form. The protocol doesn’t really care, so long as there’s a method to validate&nbsp;it.</p><p>This key can be <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">passed by value or by reference</a>, and the AS can even decide to assign a reference dynamically, but the important thing is that it’s the key that identifies the software that’s making the call. This alone is an important shift from OAuth 2, because specifications like MTLS for OAuth and DPoP have shown us the value in allowing a client to bind an ephemeral key to its requests. In XYZ, the default is that all client keys are ephemeral, unless the AS has some additional set of metadata and a policy attached to the&nbsp;key.</p><p>Whatever key the client uses for its requests to the AS, it’s reasonable that the client would be able to use that same key for requests to the RS. But in this case, the client is also going to be presenting the access token it was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>But unlike a bearer token, it’s not enough to present the token alone, or the key, or its identifier. The client also has to present proof that it currently holds that key to the server. It does this by performing a cryptographic operation on the request, in some fashion can be verified by the server and associated with the key. But&nbsp;how?</p> Agility of Presentation <p>Herein lies the real trick: a new delegation protocol is going to have to be flexible and agile in how the client is allowed to prove its keys. Just about every deployment is going to have its own considerations and constraints affecting everything from how keys are generated to how proofs can be validated across the&nbsp;layers.</p><p>In XYZ, we’ve made the key presentation modular. Instead of defining a required cryptographic container, XYZ declares that the client has to present the key in a manner bound to its request, in some fashion, and declare that proofing method. The two categories implemented to date are MTLS and HTTP-based message signatures.</p><p>For MTLS, it’s pretty straightforward. The client needs to use its client certificate during the TLS connection to the server, and the server needs to verify that the certificate in use is the same one referenced in the request — either the request body for the AS or the access token for the RS. The server does not need to do a full chain validation of the client’s certificate, though it’s free to do so in order to limit which certificates are presented.</p><p>For HTTP message signing it’s a similar outlay of effort, but the signature is presented at the HTTP layer and has to directly cover some or all of the HTTP request. There are a number of different specifications out there for doing this, and our test XYZ implementations have built out support for a several of them including Cavage signatures, OAuth DPoP, and even a simple JWS-based detached body signature invented for the protocol. The most promising, to my mind, is the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures">new signatures specification being worked on in the HTTP working group of the IETF</a>. It’s being based on a long experience with several community specifications, and I think it’s really got a chance to be a unifying security layer across a lot of different applications. Eventually, we’re likely to see library and tooling support like we have with&nbsp;TLS.</p><p>The use cases for these are different. MTLS tends to work great for webserver-based applications, especially in a closed enterprise setup, but it falls apart for SPA’s and ephemeral apps. HTTP message signing is more complex to implement, but it can survive across TLS termination and multiple hops. There is no one answer, and there are likely other approaches that will be invented down the road that work even&nbsp;better.</p> Signatures as a Core&nbsp;Function <p>OAuth 1 had its own bespoke signing mechanism, which confused a lot of developers. OAuth 2 set out to avoid the problems that this caused by removing signatures entirely, but in so doing has pushed the needle too far away from good security practices and made it hard to add such functionality back in. With XYZ we tried to strike the balance by allowing different mechanisms but assuming that signing, of some fashion, was going to be available to every client. With today’s library and software support, this seems to be true across many platforms, and time will tell which methods work the best in the real&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/38809138">Originally written</a> as a post
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/cwebber">for Patreon donors</a>.)</p>
<p>Hello... just figured I'd give a fairly brief update.  Since I wrote
my last post I've been working hard towards the distributed
programming stuff in Goblins.</p>
<p>In general, this involves implementing a protocol called
<a href="http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/CapTP">CapTP</a>, which
is fairly obscure... the idea is generally to apply the same "object
capability security" concept that Goblins already follows but on a
networked protocol level.  Probably the most prominent other
implementation of CapTP right now is being done by the
<a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a> folks,
<a href="https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/captp/lib/captp.js">captp.js</a>.
I've been in communication with them... could we achieve
interoperability between our implementations?  It could be cool, but
it's too early to tell.  Anyway it's one of those technical areas
that's so obscure that I decided to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cap-talk/xWv2-J62g-I%5B1-25%5D">document my progress on the cap-talk mailing list</a>,
but that's becoming the length of a small novel... so I guess, beware
before you try to read that whole thing.  I'm far enough along where
the main things work, but not quite everything (CapTP supports such
wild things as distributed garbage collection...!!!!)</p>
<p>Anyway, in general I don't think that people get too excited by
hearing "backend progress is happening"; I believe that implementing
CapTP is even more important than standardizing ActivityPub was in the
long run of my life work, but I also am well aware that in general
people (including myself!) understand best by seeing an interesting
demonstration.  So, I do plan another networked demo, akin to the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/blog/goblins-time-travel-micropreview/">time-travel Terminal Phase demo</a>,
but I'm not sure just how fancy it will be (yet).  I think I'll have
more things to show on that front in 1-2 months.</p>
<p>(Speaking of Goblins and games, I'm putting together a little library
called <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/game-goblin">Game Goblin</a>
to make making games on top of Goblins a bit easier; it isn't quite
ready yet but thought I'd mention it.  It's currently going through
some "user testing".)</p>
<p>More work is happening on the Datashards front; Serge Wroclawski
(project leader for Datashards; I guess you could say I'm "technical
engineer") and I have started assembling more documentation and have
put together <a href="https://datashards.net/">some proto-standards documents</a>.
(Warning: WIP WIP WIP!!!)  We are exploring with a standards group
whether or not Datashards would be a good fit there, but it's too
early to talk about that since the standards group is still figuring
it out themselves.  Anyway, it's taken up a good chunk of time so I
figured it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>So, more to come, and hopefully demos not too far ahead.</p>
<p>But let's end on a fun note.  In-between all that (and various things
at home, of course), I have taken a bit of what might resemble
"downtime" and I'm learning how to make ~chiptunes / "tracker music"
with <a href="https://milkytracker.titandemo.org/">Milkytracker</a>, which is
just a lovely piece of software.  (I've also been learning more about
<a href="http://www.drpetter.se/article_sound.html">sound theory</a> and have
been figuring out how to compose some of my own samples/"instruments"
from code.)  Let me be clear, I'm not very good at it, but it's fun
to learn a new thing.  Here's a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.flac">dollhouse piano thing</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/dollhouse.xm">XM file</a>), the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/ecto-house.flac">start of a haunted video game level</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
a <a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.flac">sound experiment representing someone interacting with a computer</a>
(<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/conversations-with-a-computer.xm">XM file</a>),
and the
<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">mandatory demonstration that I've figured out how to do C64-like</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_modulation">phase modulation</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio">arpeggios</a> (<a href="https://dustycloud.org/misc/siddy-start.xm">XM file</a>).
Is any of that stuff... "good"?  Not really, all pretty amateurish,
but maybe in a few months of off-hour experiments it won't be... so
maybe some of my future demos / games won't be quite as quiet!  ;)</p>
<p>Hope everyone's doing ok out there...</p>

<p>My blog post permalinks have been bothering me for a while, I feel like they are too cluttered. I mostly like the design of my notes and photos permalinks, since the content on those pages is relatively short, I don't mind how much other stuff on the page there is since it's also good for discoverability of my other content. However on my blog posts, people often come to those from some external source, and they're really there just to read the blog post and then leave. So I wanted to clean it up a bit.</p>
<p>Here's what my blog post pages looked like before.</p>

<p>This is on a 13" Macbook screen with a browser as wide as possible. Here is what the blog posts look like now.</p>

<p>I wanted to give the blog posts a bit more space, so I increased the size of the middle column. I also took out the top bar with the clock and weather. I removed my little author avatar (it duplicated my name, and the photo wasn't really placed very well.) I also changed the timestamp to show just the date, instead of the full date and time and timezone. For notes and photos the time is possibly relevant, but it's really not important for blog posts.</p>
<p>I also added a custom font, which tbh I'm on the fence about using. I do feel like the slightly wider font goes well with the slightly larger column.</p>
<p>So that's the first of the projects for the day done!</p>
<p>Update: Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sl007/104423151649889418">a suggestion from Sebastian</a>, I also increased the font size on the blog posts to keep a similar number of characters per line.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  I finally made the jump from Travis CI to GitHub Actions for my Postgres extensions. Here’s how you can, too.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist
   - todo/fix: check why summary can be nil/null
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->
<div class='wrap'>

 
         
<p>I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> a couple years ago, but fully embraced them
only in the last few weeks. Part of the challenge has been the paucity of simple
but realistic examples, and quite a lot of complicated-looking JavaScript-based
actions that seem like overkill. But through trial-and-error, I figured out
enough to update my Postgres extensions projects to automatically test on
multiple versions of Postgres, as well as to bundle and release them on <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.
The first draft of that effort is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a><a>1</a>, a Docker image
with scripts to build and run any version of PostgreSQL between 8.4 and 12,
install additional dependencies, build, test, bundle, and release an extension.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’ve put it to use in a <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver/blob/c56d76dcbe85e0348b44c6c098560a0df7ab25a5/.github/workflows/ci.yml">GitHub workflow for semver</a>, the
<a href="https://semver.org">Semantic Version</a> data type:</p>
  

 <code> 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
10
11
12
13
14
</code> 

 <code>name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        pg: [12, 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4, 9.3, 9.2]
    name: 🐘 PostgreSQL ${{ matrix.pg }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: pgxn/pgxn-tools
    steps:
      - run: pg-start ${{ matrix.pg }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pg-build-test
</code> 
 
 <p>The important bits are in the <code>jobs.test</code> object. Under <code>strategy.matrix</code>, which
defines the build matrix, the <code>pg</code> array defines each version to be tested. The
job will run once for each version, and can be referenced via <code>${{ matrix.pg }}</code>
elsewhere in the job. Line 10 has the job a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a> container, where
the <code>steps</code> run. The are are:</p>
 
 Line 12: Install and start the specified version of PostgreSQL 
 Line 13: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/pg-semver">semver repository</a> 
 Line 14: Build and test the extension 
 
<p>The intent here is to cover the vast majority of cases for testing Postgres
extensions, where a project uses <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-pgxs.html" title="PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure">PGXS</a> <code>Makefile</code>. The <code>pg-build-test</code> script
does just that.</p>
<p>A few notes on the scripts included in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">pgxn/pgxn-tools</a>:</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-start</code> installs, initializes, and starts the specified version of Postgres.
If you need other dependencies, simply list their <a href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages" title="Search Debian Packages">Debian package names</a>
after the Postgres version.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/pgxn/pgxnclient"><code>pgxn</code></a> is a client for PGXN itself. You can use it to install other
dependencies required to test your extension.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pg-build-test</code> simply builds, installs, and tests a PostgreSQL extension or
other code in the current directory. Effectively the equivalent of
<code>make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make installcheck</code>.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-bundle</code> validates the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto" title="PGXN How To">PGXN <code>META.json</code></a> file, reads the distribution
name and version, and bundles up the project into a zip file for release to
PGXN.</p>
 
 
<p><code>pgxn-release</code> uploads a release zip file to <a href="https://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN: The PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, use the first three utilities to handle dependencies and test your
extension, and the last two to release it on PGXN. Simply set <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets">GitHub secrets</a>
with your PGXN credentials, pass them in environment variables named
<code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code>, and the script will handle the rest. Here’s
how a release job might look:</p>
  

 <code>15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
32
</code> 

 <code>  release:
    name: Release on PGXN
    # Release pon push to main when the test job succeeds.
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' &amp;&amp; github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; needs.test.result == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: pgxn/pgxn-tools
      env:
        PGXN_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PGXN_USERNAME }}
        PGXN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PGXN_PASSWORD }}
    steps:
      - name: Check out the repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Bundle the Release
        run: pgxn-bundle
      - name: Release on PGXN
        run: pgxn-release
</code> 
 
 <p>Note that lines 18-19 require that the <code>test</code> job defined above pass, and ensure
the job runs only on a push event to the <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx" title="Easily rename your Git default branch from master to main">main branch</a>, where  we push final
releases. We set <code>PGXN_USERNAME</code> and <code>PGXN_PASSWORD</code> from the secrets of the
same name, and then, in lines 27-32, check out the project, bundle it into a zip
file, and release it on PGXN.</p>
<p>There are a few more features of the image, so <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pgxn/pgxn-tools">read the docs</a>
for the details. As a first cut at PGXN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD" title="Wikipedia: “CI/CD”">CI/CD</a> tools, I think it’s fairly
robust. Still, as I gain experience and build and release more extensions in the
coming year, I expect to work out integration with publishing <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository">GitHub releases</a>,
and perhaps build and publish relevant actions on the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Not a great name, I know, will probably change as I learn more. <a>↩︎</a></p>

I’m happy to report that all these registrations are now complete and the specification has progressed to the RFC Editor.  Thanks to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cose/about/">COSE working group</a> for supporting this work.</p>
<p>Search for WebAuthn in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml">IANA COSE Registry</a> and the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml">IANA JOSE Registry</a> to see the registrations.  These are now stable and can be used by applications, both in the WebAuthn/FIDO2 space and for other application areas, including decentralized identity (where the <code>secp256k1</code> “bitcoin curve” is in widespread use).</p>
<p>The algorithms registered are:</p>
 
 <code>RS256</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS384</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS512</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512 – new for COSE 
 <code>RS1</code> – RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-1 – new for COSE 
 <code>ES256K</code> – ECDSA using secp256k1 curve and SHA-256 – new for COSE and JOSE 
 
<p>The elliptic curves registered are:</p>
 
 <code>secp256k1</code> – SECG secp256k1 curve – new for COSE and JOSE

It could also be used with native applications, but <a href="https://developers.google.com/gdata/docs/auth/overview#identifying-your-application-to-users">it was awkward at best</a> due to many of the assumptions built into the OAuth 1 model. To be fair, smartphones didn’t really exist yet, and the handful of clunky desktop apps could more or less be dealt with via a few hacks. In OAuth 2, we at least admitted that mobile applications were now A Thing and created the notion of a public client with no recognizable credentials of its own. But it turned out that wasn’t enough, and we needed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">additional tools</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252">additional guidance for developers</a> to get mobile applications right. Even later, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps">single-page applications</a> really came into their own, further defying previous assumptions about OAuth clients. Smart devices and the internet of things drove a world of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">new interaction methods</a> and even <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html">new ideas about what logging in means</a>. And all of this is on top of OAuth’s core set of grant types, the differences between which are largely driven by the abilities of different clients.</p><p>This kind of flexibility and adaptability is one of OAuth 2’s greatest successes, so what’s the problem? Simply put, OAuth 2 makes a lot of assumptions that the user has access to a web browser which is on the same device as the client. In today’s world of smart clients, rich applications, and constrained devices, these assumptions no longer match reality and there’s a real need for a system with more flexibility. While browsers are certainly still around, we aren’t just connecting two websites to each other anymore, and our security protocols should reflect&nbsp;that.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rmrdnl?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Daniel Romero</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Getting the User&nbsp;Involved <p>In OAuth 2, the type of interaction that the client is capable of is defined by the authorization grant that’s in use. This dictates, among other things, how the user gets to the AS and how they get back from the AS to the client. In the authorization code grant, which is at the core of the OAuth 2 protocol design, the user is redirected in both directions through HTTP. The client has to choose exactly one way of dealing with the user before it starts, and this leads to awkward situations like the Device Grant letting the user interactively enter a code at a static URL or having a pre-composed URL that the user just follows. It also means that different grant types need to re-invent parts of the process used in other grant types just so that they can do things a little differently.</p><p>But what if we could decompose all of these aspects and get away from a type-based system? In XYZ, instead of choosing a grant type, a client declares all of the different parts of interaction that it supports. The AS then responds with appropriate responses to whatever portions it supports for that request. From there, the client can take action based on whatever portions make sense. After all, the client knows how it can interact with the user. With these tools, <a href="https://oauth.xyz/interaction/">XYZ’s interaction model allows for a very rich set of interactions</a>.</p><p>In XYZ, we wanted to enable the traditional redirect-based interaction but not depend on it. To do that, the client tells the AS that it can handle redirecting the user to an arbitrary URL, and also signals that it can get the user back on a similar redirect. With this, we’ve got everything we need for an authorization code style interaction.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>OK, but what if we’re now talking about a set-top box that can’t pop open a browser? Here we take a clue from the OAuth 2 device grant and say that we could display an arbitrary code, but at a static URL. We expect the user to go there on a secondary device, and so we don’t have a good way to get the user back at the client&nbsp;itself.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>This is great, but what if we could handle either a redirect or a user code? Let’s say, for instance, that we can hand the user a code they can type in, or we can get them to scan a barcode on a secondary device and be sent to an arbitrary page. To handle that, we simply say we can do&nbsp;both.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "user_code": true<br>    }<br>} <p>Notice that our client expects the user to complete the request on a separate device, and so we don’t have the callback parameter included. The AS can decide whether that’s good enough for what’s being asked, or not. An important difference between these protocols is that OAuth 2 starts with a redirect, while XYZ allows the redirect only after the initial back-channel request. This means we can mix things together in novel ways. For example, we could say that we expect the user to enter a code at a fixed URL, but we do want the user to come back to a callback webpage so that our client can continue.</p> {<br>    "interact": {<br>        "redirect": true,<br>        "callback": {<br>            "uri": "https://client.foo",<br>            "nonce": "VJLO6A4CAYLBXHTR0KRO"<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>What kind of client would ever need to do this? Maybe we’ve got a smart client on device that has ties to a push notification service with a web-based component, or there’s some other deployment structure that we haven’t thought up yet. Componentizing how the user gets to the AS separately from how the user gets back allows us to mix, match, and stack capabilities as appropriate for our use&nbsp;case.</p><p>This setup means we can start to think about other ways to get the user back and securing that return, as well. We need to consider capabilities like sending a response to the client application directly through an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2_Server_Push">HTTP/2 Server Push</a>, or a client being notified through some other signaling mechanism.</p> Moving Off the&nbsp;Web <p>Even more importantly, we need to consider interactions with the user outside of the web entirely. While XYZ’s back channel is defined completely over HTTP calls, it doesn’t have to use the front channel (redirects) to interact with the user at all. Here is where the capability-based interaction mechanism starts to get really powerful.</p><p>What if the client indicates that it can do a webauthn style signature? The server can offer its challenge to be signed in the initial response, and the client can sign it (by prompting the user to activate their key) and return the results in the follow-up request. If it’s a key the AS already knows, and there isn’t any consent to be gathered, the user doesn’t need to be redirected anywhere.</p><p>Or what if the client has access to a digital agent with ties to a non-web distributed data store, like a blockchain or other graph-based data fabric? The client can indicate that it can send and receive messages to this agent, or field queries through it. The agent and the AS might be part of the same data fabric, and therefore not need to go through the client in order to communicate. Such a system could even gather and manage consent entirely outside of a web-based protocol. All the XYZ client would need to care about is how to kick off the transaction and how to get the&nbsp;results.</p><p>Or what if the client wants to prompt the user directly for their credentials (cringe)? It’s generally considered bad security practice, but the UX of a login experience that stays completely native to the application is compelling, even today. Be defining an interaction mode specifically for this, the AS can help manage things in a more secure fashion than the OAuth 2 Resource Owner Password Grant. It could allow some kind of clever presentation of the shared secret without exposing it directly, and it could even account for different kinds of&nbsp;MFA.</p><p>Or what if the AS can interact with the user through a native application? The client should be able to indicate it can support that without pretending it’s an HTTP redirect.</p><p>And if a client could do many different things, then it can set them up in the initial request and let the AS decide what is allowed according to its own policies. We should be able to prompt for a security token and call an on-device agent and redirect out to a webpage if that’s not enough. Since the client doesn’t need to pick a single method ahead of time, it doesn’t even need to discover what is possible in order for it to work. This type of engineering at the protocol level greatly enhances interoperability while simplifying code paths for both client and&nbsp;server.</p><p>And finally, what if we don’t need to interact most of the time? OAuth 2 forces the client to try interaction first, but if the AS knows who the client is and who the user is, then it could decide to grant access without ever doing an explicit interaction. We can even do a bootstrapping of complex protocols, such as allowing the client to present an assertion to represent the user but still allowing the AS to interact through a web page (or some other mechanism) if necessary. The user gets involved only when they need&nbsp;to.</p><p>Interaction is one of the core extensibility points of XYZ and one of the key places where it breaks from OAuth 2’s past assumptions. The possibilities are nearly endless, and I believe we’re going to see some really exciting advancements in this&nbsp;space.</p>

One of the first and most important decisions I made was to not be backwards compatible with OAuth&nbsp;2.</p><p>This is a bold choice: OAuth 2 is absolutely everywhere, and deliberately breaking with it will put any new protocol at a distinct deployment disadvantage. However, I think that the advantages in the flexibility, especially in the models, are worth it. There are a ton of use cases that don’t fit well into the OAuth 2 world, and even though many of these square pegs have been crammed into the round hole, we can do better than that by taking a step back and designing something new.</p> Working With the&nbsp;Legacy <p>For people in these new use cases, this is a great opportunity. But what about everyone out there who already has OAuth 2 systems and wants to also support something new? XYZ doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and so as a solution it needs to take OAuth 2 developers into account in its design even while addressing the new&nbsp;world.</p><p>To do that, we’ve taken a page from how some of the most successful backwards compatible efforts in the past have worked. Let’s look at Ninendo’s Wii console. When it was introduced, one of its most compelling features was a radically new control scheme. This had features like wireless connections, IR-based pointers, switchable accessories, motion sensitivity, and even a built-in speaker. It was unlike anything else out there, and it was a particularly radical departure from Nintendo’s previous generation game console, the GameCube. Nintendo wanted to encourage existing GameCube owners to come along to the new system, not just by making the new features compelling on their own right (since without that, why move away from the GameCube?) but also by adding ports to allow GameCube games and hardware to be used with the new system. If you had GameCube stuff, there was a place you could plug it in. It was on the side/top of the console and hidden under a flap, but it’s there if you wanted to use&nbsp;it.</p>The ports are there, just hidden. Image from <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii">https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Gamecube-Games-on-Wii</a><p>Now if you wanted to play a Wii game, you needed to use the Wii controllers and hardware. And if you wanted to play a GameCube game, you could always just buy a GameCube. But what if you were interested in doing both, but didn’t want to have two systems sitting under your TV? This model of focusing on the new but allowing the old to be plugged in is a powerful one, and it was wildly successful.</p> Plugging OAuth 2 Into&nbsp;XYZ <p>XYZ’s core model is pretty different from OAuth 2. XYZ doesn’t have client IDs as part of the protocol, nor does it have scopes. Instead, clients are identified by their keys, and resources have a rich request language to describe them in multiple dimensions. You can even request multiple access tokens simultaneously. All of these are great for use cases like ephemeral and native clients, or rich APIs, but what about something where OAuth 2 already works&nbsp;ok?</p><p>Just like with the Wii, we’ve made sure that there’s a place to plug in things. In fact, this is one of the <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">key features that polymorphic JSON brings to the party</a>. Let’s say you’ve got an OAuth 2 client that has been assigned the client ID client1 and it asks for scopes foo and bar at its AS. This is pretty easy for a developer to plug in to the authorization endpoint (ignoring other optional parameters):</p> client_id=client1&amp;scope=foo%20bar <p>Since we don’t have explicit client identifiers or scopes in XYZ, what are we supposed to do with these values? To understand that, we first need to take a step back and think about what these items each mean in the context of the overall protocol.</p><p>The client_id in OAuth 2 identifies the client, which should be no surprise. But why do we need to identify the client? For one, we want to make sure that when the client authenticates, it does so using the appropriate set of credentials. Since the browser is untrusted for handling shared secrets, we can’t pass those credentials in the front channel where OAuth 2 starts and we need a separate identifier. If we start in the back channel, we don’t need an identifier separate from the credential. But more fundamentally, what does it mean to identify the client at all? The AS is going to want to know which client is asking so that it can apply the appropriate policies, including gathering consent from the user, and these policies drive the rest of the decision process. We can make that same set of decisions without a separate identifier and using the credential directly. XYZ allows us to send the credential by value, but it also allows us to send a reference to that credential instead of the value. In this way, we can use our existing client_id to tell the AS which key we’re using to protect the requests by passing it in as the key handle for the request, in lieu of the key itself. The AS can associate the key, and therefore the policies, by looking up the&nbsp;handle.</p><p>The scope of OAuth 2 follows a similar journey. A resource in XYZ is described by a multi-dimensional and potentially complex object, with actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of API-specific components to it. But just like the client_id, we need to ask ourselves what does the scope represent in OAuth 2? Functionally, it’s a shortcut asking for a particular slice of an API, defined by the API. So in other words, it’s a predefined combination of actions, locations, datatypes, and any number of other API-specific components — it is a shorthand to a concept analogous to one of the resource request objects in XYZ. Which means, of course, that we can use a resource handle to represent that predefined object.</p><p>What this means is that our client developer has a place in the protocol to plug in the values that they already have. They don’t plug into the same place, and they don’t go through quite the same circuitry, but they’re there, and they&nbsp;work.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar"<br>    ]<br>} <p>But here’s something really cool about this: once we’re plugging in our values into the new protocol, then we can start to use the new features alongside the old ones. Since we have the new system, we can play both the new games as well as the old games. That means that our client could, for example, ask for an additional detailed resource alongside its tried and true&nbsp;scopes.</p> {<br>    "keys": "client1",<br>    "resources": [<br>        "foo",<br>        "bar",<br>        {<br>             "actions": ["read", "write"],<br>             "datatypes": ["accounts", "history"]<br>        }<br>} <p>All of this is done without putting a burden on new apps to use any of these legacy mechanisms. Ephemeral apps don’t have to pretend to get a client ID, and resource servers don’t have to wrap their APIs into simple scope values. Those functions are there for the cases where they make sense and stay out of the way when they&nbsp;don’t.</p> Staying With OAuth&nbsp;2 <p>But what if you don’t want all the new features at all? What if you’re totally fine with OAuth 2 as it is today, or as it will be in a year with all of its extensions? In those cases, just keep using it. No, really. If it’s a good solution, you should keep using it, even if something fancier is on the horizon. OAuth 2 is a good solution for a lot of things, and we’ll continue seeing it for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>OAuth 2’s got a lot of great extensions that let it do a lot of different things, including things like PAR and RAR that start to approach a very different protocol that’s closer to XYZ than classical OAuth 2. However, these extensions have to live in the world of OAuth 2, and the fit isn’t always that great. But for many developers, the cost of smushing these new functionalities in to their existing system might be less than the cost of switching to a new system, and that’s a fine and reasonable approach.</p><p>But for the rest of the world, those who aren’t using OAuth 2 because it’s not a good fit or want OAuth 2 but a bit more than what it offers, then it’s a good time to move forward in a clear and deliberate way.</p>

 Monitoring WSO2 Identity Server Health with Prometheus/Grafana <p>Monitoring the health of your application is something we must have in a production system to make sure that the application is running without any issues. In addition, monitoring may be required in performance testing, capacity planning, etc as well in the pre-production environments to see who well the application perform under different conditions.</p><p>WSO2 Identity Server is an IAM server which is running on a JVM. There are multiple ways where you can monitor the health of a JVM application which can be used with Identity Server as well. In this post, we’ll see how to do that with Prometheus and&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Adding the Prometheus JMX&nbsp;exporter <p>Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring application. It provides different tools and clients to extract the data out of different applications. One such tool is the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter">JMX exporter</a>. Let’s see how we can add this exporter to Identity Server so that It can make the Identity Server JVM matrices available to Prometheus.</p><p>First, create a config file to be used by the JMX exporter at &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin as is.yml and add the following in that&nbsp;file.</p> lowercaseOutputLabelNames: true<br>lowercaseOutputName: true<br>whitelistObjectNames: ["java.lang:type=OperatingSystem"]<br>blacklistObjectNames: []<br>rules:<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;(committed_virtual_memory|free_physical_memory|free_swap_space|total_physical_memory|total_swap_space)_size:'<br>    name: os_$1_bytes<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true<br>  - pattern: 'java.lang&lt;type=OperatingSystem&gt;&lt;&gt;((?!process_cpu_time)\w+):'<br>    name: os_$1<br>    type: GAUGE<br>    attrNameSnakeCase: true <p>Then get the latest release version Prometheus JMX exporter from <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/releases">here</a>. You may also need to build it to get the binary. Place that binary in the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/.</p><p>Now, open the &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file (or the&nbsp;.bat file for windows), and scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following as a parameter,</p> -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \ <p>Note that I’m using the 0.13.0 version of the agent here which I took at the previous step. If it is different please update accordingly.</p><p>Also, note that I’m using 8880 port to export the metrics. You may change this port also if required.</p><p>The &lt;IS_HOME&gt;/bin/wso2server.sh file should look like below with the other parameters</p>     ....<br>    -Dhttpclient.hostnameVerifier="DefaultAndLocalhost" \<br>    -Dorg.apache.xml.security.ignoreLineBreaks=false \<br>    -javaagent:$CARBON_HOME/bin/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.13.0.jar=8880:$CARBON_HOME/bin/is.yml \<br>    org.wso2.carbon.bootstrap.Bootstrap $*<br>    .... <p>Start the Identity&nbsp;Server.</p><p>You can verify the exporter is properly configured by accessing <a href="http://localhost:8880/metrics">http://localhost:8880/metrics</a> (Use the same port you configured in the&nbsp;.sh&nbsp;file)</p> Configuring Prometheus to Pull&nbsp;Data <p>Now at Prometheus, we need to pull the data from Identity Server. To do that create a file named is.yml at PROMETHEUS_HOME. And add the following configs&nbsp;there,</p> global:<br>  scrape_interval:     15s <br>  evaluation_interval: 15s   # Alertmanager configuration<br>alerting:<br>  alertmanagers:<br>  - static_configs:<br>    - targets:<br>      # - alertmanager:9093  # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.<br>rule_files:  # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:<br>scrape_configs:<br>  - job_name: 'WSO2 Identity Server'  static_configs:<br>    - targets: ['localhost:8880'] <p>Note that as targets we gave the hostname and port of the endpoint where Identity Server was exporting the metrics. By default, the context path will be assumed as /metrics. So we won’t need to explicitly configure it&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now start the Prometheus server&nbsp;as</p> ./prometheus --config.file=is.yml <p>The Prometheus server will start at <a href="http://localhost:9090/">http://localhost:9090/</a></p><p>Go to Status -&gt; Targets from the main menu, and see If the Identity Server is properly configured. You should see something as below if all are&nbsp;correct.</p><p>At Prometheus, we can run different queries and see some basic graphs. But I’ll skip that as we can get a lot better graphs with&nbsp;Grafana.</p> Configuring Grafana <p>Download and extract Grafana, and start it by running&nbsp;./grafana-server from GRAFANA_HOME/bin.</p><p>Grafana will start on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. Use the default credentials (admin:admin) to log in (and make sure you change them&nbsp;later)</p><p>At Grafana, first we need to add Prometheus as a datasource for Grafana. To do that, go to Configuration -&gt; Data Sources from the left navigation as&nbsp;below.</p><p>Click add and select ‘Prometheus’ as the type of the data source and provide the connection details as&nbsp;below,</p><p>Now we need to create dashboards from the data we retrieve from Prometheus. Well, we don’t need to create them from scratch. Instead, we can reuse an already available dashboard by importing it. There are few dashboards already available for JVM metrics. Out of them, I prefer the one at <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563">https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/8563</a>. So, Let’s use it&nbsp;here.</p><p>In Grafana, hover over the ‘+’ icon on the left menu and click ‘Import’. And under ‘Import via grafana.com’ give the Id of the above mentioned dashboard which is 8563 and click&nbsp;‘load’.</p><p>On the next page give the ‘Job’ as ‘WSO2 Identity Server’ (which is the job name we gave at Prometheus), and click&nbsp;Import.</p><p>Now you’ll see a nice dashboard with all the health data from the Identity Server. It will&nbsp;include,</p>  Server status (Up/Down)  Uptime  CPU usage  Memory Usage  GC details  Threads  Classloading  <p>Following are some screenshots from my local server (which was mostly idling&nbsp;:))</p>Server status/uptime/CPU UsageMemory usage/GC&nbsp;timeThreads/ Classloading/Physical Memory<p>That’s it! Happy monitoring!</p><p>PS. I was also interested in getting the Identity data also here (like Login details, User signups, etc). And I made some good progress with that. I will cover those in a separate blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html">https://madurangasblogs.blogspot.com/2019/02/monitoring-wso2-identity-server-with.html</a></p>

  There are many reasons to delete your Facebook account, so let's start with the assumption you've already made the decision. Here are a few things to know before you press the big "Delete" button.

<p>There are <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook#Criticism">many reasons</a> to delete your Facebook account, so let's start with the assumption you've already made the decision. Here are a few things to know before you press the big "Delete" button.</p>
<p>Actually deleting your account can have some unintended consequences, so I actually recommend a slightly different approach instead. The problem with deleting your account is that you will essentially disappear from Facebook and any of your friends there won't be able to find you when they do things like tag you in a photo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, even if you delete your account, that isn't going to stop other people from trying to search for you or tag you in posts.</p>
<p>Where this starts to become a problem is it opens up the opportunity for hackers to create a new Facebook account with your name, and start to befriend people in your network, impersonating you and infiltrating your friend network. You might think this would only be a problem for famous people, but believe it or not it can happen to anyone. (If you do see an account that is impersonating someone, you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/174210519303259?helpref=uf_permalink">report it here</a>.)</p>
<p>Another problem is trying to track down every website where you've used "Sign in with Facebook" and remember to add another login method. Keeping your Facebook account around just to be able to sign in to things you've forgotten about later isn't a bad idea.</p>
<p>So instead of deleting your account entirely, a better approach is to remove everything from your profile except for a post that tells people where they can actually follow you elsewhere online.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
 Download Your Information 
<p>You'll probably want to download all your data before deleting everything, either for posterity, or so that you can import the posts into your own website later as well.</p>
<p>Facebook provides an export that contains a reasonably high fidelity version of everything you've done on Facebook. You can find the link to download by going to "Settings", "Your Facebook Information" and clicking "Download Your Information", or by visiting this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi/">https://www.facebook.com/dyi/</a></p>

  

<p>It will take a while before the download link is available, possibly days, so you may need to come back to the rest of this process later.</p>
<p>The HTML export is a fully browsable archive of everything in your account. If you want something you can use to <a href="https://indieweb.org/Facebook#How_to_migrate_off_of">import your posts into your website</a> later then you can download the JSON version instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alright, with that out of the way we can start getting into the good stuff.</p>
 Clean Up Your Facebook Groups 
<p>Groups are one of the few reasons to use Facebook at all, since groups can be made private, it's a reasonable way to have a hidden place to share things with specific people. There also aren't a lot of good alternatives right now.</p>
<p>So you'll want to either remove yourself from all the groups you're in, or at the very least turn off all notifications so that you aren't reminded about them constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a group's page, click the three dots and choose "manage notifications".</p>

  

<p>Turn notifications "off", and also disable member request notifications.</p>

  

<p>I say "off" in quotes because apparently this will still notify you if you are mentioned in a group. Good enough.</p>
<p>You can also "unfollow" the group which will stop pushing updates from it into your timeline, but you'll still remain a member.</p>
<p>Go ahead and go through your list of groups and clean those up.</p>
 Facebook Pages 
<p>If you've created any Facebook Pages in the past, you'll want to decide what happens to them. You can delete pages entirely, or hand them over to other admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the list of pages you maintain here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages">https://www.facebook.com/pages</a></p>
<p>From a page, click "Page Settings" and then find the "Page Roles" option in the sidebar. If there are other admins, you can remove yourself.</p>

  

 Update your Timeline Settings 
<p>Next you'll want to make sure nobody can post stuff on your profile. From your profile page, find the "timeline settings" option. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=timeline&amp;privacy_source=timeline_gear_menu">This link</a> might take you there directly.</p>
<p>Update your Timeline and Tagging Settings to look like the below screenshot.</p>

  

<p>This will prevent anyone from being able to post stuff to your profile without your knowledge, to make sure that only your final "find me elsewhere" post will be visible.</p>
<p>You'll also want to update your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy">privacy settings</a> to the below.</p>

  

<p>This locks down everything as much as possible so that people won't be prompted to friend you by correlating your contact info.</p>
<p>Under the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=facerec">Face Recognition</a>" setting, prevent Facebook from recognizing you in photos by disabling this.</p>

  

<p>Under the section called "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers&amp;view">Public Posts</a>", you'll want to make a few changes. This is one of the few places where you actually do want one of the settings opened up.</p>

  

<p>I've turned the bottom three settings to the most restricted option, but "Who Can Follow Me" is set to "Public". That's so that people who don't know you will see your last "find me elsewhere" post when looking up your profile.</p>
 Start Deleting Stuff 
<p>With these settings out of the way, we can move on to the step of actually deleting old posts. The overall goal here is to make sure people know this is you while also directing them to find your content elsewhere. That means you want to avoid giving people a reason to follow your Facebook account, and deleting your old posts is a good way to demonstrate that you aren't using Facebook anymore.</p>
<p>Start by visiting your profile page and choose "Activity Log". This will bring up a very long list of everything you've done on Facebook. Click "Filter" and choose "Posts". That will show only the things you've posted rather than posts you're tagged in.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Now you can go through and remove your old posts.</p>

  

<p>Depending on how thorough you want to be, you can do the same to remove your likes or comments as well. You'll probably want to go through the list of photos as well as photos you're tagged in. You don't necessarily need to untag yourself from everything though, because one of the settings previously mentioned makes it so other people can't see things you're tagged in from your profile page.</p>
<p>If you get bored deleting things, then there's another option to sort of do this in bulk. There's an option to "limit past posts" to be visible to only your friends. While this isn't quite the same as deleting, it at least means people who are searching for you won't be able to see your old posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find that option under Settings -&gt; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy">Privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  


  

<p>If you've previously set up a tool that imports posts into Facebook such as IFTTT, then you can actually bulk-delete posts that were created by that app.</p>
<p>Go to the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">Apps and Websites</a>" section in Settings and find the app such as IFTTT. From there, you can click "View and Edit", and then click the "Remove" button and you'll see a prompt asking if you want to delete things that app has posted.</p>

  

<p>That should do a pretty good job of mass-deleting things. Although in my testing, it missed a few posts, and some of the apps I know I used to post things weren't showing up in the list. Still, this saved me a bunch of time deleting the things it did catch.</p>
<p>You might want to double check that things aren't still showing up on your profile page by visiting your page and looking through the different sections. For example in my testing, there were still some uploaded photos showing up on my photos tab that weren't showing up in the activity log.</p>
<p>Another place to look for more things that may have been missed is the "Albums" section under photos.</p>
 Trim Your Profile Page 
<p>The next step is to limit what shows up on your profile page. Visit your profile, then click the "More" button and choose "Manage Sections".</p>

  

<p>Disable everything that you can. Some of them can't be turned off.</p>

  

<p>You'll probably want to review the list of people and pages you're following to make sure you want to continue to essentially endorse them from your profile. I decided to unfollow everyone who wasn't a mutual friend.</p>
 Clean Up Your Profile Info 
<p>I was surprised just how much stuff was in my profile. Each of these sections under the "About" tab has content that you should review and decide whether to keep on your profile.</p>

  

<p>This is where it's a bit of a balancing act between how much data you want to delete from Facebook vs whether you want people to be able to verify that this is in fact your profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to remove all the "family" connections to avoid feeding their graph database but also since most people finding my Facebook page really do not need to know who I am related to.</p>
<p>I removed everything from the "Life Events" section like my work history. If someone wants to know that they can find my LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Under Contact Info I added a link to my website and my Twitter account, since those are the two primary places I want to send people to instead of Facebook.</p>

  

 Make a Final "Find Me Elsewhere" Post 
<p>The last thing to do is write a new post that will be the last thing you post to Facebook. That post should tell people that you won't be posting here anymore, and direct them to one or more alternative ways to contact you. Think about why someone would land on your Facebook page and make a call to action to redirect them to a better location.</p>
<p>I like using the "Life Event" feature on Facebook for this post. It makes it a very large post and really drives the point home. Plus you can use this cute animation of someone shining a flashlight around as the image.</p>

  

 Check Your Work 
<p>Once you're happy with how things are looking, it's time to see what your Facebook page look like to other people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook has a built-in feature to view the public version of your profile. Click the little eye in the menu bar on your profile page. That will show you what someone who is not a friend will see when they visit your profile.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p>Now you can poke around your profile and make sure it looks the way you want!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might also be helpful to ask a friend to see what your profile looks like to them, since some of your old posts may have been set to "friends-only" and wouldn't show up in the public view.</p>
<p>Congrats! Now enjoy a Facebook-free life!</p>
<p>If you feel so inclined, add a link to this post in a comment under your "I'm leaving" post so that others can follow this advice too!</p>

  <p>Summary:      We need to replace platforms that intermediate transactions with protocols built on a universal trust framework like Sovrin to avoid a future of hostage taking and retaliatory regulations.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    Platforms service <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two-sidedmarket.asp">two-sided markets</a>. We're all familiar with platform companies like Uber, AirBnB, Monster, eBay, and many others. Visa, Mastercard, and other credit card systems are platforms. Platforms are a popular Web 2.0 business model because they create an attractive way for the provider to extract service fees from one side, and sometimes both sides, of the market. They can have big network effects and tend to natural monopolies. 
</p>

<p>
    Platforms provide several things that make them valuable to users:
</p>
 
     They provide a means of discovering relevant service providers. 
     They facilitate the transaction. 
     They help participants make the leap over the trust gap, as <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers">Rachel Botsman</a> puts it.  
 

<p>
    Like compound interest, small advantages in any of these roles can have huge effects over time as network effects exploit the advantage to drive participants to a particular platform. This is happening rapidly during the recent crisis in food delivery platforms.
</p>

<p>
    A recent New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/delivery-apps-restaurants-fees-virus.html">As Diners Flock to Delivery Apps, Restaurants Fear for Their Future</a>, highlights the power that platforms have over their users:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But once the lockdowns began, the apps became essentially the only source of business for the barroom restaurant he ran with a partner, Charlie Greene, in Columbus, Ohio. That was when the fees to the delivery companies turned into the restaurant’s single largest cost—more than what it paid for food or labor.</p>

    <p>Pierogi Mountain’s primary delivery company, Grubhub, took more than 40 percent from the average order, Mr. Majesky’s Grubhub statements show. That flipped his restaurant from almost breaking even to plunging deeply into the red. In late April, Pierogi Mountain shut down.</p>

    <p>"You have no choice but to sign up, but there is no negotiating," Mr. Majesky, who has applied for unemployment, said of the delivery apps. "It almost turns into a hostage situation."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
    The standard response to these problems from people is more regulation. The article discusses some of the attempts cities, counties, and states have made to rein in the fees that food delivery platforms are charging. 
</p>

<p>
    A better response is to create systems that don't require an intermediary. Sovrin provides an <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">identity metasystem</a> that provides a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">univeral trust framework</a> for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/02/building_identity_systems_on_the__sovrin_network.shtml">building identity systems</a> that can serve as the foundation for creating markets without intermediaries. When Sovrin has a token it can even facilitate the transaction. 
</p>

<p>
    Defining a marketplace requires determining the protocol for interaction between participants and creating the means of discovery. The protocol might be simple or complex depending on the market and could be built on top of DIDComm, or even ride on top of a verifiable credential exchange. There might be businesses that provide discovery, but they don't intermediate, they sit to the side of the interaction providing a service. For example, I might provide a service that allows a restaurant to define it's menu, create a shopping cart, and provide for discovery, but I'm easily <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2014/03/substitutability_is_an_indispensable_property_for_the_internet_of_things.shtml">replacable by another provider</a> because the trust interaction and transaction are happening via a protocol built on a universal metasystem. 
</p>

<p>
    Building markets without intermediaries greatly reduces the cost of participating in the market and frees participants to innovate. And it does it without introducing regulation that stifles innovation and locks in incumbents by making it difficult for new entrants to comply. I'm hopeful that Sovrin and related technology will put an end to the platform era of the Internet by supporting greater, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">trustworthy</a> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/its_the_autonomy_stupid.shtml">autonomy for all participants</a>.

<a></a>
<p>
    My middle son Jacob recently asked me about a number of gravel bikes in the $1000-1500 price range. In looking them over, they all had aluminum frames, carbon forks, and mechanical disk brakes. The other components differed a little from bike to bike but nothing stood out. All were from major manufacturers. 
</p>

<p>
    How to choose? I've bought a number of bikes over the years (I've only got three right now). I told Jacob that one thing made all the difference in choosing: the test ride. I've often been taken in by the specs on a bike, only to ride it and find that it felt dead. The bikes I've purchased spoke to me. They felt like they were alive, a part of me, and I wanted to ride them. Bottom line: buy the bike you fall in love with. 
</p>

<p>
    The implication of this is to buy from a local shop since you need to test ride and they have the bikes. Establishing a relationship with the shop is useful for service and advice too. They often will discount service on bikes they sold. Most bike shops have knowledgeable staff and can help you with everything from accessories to good riding trails. You might pay a bit more, but I think it's worth it.

Namely, what’s with all the handles everywhere?</p> What is a&nbsp;Handle? <p>The XYZ protocol works by passing JSON objects around that represent different parts of the request and response. These parts include the keys the client is using to protect the request, the resources the client is asking for, the user information the client wants or knows about, the display information to be used in an interaction, and other stuff. Handles are, in short, a way to pass some of the request objects in as a reference value instead of as an&nbsp;object.</p><p>First a quick aside: why the name “handle” for this bit? In all honesty, it was the best I could come up with that wasn’t already massively overloaded within the space. Artifact, token, aspect, reference, etc&nbsp;… all arguably better than handle but they could be confusing. I hope that the final version of this protocol can bikeshed a better name for this concept, but for now they’re&nbsp;handles.</p><p>Let’s take keys for an example. In XYZ, the client identifies itself using its key. It can always pass its public key by&nbsp;value:</p> {<br>    "keys": {<br>        "proof": "jwsd",<br>        "jwks": {<br>            "keys": [<br>                {<br>                    "kty": "RSA",<br>                    "e": "AQAB",<br>                    "kid": "xyz-1",<br>                    "alg": "RS256",<br>                    "n": "kOB5rR4Jv0GMeLaY6_It_r3ORwdf8ci_JtffXyaSx8xYJCCNaOKNJn_Oz0YhdHbXTeWO5AoyspDWJbN5w_7bdWDxgpD-y6jnD1u9YhBOCWObNPFvpkTM8LC7SdXGRKx2k8Me2r_GssYlyRpqvpBlY5-ejCywKRBfctRcnhTTGNztbbDBUyDSWmFMVCHe5mXT4cL0BwrZC6S-uu-LAx06aKwQOPwYOGOslK8WPm1yGdkaA1uF_FpS6LS63WYPHi_Ap2B7_8Wbw4ttzbMS_doJvuDagW8A1Ip3fXFAHtRAcKw7rdI4_Xln66hJxFekpdfWdiPQddQ6Y1cK2U3obvUg7w"<br>                }<br>            ]<br>        }<br>    }<br>} <p>This object contains the keying material that will uniquely identify the piece of software making this request, as well as the proofing mechanism that software intends to use with that key. This is especially useful for clients that generate their keys locally: they can show up with a new key and just start working, as long as the server’s policy is OK with that kind of dynamic client. But in the OAuth 2 world, most of the clients are pre-registered, and it would seem silly and wasteful to force all developers to push all of their keying information in every request. So what the client can do instead is present a key handle in lieu of the key&nbsp;itself.</p> {<br>    "keys": "7C7C4AZ9KHRS6X63AJAO"<br>} <p>This handle stands in for the object shown in full above. Upon seeing this handle, the server looks up the key and proofing method that the handle refers to. Instead of passing the key by value, the client has effectively passed the key by reference using the handle construct. Since we’re talking about keying material, it’s important to note that we’re not just talking about a fingerprint or thumbprint here. The value of the key may not have any direct relationship to the value of the key itself, just so long as the AS knows what key it stands for. The key that the key handle points to can even change over time. In addition, the XYZ protocol already has some concessions for passing fingerprints and thumbprints instead of full keys, like this one for a TLS certificate.</p> {<br>    "keys": {<br>        "proof": "mtls",<br>        "cert#S256": "bwcK0esc3ACC3DB2Y5_lESsXE8o9ltc05O89jdN-dg2"<br>    }<br>} <p>From the XYZ protocol perspective, this is still passing the key by value, as it contains enough cryptographic information to identify the key and allow the AS to validate the incoming connection’s signatures. A handle can still be used instead of this hashed certificate value.</p><p>But now you might be thinking, where did the client get that key handle in the first&nbsp;place?</p> Static and Dynamic&nbsp;Handles <p>As long as the AS understands what the handle stands for and the client knows how to use it, the XYZ protocol doesn’t actually care how the parties learn of this handle. However, judging from experience with OAuth 2 and in particular dynamic registration, clients will probably be getting handles in one of a couple&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Static Handles are assigned to represent specific objects at some point before the transaction request. For a key handle, it’s probable that a developer filled in some information into an online registration form, including their public key. The AS generates a key handle that the developer can plug into their software and get started, or the developer could use their key directly. In both cases, the client is identified by its&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Dynamic Handles are assigned to represent specific objects in response to a transaction request. If the client presents an object by value in the request, the AS can, at runtime, generate a new handle and return it to the client software. For a key handle, the client can now send the handle in future requests instead of repeating its keying information. This is a huge boon for mobile applications, as they would be allowed to generate their keys locally and present them directly the first time they talked to a server, but then switch to the simpler and smaller key handle for subsequent requests with the same server. This gives us the benefits of dynamic client registration without a separate registration step being required.</p><p>You’ll notice that in both cases, the handle always translates from the AS to a specific object. The AS is fully in charge of the mapping between the handle and the object it represents, and so that means the AS can define and change that mapping as it needs to. For example, the AS can allow a developer to update a registered client’s public key without changing the key handle that the client sends. Or instead of one handle representing a single key, the handle could represent a family of certificates signed by a common root. The clients in question can always send the key itself or the handle they’ve been configured with.</p> What Do Handles Stand&nbsp;For? <p>In the current XYZ protocol, different parts of the incoming request can be represented by handles. Each of these handles is a little different, as is the information that they represent, but all use the same exact mechanism of a handle value standing in for an object that would otherwise be passed by value. As we’ve covered key handles in our examples above, let’s look at the other&nbsp;parts.</p><p>Resource Handles are simple strings that stand in for one of the potentially-complex objects that the client can use to specify what it wants to access. These strings are usually going to be defined by the API’s being protected, and they stand for common access patterns available at the API. In other words, they are equivalent to OAuth 2’s scope parameter. And in XYZ, the client can simultaneously request both handle and non-handle resources, allowing for rich authorization requests without mode switching.</p><p>Claims Handles are similar to resource handles in that they stand in for a set of user claims that the client is requesting.</p><p>Display Handles stand in for information that can be displayed to the user during an authorization request. These are most useful for dynamic and ephemeral clients, where the client will present all of this once and not need to again. These should be tied to a particular key in order to prevent impersonation of a client. Here we start to get close to the functionality of OAuth 2’s client_id, but dynamic registration and per-instance information of OAuth 2 clients as used in the wild has shown us that it’s valuable for them to vary independently. But for cases where it doesn’t need to vary, you can in fact use a client_id as the key handle and display handle for a <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/pull/1536">hybrid OAuth 2 and XYZ&nbsp;system</a>.</p><p>User Handles can be used with trusted client software to allow that client to assert, to the AS, that the same user is still there as they were previously. This can allow the AS to decide if it wants to shortcut the interaction process — after all, if it’s the same user and the client isn’t asking for something that needs additional approval, then just let them in. This is based on the Persisted Claims Token concept from UMA2. Unlike the claims, this represents what the client already knows about the user, not what it’s asking&nbsp;for.</p><p>Transaction Handles allow a client to refer to a whole ongoing transaction in the future. For example, while the client is polling, or when it receives the front channel response, or when it needs to respond to a challenge from the AS, the transaction handle allows the client to refer to the ongoing transaction object. It can also be used to do step-up and refresh authorization after an initial transaction has been completed. Unlike the other handles, this does not represent a single part of the request object, but rather the overall state. Therefore it’s not quite a handle in the same way, but it does at least represent something that the client is referring to. I think it’s likely that this needs a better, different name, but for the moment it’s a different kind of&nbsp;handle.</p> How Can The Protocol Express All&nbsp;This? <p>XYZ’s protocol is not just based on JSON, but it’s based on a particular technique known as polymorphic JSON. In this, a single field could have a different data type in different circumstances. For example, the resources field can be an array when requesting a single access token, or it can be an object when requesting multiple named access tokens. The difference in type indicates a difference in processing from the server. Within the resources array, each element can be either an object, representing a rich resource request description, or a string, representing a resource handle (scope). Importantly, the array can contain both of these at the same time — and it works semantically because they ultimately both refer to the same thing. The same construct is used for all of the different handles above. As a consequence, it’s clear to a developer that the handle is a replacement for, or a reference to, the object&nbsp;value.</p><p>While it might not be a mode that developers working in statically typed languages are used to, we have implemented this in a number of different platforms, including the famously strict&nbsp;Java.</p><p>In a more statically typed JSON protocol, these would need to be two different fields, each with its own type information. The fields would need to be defined as mutually-exclusive at the protocol level, like jwks and jwks_uri are for OAuth clients. This type of external interlock leads to consistency errors and complex verification schemes, especially as values change. By building the exclusivity into the protocol syntax, we can bypass all of that error-prone interlock checking. The resulting protocol definition is more clean, more concise, and more consistent.</p>

 Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 — Thematic Issues Going&nbsp;Forward We Conjure Our Own Spirit <a href="https://aci-iac.ca/art-books/norval-morrisseau/biography">Norval Morrisseau</a><p>Disclaimer: This is posted by me and does not represent the position of my employer or the working groups of which I am a&nbsp;member.</p><p>The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Version 1.1 is now available on <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">GitHub</a>. This document reflects the collective effort of almost a year since we last posted <a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/public-sector-profile-of-the-pan-canadian-trust-framework-version-1-0-4baf8ff0cfa0">Version 1.0 in July 2019</a>. Since then, the public sector (federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal) have met on almost a weekly basis with 20–28 participants on each call. The result is a truly Pan-Canadian perspective.</p><p>For this post, I won’t focus on what is in the latest version(please <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP">read</a>!). Rather, I want to list the thematic issues we have identified as a group which we need to work on together to resolve. While Version 1.1 represents a huge milestone, there is still much exciting work ahead, which we have captured in the 11 thematic issues&nbsp;below.</p> Thematic Issue 1: Digital Relationships <p>We need to work on expanding our modeling and discussion of digital relationships — currently, there is not much more than a definition.</p> Thematic Issue 2: The Evolving State of Credentials <p>We now find ourselves in the middle of some very interesting developments in the areas of digital credentials. There is a sea-change happening in the industry where there is a movement from ‘information-sharing’ to ‘presenting digital proofs’. There is good work on standards (W3C) relating to verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Due to these new developments, we are now seeing the possibility that the traditional intermediated services (such as centralized/federated login providers) may disappear due to new technological advancements. This may not happen in the near future, but we are currently adjusting the PCTF model to incorporate the broader notion of a verifiable credential and are generalizing it to allow physical credentials (e.g., birth certificates, driver’s licenses) to evolve digitally within the&nbsp;model.</p><p>We are not sure that we have the model completely right (yet), but nonetheless Canada seems to be moving into the lead in understanding the implications of applying these technologies at ecosystem-scale (both public and private). As such, we are getting inquiries about how the PCTF might facilitate the migration to digital ecosystems and to new standards-based digital credentials, open-standards verification systems, and international interoperability.</p> Thematic Issue 3: Informed&nbsp;Consent <p>Informed consent is an evolving area and we don’t think the PCTF currently captures all the issues and nuances surrounding this topic especially in relation to the public sector. We have incorporated material from the DIACC and we have adjusted this material for public sector considerations, but we feel that much more work needs to be done. In the meantime, we feel that we have enough clarity in the PCTF to proceed with assessments — but we are ready to make changes if necessary.</p> Thematic Issue 4: Scope of the&nbsp;PCTF <p>Some have suggested that the scope of the PCTF should be broadened to include academic qualifications, professional designations, etc. We are currently experimenting with pilots in these areas with other countries. We have anticipated extensibility through the generalization of the PCTF model and the potential addition of new atomic processes. Keep in mind, however, that digital identity is a very specific but hugely important use case that we need to get right first. We are not yet ready to entertain a broadened scope for the PCTF into other areas, but soon we&nbsp;will.</p> Thematic Issue 5: Additional Detail <p>Many questions have been asked about the current version of this document in regard to the specific application of the PCTF. While we have a good idea, we still don’t have all of the answers. Much of this detail will be derived from the actual application of the PCTF (as was done with Alberta and British Columbia). The PCTF will be supplemented with detailed guidance in a separate document.</p> Thematic Issue 6: Unregistered Organizations <p>Currently, the scope of PCTF includes “all organizations registered in Canada (including inactive organizations) for which an identity has been established in Canada”. There are also many kinds of unregistered organizations operating in Canada such as sole proprietorships, trade unions, co-ops, NGOs, unregistered charities, and trusts. An analysis of these unregistered organizations in relation to the PCTF needs to be undertaken.</p> Thematic Issue 7: Assessing Outsourced Atomic Processes <p>Section 2.4.3 states&nbsp;that:</p><p>by design, the PCTF does not assume that a single provider is solely responsible for all of the atomic processes. Therefore, several bodies might be involved in the PCTF assessment process, focusing on different atomic processes, or different aspects (e.g., security, privacy, service delivery). Consideration must be given as to how to coordinate several bodies that might need to work together to yield an overall PCTF assessment. The organization being assessed is accountable for all parties within the scope of the assessment. The organization may decide that this is not feasible, nonetheless, the organization remains accountable. Such cases will be noted in the assessment.</p><p>The Issuer in this model is the authority ultimately accountable. Although an Issuer may choose to outsource or delegate the responsibility of the Credential Issuance atomic process to another body, the accountability remains with the&nbsp;Issuer.</p><p>We need to determine how multi-actor assessments will be conducted. It has been suggested that the organization being assessed should have the authority to speak to how well other organizations perform atomic processes on its&nbsp;behalf.</p> Thematic Issue 8: The Identity Continuity Atomic&nbsp;Process <p>The Identity Continuity atomic process is defined&nbsp;as:</p><p>the process of dynamically confirming that the Subject has a continuous existence over time (i.e., “genuine presence”). This process can be used to ensure that there is no malicious or fraudulent activity (past or present) and to address identity spoofing concerns.</p><p>It has been noted that there are privacy concerns with the notion of “dynamically confirming” the continuous existence of a Subject over time. We need to come up with a more precise and privacy-respecting definition of the Identity Continuity atomic&nbsp;process.</p> Thematic Issue 9: Signature <p>Appendix A defines signature as:</p><p>an electronic representation where at a minimum: the person signing the data can be associated with the electronic representation, it is clear that the person intended to sign, the reason or purpose for signing is conveyed, and the data integrity of the signed transaction is maintained, including the original.</p><p>We need to explore how the concept of signature is to be applied in the context of the&nbsp;PCTF.</p> Thematic Issue 10: Foundation Name, Primary Name, Legal&nbsp;Name <p>Appendix A has definitions for Foundation Name, Primary Name, and Legal&nbsp;Name.</p><p>The three terms more or less mean the same thing. We need to pick the preferred term and be consistent in its&nbsp;usage.</p> Thematic Issue 11: Review of the Appendices <p>At some point, we should undertake a full review of the current appendices.</p><p>For each appendix, we need to evaluate its utility, applicability, and appropriateness, and determine if it should continue to be included in the PCTF document. Some appendices will remain; some may be moved to a guidelines document; while others might be discarded outright. Some of the appendices that remain may need to be&nbsp;amended.</p><p>In closing, we remain on a journey of defining trust in a new way — not only for each institution or program but for the digital ecosystem as a whole. We are looking for ways to further broaden this perspective and I will keep you posted on new developments.</p>

  <p>Summary: How can I use Sovrin to perform age verification to minimize the personal data I have to keep? This blog post discusses the basics.</p>


<a></a>

<p>
    Kamea, a member of the Sovrin Telegram channel asked this question:
</p>
<blockquote>
    I’m looking for our users to sign up with a Sovrin account, validate their identity, then use it to verify age and passport country on our network using a zk proof so we don’t have to handle any personal data.
</blockquote>

<p>
    There are actually two different things here and it's useful to separate them.
</p>

<p>
    First, there's no such thing as a "Sovrin account". SSI doesn't have accounts, it has relationships and credentials. But your company will have accounts. The way that works is you set up an enterprise agency on your side to create a relationship (technically a peer DID exchange) with anyone who wants to create an account with you. After they establish that relationship, you can begin to collect attributes you need to provide service. Some of those will be self asserted and some you might require credentials depending on your use case.
</p>

<p>
    The second thing is determining which credentials you want to require. If your requirement is an attested proof of age, then there could be several choices. In an ideal world, people would have a number of those (e.g. national ID, drivers license, passport, bank KYC, etc.) In the current world, you might have to partner with someone like Onfido or another KYC company do give people a way to get their age verified and a credential to use in proving it. Once people have this credential, however, it gives them the means of proving their age (and likely other attributes) anywhere, not just to you.
</p>

<p>
    Kamea mentioned the desire to avoid handling personal data and this is a good solution for that. The proof would record that the person was over 18 and their country of residence without seeing or recording any other information.
</p>

<p>
    I recommend running through the <a href="https://try.connect.me">demo at Connect.me</a> to see how all this could work. There are a number of vendors who can supply help with enterprise agencies and consulting on how to set this up in your organization.

<blockquote>This article is part of a series about XYZ and how it works, also including articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-handles-passing-by-reference-and-polymorphic-json-e1af8892f371">Handles</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-interaction-a84091d2a8c8">Interaction</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-compatibility-with-oauth-2-f7b490be536d">Compatibility</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/xyz-cryptographic-binding-db367f6581e6">Cryptographic Agility</a>.</blockquote><p>It’s been about a year and a half since I started in earnest on <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">the XYZ project</a>. I’ve talked with a variety of different people and companies about how it fits and doesn’t fit their use cases, I’ve presented it at a number of different conferences, and I’ve submitted that work into the IETF in the hopes of starting a new standards working group based on what we’ve built and&nbsp;learned.</p><p>With that in mind, I wanted to take some time here to discuss a number of the core aspects of XYZ: why it has the engineering decisions it does and what the effects those decisions have on the resulting system. But I wanted to start this with a look at a more fundamental question: Why am I doing&nbsp;this?</p> Why Not Extend OAuth&nbsp;2? <p><a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/moving-on-from-oauth-2-629a00133ade">I’ve covered OAuth 2’s shortcomings in the past</a>, and overcoming these shortcomings was a key motivation for starting this project. Many of these shortcomings can be overcome by patching the existing framework with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par">new functions</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-v2-1">new restrictions</a>, and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar">new techniques</a>. OAuth 2 has a long and storied history of doing this, and I’ve been the editor for three such specifications myself along with a whole litany of proposed extensions, profiles, and other work. OAuth 2 is not going away, and in fact I do think that patching it up makes sense for those that want to or need to keep using it. I know I’m going to keep using it to solve problems, and I expect to keep teaching classes and doing engineering work on it for a long time&nbsp;yet.</p><p>But I still think <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-why-now-a15ffdc77fd5">we’ve come to the point where we’ve patched the framework so much</a> that it’s becoming more fragile and less flexible. We need to start looking to the future before the future surprises us. We already have needs that OAuth 2 doesn’t solve very well, even with all its extensions. People are off inventing their own point solutions right now, but that doesn’t have to be the case forever. We stand a much better chance of success if we learn from the evolution of OAuth 2 and build from that, throwing away things that didn’t work out or didn’t age&nbsp;well.</p> Why Build&nbsp;XYZ? <p>I started XYZ as an exercise of stepping back from OAuth 2’s model of the world, and the assumptions that come with it, to see what the world could look like without those constraints. XYZ was my attempt of answering the question, “What if OAuth had been made today with what we know&nbsp;now?”</p><p>Some have described XYZ as “OAuth 2, if we knew better,” and I take that as a high compliment. But it’s important to know that it’s not a completely radical departure, and in fact <a href="https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/pull/1536">XYZ has been designed to be layered into OAuth 2 based platforms</a> and re-use many concepts in a new and consistent way.</p> Why Make a Standard? <p>This is always a hard question. The standards process is <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/standards-or-how-to-program-engineers-fef923eb91c4">fraught with stress and peril</a>, and you <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/a-sandwich-of-bread-and-magic-bfad962b9f28">don’t always get the best results</a> from it. If I had kept XYZ as a simple standalone project, life would almost certainly be easier. The handful of groups that are implementing the draft protocol would still be able to do so, and as an open source project it would continue to grow and be available for anyone who wanted to do with&nbsp;it.</p><p>And I would retain complete control. But therein lies a problem: there are a LOT of really smart people out there, and I think this idea is so much bigger than me. And so I set out to start the process of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-txauth/">proposing a new working group in the IETF</a> to both bring in smart people and provide a mixing bowl for all their good ideas, along with mine. If this is going to be robust and powerful, like I think it can be, then it needs a strong and diverse community to build&nbsp;it.</p> What’s In a&nbsp;Name? <p>The name XYZ is somewhat of an accident, since I bought the domain oauth.xyz simply because I saw it was available (and on sale!), and I didn’t have any plans for it right away. It became a place to host my writeup of “what-comes-after-OAuth-2” and therefore lent its name to the result. Since this wasn’t really OAuth, it became known as&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>I’m the first to admit that XYZ is not a great name for a project. It’s not unique, it’s hard to search for, it doesn’t stand for anything in particular, and more importantly it’s a common way to say something is a stand-in. But that’s just it: it was always meant to be a functional placeholder for what would come next. An experiment in progress, one with real code and real systems working together, but far from a final product. You can deploy XYZ as a protocol today, but it’s going to change going forward as the work continues. I still think <a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/the-case-for-oauth-3-0-5c7537e3f9c3">we could call the next big thing that we’re working on OAuth 3</a>, but that’s for the wider OAuth community to decide when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p>I think it’s likely that XYZ will live on as an implementation of what comes out of the standards process, even as that&nbsp;changes.</p> What’s In It For&nbsp;You? <p>I don’t usually like to get personal here on my professional blog, but some people have been positing why I’ve been doing this work myself. I’ve been accused of trying to subvert the OAuth 2 world and drive OAuth 2 implementors out of business by causing market confusion. This doesn’t make any sense to me considering several of my clients are OAuth 2 implementors. I want them to continue to succeed, and I think the fear of something new is unfounded and bad business sense. I’ve also been accused of doing this to get famous. To that I say I genuinely doubt that being a part of the creation process for a security protocol that most people won’t ever see is going to make me more well-known than I already am, at least in the circles that care about such things. At the moment, I’m lucky enough that my consulting company is fully booked — if not more than full — and I’m having to divert some incoming projects to others. I’ve also been accused of having some secret project that I’m trying to push onto the world, or a stealth start up that I’m trying to drive in a first-to-market situation. Simply put, I don’t have anything like that. All the prototype code and specifications are open source under liberal licenses. So no, I’m not doing this to get rich and/or&nbsp;famous.</p><p>The real reason is a lot more mundane and yet it still confuses people: I want the internet to be better, and I see this as an opportunity to make a difference. I started XYZ as a concept and prototype before any companies talked to me about building it. It was after I had shown that there was something real to this idea that people started to find me because it was a solution that fit the problems that they’re seeing. The feedback and experience of the last year and a half have radically changed the details of XYZ, but the core concepts are still there and still feel&nbsp;sound.</p><p>So what’s in it for me? The same thing that’s in it for you: more security, easier development, wider use cases, and a better internet. I don’t know why some think that this isn’t motivation enough, but I promise I’m not hiding ulterior&nbsp;motives.</p> What’s Next? <p>I hope that at this point it’s more clear why I started XYZ and why I am trying to start the TxAuth group at IETF. In the next few blog posts, I plan to go over some of the key features of the XYZ protocol and explain why they are important and what they bring that OAuth 2 was lacking. Things like passing by reference handles, proof of possession, interaction models, and extensibility all have key roles, and they’ve been explicitly designed into XYZ over the last year and a half. While all of this is covered in some depth on <a href="https://oauth.xyz/">the XYZ website</a>, I think it’s time to push the conversation even&nbsp;further.</p>

<p>Introduction: This article is a brief on the essence of a Pan-African approach towards technological innovation, resilience, and the possibilities of a robust software approach in problem solving for&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>Pan-Africanism has been hailed for years by greats like Toussaint Louverture of the Haitian revolution in the 18th century to Kwame Nkrumah in the 20th century as the ideal that individuals of African descent, in the continent and the diaspora, ought to contribute towards a collective self-reliance to fulfill the potential of the continent. Fast forward to the present day with the presence of the African Union, constituted to help achieve the Pan-African agenda and now propelled by Agenda 2063, the blueprint and master plan for transforming Africa into the global powerhouse of the&nbsp;future.</p>the Black Star Gate,&nbsp;Accra<p>Agenda 2063 is a mission of the AU to ensure that Africa occupies a powerhouse status by the year 2063. Its most visible component yet is the decision to have the continent as a single trade block allowing free movement of goods and services across borders thus championing intra-continental trade. This is under the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement that makes Africa the biggest trade block in the world only followed by the World Trade Organization. For starters, this translates to a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $3.4 Trillion ($3,400,000,000,000) and a combined population of 1.4 Billion people when the ACFTA comes into effect on July 1,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The free trade area will result in significant reductions in trade tariffs and quotas and free movement of people, goods and services while transacting in the single continental market. Gradually, the vision of the founding fathers of the Pan-African movement to achieve unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity of the African people will become a reality. However, to be within the range of achieving Agenda 2063 fully, a Pan-African technological approach is the best shot at getting&nbsp;there.</p><p>A Pan-African Technological Approach</p><p>The Pan-African technological approach to employ is a combination of bits and atoms, hardware based innovations in harmony with software solutions designed to adapt with the African way of life. As such, this demands resourcefulness, multiple areas of application of the said innovation, and the ability to be adaptable over time and for the widest range of Africans on the continent and in the diaspora. This would be the engine that powers the legal tools, the ideas and earlier policy frameworks to enable implementation at scale and in the shortest time possible.</p><p>According to the UN World Population Prospects Report of 2017, Africa will boast of the largest young number of people in the world by 2050. With the quality of life set to improve and with growing numeracy and literacy levels, such a youthful population sets the continent at a massive “leap-frogging” advantage in multiple sectors of her economy. It is this population that will constitute a significant portion of the global labour force and with the increasing integration of technology into daily life and at the workplace, it should not be out of form when creative approaches emerge to solving age-old problems that have faced us as a&nbsp;people.</p>Comparison of Youthful Population by Region between 2017 and&nbsp;2050<p>2020 and&nbsp;Beyond</p><p>Digital financial services (DFS) keep contributing to the introduction into Information Communication Technology and usage of mobile phones for most Africans entering the digital economy. Hence DFS solutions maintain their position as the “Gateway” to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) based innovations. EdTech and Entertainment will also be significant Gateways in the emerging post-Covid world. Specific areas gaining traction are the use of Artificial Intelligence to build smarter systems &amp; inform decision making and the adoption of Blockchain Technologies to build resilient data, financial &amp; verification systems as evident in Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia and&nbsp;Rwanda.</p><p>From Kenya, I co-created Blockchain software for Digital Identity with a group of Pan-African technologists as part of the Identity Working Group of the African Digital Asset Framework. The project, called Kweli (Kiswahili for Truth) is based on a research paper, authored between early 2019 and released in January 2020. Kweli proposes a Digital Trust model to enable secure digital transactions in a privacy preserving way pegged on identities of Africans locally and in the diaspora. The most efficient way we identified to achieve a system like <a href="https://kweli.adaf.io/">Kweli</a> is if such a model was built as a blockchain identity network that allows for flexibility of control over ones own identity and associated data. This approach is generally termed as Decentralized Identity or Self-sovereign Identity.</p><p>A Pan-African Technological Approach would only be efficient if driven by projects built as Open-Source and adopting Open Technology Standards. An Open Source approach seeds innovations based on the initial project either by improvement on it or as inspiration to future complex projects. Consequently, it births a strong community of contributors and supporters all working towards the success of the project. We built Kweli as Free and Open Source Software with this in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>It will be exciting to observe similar projects cropping up in fields such as Robotics, Internet of Things powered solutions, Artificial Intelligence, and 3D Printing that will provide creative solutions for Africans. While a solution like Kweli may have barely scratched the surface, it is a bold step worthy enough to contribute towards the visions of Pan-Africanists from the founding days to the present day Pan-African chugging along in their own unique contribution.</p><p>Links to References</p><p>Agenda 2063 - <a href="https://au.int/en/agenda2063">https://au.int/en/agenda2063</a></p><p>African Continental Free Trade Area - <a href="https://au.int/en/ti/cfta/about">https://au.int/en/ti/cfta/about</a></p><p>UN Population Report - <a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf">https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf</a></p><p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution in Africa — <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-and-digitization-will-transform-africa-into-a-global-powerhouse/">https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-and-digitization-will-transform-africa-into-a-global-powerhouse</a></p><p>Kweli: Pan-African Self-sovereign Identity - <a href="https://kweli.adaf.io/">https://kweli.adaf.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id/kweli-pan-african-self-sovereign-identity-framework-78b6e9f38fc4">Kweli - Pan-African Self-sovereign Identity Framework</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/vibranium-id">Vibranium ID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The zero-day bug in Sign In with Apple actually had nothing to do with the OAuth or OpenID Connect part of the Sign In with Apple exchange, and very little to do even with JWTs. Let's take a closer look to see what actually happened.

<p>Last week, a security researcher discovered and disclosed a <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">zero-day bug in Sign In with Apple</a>, and collected a $100,000 bounty.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign In with Apple is similar to OAuth and OpenID Connect, with Apple’s own spin on it. While there were some critical bugs due to Apple’s initial poor implementation of OpenID Connect, <a href="https://openid.net/2019/06/27/open-letter-from-the-openid-foundation-to-apple-regarding-sign-in-with-apple/">as documented by the OpenID Foundation</a>, those bugs were fixed relatively quickly.</p>

<p>The zero-day bug that was recently discovered actually had nothing to do with the OAuth or OpenID Connect part of the Sign In with Apple exchange, and very little to do even with JWTs. Let’s take a closer look to see what actually happened.</p>

 

<p>Disclaimer: I do not have any inside knowledge about Apple's systems. The information in post is based on the original writeup by <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">Bhavuk Jain</a> and my own observations using Apple's API.</p>

 

<p>The <a href="https://bhavukjain.com/blog/2020/05/30/zeroday-signin-with-apple/">original writeup</a> heavily mentions JWTs and emphasizes the OAuth exchange, and I’ve seen many reactions suggesting that the problem was in the JWT creation or validation, or some poor implementation of OpenID Connect. But instead, the problem was much actually much simpler than that.</p>

 Breaking down the OAuth Flow 

<p>In an OAuth or OpenID Connect flow, the specs talk about the communication from the client requesting the token to the server generating the token. The steps where the user authenticates with the server are intentionally left out of the specs, since those are considered implementation details of the server.</p>

 
 The application initiates an OAuth request by sending the user to the authorization server. This part is the “authorization request” step in the specs. 
 The user authenticates, and may see a consent screen where they approve the request from the application. This part is “out of scope” of the specs. 
 The authorization server generates an authorization code or ID token in the response and sends the user back to the application. This is the “authorization response” step in the specs. 
 

<p><br>
Let’s take a closer look at step 2, the part that you won’t find any direction from the specs when building.</p>

<p>A simple implementation for first-party applications may only ask the user to authenticate with a password.</p>

<p></p>

<p>More secure scenarios may involve the user being asked for a second authentication factor.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For third-party applications, the authorization server will often ask the user to confirm the request the application makes with a consent screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>All of these steps happen outside of what the OAuth and OpenID Connect specs define. These are decisions that the authorization server makes in terms of which and how many of these steps to take.</p>

<p>All of these interstitial screens will have some server-side code at the authorization server that responds to the buttons the user presses.</p>

<p>This is where the flaw with Apple happened.</p>

 Apple’s Unique OAuth Consent Screen 

<p>Apple has a unique feature of their consent screen which lets the user choose whether to share their real email with the application or a randomized proxy email instead. The user can also choose to edit their name that is shared with the application. Both of these features are a great step in the direction of preserving privacy and empowering the user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s imagine a simplified example of how this could be built. The server shows this page to the user, and provides an HTML form that will be submitted back with the options the user chooses.</p>

<p>The options are the user’s name and an email address. Whichever the user selects will be sent back to the server, and the server will continue on with issuing the OAuth authorization response. The name is intended to be user-editable, so it makes sense that whatever the user enters here will be sent to the server. The email address however, should only be toggled between one of the user’s registered email addresses or the generated proxy address. The problem with Apple’s implementation was essentially that in this step, the email is sent to the server and the server accepted whatever email was given. The attack is to intercept this part of the flow when logging in yourself, and put in the victim’s email address in the request to the server. That would cause Apple to eventually generate a JWT with the victim’s email address in it, which the application would then use.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of an HTML form that has this problem. This is obviously simplified compared to Apple’s actual implementation, but I’m just trying to get the point across.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/confirm" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="name" value="Aaron Parecki"&gt;
  &lt;select name="email"&gt;
    &lt;option value="aaron@parecki.com"&gt;Share my Email&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="xxxx012345@privaterelay.apple.com"&gt;Hide my Email&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Confirm"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>This allows the user to edit their name and choose whether to share their real email or proxy email with the application.</p>

<p>The problem is in the form validation of this method on the Apple servers. Clearly someone who wanted to could change the values before submitting the form. For example, replacing the value of the “Share my Email” option with the email of their victim. Apple was not validating this email, so it was accepting whatever the client sent.</p>

<p>The result of this form action is eventually the client application would get a JWT which would contain the email address of the victim instead of that of the Apple account owner.</p>

<p>Here’s a way to build this form that would have avoided this problem in the first place.</p>

 <code>&lt;form action="/confirm" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="name" value="Aaron Parecki"&gt;
  &lt;select name="email"&gt;
    &lt;option value="real_email"&gt;Share my Email&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="proxy_email"&gt;Hide my Email&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Confirm"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code> 

<p>In this version of the form, the <code>name</code> field is still editable, since it’s intentional that the user can type whatever they want in that field. But now, the value of the <code>email</code> field sent to the server will be either <code>real_email</code> or <code>proxy_email</code>, and the server will assign the appropriate value server-side. This prevents the user from being able to inject a victim’s email address into this exchange.</p>

<p>The other way to solve this would be to validate on the server side that the submitted email matches one that is already on the user's account, which is likely what they did since Apple's actual form does still include the email address as the value.</p>

<p>While this is obviously a simplified version of how Sign in with Apple works, it is meant to illustrate the bug and show how this is a common problem in any system that accepts user input.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this was a problem with Apple not verifying external input from a form submission.</p>

<p>Just remember, this bug was a lack of form validation.</p>

 But what about the JWT? 

<p>There have been a lot of comments about how this is also a problem with JWTs, either lack of JWT validation or suggesting that somehow it was a misuse of some OpenID Connect claims. There is another half of the story here in order to actually pull off this attack on a real application.</p>

<p>Given the bug above, an attacker was able to start signing in to an application, and swap the <code>email</code> claim in the JWT that was issued with a value of their choosing. The application would end up with a JWT such as the example below:</p>

<p>Raw JWT:</p>

 <code>eyJraWQiOiJlWGF1bm1MIiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcGxlaWQuYXBwbGUuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoibG9sLmF2b2NhZG8uY2xpZW50IiwiZXhwIjoxNTkwOTU0ODk1LCJpYXQiOjE1OTA5NTQyOTUsInN1YiI6IjAwMTQ3My5mZTZmODNiZjRiOGU0NTkwYWFjYmFiZGNiODU5OGJkMC4yMDM5Iiwibm9uY2UiOiJlODU5ZjE0MWI1IiwiYXRfaGFzaCI6Ii1wVlROTDUxSWx3X1dxZjNOOGdlQmciLCJlbWFpbCI6ImFhcm9uQHBhcmVja2kuY29tIiwiZW1haWxfdmVyaWZpZWQiOiJ0cnVlIiwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNTkwOTU0Mjk0LCJub25jZV9zdXBwb3J0ZWQiOnRydWV9.rjHR_fuHKxyDt4vd9nLS5DnsEhDC4X1krR-qsiWr68uWkP8gCM2D-x3sa5_N6RFoITrqkwl6CBBPv07-LBcbndeNDP9bf4ztAtjs77CFkixoFFxQSqcc7oT28cDIzH6btyKveqRKSe1C1Fy-1ltxQRjDvAj4xDZTfAXzFrBMbeutx32zmXR8l4KbQaacjpASr8yfUKRCS8lAOk30zlALww2Zx1T0XB-swpsNhpum4nVo6iK7KOpgcY0teFxtf4xwXYGMTm-WQQJZZ65uHNdd99LGnyE_iflQvsm8iq3B7-eKpoC90uImoeN8W3W5AbFNhOY1z8yVsOtDSth9SQCvvA
</code> 

<p>Decoded:</p>

 <code>{
  "kid": "eXaunmL",
  "alg": "RS256"
}
.
{
  "iss": "https://appleid.apple.com",
  "aud": "lol.avocado.client",
  "exp": 1590954895,
  "iat": 1590954295,
  "sub": "001473.fe6f83bf4b8e4590aacbabdcb8598bd0.2039",
  "nonce": "e859f141b5",
  "at_hash": "-pVTNL51Ilw_Wqf3N8geBg",
  "email": "attacker@example.com",
  "email_verified": "true",
  "auth_time": 1590954294,
  "nonce_supported": true
}
.
(signature)
</code> 

<p>The application would then validate the JWT by checking the signature, and consider the user “logged in”. Since Apple did in fact generate this JWT, the signature would be valid, so the application wouldn’t know any better that the email address was not legitimate.</p>

<p>This points to the next problem, which only some applications would be vulnerable to.</p>

<p>In order to actually use this attack against the application, the application would have to be looking at only the <code>email</code> claim to identify the user who signed in. This is not the intent of OpenID Connect or Sign in with Apple.</p>

<p>Applications should be using the <code>sub</code> value to identify the user, as the <code>sub</code> value is meant to be a stable identifier for users, whereas the email address on their account may change for various reasons. If an application uses only the <code>email</code> to identify the user, then it would be vulnerable to this kind of account takeover given the bug with Apple I described above.</p>

<p>But here's the real problem, and why Apple making up their own variations on the standard leads to things like this. Notice that the user's name doesn't appear anywhere in the ID token? That's because Apple decided that the user's name should actually only be delivered to the application once, the first time they log in to the app, and it is delivered in the <code>form_post</code> response body rather than in the ID token.</p>

<p>Yes, that means the payload your redirect URI gets will be a POST request with the following request body:</p>

 <code>state=8c9b5acdc8
&amp;code=cb337ce2c688f45f6b537498acb6599fe.0.nruxt.QrMBT0tzG2Ssqs-T1L5hqA
&amp;user={"name":{"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Parecki"},"email":"attacker@example.com"}
</code> 

<p>The application is expected to then exchange that code for the ID token, but notice that the name and email are already sent here? An app developer might look at that and say "well that was easy, I'll just use these values and stop there". This is where Apple would have returned the wrong email address using the technique above, so if app developers use the email address in this response to identify users, they would be vulnerable.</p>

<p>It would be safer for Apple to not have sent user data back in this redirect at all, and instead always return it from the token endpoint in the ID token. That way app developers could be sure that the data did in fact originate from Apple and wasn't modified.</p>

 So was this really a zero-day? 

<p>Apple paid $100,000 for the bounty, which is the maximum amount they list for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security-bounty/">"Unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple Servers"</a>. This suggests that some of Apple’s own applications were vulnerable to this somehow, because otherwise this would have only affected access to data of third party apps.</p>

<p>I've never seen Apple apps using Sign in with Apple themselves, typically they use their own built in Apple ID authentication directly. However it’s certainly possible that Apple is moving towards Sign in with Apple even for their own apps, as that would be a huge step up in security compared to what they have now, for all the same reasons that <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/password/">entering passwords directly in applications is dangerous</a>.</p>

 How to prevent these kinds of bugs in your own services? 

<p>Rule number 1: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html">Validate your form inputs</a>!</p>

<p>Rule number 2: Never roll your own authentication.</p>

<p>We have standards like OAuth which represent years of experience across a wide range of companies documenting best practices building this stuff. And while it’s certainly possible to make mistakes when building an OAuth implementation, at least you have the benefit of leaning on the rest of the security community to find and document problems and patterns for building it securely.</p>

<p>If you’re going to run or build your own OAuth server instead of using an <a href="https://developer.okta.com">existing service</a> or <a href="https://oauth.net/code/">open source product</a>, take a very careful look at all of the OAuth RFCs and make sure you know what you’re getting in to before you start.</p>

<p>Even Apple made this mistake when they first rolled out Sign in with Apple. They had loosely based it off of OpenID Connect, but left out a few critical pieces that were necessary to make it a secure implementation. These were quickly <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/master/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md">documented by the OpenID Connect community</a> and Apple later fixed them, mostly.</p>

<p>Don't be like Apple, use existing open standards.</p>

 DIF I&amp;D WG: Starting work on cryptographic secret&nbsp;recovery <p>One of the most important challenges that remain in decentralized identity architecture is the key management. The whole point of a <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a> (which is the underlying paradigm that has led to the development of Decentralized Identifiers and many other related technologies) is that individuals, organizations, and things create and manage their own cryptographic keys without reliance on a central authority or intermediary. But as we know, with great power comes great responsibility — in this case, while we have the power to wield private keys that control DIDs, we can also lose everything connected to those DIDs if we can’t retain and secure them. By definition, in a decentralized identity system, there is no centralized service to provide an “I forgot my password” button.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisusuallyworks">Richard&nbsp;Payette</a><p>That is the starting condition. It is certainly possible to build safeguards and recovery mechanisms into a decentralized identity system. Such mechanisms can be as simple as creating a backup of a wallet that holds cryptographic keys or writing down a seed number on a piece of paper. Many key recovery techniques that are popular in the cryptocurrency community can also be applied to decentralized identity. Some of the better-known approaches are <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">mnemonic seed phrases</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a> algorithm.</p><p>Despite the existence of approaches to make key recovery simpler and better, there is still much need for innovation. This is the reason why the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a> is excited to announce an open call for contributions and development of new secret recovery schemes, and implementations. To kick off work in this area, Microsoft, a member of the DIF I&amp;D WG, will be contributing a scheme called ‘Fuzzy Vault,’ which incorporates many desirable, human-friendly features into a single recovery scheme. Daniel Buchner of Microsoft will be posting soon to detail their contribution to the ‘Fuzzy Vault’ scheme to this DIF I&amp;D WG initiative. The whitepaper for the ‘Fuzzy Vault’ scheme will be published in this DIF repository: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-vault">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-vault</a>. The code implementation and any specifications required for ‘Fuzzy Vault’ will be developed within the DIF I&amp;D&nbsp;WG.</p><p>Another approach DIF participants have worked on is a mnemonic scheme encoded as a 3D experience, called Seed Quest. This scheme uses geo-temporal-spatial inputs, which are more human-friendly than traditional word inputs. The scheme provides 128 bits of entropy for seed recovery with a mnemonic sequence that requires minimal rehearsal: <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest</a>. DIF members have recently discussed ways to combine these schemes to maximize UX and recoverability.</p><p>These two efforts are just the beginning of DIF’s work in the area of secret retention and recovery. We encourage everyone to contribute their ideas, code, and insights to this vital work.

  Since February of 2020, I have been spending time with the mm-ADT, or multi-model abstract data type, project. I am not an expert by any means, but Dr. Marko Rodriguez and Dr. Ryan Wisnesky have been gracious to me on the Slack channel.   Marko has been coding since he was 12 and since has become a pioneer in the graph database movement with his development of the graph traversal language Gremlin.

He worked on an early implementation in <a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/">Apache TinkerPop</a> and commercialized Gremlin in Titan through his company Aurelius [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee9TCXU--A">1</a>,<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/p2vo0J8jou8/Lr0r0cIdBwAJ">2</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAYA4Kd8JE">3</a>,<a href="http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/">4</a>].<br><br>Gremlin provides a virtual machine that allows people to express queries functionally on data that can be interpreted as a graph. A variety of programming and query languages can work together to compile to byte code used to execute Gremlin traversals.<br><br>Ryan worked with <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/">Dr. David Spivak</a> to manipulate databases using category theory. It is described extensively in both David and Ryan's talks [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk36__qkhrk">5</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkHce4zWmUk">6</a>] and has been commercialized through <a href="https://conexus.ai/">Conexus</a>. Ryan Holbrook also observed the work and produced and excellent talk [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJrVKZULiLU">7</a>].<br><br>Conexus' product, the <a href="https://www.categoricaldata.net/">Categorical Query Language</a> allows users to apply various database tasks such as"querying, combining, migrating, and evolving" using provably correct algebra.<br><br>Marko and Ryan are among the group congregating in a new mm-ADT community.&nbsp; The goal is to have Languages, Processors, and Databases interconnect. if this is confusing, look at Actors in the distributed computer sense for where this is headed [<a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">8</a>]. However, Actors are inclusive to mm-ADT since it is more general. <br><br>Algebra described in the String Ring Theory paper [<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2565243#.Xs2irBZOlFR">9</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235158">+</a>], combined with category theory, is being implemented in the mm-ADT project. What might have been a variation and for TinkerPop3 has now become generalized algebraic approach that is applicable to more than things resembling graphs. This generalized approach was described by Marko in the GQL Community Update [<a href="https://www.gqlstandards.org/community-updates">10</a>], ApacheCon in 2019 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-multimodel-abstract-data-type">11</a>] , and DataDays in 2020 [<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/mmadt-a-virtual-machinean-economic-machine">12</a>]. <br><br>Joshua Shinavier has also followed the mathematical trend in TinkerPop by working on Algebraic Property Graphs with Ryan Wisnesky [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04881">13</a>] and giving a talk at the Global Graph Summit (co-located with DataDays) [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrFz64aF5sY">14</a>]. <br><br>My involvement with this community came conveniently when a friend urged me to start a project that aimed to track data from at least nationally distributed IoT devices. <br><br>tl;dr: Marko began following me during the mid-summer of 2019.

<p>Question I received yesterday: </p>



<p>Do you know anything about the Inslee administration giving the okay to dormitory housing for all the Yakima farmworkers who are dying of the virus?</p>



<a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/may/22/agricultural-workers-in-central-washington-strike-/"></a>Agricultural workers strike this month in Yakima, calling for officials at Columbia Reach to enforce safety measures that will protect workers against COVID-19 and provide them with hazard pay during the pandemic. <br>(Photo courtesy Edgar Franks) – <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/may/22/agricultural-workers-in-central-washington-strike-/">The Spokesman-Review</a>



<p>My reply:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Sadly I learned that Washington’s agribusiness does not want to protect its migrant workforce. The unions do not want to protect the migrant workers either. The unions gave up their original demand that the top bunks not be used to enable social distancing while sleeping. The fact that the virus can spread while breathing in and out when a mask is absent was ignored. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile state and county public health workers are trying to keep the migrant workers from getting infected and spreading infection….&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-07/washington-farmworker-coronavirus">This article in the LA Times.</a>..not reported in the Seattle Times may enlighten you:</p>



<p>During last week’s call with Washington State’s Dept of Commerce, I learned that Yakima County has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections not only in WA State, but&nbsp; <a href="https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/coronavirus/update/yakima-countys-coronavirus-rate-highest-on-west-coast/article_203862c6-d516-5ae7-b9f4-87a278221d14.html">among all counties on the West Coast</a>. At that time over 2,600 people were infected with coronavirus in Yakima County, roughly 15% are agriculture and food production workers, according to the Yakima Health District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yakima Health officials are battling outbreaks at long-term care facilities and the county has the largest population of essential workers in Washington State. The CDC and OSHA have provided no written guidelines.</p>



<p>Washington State commissioned a work group who made recommendations, including at least 75 square feet for sleeping. Only bottom units of bunk beds can be used unless a housing unit is being occupied by a single family. It is left to each county’s public health officials to negotiate with each employer – and it is insane, unsafe and even deadly.</p>



<p>The pandemic is rippling through the region’s agricultural industries, sparking labor strikes and I heard a lawsuit, but I have not seen the complaint nor do I know which farm biz was sued.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Striking workers say they want more masks, gloves, disinfectant, plastic dividers between workers on the production line, and a $2 per hour increase in pay. Workers throughout the various company strikes echo those demands.&nbsp; </p><p>Workers have also demanded that their employers inform them who exactly tested positive so they can know if they may have been exposed. Company managers say that by law they can’t give out private health information of employees.&nbsp; </p><a href="https://www.nwpb.org/2020/05/21/are-their-apples-worth-more-than-our-lives-yakima-valley-fruit-workers-strike-for-protections-pay/">– Are Apples worth more then our lives</a></blockquote>



<p>In May over 400 Yakima Valley fruit packing workers have gone on strike, according to Familias Unidas Por La Justicia (FUJ). The farmworker advocacy group, based in Skagit County, is helping workers organize committees, negotiate with employers and seek legal advice.&nbsp;Unclear if anyone from the NLG is participating.</p>



<p>One worker shared what workers need: “That’s why we need a plan that gives us security to go to work, work safely, and return home and be okay.”</p>



<p>Now all 50 states are reopening – and the American worker has no OSHA guidance.&nbsp;  Now, workers fear for their lives. “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-us-workers-fear-for-their-jobs-and-their-health/a-53511146">People are scared. Especially when they’re working close together</a>, if they’re not being provided with masks or other personal protective equipment, or if there unable to wash their hands,” says Shelly Ruzicka, Arise Chicago.</p>



<p>There have been more than 200 walkouts/strikes in the country <a href="https://paydayreport.com/ford-workers-walk-off-workplace-violence-at-record-levels-220-strikes-since-march-1st/">since March 1st</a>.  Most have received little press attention and all States have relaxed Stay-at-Home Orders.  </p>



<p>Finally on May 18th, the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/safety/afl-cio-sues-osha-to-force-temporary-worker-safety-standard">AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit</a> to ask a federal court to compel the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from the novel coronavirus. Sadly this is too late for many hundreds if not thousands of deceased essential workers and their families who became infected with COVID-19. The case is <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/InreAmericanFederationofLaboraDocketNo2001158DCCirMay182020CourtD?1590201859">In re: American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a>, D.C. Cir., No. 19-1158, 5/18/20.</p>



<p>Follow the money. Seems immigrants and refugees, the poor and the middle class are expendable. All that matters is the 1% and wealthy corporations.  </p>



<p>We need a grassroots campaign to get America to protect workers’ health and our food supply!</p>

Photo Cred:&nbsp;Adobe<p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/our-technology">Transmute</a> believes that cross-vendor interoperability is critical for commercialization of decentralized identifier (DID) and verifiable credential (VC) technology. To interoperate means that a computer system or software has the ability to exchange and make use of data from a different system or software “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability#Software">via a common set of exchange formats</a>.” But technical interoperability is difficult to achieve, and it’s definitely not the status quo when it comes to the systems our customers are using today. In fact, most of them are [frustratingly] locked into a single vendor when it comes to transaction management software — with no easy way to share data with parties in their ecosystem.</p><p>I’m often asked why we, as a start-up, would <a href="https://gist.github.com/OR13/0b8be9d8c43c2acd2d7cf09f6887a8a0">build so much out in the open</a>. We aren’t afraid to put out the first reference implementation — although never without tests — because we’re keen to have a baseline to measure against and iterate on, especially when it comes to the technical foundations required for achieving interoperability. The more interesting question is why we work so hard to ensure interoperability with “competing” or ancillary DID-based products. The answer is that we view achieving interoperability as a requirement for market creation.</p><blockquote>We are solving a business problem; achieving interoperability is a barrier to adoption.</blockquote><p>As the world becomes increasingly hyperconnected, “connective tissue” products and services [like ride-shares, Slack, etc.] are in greater demand in order to bridge the last miles and information silos created between the multitude of disparate internet-enabled products and services we now rely on. For this product category, interoperability is required to create a market compelling enough to go&nbsp;after.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/5/18210376/uber-lyft-ride-loyalty-chart">if you are loyal to a single ride-share brand today</a>, your user experience suffers. It takes longer to find rides if you’re loyal, and <a href="https://evestar.com/brand-loyalty-is-dead-for-electric-scooters/">transit time is a key metric in mobility</a>. Additionally, a frustrating user experience limits adoption, and throws a major kink in customer retention. If riders have multiple apps and are willing to ride whatever brand is most convenient to them, their user experience massively improves, adoption accelerates, and the market expands for everyone. This example demonstrates market expansion due to interchangeability versus technical interoperability, but it highlights the same impact to customer adoption and retention given customers’ current attitude toward avoiding vendor&nbsp;lock-in.</p><p>Similarly, if my Texas issued digital driver license can’t be verified by my California-resident digital wallet, then I have not sufficiently solved the inefficiencies and traceability problems of physical licenses. In this scenario, a new, worse inconvenience is created since adoption of a solution that lacks interoperability means I’ll have to carry my physical license for interstate transit and my digital one. Furthermore, convincing state DMVs to offer a digital identity credential is a tremendous feat (<a href="https://thedailytexan.com/2019/04/18/digital-driver%E2%80%99s-license-test-program-approved-by-texas-house">it took Texas 3 legislative sessions to agree to a single pilot</a>); imagine when you have to sell them on implementing 50 different versions. After all, my physical form Texas drivers license is already an acceptable identification credential across all 50&nbsp;states.</p><p>One criticism of supply chain-focused solutions using blockchain is that in order to realize value, you have to convince all of the ecosystem players to adopt the same product — or at least the same technology stack. Not only is that a tough sell in terms of architecture investment (nobody wants to “rip-and-replace,” and everybody hates vendor lock-in), but it does not sufficiently address the data sharing challenges that logistics professionals face today. Efficiency gains are necessary, but not sufficient; customers want to share critical data in a provable form regardless of the underlying system.</p><blockquote>If a brand uses software to create digital product credentials, but said credentials could not be effectively handed off to subsequent players in their supply chain, then the problem isn’t&nbsp;solved.</blockquote><p>For Transmute, the foundations required to technically interoperate are considered pre-competitive, and our ability to interoperate widely is a strategic feature. This feature powers a competitive advantage that ensures Transmute customers’ critical trade documents are verifiable at every step in the supply chain, regardless of where they’re stored and what blockchain they’re anchored to. <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/global-trade-solutions">Transmute customers</a> realize maximum confidence about data integrity and access far richer insights about the health of their supply chains as a&nbsp;result.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-business-case-for-interoperability-a1a2b884297d">The Business Case for Interoperability</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hi Janne, thanks for writing! The SSI portion of the article was simply a very high-level introduction to what SSI is, and we flesh out how it works and different use cases in much more details in subsequent installments of the series. You can find full series on my Medium profile; <a href="https://medium.com/@arjgovind/self-sovereign-identity-under-the-hood-b987123c25ba">here is a link</a> to the next&nbsp;article.</p><p>That being said, I think you raise some interesting questions here; let me briefly address&nbsp;them.</p>  Regarding multiple identities, yes, anyone is free to make as many identities (i.e. DIDs) as they please. However, the trust in a DID stems from the credentials it’s been issued, and a credential issuer (say the government) is not going to issue multiple credentials based on my one physical identity.  The “link” between physical and digital identities is established primarily by verifiable credentials. To get the government to issue you a driver’s license credential, they ultimately verify your real physical ID (and make sure you can drive!). Similarly, a credential from a university will involve the university checking that you studied&nbsp;there.  I think the legal status of DIDs and digital contracts is a complicated question, however I do explore some legal questions in my <a href="https://medium.com/inside-r3/is-self-sovereign-identity-the-answer-to-gdpr-compliance-15c289ac3c27">article on GDPR</a> and a forthcoming piece on&nbsp;KYC.  <p>Thanks again for&nbsp;writing!</p>

  <p>A report I have co-authored on <a href="http://sammantics.com/s/DAO-A-Decentralized-Governance-Layer-for-the-Internet-of-Value-1.pdf">DAOs can be downloaded here</a>.</p> KEY TAKE-AWAYS <p></p>  <p>The key feature that changed organizations over the years has been: reducing transaction costs to coordinate. This is reflected in Coase’s Theory of the Firm. You can achieve marginal improvements, such as applying decision support systems within an organization, but every once in a while, a large systemic change occurs that at first looks like a marginal benefit, but in essence enables wholly new types of organizations to exist.&nbsp;</p>  <p>DAOs not only allow for the reduction of transaction costs, but new organizational forms and compositions to be created.</p>  <p>In order to have a highly functional DAO, members must:</p>  <p>Have equal access to the same information for decision-making</p>  <p>Face the same costs for transacting their preferred choices</p>  <p>Base their decisions on self-interest and the best interest of the DAO (not on coercion or fear)</p>    <p>DAOs attempt to solve coordination problems by solving problems associated with collective actions by aligning individual incentives with globally optimal outcomes (for people or corporations). By pooling funds and voting on fund allocation, stakeholders share the costs and incentivize coordination so the entire ecosystem benefits.</p>  <p>DAOs are performing the biggest experiment in new forms of alternative governance. These experiments are not in the form of giant nation-states but applied on a local community level. This comes at a time where peak globalization is in the rear-view window and the world is retreating to a more local model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>It is important to note, Bitcoin was the first DAO.&nbsp; It is run without a central authority by a core team of developers who propose decisions on the future direction of the project, mainly through Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) which need consensus from all network participants (though mainly miners and exchanges) for changes in the code to be made.</p>  <p>There will be a growing number of DSaaS (DAO Software as a Service)&nbsp; providers, such as OpenLaw, Aragon and DAOstack,&nbsp; designed to accelerate the growth of DAOs as a category. They will provide on-demand specialized resources such as legal, accounting, and third party auditing for compliance services.</p>  <p>In a DAO a triangle of tensions exists.&nbsp; This lexicon of the triangle is based on the treatise “Exit, Voice &amp; Loyalty” by Albert Hirschman. These must be balanced to find an optimal outcome which allows the DAO to achieve its mandate:</p>  <p>Exit (Individual)</p>  <p>Voice (Governance)</p>  <p>Loyalty (Decentralization)</p>    <p>DAOs challenge the traditional hierarchical and exclusive organizational structure as seen in many facets of the world today. Through “wisdom of the crowds” it is possible to have better collective decision making and therefore better run organizations.</p>  <p>New products are being made at the intersection of DAOs and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As DAOs become more decentralized and digitized using DeFi products as the payment/distribution methods, DAOs will increase and lead to new and more DeFi products being formed to interact with DAOs. This will be most powerful where the DeFi implementations allow token holders to use governance to customize and optimize the design of the parameters of the application creating a better, tailored user-experience. It can also be used for time locking and creating different types of fee structures.</p>  <p>DAOs allow for capital to be pooled, that pooled capital to be allocated, and to create an asset backed by that capital. They also allow for non-financial resource allocation.</p>  <p>Using DeFi enables DAOs to bypass, if they choose, the traditional banking sector, along with their inefficiencies.&nbsp; This is significant as it creates a Trustless, Borderless, Transparent, Accessible, Interoperable &amp; Composable corporation.</p>  <p>DAO community and governance is very complex and difficult to get right, yet is crucial to the success of the DAO.&nbsp; Coordination processes and incentive measures need to be balanced so that all community members feel that their contributions matter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Most DAOs are looking to wrap a legal structure with underlying smart contract code around the entity so as to comply with regulations, provide legal protection and limited liability to their participants and allow for easier deployment of capital.</p>  <p>DAO is a Misnomer. DAOs today are not fully decentralized, nor are they fully autonomous and in some cases they may never aspire to be either. Most DAOs will start centralized, then start adopting smart contracts to automate simple internal processes and limit centralized governance. With an aligned purpose, good design and luck they can grow towards being a truer version of a DAO in time. This misnomer has led to a lot of hype around the distributed autonomy of DAOs versus the reality of what they are today.</p>  <p>DAOs are not radical or unique to blockchain technology. There is a long history of DAOs to improve governance structures, decentralized decision making, improve and enforce transparency and enable membership voting and active participation in decision making.</p>  <p>DAO participation currently targets a niche within a niche within a niche. Many DAOs require a minimum staking for participation in a cryptocurrency. This limits participation to the crypto participants who are wealthy, tech savvy enough and interested enough to participate in a DAO.&nbsp; </p>  <p></p><p></p>
